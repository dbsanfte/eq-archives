<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xouqoa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So ... who says the Red Wings aren't gonna kick some ass this year?  :)  They are looking pretty strong so far.  20-3 ... hmm.  I can't wait for the playoffs!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmm, while I can't say the Blues are having a stellar year (they are not so far), I do seem to recall a recent Blues 1, Dead, er Redwings 0 shut out on Detroits ice.. <br />
<br />
Hockey is a marathon season.. it appears it will be an interesting season.. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Quinnell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The deadwings look stronger than ever this year.  Very impressive; but the purchase order for the players comes due eventually.  They'd better win this year or they're probably going to have to make some serious revisions - and excuses.<br />
<br />
While my Stars have been looking.......for lack of a better word, pitiful so far this season (23 points at this point in the season?  Ugly).   Even so, I watched the Stars/Flyers game Thursday and things have changed I think.  Everyone knew Lumme and Audette hated the Dallas style and getting Manson, Brunet, and Rucinsky (who I personally think has been underrated his entire career) into the lineup should REALLY make a difference.<br />
<br />
Heck, Manson loves this place and we love him.<br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to Jan 16th - I have tickets and it'll be the second game in 4 nights against the deadwings.<br />
<br />
I love hockey season.<br />
<br />
By the way -- Dallas has played Detroit twice so far.  1 win, 1 OT loss.<br />
<br />
Not bad considering.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fazzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yea, the Wings are lookin good.  But how a team does in the preseason (yes, it is technically the regular season, but everyone knows that the real season doesn't start till playoffs) means nothing if you lose in the playoffs.  But they are giving us Wing fans an interesting team to watch.  I mean, has there ever been a team with so many future hall-of-famers on at one time.  Granted most are past their prime, but geez--Yzerman, Hull, Robitaille, Hasek, Federov (maybe), Lidstrom, Shanahan, am I missing anyone?  Add to that the best hockey coach, and arguably the best coach of any professional sport, of all time Scotty Bowman--some exciting times at the Joe!!  I thought the Wings run was done after last year, but looks like they got one or two more years left to get the Cup!!<br />
Now if Illytch (sp?)  can just do something about his other professional sports team--The Detroit Kitties, er..Tigers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Detroit - lots of OLD bodies there... gonna be hard on them to go through the 82 game sched and playoffs (whats going to make it harder yet is that players like Yzerman, Hull, Chelios, Lidstrom, Hasek, Fedorov are all pretty much shoe ins to be on their respective Olympic teams as well). They have looked VERY impressive thus far, but how long can they keep it up?<br />
<br />
Dallas - another old team that is showing their age. Modano and Nieuwendyk were bound to start losing a step sooner or later: you can fight time but you can't escape it forever. The acquisition of Turgeon wasn't a stellar move either (ask Blues fans about that)... his best days were in Long Island and he has ALWAYS been inconsistent, with a tendancy to disappear come playoff time, when his offnesive skills are in demand.<br />
<br />
St Louis - not off to the start that many thought they would be. Not sure what the problem is. Their goaltending isn't the greatest, but Brathwaite isn't that bad either. Still waiting for Wieght and Ktachuk to really develop a synergy, then look out.<br />
<br />
Teams that have surprised:<br />
<br />
Calgary- Turek looks incredible (sorry St Louis) and Iginla appears to be having a breakthrough year, living up to all the potential and more, that the scouts had said was there when the Flames drafted him. Add to them a supporting cast of enthusiastic, young players who have learned how to win... Wow!<br />
<br />
Edmonton - Tommy Salo is also having a banner year and this another team of young players that is having a good time and performing well. Crushing blow to them is the loss of Ryan Smyth with a broken ankle... he is maturing into another great winger (FYI, I think its kinda cool that Smyth and Igninla seem to be on the rise at the same time: both drafted in the first round 5-6 years ago, both Alberta boys on Alberta teams... kinda cool... wonder if their small market homes will be able to afford them when their contracts expire this year...).<br />
<br />
Montreal - almost the same (brutal?) team as last year except they LOST their best player to cancer (Saku Koivu). That they are doing as well as they have been is unreal.<br />
<br />
New York Isles - not as much of a surprise, as they did make some substantial moves, in acquiring Peca, Yashin and Osgood, but who knew that those moves would make them perform as well as they have so far? Nice to see. (WOOT!!! LETS GO ISLANDERS!!!)<br />
<br />
New York Rangers - A team polarized between really old expensive talent and highly touted younger talent. Is the chemistry developing? Be interesting to see if the additions of Lindros and Berard continue to impact them. Be interesting to see if Berard and Lindros last the season, with Lindros' tendancy to go through the middle with his head down, and Berard's vision impairment...<br />
<br />
Colorado - Defensively sound, but offensively they are are hurting bad. Sakic looks ordinary and no one else is picking up the challenge left by the absence of Forsberg. I never really though of Colorado as that dependant on Forsberg, but other than that, I am at a loss to explain why they can't put the puck in the net...<br />
<br />
Florida - the Panthers. Luongo is looking good between the pipes, but it appears that his supporting cast has disappeared. So much for the re-uniting of the offensively gifted Bure brothers...<br />
<br />
EDIT: Forgot to mention the wannabe &quot;Canada's Team&quot; from Toronto, and we all know that the Dorfs are gonna pipe up with some nonsense about them owning the Cup (just like last year :p ). The Leafs haven't looked bad this year, but they still aren't a team that excites me. They haven't made a lot of moves to shake up the roster. Signing Kaberle was a good move, but that gets them back to where they were last year: a decent team team, but not a good enough team to win the Ultimate Goal. (BTW Leafs 1, Isles 3 on Friday neener neener neener :p )<br />
<br />
My hope for the year ( aside from the Isles winning the Cup :p ) is that officials will clamp down on some of this BS taunting crap, and penalize. The Brashear dusting of his hands after a fight, the McCarthy flexing his biceps at his oponent as they head to the Sin Bin, the Fleury Chicken Dance by the Islander bench in their last meeting... to me this crap is worthy of WWF, not the NHL. Its called unsportsmanike conduct and should be called. We all saw what can happen as an end result (McSorely 2-handing Brashear over the head) and the NHL has said they want to avoid similar incidents. I don't mind hard hitting aggressive hockey (as a fan, I think its the most fun to watch) but that crap has to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Atokal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The Toronto Maple Leafs have done extremely well this year inspite of adding so many new faces to the line-up.<br />
<br />
Getting rid of Manson was a stellar move as he is well past his best days in Chicago.<br />
<br />
Look for the Leafs to really gel around January and make a serious run at the cup.<br />
<br />
As far as the most surprising team of the year.. well that has to be Wulfrans Islanders.<br />
<br />
Cheers GO LEAFS GO!!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Idunno Toker: who did the Leafs add?<br />
<br />
Scoring punch is still centered around Sundin (who is a great player but can't do it all himself): if he doesn't go, the Leafs are in trouble. Still have same corps of aging toughness (Corson, Roberts, Domi). Goaltending is still (rocksolid) in Cujo' hands. A minor deal like Lumme for Manson isn't going to be enough to raise the Leafs to the next level. They lost some toughness and won on the talent side, but not substantially... and you're still talking your 3 or 4 defense slot. Toronto needs some real scoring punch (not Mogilny, who is as unpredictable as where birds will crap) added to make the step to the next level (which is the real contenders).<br />
<br />
And actually, my surprise pick would be either Edmonton (who lost their &quot;superstar&quot; in the Weight deal) or Calgary. The Isles are a surprise but you knew they were going to be a better team by adding the players they did (although perhaps not this much better).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Quinnell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Actually, I think the Manson for Lumme deal will work well for both teams -- heck, most of Toronto's D is on the upside of the +/- race; but, Wulf's right about Toronto needing some scoring punch besides Sundin.  There's a serious loss of productivity offensively there.  Heck, Mogilny is something like 7th on the team in points.  That's not very All-star esq.  My only other concern of Toronto is that in the few games Schwab has played in relief of Cujo, he hasn't looked all that great.  I hope, for Toronto's sake Cujo stays healthy and spry throughtout the season.<br />
<br />
My pick for the most suprising has to be Calgary.  I knew Turek was going to find his pace.  After watching him in Dallas over the last couple of years (prior to his horrible stop in St. Louis), everyone around here knew he had the skills to be very, very good.  Everyone has been waiting for Iginla to find his pace and he's on an amazing tear right now; but, I would NEVER have guessed Craig Conroy would be scoring and playing as well as he has been.  Before yesterday he was tied for 7th in +/-.  Not bad for someone who was barely positive last year.<br />
<br />
Course, my second pick would probably be Chicago.  They're still streaky; but they're managing to stay on the win streaks a lot longer than they used too.  With 7 guys on their roster over 15 points already and Amonte doing his characteristic slow start they could make some noise later this season.  I'm at least keeping my eye on them.<br />
<br />
And that's my hockey talk for today, I promise.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chadias Spirithealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hey guys ...<br />
A couple things here. <br />
<br />
Leafs - I love my Leafs! They are starting to click alot more now, but they have GOT to kick Alex in the ass and get him to score. Sundin cannot do it alone, and CuJo IS the man but he also cannot do it alone. Cory, to me, isnt a great backup. They will miss Healy having the backup duty. Manson for Lumme? Well, the only thing I can say about that is ... thank god we got Kaberle back =) <br />
<br />
I can't believe how well Calgary and the Isles are doing right now. Its good to see them doing well.  <br />
<br />
BTW Wulfie ... Iginla was actually drafted by the Stars but traded right away if I remember correctly. <br />
<br />
Turek - Good lord what happened to him these last few games? He got blown by Atl and I think Columbus? Thanks Turek for screwing up my numbers ... lol Im sure he will turn out like the Eagle later on down the road to a good solid netminder.<br />
<br />
Taunting - I agree with ya there Wulfie ... there is just no need for crap like that. I dont mind seeing them celebrate after a goal in some fashion, but dont taunt! Umm, of course seeing that I am a goalie, I will at times taunt when I come up with a huge glove save ... I will just shake my head at them and toss the puck at em.. lol I already know that Im not the most liked goalie in the league since I play like Hextall ... LOL They wont come in my crease anymore tho. As for the Marty McCash hit on Ronald McDonald Brashear ... he actually made it worse on himself when he *threw* himself back to get the Power Play for his team. If he wasnt such a damn retard and had his helmet on correctly, he may not have gotten a grade 3 brain beater. I checked out that *hit* as they call it ... and his stick came off his shoulder to the side of his head ... in which case Donald THREW his body back causing himself damage ... not from McCash. <br />
<br />
Thats all from me for now =) <br />
<br />
Take it easy guys</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Actually Dallas may have owned the pick originally (Nieuwendyk deal?), but Calgary used it (Iginla tossed on a Flames Jersey on Draft Day).<br />
<br />
One other thing...<br />
Can't believe I forgot about the Hawks! /agree Quinnell!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Quinnell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm trying so very hard to limit my hockey posts to one a day -- today I'm failing.<br />
<br />
Jarome Iginla was selected 11th by the Dallas Stars in the 1995 draft.  He was dealt to Calgary as part of the Newy deal.  Newy played a split season (I can't remember exactly; but, it was like 40%/60% Calgary/Dallas) in 1995.<br />
<br />
As I recall, the trade happened about halfway through the 1995-96 season; but, my memory is hazy.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure he didn't wear a Flames jersey on draft day; but, I've been known to be wrong before.  I'm embarassed to say that I can't recall exactly the circumstances; but, I'm about 80% sure that's how it happened.<br />
<br />
I've slept since then.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chadias Spirithealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Its hard not to talk about the GREATEST sport on this planet! lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ryptagudn Gobbleguts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If you're talking nice surprises so far this season, how about them Blackhawks?  Jocelyn Thibault has been great in net and it's pretty obvious the new coaching change has made a difference.  Now, if only they could stop talking about those Amonte trade rumors...<br />
<br />
And how about them Bruins?  A healthy Dafoe could mean trouble for some teams, but the Boston ownership won't commit to a championship, so don't expect them to make any big moves as the season progresses.  The Allison trade was a bad deal -- you don't trade a dollar for 2 quarters.</div></div><hr />
