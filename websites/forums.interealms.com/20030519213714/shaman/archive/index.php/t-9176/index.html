<br />
I 3-box a 49 iksar SK, 49 troll shaman, and a 49 DEF chanter. I have two computers on a USB KVM switch and a laptop. I keep the SK up on one the KVm computers and the chanter on the laptop. The shaman is totally hotkeyed on an additional keyboard. Occasionally, I switch from the SK view to the Shaman view to do additional buffs, move .etc.. I 3box because I play at weird times for short durations. I mention these things because it influences my questions.<br />
<br />
Since 49 is the highest char I have ever been, I am trying to figure out where to go next. I usually try to find a place with an xp bonus since two of my chars have xp penelties. Also, with a chanter in the mix, outdoor zones (ala EW) are really boring and slow xp. Does any of the experienced players on this board have a suggestion for my next xp spot?<br />
<br />
Places I have been:<br />
<br />
1. Katta - 40-45 - great xp near the TM zone line. There are about 7-8 guards you can pull and kill. I never waited on a spawn here. Great spot. Only difficulty was getting to until I realized that I could get a port to Twilight. I never died here. Some mobs turned light blue at 48<br />
<br />
2. Kedge Keep - 45-47 - great xp on the second floor. The SK did die once because I accidently pulled one of the lvl 49 sharks. The combination of the shaman slowing and the chantrer mezzing made this camp very easy. I left at 47 because the xp slowed down. This seemed strange since I know kedge has high xp bonus. I may go back here at 51 when the 49 sharks are blue/white ..etc..  Compared to mobs in kunark/velious/luclin, the mobs here are cake.<br />
<br />
3. City of Mist - this place has been great. I have camped the stables 47-49. I have collected 2 of the 3 illegable scrolls for the SK and most of the parchments for the shaman epic. Unfortunately, around the stables, half of the mobs are now light blue and the xp is slowing. There may be other places in CoM that I could try as I have not explored much beyond the stables since I am still waiting for the remaining illegable scroll.<br />
<br />
4. ToFS - this was a fun zone. I hunted a little bit of 47/48 here. I got all the way to final mob on the 6th floor. He proceeded to charm the SK and kill the chanter. I stopped there and continued to hunt the dogs on the 6th floor entrance. I left because I felt the xp was rather slow. Also, I wanted to finish up my LoP kuhkri.<br />
<br />
Now, I have read the hunting guides, and I appreciate everyone's wisdom there. I am looking for some pointers on where I could maximize xp next. Some specific questions I have are:<br />
<br />
1. Should I stay in CoM after I get the last scroll for my kuhkri? If so, is there a place with higher level mobs?<br />
<br />
2. Should I try out the hole. I have camped the front before but it was rather easy in the group. I did not go deeper than the front 8 mobs. What does the hole look like after the initial eight? Could my small group handle it?<br />
<br />
3. At what level should I get my HS/Seb keys and try hunting there? Should I even try it at all?<br />
<br />
4. I have not done any faction work in velious. I am more inclined to side with the giants. Is there some dwarf killing which would be good xp?<br />
<br />
5. I have not really tried LGuk or SolB. mostly because its a little hard to move the 3 chars around a lot when the 3 chars are KOS and there are many tunnels and many wandering mobs. However, if there is a good camp spot, I can arrange everyone at the spot individually.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any advice and happy holidays.<br />
<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Angryor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I 3 box a 49 cleric, 54 monk and 54 Shammmy...<br />
<br />
I camped the goo house in the center of CoM and the 3 spawn there is all dark blue to my level 54.  The exp wasn't that great but the cleric was mocing along nicely.<br />
<br />
I was able to clear the whole area around the Goo house including the little temple thingy with Lranc inside.  I never killed Lranc but there is a 2 spawn in there that were always dark blue at 54.<br />
<br />
On a side note, not that the exp is that great but I have moved over to the crystaline Wurms in GD and they all con Dark Blue to my 54's.<br />
<br />
You could do the HHK thing real soon.<br />
<br />
If you are not concerned with faction I went into Kaladim at 50 and did the dwarves in the zone in.  I was able to get about 2 blue an hour there at 52 and 54.  There is like 6 stationary dwarves and 2 or 3 roamers.  The loot is the same as HHK, but no one on my server ever goes there.<br />
<br />
Good hunting to you!</div></div><hr />
