<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hendler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If someone from FV transferred to the Legends server, and they had a Spirit Wracked Cord, would the SWC become No Drop, or would it remain droppable?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have no actual knowledge on this subject whatsoever.  But I would expect that any equipment you have will have to follow the rules of the server you are on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The item doesn't change, the rules of the server dictate the item.  There is only one SWC, and on any server other than FV it will be no drop.  Otherwise there would likely rampant Legends-FV-other server item trades going on.  Yes I know that technically isn't possible, but it happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually it is kind opf possible. Make a toon on legends and you can move to any server with all your gear. SO ya make a toon on legends, give it a ton of plat and transfer to fv. Buy whatever ya want then transfer back to legends. Now ya can retransfer to any server ya want with tons of no drop stuff that ya bought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No Stolastrov, that wouldn't work I don't think.<br />
<br />
If you make a toon on legends, then transfer to FV, then back to legends, you cannot transfer with gear to another server as I understand it.  That would be an easy way to gear up for Legends though, if you had unlimited plat.<br />
<br />
I could be wrong..hell, my brother was turned down for a transfer to FV, saying that &quot;transfers to that server are not allowed&quot;, when obviously they are.  The people that handle that sort of thing aren't always on the same page.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kinelory Opiates</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">An item that is not &quot;No Drop&quot; on FV *does* become &quot;No Drop&quot; when transfered to Legends.<br />
<br />
And server transfers are now allowed to FV (although on the official eq website it says they are not. The site has just not been updated i'm assuming..). I have several RL friends who have done this. But you may not bring your gear.</div></div><hr />
