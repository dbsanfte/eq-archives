<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know you others have problems but we barb shaman males are really suffering.  I've been wearing this cold, drafty chain stuff since level 1 and my nipples are all red and chafed.  Even the mobs tease me.  I do NOT rouge my nipples!  It's the cold I tell ya.  The cold!  At least that's my story and I'm sticking to it.<br />
<br />
It gets so bad that from time to time I have to put on my &lt;a href=http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=4872&gt;Rune Etched Chestplate&lt;/a&gt;.  Why can't the higher level BPs have that style?  Help me SoE please.  Can I get that style or at least an NPC or quest to change?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I hate the look of plate bps on barbarian females (with new models). Chain all the way!<br />
<br />
(I do miss the old plate model graphics - I looked like Wonder Woman in my Jaundiced Bone BP).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd just like to see a change to the graphics on the Chain tunics.<br />
<br />
They have been the same for many expansions now regardless of what one you wear.<br />
<br />
Not really a big issue with me, but that graphic is getting to be just a little old when you see it on every single shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Boondowk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I dont mind the graphics on the tunics but please please please get rid of helm graphics, or atleast add an option to shut them off.

<br />
Seriously though, it used to be that a new expansion would come out and you would be excited to see all the new armor sets because they were so vastly different from the last expansion.  That pretty much ended with Luclin when they introduced the new models.<br />
<br />
As much as SOE goofs around with primary/secondary slot item graphics, (hello darkglint blade!) you would think they could toss out some new armor graphics to help spice the character models up a tad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah. It helps if you fold up a bandage a coupla times and put it in your tunic over your nipple, one bandage per nipple (anything more gets uncomfortable). Trust me. If you do it right, you can't even see the bulges from the side. Mobs won't ever know the difference, cause you can dye the bandages to match your tunic.<br />
<br />
I do like the idea of a /toggle button on the Options window (somewhere) to turn helm graphics off and on for your character. Much love for my Cap of Drowned Souls! :p<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Wudoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">EQ2 has a /showhood command ... toggles the helm graphic on or off.  Would be a great addition to EQ.<br />
<br />
And the Chain BP graphics on barbs are awful (and old)...you'd think I could afford some kind of undershirt.<br />
<br />
Wudo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Virulence</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Lord yes! Please more options for plate graphic and more chain graphics for those of you who enjoy that. While some may not want the plate graphics, I personally love them on my shaman. I'm not asking for this to be handed to me like an NPC that can change the graphic of any item, but I can't see the harm at all in making a few upper level plate graphic items that we can get.<br />
<br />
I've been looking for quite some time to find suitable upgrades for me that would maintain my plate look and the only thing I've found so far are the leaf-scale arms off of the Avatar of Earth (currently out of reach, but that's ok).<br />
<br />
I don't think there's another shaman on my server who looks like I do because I've gone to great lengths (ie. passing on upgrades) to keep the plate graphic thing going and it's the little things like this that help me enjoy in the game. :)<br />
<br />
It's a bit dark, but here's how my shaman looks from a signature I use on other boards...<br />

Much better than what I thought it was supposed to look like.</div></div><hr />

Does that mean /role and hiding my 1.5 won't be enough to hide me from the angry, stick-waving I Want Buffs mob in the POK? I'm pretty good at pretending I'm a rogue.<br />

I thought I was the only one with purple nurple troubles. I was fighting in a group in OOW the other day and one member commented that my nurples were the size of hub caps! I literally almost died laughing. Then in PoK I saw what she meant. My BP has some saucer markings in that area. I almost look like donut-boy.  lol  :o</div></div><hr />

Now thats a great idea !!!  I want my damn plate look back (that I once had and can still get with a Vindi BP :(<br />

 i mean, honestly, that looks like i am in skin tight whole-body-straps with holes :/<br />
<br />
imo the troll-armorgraphics look best all in all.<br />
ah yes, and the iksar plate look looks a bit weird, too ;-)<br />
<br />
but all in all .... frozen nipples aren't that bad, or?  :D</div></div><hr />

What a sad, sad day when a tough barbarian is asking for some undershirt. For the record barbarians aren't supposed to wear any kind of underwear  :D .<br />
<br />

Solid advice. Or grab some nice old bear fat and rub it in  :p .</div></div><hr />

<br />
In days of old, when chainmail was worn, it was usually over some kind of leather tunic.  I swam in the waters of Halas everyday as a young barb.  It's not the cold...it is that there are no options.  <br />
<br />
Either way... it isn't as bad as the Half-Elf leather pants graphic (or lack there of) with the mid-thigh go-go boots look ~ :)<br />

Hey now, stay focused! Ain't no need to turn any attention to one of the best damn graphics left in this game!<br />

Usualy, I jsut tell them No as soon as they say Hi!.<br />
<br />
If I feel like buffing,, I start hawking it.<br />
<br />
If they catch me in a good mood,, I'll take them down the &quot;Why do you deserve buffing?&quot; road.<br />
A tormenting conversation that has, in some cases, lasted 3 hours and netted me a new friend. Go figure.<br />
<br />
A cool thing my roomie does is take his Barb beasty, take the wave crasher idol, and then do a whole jib-jab of emotes buffing newbies in Kelethin.<br />
<br />
Then he asks for payment for his prayers and beseechments of the tribunal.<br />

Very funny to watch.</div></div><hr />
