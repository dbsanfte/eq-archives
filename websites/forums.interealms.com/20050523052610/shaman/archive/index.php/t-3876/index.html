<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The kinda short answer is that they can't.  Generally, underbulks assist other underbulks, shrooms assist shrooms, etc.  However, for no discernable reason, some of the mobs are linked.  Thus, when you see a single underbulk and 3 shrooms, if you pull the underbulk, one or two shrooms come with it.  Go figure.<br />
<br />
At any rate, even at level 60, you can't truly solo pull 100% of the time in the Deep.  The assists are just odd.  Sometimes you will continue to get adds.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Forty-SoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Unless you are pulling the &quot;indifferent&quot; con mushrooms (Ancient Shreiks), then you can get a single everytime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you are talking about the Underbulks in Echo Caves you can pull them single at lvl 49.  But if you get Fireclaw in the group you won't be able to split it.  Pull an underbulk, he comes as well.  Pull Fireclaw, you'll get at least 1 underbulk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>reaper23</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yea i think hes talking about the 1s in echo also and i u do get fireclaw and the others are spawned just root the closest underbulk and than take out fireclaw</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was doing it at 48 with my monk. I'm 100% of it to because I dinged 49 there.<br />
<br />
Watch out for Fireclaw or Trillcor though.<br />
<br />
With Fireclaw up (immune to snare) the best you can do is him and one other. Fire DD proc is a pain.<br />
<br />
With Trillcor (immune to fear) up, you'll get all three Fungal Fiends every time, or at least I did. He's a punk too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Warscar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Weird, I did 49 to 51 here and never got an add. Don't pull with an offensive spell. Pull with slow. I did this and never got an add. Though if Fireclaw or Trillicor was up I pulled them first. With Trillicor I just pulled him to the haven defender to kill. He isn't worth the mana to fight.</div></div><hr />
