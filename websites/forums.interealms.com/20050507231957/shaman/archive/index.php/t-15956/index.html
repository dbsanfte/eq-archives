<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aikoiko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm sure this has happened to everyone at some point, and was just curious about other thoughts.<br />
<br />
Recently while in a pickup group in PoD with a War, Pally, Rouge, Cleric, BST and me, the warrior asked the Cleric and myself for AC/HP buffs.  I quickly obliged, but the cleric asked for 12pp from the warrior to cover reagent costs.  War was like &quot;huh?  You serious?&quot;  Cleric was totally straight.  He expected payment for his reagent.<br />
<br />
Now, I didn't care too much as I didn't need his buffs, but the warrior was a little peterbed.  This is the first time I've seen someone require payment for spell reagents for group members.<br />
<br />
Is this typical, or was the cleric just ***?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Plane of Disease = bugger all cash drops, if I remember right.<br />
<br />
Cleric was perfectly within his rights to ask for peridot compensation, since he wasn't going to be getting it from mob drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, clerics have always had to pay for it, so they have always required payment.  The way it is usually handled, however, is to allow the cleric to loot enough to cover his expenses.  In the past, this has always been abused to the point that many clerics get rich (not all, of course).  The cleric in question was a little more straightforward at least.  I don't really see a problem with it, although his presentation may have been a little off  ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If that cleric had been in my group and i was the leader I would have hit disband right away. Asking to cover the cost of the spell is one thing. Asking to cover beyond the cost is just insulting. This isn't someone buffing for donations in PoK this is a member of your group. In ever group i've been in the cleric has been given enough sellables (diamonds and such) to cover thier cost and then some before anyone else starts getting those. Clerics are usually a dime a dozen. Boot his ass and get one that isn't a greedy arse. Heck pick up a druid and get someone can heal and snare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I usually carry a stack of dots with me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Its a case of someone using their position to blackmail you.<br />
<br />
Sure, give the cleric some cash loot to cover peridot costs for the group.<br />
<br />
If no loot drops, hey, they got experience just like you did.<br />
<br />
If they cant afford to hunt in a zone because of the lack of drops... dont.  There have always been some zones with good experience, some zones with good loot, and few with both.<br />
<br />
This is not a new discussion, and my position on it is not new.  I feel for clerics because they have to pay for reagents to use in every group they are in.  I am not willing to default all the loot to them if more drops than is needed to cover costs.  I will not pay them to do their part in the group.  I believe they should loot whatever vendor loot drops until the costs of the peridots are paid for, and then share what drops after that evenly.  I do not believe it is my responsibility to pay for the group they will be in tomorrow out of todays drops.  If they dont feel they can afford to go to a zone with poor drops, then they should say no and look for a group in a zone with better cash loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I usually carry a stack of dots with me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I usually carry a stack of dots with me.<br />
Ditto.  I give cash for any spell that requires semi expensive reagent.  Why should they lose money when entering a group?  If the warrior didn't fork out the cash then I would have.  It's only 12p to the war but an unending expense to the cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I usually do ML for our group and PoD is about the only place I know where we sometimes wouldn't cover peridot costs. Especially if the cleric doesn't have Aego yet or a lot of people are dying. It's not a big deal if you group with the same cleric most of the time, you just give the cleric some extra loot next time you hit a decent cash camp but in a pickup group I can see for a cleric there to ask for peridot costs up front. Either cough up or make do with Heroic bond. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Way back when Seb was the place to grind, I remember clerics gushing about how they made 10k+ in a weekend in cash drops.  Shoulda said &quot;Know what a Key to Old Sebilis is?&quot;  My opinion is the cleric just went about asking in the worng way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Frankly, cost of peridots comes with the territory of being a cleric.  Clerics have the luxury of being wanted for groups maybe even more than a shaman or a chanter.  The price for admission is a stack of dots for a day's worth of grind.<br />
<br />
Next time tell the cleric &quot;hey - play my warrior for a couple days.  Learn what it feels like to actually be LFG for more than 15 minutes.  THEN complain to me about how I am hurting your finances.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The cleric is in the right for asking for dot coverage.  Most people do not compensate clerics for the plat they spend on regeants, and over time, it adds up to be a serious expense.  Imagine having to cast old school avatar (burning emeralds) constantly, and thats what its like being a cleric.  Typically, though, they are a little nicer about it.  They wait for a diamond or something to drop, and they get that which will pretty much cover a whole stack of dots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Imagine having to cast old school avatar (burning emeralds) constantly, and thats what its like being a cleric.<br />
<br />
Hardly compairable avatar lasts a base of 6 minutes. Symbol of that level lasts a base of just over one hour. If the cleric happen to be high enough level to cast aego that lasts for a base of 2.5 hours. So anywhere from 10 to 25 times the duration of avatar and the reagent for avatar is ~30% more expensive.<br />
<br />
  Typically, though, they are a little nicer about it.  They wait for a diamond or something to drop, and they get that which will pretty much cover a whole stack of dots.<br />
That single diamond is enough to cover 3 hours of symbols for the entire group even casting it singly or 7.5 half hours of aego cast singly with a couple left over to cover deaths/dispells. Going up to the group spells and it's 20 hours with naltrons mark or 10 hours with kazad's mark or 12.5 hours with group aego. Thats all with no sort of extension aa's or items at all either. I think it's safe to say 1 even half way descent trinket covers the dot usage for longer than most groups last.<br />
<br />
That doesn't even adress the fact that the cleric was asking for MORE than the cost of the dot. Yes MORE than the cost of the dot. Having bought stacks upon stacks of dots they cost 10.5pp (well a hair less than that now). He wanted to not only be covered for the cost of casting the spell he wanted to make a profit on it. Asking for a dot or to cover the cost is one thing but this joker would have made my do not group list pulling something like that. If i'm gonna BUY a buff of someone it's gonna be the level 60+ cleric casting majorly extended aego or virtue not the cleric who's probably not even 60 with little or no extention and no aego exping in PoD especially the cleric in my group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Absolute minimum cost for a peridot = 10.5pp.<br />
12pp isn't an unreasonable request.<br />
<br />
And, keep in mind, that while I am sure all of you make sure that your clerics get enough drops to cover the cost for the peridots they had to use while grouped with you, the vast majority of players are either to ignorant or greedy to do so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all, I know that a shaman keeping up avatar on a group is going to burn a lot more regeants than a cleric will.  It was just an analogy.<br />
<br />
Second of all, I am more than happy to let the cleric have a little extra, to make up for all the times they don't get any money back.  I care very little about the cash gems that drop in groups, and 12pp is nothing.  If a cleric in my group wants either of those things in order to not feel cheated, I am more than happy to comply.<br />
<br />
The best thing to do, really, is for anyone getting buffed to just pay the cleric his 12pp (I know the minimum cost is 10.5, but most clerics aren't near the cha soft cap, especially dwarves) and be done with it.  The reason this doesn't happen very often, though, is because it is a monumental pain in the ass, and most clerics don't like having to ask for 12pp every time they cast a buff.  It's like buying something and coming up 4 pennies short on the change.  Some people will get their 4 cents, which is their right, but most people would rather just not F with it and go about their way.  It's just so much easier to give the cleric a diamond and be done with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not in my job description to compensate the Cleric for his OTHER groups.  Hey, you got shafted in Group_X last week? Welcome to the club. We ALL have those stories.(*)<br />
<br />
I have YET to join a pickup group where the first dropS (TWO BD's / RD's / D's ) didn't go to the Cleric. Now, if you want 12pp UP FRONT? No worries, but you just forfeited those first two drops.<br />
<br />
Clerics had a nice scam going in Sebilis. (*) I remember one at Guard, over a 4 hour period (no deaths mind you) she had to have raked in 4-5k. Gems were dropping so often it got silly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>doqtir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'm amazed people are calling 1.5 pp over minimum cost outrageous. Even over a 12 hour period, assuming he/she buys them for 10.5 pp, they're lucky to cover the cost of the dots used on their character.<br />
<br />
That aside, compensating anyone for the cost of the reagents supplied in a buff, port, etc is common courtesy. Greedy characters, regardless of their class, should be dealt with on an individual basis. This one seemed perfectly reasonable in asking for compensation in a zone where pp drops are rare to non-existent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Here's my feelings on this issue.<br />
<br />
Sub-60 clerics: I always donated a peridot. Since I can solo for money it's not an issue for me. Sebilis isn't an option for most peeps that level anymore because it's constantly farmed by 61+ soloers including yours truely :) Only times I made a donation exception is after I just spent a bunch of money, i.e. Malo, and was short of cash until I could farm for more money.<br />
<br />
Post 60 clerics: I'll donate now and then but if a cleric at this level demands I donate he'll get my wrath. If you can't afford peridots at this level then you are spending too much time power leveling and not enough time at the cash camps. If they are this hard up for money then they should be spending more time at Seb, Chardok, Acrylia and Veksar and less time at PoV/PoS. In BoT/HoH at least diamonds/BDs drop often enough to help offset the cost.<br />
<br />
P.S. All a cleric needs to do nowadays to make quick money is bring a friend to Acrylia Caverns. Nuff said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Agreed, pre 60 making pp is fairly hard, although temperance helps a lot now.  As Kogu I got around PoD's lack of cash drops by simply alternating where I grouped, if my peri bag was in good shape I'd go to pod for the best xp, if it was looking a bit poorly I'd either keep my eyes peeled and do a few resses or just go to pon for less xp but a plentiful supply of cash gems.<br />
<br />
Post 60 having a bad group where I waste a ton of peris with no comeback just isnt a problem anymore, I'm beefy enough to blow up an old world giant in my sleep, I can go pimp virtue for an hour, or I can just click a few corpses.  Yes I still greatly appreciate the first gem drop, but I've always got options availible to me when that doesnt happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>doqtir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I can go pimp virtue for an hour<br />
<br />
Sorry, I just found that statement ironic. <br />
<br />
It's ok to ask 40+ pp per buff in PoK but it's taboo to ask for compensation in a pick-up group where there is little to no chance of recovering the costs of a dot...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kaalisti_Painstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">My war hubby and I always dumped some peri's on the pickup cleric if there weren't drops to compensate. <br />
<br />
The other day I was making him arrows (fletching maxxed) and I broke down the cost of the arrows to just under a plat each, or roughly 14p a stack. He'll sometimes go through TEN stacks a night while pulling. <br />
<br />
No one has ever even considered donating to him for the cost of the arrows... granted I could make him the really crappy cheap ones, but pulling/keeping aggro/regaining aggro on inc would be harder.<br />
<br />
We're no longer going to be so adament about making sure the cleric's taken care of first.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">No one has ever even considered donating to him for the cost of the arrows... granted I could make him the really crappy cheap ones, but pulling/keeping aggro/regaining aggro on inc would be harder.<br />
<br />
<br />
While I agree with you that a lot of classes have hidden costs that people don't consider (think of all the DoTs a &lt;61 chanter uses on self runes) in this case at least for the most part the group isn't going to notice/care if the warrior is using summoned arrows and for the most part doesn't make that big of a difference. Someone isn't going to throw the warrior out of the group for using different arrows, the cleric will get tossed if he's not buffing. Everyone notices when temp/aego/virt/symbol goes down and in one of those stupid eq things these spells cost much more in plat per hour at lower levels then higher levels. Casting temperance on a group 6 dots, group Aego 4 dots, group symbol 2 dots, group virtue 2 dots. The lower level players have to cover move expense then the higher level ones. They are also the ones more likely to have to rebuff deaths and hunt in low plat areas. <br />
<br />
I don't see a problem with handing over a dot for your spell in a cashless area. There are very very few places in the game which don't drop enough stuff to at least cover regeant costs though. Even nightmare drops crap thats worth 60-70pp each. Basically everyone that said carry a few dots I think is right on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Second of all, I am more than happy to let the cleric have a little extra, to make up for all the times they don't get any money back.

When did it become my responsibility to cover for other jerks that might be out there. If 12pp is nothing why does the cleric need to ask for it then?<br />

<br />
If you aren't cha maxed spend a couple PP on some steins in the bazaar. Odds are you pay for them in a stack or 2 of dots if you truely are paying 12pp a dot you'd save 30pp a stack. Well worth the time to get 2 steins that provide 50 cha which should be enough to put anyone at best prices or very close to it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm amazed people are calling 1.5 pp over minimum cost outrageous. Even over a 12 hour period, assuming he/she buys them for 10.5 pp, they're lucky to cover the cost of the dots used on their character.<br />
<br />
Ok so now we have to pay for our dots and the clerics dots too? When does the cleric start to have any responsibility for anything?<br />
<br />
What about the Enchanter burning dots on runes for themselves? How bout the warrior or monk pulling with 1pp a pop arrows/darts? Or the necro using dot's for pets. Lots of  other people have costs too, ever see anyone sugguest they get paid back for that?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as the difference between paying for buffs in a group and paying for buffs in PoK or someplace there is a big one. If we're grouped we've gotten together to work together towards some common goal, might be as simple as exp camp, and share in the rewards. The guy sitting around PoK gains nothing at all from buffing you when you run off and solo or join a different exp group. He's offering a service</div></div><hr />

  No i dont know that you have extra obligation to a cleric if they got shafted by a group but at same time i didnt always have plat in the bank. If i got shafted by a few groups was a time it would of put a pinch on my money and i'd prefer not to wait on a group of strangers to see if i am gonna have to scape together more dot money.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In 4 years of playing EQ, the basic rule on our server (in our groups) is we pay for any class buff/spell that is cast on another person. This includes clerics buffs, enchanter runes (if the encounter calls for them to rune the MT, etc), shaman's avatar, necro's coffins. We don't pay for self-buffs, we don't pay for basic equipment (arrows, shurikens, etc) and we don't pay for pets. I am amazed that other servers/groups don't follow this, but to each their own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Worador Spiritbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I'll pay it or give them the dot, but I better not die!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I'm sorry but if a cleric has to ask for the platinum up front he's either greedy as hell or he has no idea what he's doing.  In 99% of the groups I've been in the cleric has been the MLer for the duration of the group.  More than 50% of the time the cleric comes out several hundred platinum ahead of cost.  Maybe its just the Seventh Hammer but thats pretty much the norm.  It isn't even a question, the cleric loots.  Like I said, maybe it is quite a bit different on other servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>chmodux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">My opinion on this is pretty much cut and dry, that was the cleric's problem not the group.  I understand many of you have no problem paying the cleric for dots thats fine, I carry around dots sometimes to compensate the cleric but I dont always have the money.  Because I had to pay for 20k spells, should I have asked for 12pp or default drops every group I was in over time hell no.  Why? because I chose to spend time on a class that has very expensive spells, its MY PROBLEM.  <br />
<br />
So for example lets take torpors, I'm lvl 65 by then and still working with stocism.  Do I start ninja looting because I really could use the mana regen in HOH and Bot groups, on raids etc to do my job. No me and some friends of mine go down to chardok B with several purposes one of which was to get torpors, and I did get it off a named mob.  You can also replace this with hours of farming (thank you velks and sebilis) for no/little xp so i can do what...MY JOB.  <br />
<br />
That said I do sympathize with clerics pain of having to buy so many dots, it sucks but do what the clerics in my guild do A) go farm greens for awhile, B) loan some money off a friend who has it at the time and then go farm later when you have the time C) make a withdrawal from guild vault (I understand option C is not available to all and its not abused by our clerics as is).<br />
<br />
<br />
Point of all this is that it is awfully considerate of someone to donate to the cleric a reagent or some pp kudos to you.   But a requirement for xp or groupage with a cleric in this game of eternal cost, no dont play cleric if you cant put the time into doing it right, or shaman, or warrior, or wizzard, etc.  Your problem not mine. ps i'll gladly heal for you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Ungerargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Many of the pickup groups I've been in lately don't have a ML; and thus, invariably a few people get screwed out of any loot whatsoever.  Most often, that would be me (I'm always cannibalizing), the puller, and sometimes the tank (depends on how good the puller is ;) ).  Meanwhile, the (for example) ranger, wizard, and cleric in the group each take home 3-5 raw/blue/regular diamonds, and another 50-100 pp so in stackable crap cash drops.  This would be why I hate being in a group without a MLer.  :)</div></div><hr />

When I join a group, regardless of the Cleric's level, do they then owe ME what I paid for Virtue? Or do they owe me the cost of a Dot? Or do we split what I paid for Virtue minus the cost of a Dot?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Faern why would a group owe you anything for what you decided to get out of group? Does a cleric have a choice of not using a dot? Yeah not casting it, how many groups are going to let a cleric get away with that? <br />
<br />
 For people using spell prices as an example. Thats not the same either. Cleric can pay for their spells also. Having to use a dot never stops.<br />
   Once i bought Q to use i never had to pay towards it again. Once a cleric bought symbal of whaterver, aego, virtue they still keep eating dots.     <br />
<br />
   I dont mind helping a cleric cover costs while i am grouped with them. Heck i dont mind donating extra. That **** must get old. Constantly having to buy dots to put hps on people who may never get hit must be fun too pre 60 but heck if people dont expect cleric to hp buff them. Or symbal with druid buffs. Those should be free i guess because they choose the class?  Why is asking for 12 plat ( albeit tacky in group)greedy but never feeling should help a cleric out not selfish?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I 2 box a clr so I can see both sides. 1 stack of dots = 210pp. When I stock him up which is every week to two weeks at the most. I put 8 stacks on him 1680pp. A blue dimond or raw dimond will sell to a vender for 190ish. So 10 BD's / RD's in what ever combanation = 1900pp. <br />
The point to this is that Dot cost isnt has bad has what some Clrs make  it out to be. I have never included my clr in loot rolls but I do include him in the split at the end of the gorup. I have never had a probllem with him paying for his own dots and spells. If a clr is talking about dot cost he problly just bought something that cashed him out, is saveing up for something, or is just plain gready.</div></div><hr />

While I agree in principal i feel my argument there has some merit. While as of late this has changed signficantly and with new facts new arguments need to be made.  With chardokb the opening of the some planes spell prices on my server for shamans have plummeted.  That said I doubt anyone who knows both classes would argue the cost is the same.  It took me weeks of farming to be able to get some of my spells, thats all i'm saying and I understand over time that cost gets muted. I still think its a valid point when your talking multiple 6 figure spells. This is on tunare, while I know my cleric friends never ever had to struggle for money doing the same farming alongside of me, they had more money for gear and dots besides because their spells just flat out werent as ridiculous in rarity/cost.  Just my limited experience and input on the subject, I understand its not the most in depth analysis but seriously there is something to our spells cost a bundle and their is hidden costs in alot of classes.<br />
<br />
Still two thumbs up to those that are considerate enough to donate</div></div><hr />

its even easier for me to take over healing duties instead</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I can't believe those of you complaining over the pp.   I think the only mistake here is how the cleric presented his request... it was a little too... abrupt for most.<br />
<br />
One of my past characters was a 61 cleric.   I was not rich... I didn't get 50k drops, I didn't abuse &quot;repay the clerics expenses&quot; drops... I was lucky to make 150-300pp a night in any camp that had some cash.   <br />
<br />
Master looting was my preferred way to go, repay expenses first, then split the coin.<br />
<br />
I had Blessing of Aego at the time... 4 dots... few hour spell.  Now factor in dispells... factor in deaths... factor in people coming and going in the group... almost everyone wants Aego (and now Virtue).<br />
<br />
I honestly never had a case where I was in a greedy group, or someone didn't look after me... I'm trying hard to remember if I ever walked away from a group down a dot or not... probably not, I usually grouped with friends.<br />
<br />
People point out Naltron's Mark as an example.  Awesome spell... 1 dot... and you know what happens when you cast it?   The tank and the enchanter ask you for Marzin right after cause &quot;they need all the hp they can get&quot;.    If it's worth it or not is a little rough.<br />
<br />
Anyhow... clerics always go through dots... almost EVERYONE wants it with a few exceptions (sometimes druids don't for example).   <br />
<br />
If you have a good easy night... one group Aego / Virtue lasts the whole duration... if you have a bad night, deaths / new people / dispells / whatever... well it can turn out to be a ****ty dot night.<br />
<br />
Again... I think perhaps this guy was just too abrupt... I don't know how I would have handled that situation... but there's NOTHING wrong with him wanting dot money.<br />
<br />
If i was making 50k a week ... I wouldn't care two ****s about 10.5pp (every cleric should get this price, 2 cha stiens and you're golden)... I simply never made much money... still don't as much shaman, although I'm much more self sufficient.<br />
<br />
I always look after my cleric now... if at all possible, no one in the group spends money out of their own pocket if there's enough cash drops... master looting makes this easy... even places like PoD ... often there is a rare drop worth like ~40-50pp.  <br />
<br />
Just my thoughts... not everyone is rich... 10.5p one night won't break anyone... even a poor cleric... but if that happens night after night...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">After grouping with a couple of clerics that walked away with a few k in gems in an hour or so, I started carrying my own dots and handing them over as needed.<br />
<br />
Turned out that this is a LOT cheaper in the long run because it totally undercuts the cleric asking for every other cash drop.<br />
<br />
I did have one guy moan about how he still needed all the gem drops because 'my spells are so expensive'.  I instructed him on the reletive costs of shammie spells and then disbanded shortly thereafter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Hail,<br />
<br />
Carry a stack of peridots with you.  Hand them over to the cleric as needed.  12pp is not unreasonable.  If he's stupid and doesn't have 2 opal encrusted steins to put on when he buys them, they could easily cost him 12pp each instead of 10.5pp each like the rest of us pay at a vendor.<br />
<br />
That said, even in PoD, if you keep all the trash drops and don't destroy them, you will be able to easily fund the peridots for an entire group as long as you aren't dying every half hour.  Make yourself the Masterlooter, hand the Cleric a stack of dots to shut him up, and keep a tally of the drops.  Those tainted planar essences sell to vendors for 1pp each I think (haven't been in PoD in forever), and they drop often.  There are gem drops rarely as well iirc.  One raw diamond will essentially pay for a stack of dots.  190pp for a diamond to sell to vendor, 210pp for a stack of peridots.  One stack of dots should last for any single grinding session unless your group stinks and dies alot.<br />
<br />
Clerics deserve to be compensated, but they should also learn a courteous method of requesting payment to cover their expenses.  The fellow you ran into seemed crass in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />
Frekkels</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Grann Met</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">My opinion ... the guys was being a bit of a bish.  I know a few clerics and we just let them loot trinkets, if there are not trinkets, well most 60+ clerics are not starving to death on acount of their small pocket books.  I do, however, feel for any class that has a coveted buff that costs reagents that come right out of their personal bank account.  I would just carry some dots and hand one over if they ask but usualy the cleric buffs w/o asking, at least the ones in my experience have and the ones that don't get &quot;written down&quot; by some of my group members after they leave the group for being a little cash grubbing $h!t.  <br />
     The cleric not buffing the tank though ... that is just retarded.  I would make a hate list and use the fact that shamans are far less common that clerics to keep him out of groups for a while MWA HA HA! that outa' learn him a thing or to.  (j/k, I dont really do that unless it is overly deserved i.e. intentionaly training me and telling me, from my bind point, &quot;ha ha I 0wnzord j00 n3wbee&quot;)<br />

Nope. They don't owe you as much as a single copper. And only someone who doesn't even begin to understand the situation would suggest that it might be a reasonable request.<br />
<br />
Does your group expect you to show up with a Virtue when you join? No.<br />
Does the group expect the cleric to cast Aego/Virtue/Symbol on whoever may need it? Yes.<br />
<br />
The only way the group owes you for the cost of that Virtue is if they asked/told you to get it.<br />
<br />
You aren't playing Devils Advocate - that position requires that your proposal actually has some potential legitimacy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Taraddar, yer off base on this one.  1.5pp could easily be explained away by the cleric having lower than normal charisma.  Just drop it and move on.<br />
<br />
When you can pick up a pair of steins in the bazaar that provide 50cha for next to nothing (roommate rescently bought a pair for 40pp) there is no reason to be paying 30pp more than needed per stack of dots. The cost for the steins can easily be covered by a couple stacks of dots at most. If it's such a drain for the cleric that he's demanding payment ahead of time he should be taking the appropriate steps to minimize that  cost. Then again if he's too lazy to pick up a couple steins that might explain why he's constantly broke and needs to charge his groups for buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>chmodux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I think the issue is one of obligation.  I think most people agree clerics go through alot of money as do many other classes, but clerics are a coveted class to have in groups by many.  I for one would never ever group with a cleric who REQUIRED donation for a buff, its the principal of it, I'd start asking for donations of focus of the 7th from now on till it was paid off if that was the case (or infusion of spirit or whatever the cleric likes). However i think it is polite and proper to help someone else out if you can.  But I'll take over healing duties or solo rather than have a cleric like that.  I'd even rather pay 400pp for essence emeralds and a necro rez first.  Money is not the issue, people demanding things from me is when they are being jackholes.</div></div><hr />
