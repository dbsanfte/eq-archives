<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kudoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking for an Affliction Haste 4 item to replace Ceramic Skull of Decay and it appears that Torch of Lxvanvom  is the only other one that's been discovered or reported at this point.<br />
<br />
Saw Atarak listed as submitter so decided I'd post here with my inqurery.<br />
<br />
Makes sense this would drop in CoD, but haven't seen one from the HP ring, or from the Kings yet, and not enough hps/mana to be from Bert. Many of the Kings nicer drops seem rare however, and I haven't done Paffa or gone very deep into the rat section either.<br />
<br />
Any info on where to look for this would be greatly appreciated :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>sakshale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The torch drops rarely from a mob during the Bertox ring event. Pretty sure it was the Elite Priest of Decay that dropped it. <br />
<br />
In 2 completed rings and our attempts we've gotten one torch (and enough two-tined pitchforks to choke a large horse).<br />

Yup yup, the torch dropped off one of the mini-named, damned if I recall which though. If you're on Inno and want a:<br />
<br />
Item: Ceramic Skull of Decay, MAGIC, Slot: RANGE PRIMARY SECONDARY, MANA: 30, Required: L46, Focus:<br />
              Affliction Haste IV, WT: 2.5, Size: SMALL, Classes: ALL, Races: ALL, Type: Misc, Submitter: Kerasota,<br />

Shoot me a holler in game and we'll work out the details.</div></div><hr />

Makes sense for it to drop from a King durring the Bert event. I'll definetly keep my eyes open next time through and maybe we'll get lucky with one of the torches rather than Rotting Lions :p</div></div><hr />
