<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">You really cant beat a shaman . im  sitting here planing a night of helping a guildie and helping myself after that.<br />
<br />
his biggest concern was getting invis to undead . couldnt find someone to do it .<br />
<br />
well guess who is a alchemist ? ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
i justpicked a shaman cause in real life im attracted to the idea of spirituality. but i have to say , its becoming more then just a neat idea for a character . this really is one of the best if not THE best class in the game . the versitality alone is enough to warrent that . <br />
<br />
thank god i chose this class :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Shhhh... keep it quiet ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">some one told me,<br />
<br />
 dude, you'll get the run fast spell at level 9 <br />
<br />
sold ill be a shaman</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I saw a big green chap scratching his arse when I was a level 5 shadow knight.  I asked him what he was and he said a troll shaman.  Kro was born and have never looked back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Spritabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Heh, I was running around in Gfay with my very first char, a level 2 ranger when the phone rang and my friend rang. He said to make a shaman because 1) i got spirit of owl (that's how I heard it) and 2) I could solo dragons at 50. Well, how can you argue with that?<br />
I sent him a tell at 54 asking him about that 'dragons at 50'-part. Well, he said, shamans suck until 51 so I wanted something to keep you going, but aren't you glad you did it? Bastard...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I started a shaman because my RL friend was creating a barbarian warrior, and I figured I could make a shaman to heal him.  Little did I know that I'd soon prefer to make clerics deal with that nonsense, so that I could do the 18+ other cool things that shaman do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Run fast + Barsh + Heal + Look cool ... good enough for me.  I didn't even know we could slow (wow- that was back in May of '99, weeeee!)  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Heh man this is bringing back memories.  Yup buddy of mine had his Dorf Warrior and a buddy of his (at the time, now we are RL friends) had a Dorf Cleric so they thought a sham would be a great grouping partner.  Figured they were lvl 15 so they could help &quot;PL&quot; me :) up to their level.  Since they were Dorfs they figured if they made me an Evil we could bank anywhere with little distraction from playing... thus the dillema of being an Ogre, or Troll....hm.... &quot;Ogres are Huge I'll be one of them&quot;<br />
<br />
Same thing....3 years later I am still loving my tubby bastage of a shaman.  Time for me to rant for one second.  Remember when there were Wednesday morning patches?  Put it this way, tuesday I decided that I put off getting my guise of disguises long enough (was lvl 30 or so) and we'll just go get it after the patch when I got back from class (was in college with the dorf warrior).  Yup sure enough that morning they patched the mask to be no drop and only equipable by rogues and bards.... GRRRRRRRRRRRRR of all things in this game that is still the ONE thing that pisses me off more than anything else. because i cant shrink any time i want.  and look around, how many sham are still around with their mask?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Damn Gorgos, you live like 30 minutes from me if your hometown is right. It tires me to see so many EQ players in the Midwest (let alone the Chicago area) yet we NEVER have a Fan Faire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Think what inspired me to make a shaman was back in my days as a wee mage.  I would always kill stuff in blackburrow to level up and would always group with shamans.  I figured they were a tank class because they would always seem to stand up to gnolls as well as any warrior.  So i made one!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>HerkeeLees</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i made a war and put a good portion of points into cha and int because i wanted to be well-rounded, heh. then i found out i was supposed to put my points into str so i rerolled what i thought was a war and turned out at level 5 i was a shaman and didnt find out about wisdom till late 20's ( i didn't have much help ) so I just kept my very strong shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I heard that shaman were &quot;tanks that could cast.&quot;<br />
<br />
We're SLOW tanks, but by gum we can do it.  It may take us a few minutes to beat that thing down... ah, the luxury of having that time to do it makes it all worthwhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I picked shamans because I didnt wanna be a warrior or rogue and I liked the way barbarians looked (though at first I was gonna make an ogre...sometimes I wish I had).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">After reading the book that came with the game, I decided I<br />
wanted:<br />
<br />
1) To be able to summon food &amp; water, so I wouldn't &quot;starve to<br />
death&quot; or not be able to cast gate.<br />
<br />
2) To be able to gate<br />
<br />
3) Spirit of Wolf<br />
<br />
This limited my selection to Shaman or Druid. Druids could port,<br />
but elves and halflings just looked so fragile compaired with<br />
Ogres Trolls and Barbarians. I decided it would be much more<br />
fun to play an Ogre. I was right. The only petition against me is<br />
when I blocked the door to the throne room in Cazic Thule so<br />
we could keep the KS's out of &quot;our room&quot;. It worked pretty well,<br />
Ogres made great doorstops!<br />
<br />
By the way, I used my Mask of Deceiver for a quick shrink just<br />
last night ;D <br />
<br />
Lost my damn mana stone to a bug when looting my corpse :(<br />
This was long after they stopped dropping; the GM just stone-<br />
walled me. <br />
<br />
Used to have a full set of Rubicite when it was the top of the line<br />
for us. <br />
<br />
Remember &quot;alphaloot&quot;?<br />
<br />
Remember when 90% of the server was either in Guk or SolB<br />
cause there was no other place for high levels?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I picked a shaman because I'm half scot-half norse, and the barbarians looked like me and all my uncles and aunts. (I'm very proud of both lineages).  And I hate pure melee classes, so that kinda limited it to shamans :P<br />
<br />
However, I love my shammy so much, that when I try to play my other toons, I miss my slow, buffs, dog, and esp can.  So I don't really play my other toons much....</div></div><hr />
