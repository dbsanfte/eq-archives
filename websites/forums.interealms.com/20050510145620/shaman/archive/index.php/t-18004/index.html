<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone fought him?<br />
I just got flagged to fight him.<br />
I know what his AE apparently is.<br />
<br />
Anyone got word on his max hit?  Slowable?  Minimum number of ele plane flagged people you would need to kill him?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">He was first killed long before anyone was even close to elemental flagged. I doubt he's all that hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Oh.  I realize that he can't be that hard.<br />
I'm more wondering bare minimum numbers to kill him.<br />
He'd have some great twink loot if you can do him with just a few groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i think his max is around 1400-1700 unslowable <br />
<br />
<br />
its been a while since  i killed him<br />
<br />
edit you can test if i rember right he has a ghetto leash hes not perma rooted tho</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">they beefed him up after the first few kills cause it was only taking 1-2 groups to kill him.<br />
<br />
never really saw any numbers about the new one though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I got him to 99% with spirtcall after my enchanter and rogue friends had laid down their lives ;)<br />
<br />
Seriously, I think is a 5+ group thing nowadays but have never done it (I did all the trials with guildees for kicks a while back)</div></div><hr />
