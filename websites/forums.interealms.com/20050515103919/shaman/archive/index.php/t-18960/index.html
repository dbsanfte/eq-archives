<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Walor_Spiritweaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hullo all. I am a level 62 Shaman and my defense is only 164. I was wondering if there is a way some of you may know how to raise defense rather quickly up to 200? Maybe there is some mob that cons blue that doesn't hit hard that I can just let whack me? I dunno...just would like it to get to 200. I'm open to any ideas. My Magelo should be updated...I am going to double check that now just to make sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Acrylia Caverns has mobs that con a decent blue and hit for low amounts. Just slow one, and go toe to toe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>dmuscat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Buff yourself with as much AC and agility as you can.  The more AC and agility the more chance of missing (AC) and the quicker your defense will raise (AGI).<br />
<br />
Get a fellow shaman with a 61 pet and duel him.<br />
<br />
Get fellow shaman to haste his pet with 60 percent haste.<br />
<br />
You cripple his pet so he will hit for less and potentially miss more then.<br />
<br />
Get fellow shaman to attack you with his pet.<br />
<br />
You heal yourself with torpor.<br />
<br />
Do this for about an hour and you should be set.<br />
<br />
Any pet that is dark blue can give you offense and defense skill raises.<br />
<br />
In addition make sure that the pet has weapons so that its duel wielding.</div></div><hr />
