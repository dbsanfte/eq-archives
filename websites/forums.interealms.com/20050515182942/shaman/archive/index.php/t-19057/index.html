<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In LDoN, I've noticed that pretty much all that drop anymore are resist augments.  In my pickup groups, people almost never roll on these augments, saying that they are waiting for a wis/int/str/sta augment to drop, so I get more than my share of them.  I now have a lot of my gear augmented, and I have augments on my resist gear.  Plus, I have a couple bags of augments in my bank. <br />
<br />
Am I just being a packrat picking up these resist augments?  Or have I been grouping with idiots?  And am I just incredibly unlucky to have stopped seeing anything but resist augments drop?</div></div><hr />

Depends on how much your group mates have done LDON. I know we've done well over 150 adv's apiece, our banks are clogged full of fire, poison, disease aug's, so we just let them rot now too. For that matter I have quite a few WIS augs unused as well. Pretty much the only thing we roll on anymore are STA augs.</div></div><hr />
