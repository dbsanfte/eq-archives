<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, bit of spoiler info here but that's not saying much since there is basically nothing to Trial 7 to figure out.<br />
<br />
For those who aren't familiar with it, you zone in, kill a few statics and wanderers, then kill a named Pixxt who's so close to the ZI that you can ALMOST cast on him from where you zone in--(he's about 300' away, I'd guess).  Then you clear some more wanderers and statics and kill the Diabolic Destroyer.  IF(big if) you can do it with no screw-ups/deaths, etc., you can do it in about 1 hour.<br />
<br />
IMPORTANT NOTE!!!!!!  PLEASE READ!!!!!  You're not quite done when you kill the DD.  An unslowable Cruel Illusion pops (wuss--hits like 1100s) after it dies.  You have to kill the CI and loot an item off of it to finish trial.  The bad news: he's easily bugged.  If you run oom and chanter dies or something, then EVAC.  or die.  DO NOT RUN TO ZONE IN, or kite it while ONLY cleric runs to zone in.  If you let the CI get out of the room, it will be bugged.  It will warp around ZI, agro wanderers on you, and be unkillable.  Each warp (2-3 seconds) completely heals its hp.<br />
<br />
Shaman role on named:  pure dps.  Take 2 healers--2 clr or clr/dru.  Even with a particularly beefy tank, I don't recommend trying to heal.  Even with the new heals.  People have done it.  It can be done with a shaman as 2nd healer, but it's not real safe.  I recommend a clr/dru combo for additional damage shield.  An unslowable quadding mod does a lot of damage to itself with shaman potion DS, mage/dru DS, and, if applicable, bard DS.<br />
<br />
With a particularly beefy tank (recommend 11k+ hp warrior, pal, or SK), they likely have very high AC and lots of agro mods.  Warn them that you are going to be doing an insane amount of agro and tell them to go agro generation over dps.  Paladins and SKs can (recommended) wedge into a corner to avoid interrupts.  Paladins can chain stun with 4 stuns for agro.  SKs have voice and lots of taunt spells.  Enchanters (and you NEED an enchanter for 7) can Visage them for additional agro.  Warriors can repost disc to start (45ish min refresh) to build heave agro (especially with anger procs), then go defensive.<br />
<br />
With that kind of agro generation, you've got license to really tuck in.  Enjoy it--you don't have too many of these opportunities!<br />
<br />
First named I'd recommend a DoT heavy load out--Bane, Blood, Breath, Tears, Velium Strike, Malos, Malicious Decay, and Tnargs.  I have clicky Pox on my pants, too.  Chanter can mez the 2x 30 second pets.  Malos, MD the mob, then bane, blood, breath.  VS until pets despawn, then alternate tears and VS.  Remember, you're taking the place of a DPS class.  Pretend you're a wizard--screw mana efficiency and burn as hard as you can.  The mob has to die before your healers run oom, and they'll be doing fast healing.  The mob quads 2200s, so CH ain't a good idea for the most part.  Once I get all the DoTs on and start nuking hard, I'm betting I can sustain 400+dps, possibly 450 for the remainder of the fight (needs to be under 3 minutes).<br />
<br />
DD fight: similar strategy, but your dps is doubly important.  Your enchanter has to lock down all the adds and pets.  The DD has like 7 pets.  2-3 spawn very fast, then like every 20 seconds or so another spawns.  The pets hit farking hard--1000+, so your chanter HAS to control them.  They despawn when DD dies.  DO NOT USE TEARS!!!  :)<br />
<br />
Recommended load out:  Bane, Blood, Breath, Pox (if you don't have elemental pants), MD, Malos, VS, Spear of Torment.  I haven't tried using a 5th dot--I worry about agro on 5 Dots even with repost and a beefy tank.  Again, damn the mana and get the named down ASAP.<br />
<br />
Good luck guys!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thanks Chutoi, I have been pondering this type of strategy myself.<br />
Youre right, that is an insane amount of aggro, I had to zone out on a yellow after 1 cast of bane was followed by a couple of hammer procs.<br />
It's also not easy convincing anyone to take you as a worthwile contibutor to dps. <br />
Druid was a good choice here as backup healer because they can contribute a lot to dps while clearing trash, then swith to viable second healer for named.<br />
<br />
Couple of questions. At what point after named engage did you start casting?<br />
Did you stand way back to minimize proximity aggro?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I went a slightly higher DPS/Aggro route than Chutoi.  Bane, Blood, Anathema, Pox (legs), Spear and of course alpha pet.  With Crit dots, focus effects, etc.... you can put out a pretty good bit of DPS on this, but you gotta make sure your tank can generate a TON of aggro and keep it up throughout the fight.  Ten seconds after your tank assumes he's got an aggro lock and slacks off... You'll be summoned and die. I speak from experience. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah that was kinda my experience with it last night. Drop a bane on him and throw a few spears of torment around then all of a sudden summoned to my death. Had forgotten resist buffs and tank was stuned most of the time.<br />
<br />
Resed, rebuffed and gave it another go and got him this time. Tank died at like 2% and we were able to nuke him down before he got anyone eles. The cleric had just ran oom at that point. Not an easy fight gonna be interesting trying to do the destroyer i think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Honestly, I'd recommend getting right on him.  Forget proximity agro--if the tank can't hold agro, you've got problems anyway.  However, if you flip him for one round, don't make the tank chase him--it's gonna be that much longer for the tank to re-establish agro.  You may die, but that doesn't automatically mean the party will wipe, especially if it's late in the encounter.<br />
<br />
As for timing, if you want really good agro on a tank, tank a well-geared warrior with lots of anger procs.  Have him start off with the reposte disc, then defensive.  Repost disc on the mob will probably take off 20% of its hp anyway, since it quads and hits so fast.  That many hits will also generate a ****load of procs.<br />
<br />
Your chanter will be handling the pets--unless you have used the agro/zone technique to already make it use the pet disc before pulling.  (Even if you do this, keep in mind a chanter is almost required for DD--root/parking not real viable in there for most).<br />
<br />
With a warrior using repost, you can start casting right after you debuff.  Have the chanter pull with recant magic (VERY important since there is a shaman in the DD room that can haste first named ixxt through wall).  Malos on inc and let the warrior intercept/incite/reposte/defensive.<br />
<br />
I could pretty much chain cast malos/MD/ultor/bane/blood/VS.  Then after pets despawned I unloaded with tears/VS combos and refreshed DoTs as they dropped.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Root parking for cc works fine imo, I have done it twice on DD and been able to add some dps too while keeping the adds locked down away from the fight.<br />
<br />
The pets appear to lose hp much slower if they are rooted than mezzed also, which prevents more pets to spawn (there's a message that says that they lose power due to the incapacitation which is mez/root). In fact I only had to keep 3 pets locked down during the whole fight which is incredibly easy once they are placed etc.<br />
<br />
I have never done this encounter with an enc so I'm not sure how fast they lose hp with mez but it seems kinda fast.</div></div><hr />

You don't proc on ripostes during furious. The agro the tank gets from the disc is from the dps he does, which can be very large depending on the weapon used and if he has his double riposte aa skills maxed. Generally the best way to do this encounter is to use cascading invul discs, so your warrior gets an agro platform after taunting off the previous invul tank (make sure they get agro by AE taunt, not by proximity on a feigned monk or dead ranger). That platform plus the agro from furious can be quite large, depending on how things were timed. There are a few other tricks you can do to maximize dps if you are smart. Btw, all of the 3 nameds prior to DD can be taken easily with a team based off a cleric/shaman duo. You don't need 2 clerics or a cleric/druid combo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doesn't thier AE dispell your root?  I haven't been in there a lot but they sure seemed to cast it often, when I was.</div></div><hr />

Song of Highsun works wonders if the Illusion leaves the room.<br />

<br />
<br />
Most likely if there's a second healer already in the group, a shaman won't be invited.  I've done it as secondary healer with a cleric and we beat the mission.  The Diabolic Destroyer appeared to put out less damage than the Pixtt Annihilator, because I was chaining Tnarg's and many landed when the tank had 70%+ health.  If I had ducked half a dozen heals I wouldn't have gone oom.  Though you're right about using a DS potion.  Make sure you bring some Kilva's along.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, a bard puller is preferred in this trial over a monk I'd say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I am finally getting around to doing this trial Friday (after backflagging tons of people on 5 and 6).  I have the role of the secondary healer *shiver*<br />
<br />
The tank is our best equipped in the guild, and he'd been pulling several people through every week for a while now, so I'm hoping it will go smooth.<br />
<br />
The planned group make up (Magelos linked for reference or something): guild's best cleric (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=362355)  and warrior (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=9257), a pally (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=147547)  for 2ndary rez/RT, rogue (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=780656), chanter (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=160632)  and shammy (me!). Pally cleric and myself all have the new GoD heals.<br />
<br />
I already planned on bringing FT potions,  some harvest potions I got from the casino (these (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=66613) ), and a crap load of DS potions, is there anything I'm forgetting? Do any of you bother to deal with dogdog during this whole thing?<br />
<br />
Any tips on how to maximize this group will be *greatly* appreciated!!<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh.  The warrior you are doing this with has more unbuffed hp/ac than the one I do this trial with (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=18306&amp;resize=true) has in full buffs.  If your groupmates have already done it a lot of times, I don't imagine it will be a big problem.  For the regular nameds I'm always the second healer, malos on inc, toss on a bane and a blood of saryn, send in the mutt and heal heal heal heal.  I've got max healing AA and Improved Healing 4 and the GoD heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Doesn't thier AE dispell your root?  I haven't been in there a lot but they sure seemed to cast it often, when I was.<br />
<br />
No, the dispell they cast is single target and they only cast it when they pass their leash and warp. The spell they cast is standard for pretty much all leashed mobs in GoD; http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3791&amp;source=Test<br />
<br />
Having an Enchanter on this trial is nice but by no means needed for a win.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thlayli of Xev: Your group should be able to complete the trial np.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">ah yes, sorry I misspoke about spell they cast being AE.  I wasn't aware that they only cast that spell when out of their leashed area though, they seemed to cast it no matter where we were standing.  I'll try some root parking next time we go and see if I can figure out where they are supposed to stay.  Thanks for the tips.</div></div><hr />
