<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Solo I can root dot golems/crawlers in PoV for an AA in 100 minutes. Grouped it usually takes 120-150 minutes. Is there anywhere in tier 2 thats faster, grouped or solo? An AA in 2 hours isn't exactly what I would call fast. What kind of rate do the rest of you get?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Contagion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't know if this will help you at all, however...<br />
At 62 I can solo frogs, (real names, &quot;hurricane lorok&quot; and &quot;typhoon lorok&quot;) in PoStorms, for about an AA in 100 minutes as well.<br />
At 65 that may slow down a tad, but I am sure you could kill them faster than I do (I tend to root/rot them with Bane of Nife,)<br />
No Epic, No Pox.... they take about 10 minutes a piece for me, 10%AA per kill. (I have heard from some druid friends that they are 9%AA at 65, but... /shrug.)<br />
<br />
As I said, not sure if that helps you at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I get an aa every 35-40 min soloing in fire past fennin trigger. 18% per kill and takes 6.5min to kill one.</div></div><hr />

We're not all so uber wulf. Only 2 guilds in pof on my server :p<br />
<br />
Mcast: The fastest place I've seen my group AA move has been in the inner caves in PoV. The mobs die fast and if you have a good puller, it seems like they never stop coming.  Can get an AA per *just under* an hour there. If you get a *really* good group you can take on both camps (inner and outter caves) and just blow your AA bar away.<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />

POV  crystaline golem, razorfield 6%<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kumate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">PoV caves was the best XP for me, before PoF.  Solo i would get an AA every hour.  Full group about the same, depending on group.  Sometimes less than an hour.</div></div><hr />

I've found that most the time at inner your waiting on spawns.  Figureing your fighting outer for some of them, hour is if your lucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wyldin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I usually solo the golems but it can be a pain if you run into crystalline crawlers as they are unrootable. I dont really understand how people use BoN for solo as it breaks my root half the time, possibly my only understanding would be a root clicky. Otherwise I would use BoN and ABoN. The best thing about golems is you can root one right outside the castle then run inside and cast through the wall. Give yourself a little distance so you dont get hit through the wall. The way that it would path is that if root breaks it tries to get to you and the way it will work is it will warp on you after an extended duration of time but if you know what you are doing it gives you even more time to land root.</div></div><hr />
