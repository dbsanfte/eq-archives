<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Emmhim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello<br />
<br />
I had the impression that Combat Stability would reduce all hits with a given percentage, so if e.g. a mob hits for max 500, it would hit for max 490, 475 and 450 with CS1, CS2 and CS3, but it seems like that is not the way it is working.<br />
The crystalline golems in PoV use to hit me max 544. Yesterday I bought CS3, and they still hit me for max 544. I see no change at all, which makes me wonder whether it is waste of 15 AA to buy Innate Defence V.<br />
<br />
Can somebody explain how damage mitigation works, and how combat stability/innate defense should influence this?<br />
<br />

Innate Defense and Lightning Reflexes are &quot;save your ass&quot; AAs.  They are streaky and only work sometimes.  <br />
<br />
Innate Defense, if you &quot;win the roll&quot; for it to be active, will mitigate incoming hits, like Gangas said.  You won't be hit for max damage.  It operates in such a way that you never really know that it's working unless someone like Fennin Ro or some GoD boss hits you for 20 for a round of melee.<br />
<br />
Lightning Reflexes is much better and much more noticeable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A dev posted on the warrior boards, I'm sorry I don't have a link, but he said that Innate Defense line of AAs only raises your AC Cap.  Thus, you get better mitigation from your AC, not technically from the AA.<br />
<br />
What this means is, if you have a low AC, you buy these AAs, your AC Cap goes up... but it means frick all to you... nothing... because you're not at your cap anyhow, because you have low AC.<br />
<br />
If you have high AC, and you get these AAs, you'll get more mitigation bonus from your AC since your cap has now been raised.<br />
<br />
The Dev did not post the AC value, but did say that mid-upper end 65 warriors should have no trouble getting to their AC cap for the AAs to be useful.<br />
<br />
What that means for other tanks, and priests, I don't know... so these AAs are virtually bottom on my list until my AC is massively high (if ever).<br />
<br />
The Reflexes AAs are worth their weight in gold.   Streaky yes, no matter what your AA level there is no guarenteed miss... but totally worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tyck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The method I found for testing Lightning Reflexes is to put a damage shield up and then let a mob hit at you. <br />
<br />
When LR works.. you'll see the Damage Shield hit but NOT see a Miss or Hit message from the mob.<br />
<br />
Note: they may have fixed this, I'm seeing a LOT more &quot;You have Dodged&quot; messages these days.  But that just might be the +2% dodge shield I picked up actually working!<br />
<br />
If I recall correctly, this weekend's output looked like this:<br />
<br />
Quavonis Firetail tried to hit you but you dodge!<br />
Quavonis Firetail hits you for 3140.<br />
Quavonis Firetail hits you for 2980.<br />
Quavonis Firetail tried to hit you but you dodge!<br />
Quavonis Firetail hits you for 1200.<br />
Your Quiesence has worn off.<br />
Quavonis Firetail hits you for 3000.<br />
You have died.<br />
Zoning. Please wait...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Haass Wolvesbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Warrior here, i'll answer this question for ya, so you don't get a bunch of people giving their ideas and getting confused.<br />
<br />
Lets say we make a graph of what a mob hits you for over time.  We'll obviously see a spike at certain damages based upon your AC compared to the mob's ATK.  What innate defense does (And this is also what AC does actually) is move that graph slightly to the left (IE : Closer to zero).<br />
<br />
The maximum a mob can hit you for will not change.  The minimum a mob can hit you for will not change (So you will never be hit for 20 by Fennin ro...it's not a number he can hit you for).  What it does do, is make it so that over a large sample of hits, you'll be getting hit for less more often than you were before you trained the AA.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
<br />
Innate Defense is basically equivilant to AC.  It reduces the mob's average hit, though the max hit remains unchanged, which reduces your damage intake over time by the given percentage.  EDIT: Haass's line graph description is spot on.  <br />
<br />
Lightning Reflexes is NOT better.  LR has the advantage of helping with channeling, because a miss will not interrupt you, but that's where it's advantage ends.  ID reduces the same amount of damage over time, and does so more consistantly - mitigation is less streaky than avoidance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">LR also helps with avoiding innate mob procs (but not weapon procs), for what that's worth. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Griz, LR gives a percentage improvement to your chance to avoid an attack. So, if your chance to avoid was 50%, and LR gave (for example) a 10% improvement (I dont know the exact numbers), you would have a 55% chance to avoid. In the case of PA he has a very high accuracy setting, so your chances to avoid are very low. A 10% improvement of nothing is still nothing, and that is why he hit you every time. For PA having ID is way better than having LR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">In the end, CS and ID will help you live through any encounters where a mob will hit you via melee.  Will you see a large difference that you did with CA/LR.  Nope.  But I still deem having maxed defensive aa's done before you ding AA 100.   But I'm a raiding shaman so my p.o.v. is skewed that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Emmhim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thank you for all the answers.<br />
<br />
Seems like my 12 AA used on Combat Stability are not wasted - it does reduce melee damage but just not the way I thought it did.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">CS is the &quot;less obvious&quot; of the defensive AA's.  Still works, you just dont get those nice streaks of misses like CA and LR.</div></div><hr />
