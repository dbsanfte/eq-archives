<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>brindelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello guys,<br />
<br />
This and the other class boards are generally the only sites I read, however we are going to kill trak tomorrow and none of us have done him before.  I searched this site did not much find info on the whole process...I was wondering what sites you all used to find out the best ways to kill mobs etc etc.<br />
<br />
Addittionally I know Trak is pretty gimp but so are we and we are just trying to get our feet wet for our little family guild.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">allakazam has the effects that trak has he isnt really hard but if you pull him outa his lair dont let him gate !!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yeah I read that.  So lets hope that is the case, also we have a mage for CoH so we probably dont need to pull him out of his lair.<br />
<br />
I was also just wondering for mobs in general.  Nobody in our guild raids really and never really has except we have a reroll from some guy that supposedly had the first monk epic on some blue server.  But other than him we have no raiders, so we are just looking for some mobs we can down for kicks and some minor upgrades.<br />
<br />
We are going to try the kunark dragons when they are up and kelokk darr in CS, and Xxblitv in Burning woods.<br />
<br />
Basically we have this 63 warrior, 63 shaman, 65 monk, rogue, ranger, cleric.  Like 3 clerics 55-62 and then thats about it.  Have some others who aren't playing much that are around 60.  So as you can see we are a little low on dps but have alot of healing power.<br />
<br />
Anyways too long winded.</div></div><hr />

extra clerics?  can i have one? ;)<br />
<br />
for Trakanon himself, everyone needs to have 150PR minimum.  Well over 200 is recommended.  If you can get a mercenary bard or 2 for resists, its well worth it.  If Trak can land his DoT, you're pretty much dead.  End of story.  1200hp DD + 150ish/tick DoT on everyone (probably 3+ times too, since it will take you all a bit to kill him) is murderous for a small crew.  You have a lot of cleric support, which will help mitigate some of it, but it's pretty bad news if it lands on someone repeatedly.  And with only 9 of you, losing 1 or two DPS folks (or a cleric even more so) will be a serious problem.<br />
<br />
The rest of the stuff should be pretty easy for you with that crew though.  The protector and jumpy aren't too bad.  It may take you a while to get through the reets, shrooms and juggs though since you are a little light on DPS.<br />
<br />
good luck, he's a fun fight!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Midnyte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Trak is a 32k dragon. He can be killed in 10 seconds by a group of 65's.<br />
<br />
Have a bard in your healers grp playing mana regen and resist song. Kill him fast. DPS is uber important. Nuke hard. You will win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dalarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">For Trak, more DPS &gt;&gt;&gt; more healing. I'm not sure how often he Trak Touches, but that is going to be a problem with that small of a crew especially since you're DPS-lite. I suggest having one of the lower level clerics DA pull him to the back of his lair when you're ready to engage him since you have no pally, that way you avoid one Trak Touch, and if something goes wrong while the rest of you run in its not a terrible loss. <br />
<br />
You say you have a mage for CoH but he isn't in the class list you gave, that would be another way to beat the trak touch.<br />
<br />
All in all:<br />
<br />
Good:<br />
Trak only has 32k hit points.<br />
<br />
Bad:<br />
He teleports people<br />
He has what is still a semi-mean AE by todays standards, especially since you have no bards for resists<br />
He procs Venril Sathirs 'soul tug' lifetap<br />
He will be buffed by a level 60 chanter.<br />
<br />
Ugly:<br />
Even when you know exactly what you're doing he is easy to wipe on with a small crew.<br />
<br />
I really hope your monk knows how to pull the lair, it can be a real PITA although CoH at least lets you fix screw-ups easier. Poke around the archives at Monkly Business, pretty sure I read some good descriptions of pulling his lair there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>brindelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah our monk doesnt know what he is doing, and hes one of the few unwilling to learn.   I'll probably have to learn for him...is pacification going to help?<br />
<br />
I'm sorry we also have a 60 bard and 59 mage.  I'll recap more clearly.<br />
<br />
65 - Ranger, Cleric, Monk<br />
63 - Rogue, Warrior, Shaman, Cleric<br />
60 - Bard<br />
59 - Mage, Ranger<br />
58 - Cleric<br />
55 - Cleric<br />
<br />
<br />
We have a bit more than I said at first, we are all very poorly geared except for the rogue.<br />
<br />
Thanks for replies, look forward to winning our first raid well other than Rak but he's not much of a deal anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
aye, and 4 65 SKs with HT AA can do him almost instantly. <br />
<br />
unfortunately, they've got no nukers: 63 warrior, 63 shaman, 65 monk, rogue, ranger, cleric (+ 3 mid-50s clerics), which means contending with the DoT, probably several times.  And suriving the kill means nothing if everyone dies before they can loot the corpse.  moreover, at least 1 of the clerics has to survive to rez folks back in.  probably would be best to have the lowest level cleric camp out, or hang way back, before the fight in case of a wipe.<br />
<br />
edit:<br />
<br />
based on what you said about gear, you guys may have trouble with him.  He's no slouch fight, even though he's a few expansions old.  his DoT range is pretty big and your low-level clerics will probably eat it after the first one (mediocre resists + low level = death on trak).<br />
<br />
assuming your melee gear is mediocre, I'd guess they're putting out 300-350dps combined, which will make for a fairly lengthy fight (&gt;= 1min) considering you all don't have a lot of margin for error.<br />
<br />
 - the mage will help some... he needs to nuke hard, but not get aggro.  <br />
 - monk, rogue and ranger engage from BEHIND the dragon (ripostes for 600+ will hurt a ton, even if they resist the DoT)<br />
 - warrior MUST hold aggro... i've no idea what his weapons are, but the other melee classes may need to wait to engage for a few seconds.<br />
 - landing slow sounds like it will be key for you all (go shaman!!).  i assume warrior has mediocre gear also, which means he's probably what, 6k buffed to the teeth?  a CH chain won't last long with clerics dying from his breath.<br />
<br />
sounds like it will be an exciting time!  good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>brindelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah Warrior is 6.5k hp buffed to the teeth.<br />
<br />
He has the two droga weapons for aggro which aren't bad but definately aren't great.  <br />
<br />
Our dps is only ok, Monk has weapons off of Tunare which can be a royal pain snaring and rooting(but he's a gimp).  We'll have to make sure he takes the root one off.  The rogue has best bazaar loot he can get.<br />
<br />
<br />
Other than that yep we are really low on dps, would like to do it as a guild but if I have to I can bring in some 65 wizards.  Which would make it rather trivial as well.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Two more questions, you mentioned that he needs to be slowed but he's flagged on our slowablity charts as unslowable.  Secondly does anyone know if pacification works here, I haven't seen it in any of the guides.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Blood of Nadox rocks for Trakonon AE. For information</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Don't figure on slowing Trak.<br />
<br />
Have the cleric use group heals, and everyone just flat out go for damage.  Be ready to cure the AE very fast when he dies.  Just have folks spam it, don't wait for people to say &quot;hey I'm dot.... (dies).&quot;<br />
<br />
It's going to hard fight for you guys I think, and I hope you have a good puller team to guide you folks down there without a premature Trak aggro or a train of Juggs.  <br />
<br />
Fight down to his lair and get comfortable, and then you can figure out the charge/pull tactic you want to do.  <br />
<br />
It's great fun though, and thrilling when he croaks.  <br />
<br />
Don't forgot about the Trak teeth and consider Veeshan's Peak.  It's a lot more playable now than it used to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">He procs Venril Sathirs 'soul tug' lifetap<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
No longer lifetaps.  At least, in my experience being beaten up by Trak.  <br />
<br />
He tends to just knock the hell out of me and port me to shrooms.<br />
<br />
Shaman pet will path from Trak's lair all the way to the shroom landing point after trak dies btw.  You don't need to know that, it's just trivia.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If Trak ports you (trak touch), sit down immediately - you may get summoned back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Having a Necro (see if one will join your raid perhaps) will pretty much ensure you to be able to resist the poison dot.  Have the necro DMF everyone then use the group poison resist (Talisman of Tribunal if you have it would be good).  They both stack their PR and will get even people with crappy PR over 200 most likely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>brindelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Sorry we play on sullon zek(one of the main reasons our gear is ghetto)<br />
<br />
<br />
So probably no necro, we got shaman and bard and hopefully thats enough.  Luckily being on SZ most of us have resist gear.  <br />
<br />
I mentioned earlier that the warrior has poor aggro weapons, well we solved that just all chipped and bought him a BoC.</div></div><hr />

I beg to differ, lifetaped our second MT 3 times in a row for 1500 HP each the 12/12/2003<br />
<br />
Better have a chanter runing your MT constantly.</div></div><hr />

Seems I've just gotten lucky then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If your 65 Monk has rooting/snaring weapons, he may want to unequip them and use bare hands instead. 15/20 is still decent and won't mess up agro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yep, my mistake.  i haven't been primary shaman on a trak raid, so had never experienced that bit.  my monk managed to survive the last one with 100% hps though ;)  think she had 315 PR when we engaged.<br />
<br />
a BoC, huh? that was a pretty nice gift for your warrior!<br />
<br />
best of luck on this.  give it a go with just your group before you decide to bring in extra help: challenges are the fun part of this game and pulling this off would be pretty sweet.  don't get discouraged if you have trouble the first time or two either.</div></div><hr />
