<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TwoBrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was fighting this all powerful Snow Leopard...(remember those?)<br />
My hit points were down to 53...I then realized that my AGI was down to 77 from 103. Why?<br />
<br />
How does HP affect only AGI? Or does it? Was it something else that I wasn't seeing? I had one bubble of Stamina gone from the fight.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When you get to the percentage hit point where warriors go beserk we as shamans start to loose melee stats.<br />
<br />
The closer you are to death the lower your melee stats get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">normally near death only effects agi.<br />
<br />
the sta loss was most likely from swinging a weapon for an extended period of time.  swiming will do the same thing to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The agility loss is one of the reason you move so slowly when you're about to die ;(  Makes running away so difficult</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mordaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">When your hit points get to about a bubble and a half you start to loose agility. It's the lovely death march.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>flinx_21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have a question based on this<br />
<br />
people who have high agility and are hurt don't slow down as much<br />
<br />
my question is does high agility effect your run speed?<br />
<br />
example<br />
<br />
take two 20th lvl shaman exact same stats<br />
they cast sow on themself<br />
both have the exact same equipment and weigh the same amount of stone(lets say 20 stone)<br />
<br />
the only buffs are sow except one has an agility buff on him<br />
<br />
will the one with the agility buff run faster??<br />
:confused:<br />
<br />
----------------<br />
hhmmm maybe that's hard to answer<br />
<br />
lets try three examples<br />
everything above is true in the three examples<br />
<br />
in the first one the both have 64 agility unbuffed<br />
<br />
in the second one they both have 74 agility unbuffed<br />
<br />
in the last one they both have 99 agility unbuffed<br />
<br />
would the person with the agility buff run faster in any of these examples?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Once you break a certain threshold (2 bubbles of health is a good estimate), your ATK and AC drop off dramatically because your AGI is dropping.<br />
<br />
So the more you get hit, the easier it is for you to get hit.  As Mordaen pointed out, it's known as the 'death march' or 'death spiral'.  Its a slippery slope.<br />
<br />
Once you get into that 'zone' it's hard to get out.  You can't kill the mob that's on you, your HPs drop quickly, and you move so slowly you can't run away.<br />
<br />
The best thing you can do is get your /loc.  Makes it easy to get your corpse. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT:  There is a chart *somewhere* that shows the approx relationship between AGI and AC...basically, there is a HUGE jump at 75.  Most of the other time it's a trivial increase.  So keep your AGI up high enough so that even if you start losing points because of the 'death spiral' it will remain above 75.</div></div><hr />
