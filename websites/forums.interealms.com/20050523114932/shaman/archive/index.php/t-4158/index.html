Anyone that can explain this? My slow should last for 7 minute and 12 sec with my focus item. Minimum time is 6 minutes.<br />
<br />
First it wears off after 5 min 25 sec, and then after another 10 sec!?<br />
<br />
If it cant be dispelled or cured, whats going on?<br />
Wasnt any other 60 Shaman in zone either.<br />

I wasnt timing, but malosini/cripple/turgurs seemed to only last around 8 mins or less.  Last i checked turgurs was a 10mins spell.  <br />
<br />
Anyways, i was up their taking care of the 4 priest and i saw it ware off, but some of them didnt seem to be meleeing faster, either way i got it slowed asap and slowed often for the entire fight.  /shrug...ssra is a weird zone anyways, lots of quirks<br />
<br />
Slows cant be dispelled anymore :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Looks weird to me fatsow... in the past I would say someone was dispelling, but that can't be the case.  Now I would wonder if another shaman wasn't overwriting, but you say there was no other.  Turgurs can be cured, but a PC can't cure a mob.  I have no idea what it could be...  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, I have spells for group only turned on because of exessive spam. I cant remember seeing the message about slow wearing off when another 60 shaman cast on same mob though?<br />
<br />
I know if someone else with a higher level/better spell overwrites it I get the message about it being overwritted, malo--&gt;malosini for instance, but not for slow? Am I incorrect?<br />
<br />
We had another guild shaman there but he was only lvl 58. Now, there could ofcourse be a non guildie shaman there casting slow on him, but I can hardly see why someone would just start slowing him when not on the raid.<br />
<br />
hmm, we might have had a mob add there, could it be possible for it to cast cure on vadyn? I have NPC spells turned on, but didnt see any mobs casting. Also checked logs for mobs there, could only see a centi dator. Only caster classes they can be are SK and wizard, they cant cast cure can they?<br />
<br />
Another possibility is that someone have found a way to fake messages like the one being fixed a week or 2 ago.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Oaks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">perhaps he had all 15 buff slots full?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vulgarr Disruptor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">that is strange... only thing i can think of would be that maybe the mob was fully buffed/debuffed. I'm told Mobs have a limited number of buff/debuff slots, like as players we only have 15. If slow was in one of the first slots... followed by a full raid debuff cycle of malo, cripple, tash, fixation, weaken, sundering, occlusion, etc. plus DoT's &amp; misc. ...... it's possible a weapon proc or something was overwriting the top slot (Turgurs)<br />
<br />
just a wild guess, but it is possible to debuff/dot to the point that other stuff &quot;won't take hold&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">wont overwrite, you'll just get a nohold msg, i've never lost a slow this way, but i've heard others saying this too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, you are incorrect. If a higher level shaman casts Turgurs, you get the spell wears off message as if the duration had expired. Just like if you slow with Plague of Insects, and then land Turgurs, you get 'Your Plague of Insects spell has worn off'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">if you are 59 and land slow then a 60 shaman lands slow you will not get a slow has worn off message, cause turgurs insects has not worn off.  A while ago when killing statue i slowed intially (was lvl 59) then our 60 shaman reslowed and i did not get a slow worn of message.   since fatsow is 60 and there is NO better slow it had to be getting cured or something.   No va'dyn is not priest class hes pure melee.<br />
<br />
the reason you get a plague of insects or tigirs insects or whatever lower slow than turgurs has worn off when someone lands turgurs is because the spell is no longer there replaced my a different slow.  same goes for malo wearing off when malosini lands.</div></div><hr />

No, if a higher level shaman casts turgurs and overwrites your turgurs you will NOT get a spell wears off message.  Will happen with malo/malosini, plague/turgurs, but not turgurs/turgurs.</div></div><hr />

Cast an unresistable debuff on a mob and one of the other debuffs gets bumped.  Sounds like your slow was the unlucky loser.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">But why could he re-slow then immediatly ? If what you say is correct all slots should be filled.<br />
<br />
Very strange indeed. But I had my slow run out on Dozekar after 4 mins too once .. nearly had a wipe because of this.<br />
<br />
Note: If I as a lvl 60 shaman slowed a mob with Turgur's and another lvl 60 shaman successfully slowed the same mob, neither me get a message (for Turgur's ran out) nor him (not taking hold).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">A lvl 60 enchanters  best slow is slightly (5%) worse than a lvl 60 shamans. There are a couple short ranges where enchanters slow better but in general they would only slow better if they are higher lvl.<br />
<br />
As far as the wear off msg goes you only get the wear off msg if the debuff ends up leaving the mob. IE malo gives a worn off msg when someone overwrites it with malosini. On the other hand if a lvl 51 shaman lands turgurs and then a lvl 60 shaman comes by and lands turgurs. Even tho it's a more effective spell, 75% vs 65% because of the lvl difference, it's still the same name. So the lvl 51 shaman won't get a wear off msg ever and if the mob was somehow cured or dispelled of the slow the lvl 60 shaman would get the worn off msg.</div></div><hr />

He's not a mob you tend to debuff much, he's a fast fight and he's been immune to slow up until recently - I just can't imagine there being 15 effects on him.<br />

I assumed he was getting it off himself, quite how /shrug.</div></div><hr />

It took em a patch after the changes to slow were made to figure it out, but mobs that dispell themselves were in general not meant to be slowed.<br />

If the add was an SK they may get cure disease, I'm not 100% on that but I know that necros get it.  <br />

The only problem I've run into is a necro slowing undead mobs after I've slowed them with togor's.</div></div><hr />

What I find interesting about the initial problem is that the first Turgur's lasted 5:25, the next was 10 seconds and 7 seconds later he Yawned again.  Where are the casting messages?</div></div><hr />

Anyway, checked out Shadow knight spells. Could only find one cure disease spell and that removed 1 disease counter. Turgur got 16 disease counters. And the second slow wore of after just 10 seconds...<br />

hp is still unslowable. but theres the adds..<br />
