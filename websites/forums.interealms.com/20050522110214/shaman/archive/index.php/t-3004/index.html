<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DocXav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all, first let me introduce myself as i am new to that board; i am Letaal, 50 shaman on the Tribunal server.<br />
<br />
Now my question: i heard that buying a horse is interesting because u are always medding while riding it; Is that true? And if it is, is that a bug that is going to be fixed one day?<br />
<br />
And long live that forum !!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>TetrianBrell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You med while on a horse, weither or not its gonna be fixed i dont know, i doubt it though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>DocXav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thx for the answer, i guess i will put some money aside to buy one now as it looks very interesting to be always medding =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The facts about horses:<br />
<br />
You meditate while sitting or standing, but NOT while autoattacking, or moving. You do meditate while casting spells. This applies whether horse models are on or off.<br />
<br />
You always regenerate hitpoints at your STANDING rate. This applies whether models are on or off.<br />
<br />
If you turn off horse models, you don't get the movement benefit of the horse. Nor do you get the safe fall. BUT you can then SoW yourself for normal SoW speed.<br />
<br />
Horses are hungry beasts and eat your food. This applies with models on or off.<br />
<br />
Horses are buffs and use a buff slot. They can be dispelled or clicked off.<br />
<br />
Horses can only be used in outdoor zones. Unlike SoW, if you enter an indoor zone, your horse will be dispelled.<br />
<br />
If you camp while on a horse, you go linkdead (obviously a bug). Click off your horse buff before camping.<br />
<br />
Some people have reported problems when using invis on a horse. To be safe, click off the horse before invissing.<br />
<br />
Some people have reported problems with targetting people on a horse. You may find that while you have a horse summoned, other group members can't cast spells on you, or trade with you.<br />
<br />
<br />
That's about all there is to know I think. If you just want a horse for the med benefit, buy the cheap one for about 8400pp (with high CHA). I've had one for a few weeks now and it's worth every copper. My personal opinion is that it's better for grouping than soloing, but if you have a JBB a horse is probably a great solo tool also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">is it possible at all to run at sow speed with horse models on? I want to leave the models on when i get a horse so i look cool (will get the cheapest one) but i dont wanna hafta be all slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gert Groinwounder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The biggest problem I see with having a horse (with models on or off) is the inability to interrupt your casting by crouching.  That is a MAJOR drawback in my opinion...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">With horse models off, you can duck to interrupt casting just fine.  <br />
<br />
The invis thing is the only drawback I have found.  Invis icon shows up as normal, but all mobs can see you.  I have NOT tested this with models ON.  Only with them OFF ( meaning Barb luclin models on and horses off).  <br />
<br />
You WILL forget and it may get people killed when you do (/wave moving through cazic thule).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hmm, I move through CT with horse models off and invis ON all the time and have yet to be seen. I wonder if it's some other buff that when combined with the horse causes issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah, I have been told that others have not had that problem.  I need to do more research.  It may be a bug specific to my .ini/graphics setup.  Or mysterious coincidence :).<br />
<br />
Observations thus far:<br />
<br />
I have noted the problem both when normal sized and when shrunken.  <br />
<br />
Zoning before or after summoning the horse seems to make no difference.  <br />
<br />
I have all models on except horses/elementals and all other settings on highest quality.  <br />
<br />
Only movement speed buffs that I have had on have been sow or Bi Lhi.  No lev or Dmf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>DocXav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well tank u for those precious informations, i have a JBB so i will consider buying one after some change in my inventory (i really can t stand those rygorr legs and that Drovalg mantle anymore).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Alminah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Go get yourself a horse. They are incredible useful!<br />
<br />
<br />
Horses are buffs and use a buff slot. They can be dispelled or clicked off.  <br />
<br />
I use the horse often but my horse have yet to be dispelled, so I thought it worked like the beastlords pets and couldn't be dispelled. For instans when I'm in WW killing dragons I normally have the horse icon among the first ones, and when the dragon is dead I'm sitting on my horse with the horse icon up -  but got the other 10 first buffs dispelled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">the main problems with having the horse grapic on:<br />
-Accelerating and stopping while on a horse is quite slow.<br />
-Big fat horse head in the way<br />
-Cant cast SoW over it<br />
-Can't duck to interupt spells<br />
<br />
advantages:<br />
-looks cool<br />
-safe fall<br />
-no forgetting its on when you camp and go LD (i do it all the time)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Maybe I'm wrong about horses being dispelled, my memory is hazy ... next time I'm in Skyfire, I'll barsh a Chromodrac and test it out.</div></div><hr />
