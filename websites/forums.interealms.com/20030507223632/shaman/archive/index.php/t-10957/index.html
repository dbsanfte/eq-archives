<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>thevolcanogod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone know the reccommended level for soloing the area that the Swirling Red Mass appears in (drops Boots of Flowing Slime)? What is the lowest level it has been done? I assume Virulent Paralysis would help here since on the break you would get a 2 pull out of the slime/water.<br />
<br />
Can a level 61 hold this single &quot;pod&quot; indeffinately?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i thought the boots on longer dropped?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmm, I don't know. I've thought about doing this, I think it could be possible though very challeging. Pools of slime and Skeeters are not easy mobs at all. I may give it a shot someday when I'm bored.<br />
<br />
And yeah, I beleive the boots still drop. I havn't heard otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I can solo the room + break in... level 65 though.<br />
<br />
Used to camp the boots when i needed money, exp is horrid compared to Pop (duh) and the break in can suck with 2 pools. The boots still drop but they're the rare from Swirlign Red Mass.<br />
<br />
Hope this helped.</div></div><hr />
