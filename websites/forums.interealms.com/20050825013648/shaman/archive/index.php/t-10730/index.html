Do shaman stand a chance of getting a bone here.  I don't want a new heal.  I doubt where we stand in the make up of players counts for much, since we are few in actual numbers.  <br />
<br />
I assume the ability to block for duel-wielding classes is based on the new mob abilities and as such is meant to counter that..  If so does that mean each time we draw aggro since we can't block will be just like when we get resists ..  because I expect to die when I get resists trying to slow. <br />
<br />
So will shaman get considered due to our normal job in the experience grind groups as a slower or what?  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think our defensive capabilities are fine and balanced.  It'd be nice if we tanked like monks but that just isn't going to happen.  If you are serious about raising your defensive skills, then grind out the CA3 and LR5 AA's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>thevolcanogod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Don't know if this has been suggested but what about a relatively low cost Archetype AA skill that is like a Malo spell buff. The effect when activated would make all our spells become unresistable for a period of time - perhaps 15 seconds or so. There are a couple avenues that could be taken here:<br />
<br />
- have the ability to spend multiple points in this skill to increase the time of unresistability and decrease the reuse time of the skill<br />
- the possibility of using this on other classes also - not sure if this would create balance issues or not<br />
- this unresistability would not allow spells to land on things that are naturally immune to those spells<br />
<br />
I think this ability would increase our balance in the game (able to land a slow or cripple immediately rather than wait for debuffs) without doing anything too unbalanced - the spells that are usually landed are just going to be landed a little faster by a Shaman with this AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">thats asking for a lot.  i mean just before any big pull you hit the AA and the mob is auto slowed.  for some mobs its hectic and a lot of work to get the mob slowed... once hes slowed you have 4 minutes to make sure all the debuffs and stuff are in to reslow. its the intial slow that has everyone up tight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">well its a fine line when you come to issues like this , GIVING us block is not smoethign s shaman would be adept in , we are casters , medicine men , we are magic users basicly , but we can take a puch is all.<br />
<br />
I think the AA aprouch is good cause it would be like learning and no matter who you are youc an always go and TRAIN something. But it would take melee skills to have inate blocking ability.<br />
<br />
There is alto of things sk ask for , alot of things we want , but i think whats important is that we keep inline with what a shaman is , even if it does mean we miss out on some things....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>thevolcanogod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I know that's it's the initial slow that sucks - but that is a way we can really be set apart from the other slowing classes. From the way I see it, slow was given to other classes because of utility purposes - if you don't have a shaman on your raid, you can make do with an enchanter - same reason CHeal was given to us and Druids. However the way it was given and to the degree - 70% versus 75% - many shamans I think feel cheapened that one of our main shaman-defining abilities was given away. It would be like giving Wizards and Beastlords the ability to cast Call of the Hero at level 62 in the next patch - the outcry from the mage community would be deaffening.<br />
<br />
Now for all fights the faster a spell lands, the safer the fight is and the happier the whole raid is in general - I.E. landing things fast is a highly desired skill. The recent trend to make things more challenging is to go towards slow-resistant creatures or slow-immune. For the ones that can actually be slowed by the full amount, I feel SOE has them tuned with the idea that they will eventually be slowed. If the devs are expecting them to be slowed anyways - letting us do it a bit faster is IMHO not too overpowered. Plus this will make our contributions to groups and especially raids much more valuable in the slow department than say chanter slow and won't in any way limit their already given use of the spell.<br />
<br />
This is also a change that will benefit the mid level shamans as well as the high levels. It will of course devalue Malo a bit but I think Malo would still have it's uses as a resistance debuff for the other classes spells. Plus I don't think many shamans would mind having malo loose little status once they had this skill, especially now that Malo is getting even harder to get.<br />
<br />
If a time limit for this spell is too overpowering, what about having it allow one spell to get off unresisted - make it a level 60 2AA point skill that will alow the next cast spell to land unresisted - this would even increase the value of multiple shamans on raids - one for unresisted slow, one for unresisted debuff, one for unresisted cripple etc.<br />
<br />
Just a thought but I think it would be a nice twist to our abilities.</div></div><hr />
