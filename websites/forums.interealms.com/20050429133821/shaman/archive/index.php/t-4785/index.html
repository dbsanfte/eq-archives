<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>phileepae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last time i tried to use a new UI, i had it already installed, but i couldn't log in because of that stupid new compass thing.  I had to take off my new installed UI so i could get into the game, but I was just wondering if there was a way to take off the compass before I log into the game so it doesn't always appear when i log in, only when i want it to, yah know?  Another thing is i'm wondering if the compass is effecting anyone else, and if they have made UI's that are compadable with it.  Thanks and sorry for not posting a new UI here, just seeking out some help.</div></div><hr />
