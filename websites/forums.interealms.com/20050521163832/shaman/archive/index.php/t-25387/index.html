<br />
Does anyone else agree that the graphic for the Shaman epic should have been the one that the Beastlords ended up with?<br />
<br />
Seriously..... why did we get the Lion-cycle™ instead of the tribal looking Beastlord stick?  The 1.0 looks so freaking pimp, the second looks out of place.<br />
<br />
I could be wrong, please share your thoughts.</div></div><hr />

to be honest i am happy to have a good weapon=)<br />
<br />
and the BST looks like a totem pole!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Fiery Spear &gt; All.<br />
<br />
We shoulda gotten a spear, and the druids shoulda gotten a scim again.<br />
<br />
Edit: Better yet give druids an elf shoe! they deserve it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>leibeast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ELF SHOE!   lol<br />
<br />
gawd i love that! My druid might even get her epic if it wer an elf shoe!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree that out epic 1.5 looks like crap, would have been nice to get a modified spear instead of a lions head on a stick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>leibeast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i would like to see a 2.0, has anyone sloved it yet? the lion goes well with my vah shir, but the main thing for me is that when forced to, i can finally melee in a worthwile mannor, before with the spear i just tickeled thinngs...slowly. I can still grab it for manaless dot if needed, but all in all 1.5 is a greatly improved weapon.<br />
<br />
the graphics arent a huge factor for me, i never see it=)<br />
<br />
as long as the mobs FEEL it i am a happy cat!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think every 2.0 has been solved except ours, actually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I still think it's as ugly as I did when the photograph was posted on SOE's site. We should have gotten another spear, or barring that, a nifty shield so folks could have TA's equipped as well. Read this old thread (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=23911) to see what people thought when it came out. There are actually some funny comments in there (like one about the lion-head dildo). I do have to admit — looks aside, it's one of my best pieces of gear and something I won't replace for a good, long time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>jeyche Deychundei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">being a Vah shir shaman i think it suits me... but seeing a barb or a troll wielding it does make it look a little out of place... maybe one type per race would of been better.<br />
<br />
but atleast we didnt get the Ivory rod of the Druids *shudders* and the Beastlords looks aweful</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I would much prefer a spiked club look like Sharkspine Club or Illuminati Hammer, myself. As a troll, I would like my equipment to be somewhat &quot;in character&quot;. Thats why I have a drogmar instead of a horse, thats why my chain BP looks all ratty, etc etc. <br />
<br />
Epic 1.0 kinda fit everyone, but 1.5 is very non-troll. I would love to see SOE implement even further individually by offering options on certain things, Epic graphic being one (helm choices being another). I mean, we already have armor dye, facial options, titles, etc etc. Why not offer a couple choices for Epic graphics?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Virulence</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The shaman epic looks like crap. (imo) It is far and away the least appealing of the new epics. (again, just my opinion)<br />
<br />
It's not as though this will be changed however. Even before it was put into the game there was a lot of feedback here about how ugly the 1.5 was and they still put it in.<br />
<br />
A lot of times when I'm just running around in PoK or wherever, I equip the 1.0 because it looks bad ass even though it's pretty common.<br />
<br />
The stats and even the effects I can't argue with, but the thing looks like ass. Someday though I hope to get a TA and I'll probably bag the 1.5 90% of the time anyway regardless of the stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well, whatever. Lion is my power animal, and I'm happy to have him on my catstick. 8P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The 1.5 is a good item.  I won't argue that at all.<br />
<br />
It looks out of place though.... too bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well, whatever. Lion is my power animal, and I'm happy to have him on my catstick. 8P<br />
<br />
I still think it's a bear's head framed in fur.  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>redribbit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I guess it growls when you cast the HoT.... and glows with 2.0, I think when it glows it will have a greater effect..... but I'm not going through another long quest for minimal reward.... too much stress i tell ya. the 1.5 was great for the amount of work it took and looks aside the stats and effects are fantastic. There could definitely be worse epics btw :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>leibeast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">it growls? hehe!<br />
<br />
i use it when there are adds, so i never *hear* it!<br />
<br />
yes there are definatley worse epics (see paladin) how many pallies do you know that bothered with 1.0?</div></div><hr />

Heh, for the record, Pally Epic 1.0 was also called Firey Avenger, and at the time it was in the game, it was the ONLY epic. <br />
<br />
Still kinda proud that I had the first one on my sever (along wiht 2 other  Pallys, we all did the final turn in on Pegasus Isle in Sky at the same time) and something like the 9th or 10th in all of EQ. <br />
<br />
Then, a couple months later, Kunark came out, a Polymorph Axe dropped off a zoneline trash dog in KC, a couple other events (uber guild related) happened, and I abandoned the pally, and the uber guild, forever. Cest la vi.</div></div><hr />
