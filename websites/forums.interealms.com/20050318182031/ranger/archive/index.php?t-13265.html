<br />
After spending time killing in Crypt of Decay and Halls of Honor, I tested this out again.  Everytime the mob was right next to the wall, I was still able to hit it.  Had my guildmates try to push mob into the wall and stuff and still able to shoot the MOB.<br />
<br />
It looks like the MOBs do not get pushed far enough into the walls to where it messes up Archery.  Or the walls are coded differently with this expansion.<br />
<br />
Grummus was also another Mini-boss? (PoD) where I found him in the walls on every fight, but was still able to shoot him with TS.<br />
<br />
Anyone else experiencing this nice new Archery in POP?  Only thing that's stopping me from shooting the mob now is my guild/groupmates who are in my LOS and the Above/Below doodoo.<br />
<br />
How bout removing Friendly Fire, this would make those guys get outta our way of the arrows :D  J/K</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dauvan</div><div class="date">11-04-2002, 06:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">actually, i was doing some root/archery in PoN last week and I noticed something.  In old world(luclin and farther back) If you shoot a mob you don't get a message until the arrow  hits its target(shoot a mob from way far away see how long it takes to get damge message).  In PoN I was off a good distance and was getting damage reports soon as I clicked range attack.  <br />
<br />
  So it seems its its calculating damage soon as you press attack, another way to test this is to put a mob infront of the mob your shooting.  In old world the arrow hits the mob int he front, in PoP(i only did this once) it hits the mob you have targetted.  Or am I imagining thngs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leiker</div><div class="date">11-04-2002, 07:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am sure you are imagining things :)<br />
<br />
<br />
I am still having delay on damage message, I get it on impact - noticed this alot in PoN last night, as I pulled from very far and had to wait to see if I hit it, or had to move abit to try again.<br />
<br />
<br />
And, I also nearly got the Enchanter killed yesterday in PoN since I broke a mess during a fight, where the Pally tank fought his mob inside 2 messed mobs - and one of my arrows hit one of the messed ones.<br />
<br />
<br />
The thing about walls being coded slightly differently may have happened though, as I remember a few days ago thinking, oh well - never gonna hit this one since it was in a wall...but I did. This was outdoors though, and the wall was inside a cave - which in general seems to behave strangely :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Reandn</div><div class="date">11-04-2002, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I never shoot my bow into a group of mezzed mobs.  I don't think anything has changed about that in POP, as I was in a mass melee/train using my bow by shooting into a group (unmezzed) mobs, and frequently hit some one other than the one I was aiming at.<br />
<br />
So, ask your group to move the target mobs off the mezzed ones if it is feasible, and don't shoot into them if you don't have a clear shot.<br />
<br />
I actually like this aspect of archery, as it is realistic -- the part about not being able to hit mobs who have their toe in a wall I *don't* like though ;-(  I can't confirm if that has changed in POP or not.  But it is true that in outdoor zones &quot;some buildings aren't really buildings&quot;. Maybe that is what is going on.<br />
<br />
I killed the enchanter in my group with a single keystroke the other day.  Fighting two big level 60 robot mob things in Plane of Innovation, and the MA must have briefly had the one that eventually got mezzed targetted.  This is normal, and generally I try to re-assist when it's clear he's got his target picked.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I must not have re-assisted, or there was a delay or something.  Because I shot ONE arrow and it went whizzing off at an angle to the OTHER big robot, broke mez, and he came and pummelled the enchanter to the ground even as I was typing &quot;oops&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be nice to me, mister enchanter.  One little keystroke from me and you DIE!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Actually it was very embarrassing at the time and I'll be extra careful not to let that happen in future ;-/  I don't want archery to get a bad rep from stuff like this (it would never happened if I was meleeing, since the mobs were not near each other and there is no way I could have been facing one in melee range and hit the other).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solonaro</div><div class="date">11-04-2002, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is definitely still a delay with archery.  It's easy to notice if you have a proc on your weapon, because procs go off instantly upon hitting the button, but regular damage messages take a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gwindor</div><div class="date">11-04-2002, 06:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been able to hit stuff stuck in the walls in PoJ. However, I can also cast through the walls in PoJ (I've been landing snares from behind closed doors in cell rooms on creatures inc) so i think it's the walls which are coded differently in this case. In umbral (where i did a lot of my grinding) walls are still obstructing my shots unless I use one of the wall tricks so it's not archery code which has changed in PoP, rather (I believe) wall code.<br />
