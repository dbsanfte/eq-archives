The country of Brazil is going to to sue &lt;a href=&quot;http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/story/0,7493,681296,00.html&quot;&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/a&gt; over an episode aired a couple of weeks ago.</div></div><hr />

My guess is there is some corruption problems down there and they are trying to destract attention away from themselves by making Fox a scapegoat of some sort.<br />
<br />
Note at the end that the mayor considered sueing a weatherman for being off on his forecast... like I said desperate for money.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't count how many times a flaming meteor has caused untold panic in MY town, yet destroyed only the shelter designed to protrect us from it.<br />
<br />
How many times have YOU been hired by an evil genius to work at his super-secret plant?<br />
<br />
And when George and Barbara Bush moved in across the street from me, my dad acted JUST like Homer.<br />
<br />
Fiction and farce are NOT slanderous, or defamatory. They are humor. Laugh at them, OK?</div></div><hr />
