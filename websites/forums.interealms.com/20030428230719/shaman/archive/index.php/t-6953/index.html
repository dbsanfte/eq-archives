<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Couldn't agree with you more Ineluk.  Problem is some people think then speak.  Others reverse the order.  In any case, go check the original post or send me a private message.  Happy to help you out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ineluk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">for those who are curious who i am talking about ... its Harvyst ...<br />
<br />
you can add me to your ignore list too you ignorant ****</div></div><hr />

And I hope you think of this the next time you pirate a game - that studio you stole that game from may go under next month because of you.<br />

Today it's Ea Studios. In 1995, it was Sierra Yosemite. But it's always the same cause... Lori and Cori Cole, we miss you, we miss QFG....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmm, so that is what they are talking about, didn't get it the first time that I checked, but now that I see Harvyst's reply, I believe that he speaks the truth. hmmmmmm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ineluk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">are you just retarded or what problem do you have?<br />
<br />
noone is pirating a game here its all about having a friend buy an EXTRA copy because you cannot get the game in europe yet <br />
the companie receives the same benefit from it when you buy it urself... <br />
<br />
how about you spend your next money on soem brain sir?</div></div><hr />

Dude you need to get a clue. No one is supporting or even sugguest that people pirate the game. We have numerous people in my guild that are doing this and it hasn't cost verant a single sale. YOU NEED A REG CODE. You can download and install the files all you want and with out a reg code it does you absolutely no good. Providing a way for our euro friends to install the software and use the reg code they purchased is not piracy. If you can't understand this concept it's no wonder your company had problems and went under and i doubt it was because of piracy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">wait, what?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Wait, from what little true content this thread has, is this the basic scenario?<br />
<br />
Person A bought copies for guildies and friends overseas.<br />
--  Person A it is hosting the CD content on a site so they can download the software and install Pop.<br />
--  Person A is providing the account keys for the software that's been legally purchased, but hasn't gone through the export rigamarole that increases the price and nets 2 other companies and other governments shares of the inflated price.<br />
--  Folks are paying him back for the costs of the software.<br />
--  Harvyst is being obnoxious about this.<br />
--  Others are venting here inappropriately over this whole affair?<br />
<br />
For the record, if the copies are legally obtained in the US, there's no piracy or copyright violation.  Also, if he's not doing it for profit, there may be no export violation.  Welcome to the murky world of intellectual property distribution. <br />
<br />
The folks not seeing income from this are the shipping company, UbiSoft's overseas distribution folk, and the EEU's tax folk.<br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
Edit:  Still not sure this is the scenario.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Keldain Silvermyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">-- Violating copyright and international software laws.<br />
<br />
But then...legal matters don't seem to impress people around here...After all, they say you may not reproduce or redistribute their software, keys, etc, in any manner...But then, we don't care about these little things, do we...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ineluk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">omg i am goin to explode....<br />
<br />
THIS IS NOT VIOLATING ANNNY COPYRIGHT<br />
<br />
for one reason ..  you are buying the rights to use something... ( the person getting you the CD key gets those rights for you)<br />
<br />
If you download the software after buing the rights to use it is as legal as a backup copy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Keldain Silvermyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Read your Terms of Service and EULA again, Einstein...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zenyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">so let me get this straight, ineluk is having a bought copy of the game sent to him via postal mail, and someone is throwing a fit.<br />
<br />
tell me this isn't true.<br />
<br />
edit: ok to quick, or did he download the game and have someone purchase the game to send him a cd key?  or is the cd key cracked?  Which I doubt EQ would let crack cd key's get through?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Intellectual Property being one of my main concerns, here are some notes:<br />
<br />
EULAs have been found in several states to be non-binding.  They're not an agreement, they're a non-binding statement of intent, disclaimer, content warning, and iteration of copyright concerns.  In particular,  Microsoft EULAs have been gunned down.   US copyright  rights and &quot;violent or inappropriate content warnings&quot; are the cornerstone of the EULAs presence.<br />
<br />
Yes, I know there's a little &quot;agree&quot; button.  Just hear me out; I don't care about this either way, just want to make sure folks bitch and whine intelligently for a change.<br />
<br />
Say Joe lives in NYC, and John lives in Sheepdip, MT.<br />
<br />
If Joe buys a copy of a game, copies it electronically or on fixed medium, then re-destributes several copies, that's illegal.<br />
<br />
If Joe buys ONE copy of a game, and transmits THAT copy of the game to John, it's legal if and only if he does not keep a copy for himself.<br />
<br />
As EQ doesn't seem to have 64-bit or higher encryption, it doesn't seem governed by most of the software export acts.  Exporting intellectual property is something of a quagmire, I'm generally concerned with books and print.<br />
<br />
So, as long as there's one copy purchased for every copy transmitted, there's no copyright violation.  Like I said, I'm unsure of the export laws.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">This thread is gay.<br />
People who don't understand that Euros can't get PoP in their own stores at this time are stupid and myopic.<br />
It's not a hard concept.  Euro_01 has American_Friend_01 buy extra copy of PoP and send it to them in Europe.  Before American_Friend_01 sends the copy tho, they open it and copy down the registration key which they send over email or whatever to Euro_01.  Now Euro_01 downloads the CD files which are posted already so he/she can install PoP.  Then Euro_01 types in their registration key and starts playing PoP.  <br />
<br />
I see nothing illegal about this.  Nothing whatsoever.  Sony still gets their full cut.  So how exactly is this illegal?  Some of you guys seem a bit slow on the uptake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Xalbus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Just a question for the ignorant Ogre (me) <br />
<br />
Does the european player require a DIFFERENT  EQ from the rest of us. similar to PAL and the difference in wattage etc. I mean is there a whole different set of programing required to play this game outside of North America?<br />
<br />
I cant see why this would be since people are DLing US released files over the internet.<br />
<br />
question 2<br />
<br />
Is EBworld not shipping overseas, or Amazon.com for that matter? <br />
<br />
***EDIT*** course my german is rusty but I found it on Amazon.de I have no idea if they are NOT shipping it but what lil german I know I can kind of decipher that its availible to order now. Now if you can not order it online for some reason (no credit card etc) well thats not something anyone can help you with****<br />
<br />
if the answer to question 1 is no and question 2 is no then I dont see the problem with purchasing this through an online provider. It might take a few days to get but youll still get it<br />
<br />
now as I said I DONT know the answer's to the questions<br />
<br />
I know that what is being proposed is very grey area and I understand the Crucible's reluctance to allow the post.</div></div><hr />
