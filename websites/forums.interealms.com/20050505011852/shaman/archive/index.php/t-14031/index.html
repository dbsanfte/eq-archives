<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Korsib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I just hit 51 last night, and after I reinforce the lvl, I was wondering what a good percentage is to put into AA.  Also, a question about what AA is good to get.  Run 3 seems like a must, but I was also wondering about Innate Regen/Metabolism, I've heard that regen is alright starting out, but that later, it doesn't really matter too much.  I've also heard some people on the serverwide chat talking about that since mounts eat up lots of food and water, it is nice to get metabolism, espeically if I am going to use stat food.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">get to 60, do run3, your choice of regen or metabolism (they're both okay), mental clarity3, canni5, get to 65, continue AA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wulfson Soulforger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">First thing to remember is 60 is greater than all but 61+.<br />
<br />
If you feel you must bleed off aa's, get run 1 (you can outrun most old world mobs, and with run3 all but a few) then get to 54.  Then get regen 1 and then get to 58.  From there, just get run 3 and then 60.  If you are going to be hunting in PoP, you can burn thru an aa in a few hrs with a good grp.  Do NOT do more than 6aa fore 60 as it is just wasting your xps that you deparately need for 60.  At 60, you can pal around and soak up the next 18aa's or so afore you venture out into the abysmally nerfed zones for xps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Farenheit_Eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">personally, I'd grind out Run 3 then turn aa's off until your 60+...Then go 80 reg xp and 20 AA's because in most pop zones the aa's at 20 percent will still build faster than your xp at 80 percent. <br />
<br />
Shaman with AA's still &lt; A shaman that is 60+... Think about it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Loopi Loo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I wouldn't even worry about run 3. Levels &gt; AAs imho. <br />
<br />
Yes, canni5 is nice, but it is still possible to get 65 without it. Thats the way I did it at least. :D <br />
<br />
And besides, unless you have a steady group of friends that you exp with all the time, higher levels will get you more pick up groups too.<br />
<br />
Now don't get me wrong, AAs do make a HUGE difference, anyone who has had the chance of grouping with someone with 100+ AA can obviously see that they are better hands down than someone with no AA. But because we are offensive casters generally speaking, and our resistance is checked against the mob lvl, I still have to say that for shamen, levels &gt; AAs.<br />
<br />
The only situation that I would consider AAs is if you really are not interested in the 60+ end game, which is understandable. In that case, I'd just go all out AA, get everything your heart desires, then come back to leveling when you feel like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I wouldnt stop, alot of the best XP spots now are outdoor anyway.  If your going to stop anywhere do it at 60.  60-62 range is the best for catching up on your aa's.  PoV in those level ranges can net you an AA easily in a couple hours or less even.  At that rate depending on your play time it shouldnt take you more than 2-3 weeks to get yourself Can5.  After that I would go back to XP and go to 65.  Ofcourse in those 2-3 weeks you could be level 65 and your probably not saving any time really but you will be more useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I followed the then-prevailing wisdom and got Run3, but I can't say that it's been that useful.  I might go for Run1 and then move on for a while, Run1 still lets you outrun a fair number of mobs but only costs 1 AA.<br />
<br />
If I had to do it again I'd spend my 6 base AA's on Run1, Regen3, Wis2 or possibly Sta2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">run 1 and then get 60. run 1 helps so much if you're indoors and just need to run. I got baron at 57 just because I turn on 100% AA xp on raids/farming crap(time when I would get little to no normal exp). and I guess it just added up lol. I went regen and run 3, though now that I have a lizard I would have gone run2 regen2 and metab2, but I wont go back to basic AAs for a LONG time.</div></div><hr />
