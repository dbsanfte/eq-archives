or PoV</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>shooteneq1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">simple, you cant.<br />
<br />
trials is the only way to access these 2 zones. it really sux that pop has such limited content for the lvl 50ish people but thats just the way it is, aside from that lvl54 anythign would get chewed to peices in poV or PoS as every mob there hits for 400+ and most around 600+ and most mobs have rouhgly 32k HP. all in all its not a friendly place for people still in their 50s, hell not very friendly to people in 60s. <br />
<br />
i still think there arnt enough zones for the people in their 50s and that pop is geared almost exclusivly towards the 1-3 top guilds on servers and almost everyone else wont ever see more than 50% of the zones there if that many. a waste imo, it sux that almost ever single zone you have to do some kind of a quest or trial to get into it and those quests and trials are by no means easy. if i was still in my 50s and bought pop i have to say ide be highly dissapointed and would feel it was a total waste of money<br />

  The &quot;easier&quot; routes still involve at least one group for the tier3 planes as well.</div></div><hr />

Wow ok.  lets see if thats true:<br />
<br />
Old world: SolB, Guk<br />
<br />
Kunark: KC, Seb, HS, CoM, Chardok, BW, skyfire<br />
<br />
Velious: Velks, Kael, Icewell, WL, CS, SG, WW, DN<br />
<br />
Luclin: Acrylia, Akheva, ME, Umbral, DSP, Ssra, FG, Grey, Greigs, Seru, Katta<br />
<br />
Hmm.  Maybe you meant that theres plenty of xp zones for players in their 50s?</div></div><hr />

A little harsh.. the xp you can get in the three zones you can access at first makes it worth it IMHO.  I can spend a few hours in Velks and grind about 2 blue, or spend the time in PoD, PoI, or PoN and get at least twice that.   Plus the instant (and free) travel is a huge plus.  No group in Velks? I can get over to Seb or the Hole in a few minutes, no more trying to find a druid or wizzy to get anywhere, and spending plat to do it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jeryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Let's see... so far I've had fun playing in Innovation, Disease, Nightmare, and Justice. Gained a couple levels since the expansion came out that would have bored me to death prior to PoP exp rates. Haven't even bothered trying to get flagged for anything other than PoNb (hedge event). Turned in a couple parchments in Knowledge, gotten a couple neat spells I'll probably be able to use within a month or so. Used pedestals to get all over the place reallyreallyquick. Gotten a few neato drops, including new bow yay (twisted longbow)!<br />
<br />
I paid less for the PoP expansion than I put into trying out Dark Age of Camelot and Anarchy Online for a few months apiece, and I've had more fun with it. It's worth it for me :) The other zones can come later.<br />
<br />
By the way if you're wanting to get out of the aforementioned zones, maybe try out something like the alternate route into Crypt of Decay in PoD.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Paluwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hi, PoP is an expansion...Expansions are generally intended to give more content to players who have already completed the previous content. SoE has almost always thrown in a ton of extra content for those who like to skip over entire expansions, power to max level &amp; camp the higher xp zones. EQ has a long history of this as everyone knows &amp; in my opinion it's nice to see SoE go for a more &quot;true&quot; expansion.<br />
<br />
    Go ahead say to yourself &quot;well sure he's in AL so that's why he says that&quot;, it has nothing to do with it. If you find PoP is too much for you to handle it is because you haven't achieved the things EQ layed out to prepare you for it. SoE even went as far as to ease the encounters pre-PoP to make them more doable for the average guild/player base.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lauralei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">so basically what your saying is that paying $25 real dollars is worth 4 zones with a little better XP and easier travel for the casual lvl 50ish player? maybe to some people i guess but not in my book  <br />
<br />
Yes. <br />
<br />
The worst part of the game is grinding and time sinks.  Especially for us more casual players.  You downplay just how much better the xp is in PoP than old world.  If I want to grind, then at least they have given the option of gaining xp at much faster rates than before, and in a more challenging environment.  They have also made travel (another time sink, I mean how dangerous is the run from Freeport to Qeynos at lvl 50+?) much easier.<br />
<br />
By Xp'ing in PoP it opens the ability for people to gain access to the content in old world areas that they would have had to grind for hours more to gain access to.  I spent a couple hours grinding in LCY in PoD the other night with friends, just xp'ing.  I left about 25% more into 58 than I came in with.  I could have spend the same time in Velks and fallen asleep doing so, and gained about 4% xp.  I don't care that I am not flagged for tier two content - I'm very happy with what I have access to at the moment.    To me the time saved in many areas is worth the $25.  Heck if you want to justify the money, you can now go work more in the time you saved, to make that $25.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bindamel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm going to guess that a lot of people (including myself) spent the $25 and have no characters above 46.  I spent $25 for one zone, at least for now.  <br />
<br />
I haven't paid for a port since. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zelgadis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I paid however much PoP cost and got more than 4 zones... /boggle  I've seen lots of people in uncapable or less than capable guilds or no guild at all running around the higher tier zones.  By the sound of the folks who aren't happy with PoP, why not go back and complain about, I dunno... Kunark Veeshan's Peak, or Velious Sleepers Tomb, or Luclin Vex Thal.<br />
<br />
Now for my special quote of the day - Everquest: Planes of Power is like Mario 64 for the NIntendo 64.  You start out with a few spots to run around in, and then eventually after some good working around the game you can explore much more freely after you've unlocked things.  The only difference (that I can bring to mind now) is in Everquest you need to work with other people to unlock new areas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gean Soul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Zelgadis. you got name from &quot;Slayers&quot; ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zelgadis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yeah, my more favorable anime series... which I keep getting lost on with which episode tape I should buy next in line... because by the time I had enough money to buy more of the series they had already released 7 or so more.  I dunno, maybe now that I have a steady job and some income of money I can track down and buy the whole series on DVD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Epiphany EQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It was worth the $25 to me to be able to get around all by myself without having to constantly beg for ports.<br />
<br />
That said, yes I'm a little disappointed with this expansion.  The high-level, non-uber game on my server was entirely too crowded pre-PoP.  There are probably 20 or 30 guilds on my server that fit that description with another 2 or so that actually rate uber status.  By high-level I mean average level of 55+, and by non-uber I mean haven't gotten into VT and have no plans of ever even trying.<br />
<br />
Instead of spreading those 20 or 30 guilds out among the new content and the old, PoP has squeezed us into a small handful of the new zones.  Nobody bothers with the old zones much anymore because they have turned green.  And we aren't uber enough to get into more than a few of the new PoP zones.  So those 2 uber guilds got a great expansion with tons of new zones to explore without the rest of us bothering them.  The rest of us got shafted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>lotholeaffall2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If you have PoP and go to Sebilis, Velks, or the Hole, you do feel like you are missing a bit on the xp side. That's too bad really, since I have more fun on those old zones than in doing PoI/PoD/PoN yard trash.</div></div><hr />

I'm level 40, and it's been worth it to me so far.. And I've paid 29,99 PLUS 9,99 shipping PLUS an additional 22,- import tax.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bahladur Eahrendil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">PoP is great so far. The first tier has been really fun, plus the ease of travel and raid functionality were worth it alone. I'm flagged for PoV and PoS, but haven't done anything there since I'm waiting for more people in my guild to get flagged.<br />
<br />
There's plenty of zones for 50ish players. I'm pretty sure PoP was intended for 55+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Dranex Tical</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I bought PoP FOR PoK and the books.<br />
<br />
All those extra zones were just neat freebies thrown in to me.<br />
<br />
If the expansion came out and all it was was the books and PoK, I STILL woulda bought it :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Jalim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I agree that PoP was worth it. It can be frustrating at times for me though as well. Basicly the old places that a lot of folks used to go to for grinding are empty, Velks, Seb, etc. Now the new-and-improved grinding zones PoN,PoI,PoD,PoJ are the ones that are full. Makes me wish they would release another expansion right now so it would free up the tier 1 PoP zones a bit :D<br />
