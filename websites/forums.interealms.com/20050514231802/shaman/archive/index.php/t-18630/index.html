<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aniha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hopefully not treading covered ground- tried searching forum &amp; web and couldnt find much on this.<br />
<br />
What do you guys do to keep track of buffs wearing off? I would like to keep my party fully buffed without them noticing something is wearing off and asking for it. For example, I may want to keep FA on the MT, haste on all Melees, and then the usual buffs on most/all of the party (STA, Focus, Bihli...).<br />
<br />
I can use my pet/myself as a timer by casting a buff on me and seeing when it wears off - but often I will still get tells from folks who see the same thing (buff wearing off) before I can cast. Also, we may be in the middle of pull/fight such that it may take a sec for me to get to. Plus, some buffs like FA don't seem to be made for this heh.<br />
<br />
Are there any GOOD tools out there that help you track your buffs and when they will wear off? I tried one called EQSpellTimer but it didn't seem to do much for me. <br />
<br />
So I guess the real question is what is good Shaman practice?<br />
A) Let the party tell me when buffs wear off.<br />
B) Set a timer for FA, use my pet/self for all other buff warnings.<br />
C) Get a tool to warn me BEFORE buffs start wearing off<br />
D) You worry too much - just slow the bastards the buffs will take care of themselves.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance and all the great advice on this board. <br />

<br />
I'm no ones buff whore, if they want buffs they can tell me when they're fading and I'll rebuff before it does.<br />
This specially goes for FA :)<br />
<br />
edit: I use the stopwatch on my mobile to time slows :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>TPFKAFaern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Some people use actual physical timers (cooking clocks, watches, et al) to keep track of buffs. Personally I use either myself or what I call the &quot;whiny melee method.&quot; There was a discussion on this over on CR, specifically the Enchanter boards re Mez. <br />
<br />
My best advice is to buff yourself FIRST then hit the melees. Now, this leads to the &quot;impatient DOMINO whiny melee effect&quot; which I'll describe below:<br />
<br />
/Your_SELF_BUFF_wears_off<br />
/you slow 4 MOBs, root 3 others. Heal 2 people, saving both from death. Pause for a WHOLE nano-second<br />
/g WM_01: Haste down<br />
One pico-second later<br />
/g WM_02: Same<br />
Less than one pico-second later<br />
/g WM_03: Me too<br />
/g Wise Shaman_Bear: You are all on the same timer.<br />
/g WM_01_03: ??? Timer???<br />
<br />
My best advice?  Patience. A slooooow fuse. You've already alluded to using yourself or Jobarer as an alarm. I second that. Although Jobarer is usually too busy answering SOW requests to complain if he isn't fully buffed.<br />
<br />

<br />
This is great for setting up buff timers and DoT Timers.<br />
<br />
I'll usually cast haste on my dog first so I'll have the timer and the dog to let me know about it dropping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Raids and LDoN is pretty much all I do these days.<br />
<br />
Raid buffs from me consist of Focus of the 7th and CHA on Warriors and others who need it.<br />
<br />
I MGB 7th, and just refresh 7th when the timer allows me too.  CHA I refresh on the same people I cast it on about every 40 minutes, or when I rebuff them if they take a dirt nap.<br />
<br />
The other buffs people ask me for if they want them, such as the odd STA or Bhi'Li buff. <br />
<br />
Also, I never buff from seeing a request in raid chat, unless it's a special case such as the puller needing a buff. <br />
<br />
If someone needs a buff, generally I respond to tells only. I try to buff people that have died without needing a tell from them if I see them after they are ressed.</div></div><hr />

Honestly i think it means Charisma, but i cant put my mind around it. is it for the bards and enchanters? do you group buff it as a &quot;Take that SOE, i am gonna use this spell.&quot; or &quot;You will have a buff slot taken by charisma and LIKE IT, random ranger 01&quot; I guess it a high end thing.<br />

Sorry, I can't provide the links to the CHA/DI study, but they are out there somewhere.<br />
<br />
I also only respond to /tells, unless I notice the freshly rez'd person and ninja buff them.  I'll let my shaman pals on raid know I'm buffing somebody via a hotkey, so they don't ninja buff the same person.</div></div><hr />

It's CHARM, baby!   :D   No, it's really charisma, but I always think &quot;charm&quot; when I see CHA.  And dammit, shamans are charming!  Who doesn't melt when they see a sweet troll face?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well I just recently found program that has been out there for a long time called EQ Watcher.  I am still in the process of configuring it to my tastes but I do say its VERY handy.  <br />
<br />
Eq Watcher (http://nielsen-woodwinds.com/eqwatcher/nuke/html/index.php)  basicly is kinda like a log parcer but reads your Log file on the fly.  So any thing that gets sent to your log file it can read.  Based on what it sees it can give you audio feed back.  What the really nice part is that when your buffs land on your target it Places a timer takeing into concideration the length of time your buffs last WITH aa and fucus items and then gives you count down notifcations based on how soon till the buff wears of based oh your desires.  Love getting those 5 mins warning on the long buffs just before they wear off.  I've found I have buffs not dropping near so often as I just dont have the mana to get them up as I though I had more time till they dropped.  Handy having it say when you get interupted or when the spell lands as well.  It does take some configuring though but once you get it where you want it really is very handy.<br />
<br />
If you want to go check it out goto EQ Watcher (http://nielsen-woodwinds.com/eqwatcher/nuke/html/index.php).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've developed an internal haste timer.  If I happen to have a long play time in one sitting, I know seemingly to the second when haste will drop.  Unfortunately, I also know that someone will tell me haste is dropping seconds after I tell the group I'm rehasting.<br />
Sometimes, when I'm sleeping, the haste timer in my head goes off.  I wake up screaming.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lol, I've also developed that sense. I use my pet for things like haste, but, I find that I have a feel for when the expiration time is immenent. I also agree that people whining because buffs have gone down when your in the middle of slowing a whole pack of mobs is very annoying. I've gotten in the habit of saying &quot;haste inc&quot; or something similar for the other spells we cast repetitively. That way they at least know I'm aware of the fact that they need to be rebuffed. Of course, you still get those who incessantly ask and ask again even after I've given the message, and am in the middle of slowing a whole pack of mobs.  :rolleyes: <br />
I just got my ornate BP today, so that haste is gonna be a lot less painful to cast.  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">FA has always been problematic for me to keep up. I'm usually doing pretty good with it for a while, then I get one time when I get very busy and I don't notice it drop of dog so I then have no clue who has it anymore when I do get back to it again.<br />
<br />
I've used EQwatcher as well. The only problem I have run into is that clearing the timers does not seem to work properly.  This usually isn't a problem until somebody dies in which case I just go out unload/relead the buff module. I also like the other verbal warnings it gives you like mobs gating, resists, interrupts, and invis dropping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">With FA, I usually pick my people, depending on what other shammies are around, and then just go alpha by players and recast everytime the icon refreshes.  I can usually squeeze about 11 people into my cycle with no complaints.<br />

Other buffs/dets I just refresh when asked, on the newly rezzed, and when I get that itchy feeling. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hail,With FA, I usually pick my people, depending on what other shammies are around, and then just go alpha by players and recast everytime the icon refreshes.

How the heck do you keep 11 people in an FA cycle?<br />
With SCRM &amp; 8th shawl, FA lasts just over 11 min.  With the cast time involved, I would be amazed if you could continuously keep it on 10 people with FA.  I generally refuse to take responsibility for more than 6, because even if the gem is available I'm usually too darn busy to do more than that reliably.  I'll hit extras if I have time, but no promises.<br />
<br />
Unless you are just a FA BOT, I can't see keeping it up on 11 people consistently.  Heavy melee LDoN groups (4 melee+2 or 3 pets+healer+me) are a pain in the neck as it is just because I'm so busy slowing chain pulls (or acting as chain-puller myself).<br />
<br />
The TimerUI link was excellent, thanks for providing it.  Is EQwatcher approved for use with regards to the EULA btw?<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">EQ Watcher does nothing more then read the log file that EQ makes.  It then either reads back an audio message or plays a wave file.  It will also set a timer up so that it will play a audio message a set amount of time in the future after finding certain text newly created in the log file like &quot;XXX mob slowed&quot;  Its not fail proof but the basic set up you are provided covers most of the standard spells and such.  The program was created so tht it in no way is able to affect the game in any way so is not band by the EULA any more then UI Timers.  There is a TON of stuff the program can do though if you are the type that likes tweeking things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shazgok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Thanks for that UI Timer, that is the perfect tool I've been looking for but was afraid to ask. (I set it to replace my Selector window, since I hate that window and never use it.)<br />
<br />
It is an awesome tool. I'll never be caught by surprise again, blowing all my mana on refreshing unexpected buffs. :) A great tool for visualizing your buff cycles and keeping them nicely staggered.<br />
<br />
The only problem with it is if that site ever goes down, I'll be lost without it. I hope they come up with an offline version of the xml generator.</div></div><hr />

hehe..before I hit the 60's and started getting group buffs my internal timer was the following.<br />
<br />
&quot;OMG! I'm suddenly full mana?? OMG! It must be buff time :(&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">That UI Timer is essential if you like keeping up FA on as many as you can on raids and groups.  What I do is start my FA rotation at the top of the FA cycle list in raid, and set the UI timer to zero when I hit the top guy with FA.  I hit the next guy on the list whenever FA pops (or when i get around to it), but in any event go back to the top guy when the UI timer comes fully around again.  I set the FA timer for 10:45, because that is the FA duration with SCRM + EE4, so the first guy is wearing off when the timer comes around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>khazmun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">In LDoN I've usually been using the time left on adventure to manage haste.  Just pop up the adventure window and it acts like a little timer for you.  Not the best system but it gets me by in a pinch.  Since BattleAxe posted that UI timer though I think I'm gonna get me some of them, looks pretty nice.  Thanks for posting that BattleAxe :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">In groups I just let people shout at me for buffs, usually get most stuff before it wears off.<br />
<br />
I made a customised UI timer for raiding from  here (http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/customize.asp).<br />
<br />
I basically use a 6m30s for slow, then a 1 hour/2hour bar for timing other stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Was curious how you all used that timer linker earlier....after I loaded it I realized that you have no control over it. You can't start it, stop, reset it or pause it. So basically, you have to remember the location on the bar when you cast the buff (I would think waiting to cast a buff at the beginning of a timer is not feasible). To me, if you have to keep track of each buff, and where on the bar the timer was, you might as well go write it the hell down on a piece of paper lol. <br />
<br />
I thought you could use the sliders to mark the location when you cast a buff, but when the timer is done and begins to start again, the amount of time the timer will last changes depending on the location of the slider, so that idea is out of the question.<br />
<br />
Just curious as to what you all do....thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">You place the mark when you cast the spell, it takes the duration of the timer you created to again reach the location you placed the mark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Aniha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Thanks everyone. Still working on getting watcher to run correctly, but the UI timer is very handy. Thanks for the constructive discussion. =)<br />

<br />
It really isn't that hard for me to just recast FA everytime it pops and the minute downtime lets me do all that other shaman crap.  Trust me, I dont aim to always be doing FA for 11 during a raid, but I often do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Bloxr Fatso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Only thing I've ever used a timer for was for malosinias on mezzed and TMed mobs (and slow on those) during the Rathe Council... besides that a shaman should be able to reslow, or have people tell them when a buff fades and stuff...<br />
<br />
People cast FA on like... multiple people on raids?  Damn, I'm a slacker.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">You place the mark when you cast the spell, it takes the duration of the timer you created to again reach the location you placed the mark.<br />
<br />
That won't work though, because a feature of the program is that you don't need to reconfigure it for spell duration changes. By moving the slider, you alter the duration of one cycle. For example, if your sowing, and you cast it at the middle point in the bar, and then move the slider to the halfway point, when it gets to the end of the bar and restarts, the new full bar will now only last 18 minutes, because the slider is in the middle, it then cuts the duration in half, meaning it will get back to the middle in 9 minutes, instead of another 18. I'm pretty sure this is how it works, because I tested it with a one minute timer - I moved the bar to the middle, next cycle was 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
<br />
I used it for first time today for a few buffs, it was definitely helpful, and not as bad as i thought with the limitations. I don't know about everyone else, but I assume there are plenty of times your at full mana with no mob to cast on (and I don't even have canni 5), so I was just recasting buffs early when the bar was full if I felt like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Splitzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">From the UI Timer FAQ (http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/faq.asp):<br />
<br />
Let's say that you want to time an ability like mend, which is available every 6 minutes. So you would create a timer with a 6-minute duration. Whenever you use mend, move the slider to the current position of the bar. It will take the bar exactly 6 minutes to reach the slider again. Or if you want to time a buff like Spirit of Wolf, which lasts 36 minutes, you would make a 36-minute timer. Whenever you cast Spirit of Wolf, move the slider to the current position of the bar. As the bar approaches the slider again, you'll know when the buff is about to wear off.<br />
<br />
The timers are simply static animations configured to take a set amount of time to completely cycle through from start to finish.  There's no way to vary the cycle length while playing without manually editing the .xml file and reloading your UI.  Using your example, if you set a timer for 36 minutes, then move the slider to the middle.  It will then take 36 minutes from that point for the bar to finish that cycle and make it back to the middle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">That won't work though, because a feature of the program is that you don't need to reconfigure it for spell duration changes. By moving the slider, you alter the duration of one cycle.<br />
<br />
It works just like I said it does. You're not looking at it correctly.<br />
<br />
No matter where the bar is currnently, whether its full or empty or 20% full or whatever it will take that amount of time to get back to that spot again.<br />
<br />
So if I have a 3 minute timer, and when I cast my spell the bar is 48% across the graph, it will take the bar 3 minutes to get back to being 48% across the graph.<br />
<br />
There is no start and finish, the graph is circular.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I seem to do well enough refreshing buffs.  The continual 'haste plz', 'haste dropped', 'need haste' business does get old but haste is a wonderful thing when you're a melee.  I can usually keep mental track and keep haste refreshed without the melees needing to remind me...and sometimes I even use the clock on my desk to help me keep track...amazing device, that clock.  It's always nice when some says, 'xxx dropped', and I'm halfway through casting 'xxx' and just say, 'aye' a second before it lands - they usually don't worry about letting me know buffs have dropped after that.</div></div><hr />
