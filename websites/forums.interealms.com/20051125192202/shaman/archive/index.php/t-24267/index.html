<br />
An old woman, leaning heavily on her staff, enters the nearly deserted tavern. She makes her way slowly to a dark corner, and sits down quietly. No one seems to be paying her any mind. <br />
<br />
&quot;It is well,&quot; she says to herself. <br />
<br />
She looks around slowly, observing both the patrons and the furnishings. She has been here before she thinks; but perhaps it is just her mind playing tricks on her again.<br />
<br />
She shrugs. <br />
<br />
She reaches down into her satchel, and takes out a rolled piece of parchment and lays it on the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;They will find him if they search for him,&quot; but she doubts any will seek him out.<br />
<br />
She rises slowly, pauses briefly before the hearth, and then makes her way to the doors, and out into the night.        <br />

THE MIDNIGHT OF THE SOUL<br />
<br />
Questions we ask, and the answers we seek<br />
Under dark clouds that are dismal and bleak.<br />
Ever we yearn always longing for more<br />
Standing alone on a dark distant shore.<br />
Torn by despair, a silent prayer speak;<br />
But all that's heard is the surf's crashing roar.<br />
<br />
Rewalk the paths that your young heart once knew<br />
In days gone by when the world was still new.<br />
Now do the proud and the famous and strong<br />
Grieve for the cause that's been lost for so long.<br />
Enter a glade, that's been hidden from view;<br />
Refind thy way in the words of a song.<br />
<br />
<br />
TABULA SMARAGDINA<br />
<br />
Truth must be truth as the wise men well know,<br />
Revealed above and revealed below.<br />
In one is all, on the Stone it was read,<br />
Sired by the Sun and the Moon it is said.<br />
Made by the Wind, the Earth fed it to grow,<br />
Every work of wonder in the world has it bred.<br />
<br />
Great from the small, and fire from the earth,<br />
Into the heavens to seek it's rebirth.<br />
See by a new light as obscurity flees,<br />
Thus strength of strength will bring all to their knees.<br />
Unknown in the lands is the Stone's real worth,<br />
So secrets and signs you now see with ease.<br />
<br />
<br />
PRIMA MATERIA<br />
<br />
Make ye your choice, for the quest soon begins<br />
A friend ye must seek where a windmill now spins.<br />
So all ye who wish a new journey to make,<br />
Search through the mists for the path ye must take.<br />
Approach now a cave on feet more like fins,<br />
Cross under the ruins 'neath the floor of the lake.<br />
<br />
One's purpose must be to prove trust alone<br />
Now by thy deeds will thy true faith be shown.<br />
For ye to find life, prepare first to die,<br />
Under cold waves ye will make thy last sigh.<br />
Seek shadowed rest near a cold shaded stone,<br />
And read in the cards where the true path must lie.<br />
<br />
