An interesting article that once again proves that the $ &gt; all. It appears that nothing else really matters.<br />

...now has 433,000 paying customers who generate $5 million a month for the Japanese entertainment giant. Given the 40 percent gross-profit margins, and the fact that this world practically runs itself, the dragon-slaying business is looking pretty good these days. <br />
<br />
<br />
Just reminded me of when people complained about the hike in prices and were told to shut up because they werent making that much.  I realise the 40% is gross , but that is still damn nice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
HAHAHAHAHA!!! Yeah, BB has been reset HOW many times since the bazaar patch?  After each crash or unannounced world take down for &quot;scheduled maintainance&quot; (they say its coming down in 15 and it comes down in 5, and shows up on the network status page as it happens, real scheduled) where you have a half dozen GM and guides frantically running around the world ressing and doing CRs.  EQ has been a lot more hands on lately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, considering the piddly pay they offer GMs and the nonexistent pay that guides receive, yah the world does kinda run itself.  Only people they have to really pay are programmers and system techs.  And I expect one tech per server is enuf, maybe less.  <br />
$14/hour job I estimate.  Programmers would get substantially more, but probably not more than $50k/year since they lost most of the people who were in the actual development process and would thus be needing higher salaries to compensate.  <br />
<br />
EQ is definitely a money maker, no question.</div></div><hr />

BTW 433,000 x $12.95 = $5,607,350.<br />
<br />
A Month.<br />
<br />
Figure $50,000 a month in electricity.<br />
Figure $50,000 a month in rent.<br />
Figure $250,000 a month in server upkeep/upgrade.<br />
Figure $20,833 a month for programmers (50 programmers * 50K a year / 12 months in a year<br />
Figure $28,800  a month for GM's (150 GMs * $12 / hour * 160 work hours in a month)<br />
<br />
I get $399, 683 in monthly costs.<br />
<br />
I see 5.2 Million in gross - what am I forgetting? (I asked my NCO's that all the time)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is WAY low for 50 programmers in the middle of San Diego. You're not factoring in the health plans, 401k plans and benefits for these programmers, nor the computer equipment that they need. Add another 200k to the programmer figure and maybe you're getting close to the cost.<br />
<br />
According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eastridgeinfotech.com/sd_salarysurvey_2001.pdf&quot;&gt;this salaray survey&lt;/a&gt;: <br />
<br />
Wages for junior-level IT employees are still among the highest for less<br />
experienced workers today. A junior level programmer averaged $49,423 per<br />
year<br />
<br />
There's no way they've got 50 junior-level programmers there either. They've got to have somone managing them. I'd imagine that their cost-per-development person is around 90k all in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you.  It was nice to be vindicated when being told to shut up because OBVIOUSLY they aren't makeing much off of EQ.  Ha.</div></div><hr />
