<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tagra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've seen hints that this isn't so difficult, but nothing specific.<br />
I have a small guild of friends. Almost all level 60, quipped with HoT gear and epics for the most part.  However, we're sorely lacking in mages and I don't have any mage friends!  <br />
<br />
Is Lord Rak doable by a couple of high level, well equipped groups?  <br />
<br />
Any tips on Lord Rak would be appreciated.  Healing, how often he procs, type of damage, melee damage etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">a friend of mine did rak without mages... or necros, chanters, clerics, druids, wars, monks, rogues, pallys, SKs, rangers, beastlords, or bards...<br />
<br />
just 3 manaburn wizards...<br />
<br />
which proves he doesn't have all that many HP, so a well-balanced group or two with good fire resist and enough healing power should be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can do Rak just fine with a traditional heal circle, but you have to calculate his damage and set the c-heal chain accordingly.  Rather than have several people engaging him directly, I'd recommend a single tank, heavy HP buffs and FR, and a heal circle on him.  Everyone else gets to use range weapons and spells.  It's messy, but it does work if you can keep your tank alive.  The AE DoT that Rak has sucks, but Rak doesn't hit very hard.  Were it not for the AE, he'd be soloable.<br />

*edited*  Sorry, I should probably speculate a bit more and see if it helps.  The guy above me said 3 manaburn wizzies--so that's probably about 25k hp tops.  I'd have a minimum of 5 clerics if you want to be REALLY safe, though four would work.  Set up a c-heal circle at a delay of 20, and a second circle at a delay of 30.  Start out at 20, and if your tank isn't taking that much damage, drop to a delay of 30.  Don't use defensive on the tank--Rak's melee is low, it's just his AE that sucks and defensive won't stop the AE.  Additionally, if the tank has defensive on, he won't taunt as well since his damage is lower.  Everyone else is on blasts.  Debuff after 10 seconds or so to lower resists on Rak.  Rangers with bows do good damage.  Rogues can also use the bows.  A second thought is to use a pally as the MT.  Since the tank shouldn't be using defensive anyway, and (I think) Rak is flagged as undead (please confirm), a pally with some AA skills would probably excel at holding agro.  This will allow all the casters to blast more easily.  Agro control is going to be vital.  I'd STRONGLY recommend that you have the clerics well away from the casters, so that if the casters screw up and get agro, the clerics don't also eat the AE while the tank is getting agro back.  MAKE SURE THAT ANYONE THAT GETS AGRO KNOWS TO STAND STILL UNTIL THE TANK REGAINS AGRO--EVEN IF THEY WILL DIE BECAUSE OF IT.    If they run around like an idiot, you will almost certainly lose.  The only reason I suggested 5 clerics, btw, is because I don't know what kind of DPS your guild can put out.  You may need a few minutes to do that much damage, and, depending on the speed of the heal circle, you may not have enough cleric mana to maintain the circle long enough if you are short on clerics.  With all level 60s, 2 non-manaburn wizzies, 2 druids (with moonfire), a pally MT, 1 shaman, and 5 clerics, I'd expect something under a 2 minute fight for sure, unless the agro get screwed.  Obviously, you know your DPS better than I would, so just plan accordingly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kodiane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i've helped my friend do his with 1 group.. what we used was a rogue, warrior, wizard, 2 clerics and myself.  it went very smooth and didnt take long at all, each cleric healed a melee and i pitched in some patch heals.. didnt take overly long either =]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kytra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">When I did Rak, we had two 60 Mages, but we also had a 60 SK. His Resists must have been high, because he never took AE damage. So, I think if you had your melee in resist gear and a druid for circles, he's doable without the mages.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The Pet FAQ at the Magician's Tower (http://pub6.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29.showMessage?topicID=288.topic) says Rak's fire AoE is a lure type, players will generally be fried regardless of levels or resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Done this a few times without mages, 60 tank 60 ench 60 Rogue 2 clerics any level that can CH and Shaman (of course) Rak is perfectly tankable so long as noone panics, just need some healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>KriFos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hmm... I resisted about 9 of 10 of Raks aoe's... and the one time he hit me it wasnt for more than around 500dmg either... wimp... had around 200svf though, still...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I didn't get around to doing the final part until I was 60.  With FR ~110 (unbuffed) I resisted the 5 AE's I got hit by.  <br />
<br />
With the latest changes to resists, I'd suspect that getting 150 FR if you can on your melees would probably be more than sufficient (especially if they are 55+)<br />
<br />
Basically, the higher the lvl, the better off you be when it comes to resisting his AE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shekina Wolfhowl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Did lord rak the other night, with 3 mage pets and a mana burn wizzy.<br />
<br />
Took maybe 10mins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tagra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ok, just a report on a friend's fight.  He had a full group, no Mage pets.  Level 60: SK, cleric, rogue, enchanter, shaman, druid... All played by one person.   He said the fight was longish, guess he didn't get a heal into the rogue on time so she died.  But he said it wasn't too bad except you have to be on the spot with the heals.</div></div><hr />
