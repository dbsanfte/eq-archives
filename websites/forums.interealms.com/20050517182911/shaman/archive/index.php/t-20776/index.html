<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There are a couple of threads that deal with the question of just how effective shaman slows are versus those of other classes.  There are a lot of numbers being thrown around, and some misconceptions.  I thought a new thread was needed to clear up some of the confusion.<br />
<br />
The most appropriate way to compare slow effectiveness is to compare the total amount of damage done by mobs slowed by different percentages.  Comparisons of DPS are misleading because DPS is broken down as follows:<br />
<br />
DPS = DPH (damage per hit) * HPS (hits per second)<br />
<br />
Slow only effects HPS, not DPH.  Total damage (X) is then<br />
<br />
X = DPS * time<br />
<br />
A mob slowed by 75% means that HPS with be 25% of its unslowed value.  Thus, total damage with be 25% of X.<br />
<br />
Now we are ready to compare slows.  Relative effect of a slow on mob damage output is independent of X, and hence independent of DPS.  To see this, let's compare enchanter slowed mob damage output with shaman mob damage output:<br />
<br />
X = unslowed damage output<br />
0.25 X = shaman slowed damage output<br />
0.30 X = enchanter slowed damage output<br />
<br />
Relative decrease in damage output of shaman slowed mob to enchanter slowed mob is then:<br />
<br />
(0.30 X - 0.25 X) / 0.30 X = (0.30 - 0.25) / 0.30 = .167<br />
<br />
So a mob slowed by a shaman will do 16.7% less damage than one slowed by an enchanter.  This is close to the 20% figure attributed to Rytan at the FF.<br />
<br />
By the same logic, a mob slowed by a shaman will do 28.5% less damage than one slowed by a beastlord.<br />
<br />
These comparisons among classes remain unaffected by slow mitigation.  Although total mob damage will increase with mitigation, the relative effectiveness of the class slows remain the same. *Edit: This statement is incorrect.  See Murtak's post below*<br />
<br />
The problem with slowing is not in the percentages, but in the nature of short, high intensity fights.  These fights marginalize the need for slowing since the outcome of the fight is decided so quickly.  As many have pointed out, any slow will do for a short fight.</div></div><hr />

This is not necessarily true.  See discussion at Here (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=19518)<br />
Where the idea of mitigation over a cap was introduced.  I don't think its a fact yet, and rather surprised that more proof wasn't sought after.  Well yeah, I am too lazy to do it myself!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Almost but you miss a part.<br />
<br />
Let me add a viriable to this:<br />
T = Total battle time = t1+t2<br />
t1 = Time unslowed<br />
t2 =  Time slowed<br />
<br />
The actuall formula would then be:<br />
<br />
X = unslowed damage output<br />
((0.25 X * t2) + (x * t1))T= shaman slowed damage output<br />
((0.30 X * t2) + (x * t1))T = enchanter slowed damage output <br />
<br />
and the result would be a graph that moves towars the 16.7% when T = very large<br />
<br />
to complicate things the T is not the same for the shaman and chanter class so you end up with a much more complicated formula even without resists.<br />
This will also explain why in short battles the chanter is not that much worse then the shaman in slowing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I fully understand what you guys are saying, but I can not agree with the math.  <br />
<br />
Bottom line is I believe you are overly complicating the simple fact that a mob that does 100 dps and hits for a consistent amount of damage (you just can't take the variables associated with the amount of damage done per hit to make a valid statement), you get:<br />
<br />
100 dps * 75% slow = 25 dps<br />
100 dps * 70% slow = 30 dps<br />
<br />
30 - 25 = 5 dps<br />
<br />
5 dps is 20% greater (5/25), than 25 dps<br />
<br />
Yes, it's that simple, really.  No need to complicate.  Time has been made a constant in this equation (one second) and therefore has nothing to do with it, if the average damage per hit is the same regardless of the length of the fight.  True, a longer fight will make the difference more noticeable, due to the higher amount of damage mitigated, but the % will still be the same.  1% of a dollar is a penny, 1% of $1,000,000 is $10,000, much more impressive.<br />
<br />
Now, granted, in reality it is much more complicated in game due to many other factors that influence damage done by mobs, not the least of which is slow mitigation.  <br />
<br />
However, no matter how short sighted, saying that shaman slow reduces dps by 20% over chanter slow is a true (granted in a simplistic way) statement.<br />

<br />
<br />
Actually it's not true. An enchanter slowed mob will do 20% more dps than a shaman slowed one. Which is the number brenlo and some others seem to be fixated on.<br />
<br />
Gardeltron correctly calculated out that a shaman slowed mob will do 16.7 less dmg than an enchanter slowed mob. IE 5 dps is 1/6th of 30 dps.<br />
<br />
Your statement uses the chanter slow as the base number thus the second statement is the correct one.<br />
<br />
While you are correct that the % of dmg prevented will remain the same no matter how long the mob stays slowed slows still are more effective in longer fights when you look at things from a mana spent vs dmg prevented aspect. A mob slowed for 30 seconds costs the shaman the same mana as one slowed for 5 minutes. Obviously how ever the one slowed for 5 minutes had 10 times the dmg prevented by the slow so 10 times more mana efficient in that reguard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Almost but you miss a part.<br />
<br />
Let me add a viriable to this:<br />
T = Total battle time = t1+t2<br />
t1 = Time unslowed<br />
t2 =  Time slowed<br />
<br />
The actuall formula would then be:<br />
<br />
X = unslowed damage output<br />
((0.25 X * t2) + (x * t1))T= shaman slowed damage output<br />
((0.30 X * t2) + (x * t1))T = enchanter slowed damage output <br />
<br />
and the result would be a graph that moves towars the 16.7% when T = very large<br />
<br />
Your equations are slightly different than mine.  X is the total damage output in my equations, your X is really DPS.  But using your idea, I came up with the following:<br />
<br />
The general equation for damage is:<br />
<br />
X = t1*DPS + slow proportion * DPS * (T - t1)<br />
<br />
where t1 is casting delay and T is fight duration.<br />
<br />
For shamans: t = 5 sec (Malos) + 3 sec (Turgur's) = 8<br />
For enchanters: t1 = 1 sec (Tash) + 6 sec (Forlorn) = 7<br />
For beastlords: t1 = 3.5 sec (Sha's Revenge)<br />
<br />
Xs: total damage for shaman<br />
Xe: total damage for enchanter<br />
Xb: total damage for beastlord<br />
<br />
Relative efficiencies are:<br />
<br />
Xe/Xs for enchanter vs shaman<br />
Xb/Xs for beastlord vs shaman<br />
<br />
When relative efficiencies are equal to 1, the two classes are equivalent. If less than one, the class being compared is better than the shaman, when it's greater than 1 the shaman is better.<br />
<br />
DPS factors out of the relative efficiency, but it changes with duration of the fight.  Resists are not factored in here.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is this:<br />
<br />
Enchanter slow is better than shaman slow if fights last less than 22 seconds.<br />
Beastlord slow is better than shaman slow if fights last less than 37 seconds!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
That actually remains to be seen. How exactly slow mitigation works is definitely still a bit of a question. If as some tests indicate only the percent over 30% slow gets mitigated that would obviously have a greater effect on high percent slows.<br />
<br />
Even if it is just a straight % multiplied by the whole value it still ends up changing things around.<br />
<br />
Working with our nice handy 100dps mob for easy numbers. Lets pretend we're on a mob thats mostly slowable and thats exactly 75% of a normal slow.<br />
<br />
That puts an shaman slow at 56% leaving the mob doing 44 dps.<br />
It puts an enchanter slow at 53% leaving the mob doing 47dps.<br />
The mob dps has going up pretty substantially already and the gap has closed between shaman and enchanter. Now instead of the enchanter slowed mob doing 20% more dps than a shaman as brenlo and others like to say it's now doing ~7% more dps and relative to orginial mob dps the difference is now 3% instead of 5%. The gap obviously has gotten smaller even with out any strangeness involved.<br />
<br />
The problem with slowing is not in the percentages, but in the nature of short, high intensity fights.  These fights marginalize the need for slowing since the outcome of the fight is decided so quickly.  As many have pointed out, any slow will do for a short fight.<br />
<br />
You are correct that shorter fights do definitely devalue any type of slow but it's still true that slow mitigation decreases our lead over all other slowers. The two combine together to majorly weaken our contributions to groups. Fortunately for us I guess most people seem pretty ignorant of these mechanics.</div></div><hr />

Although total mob damage will increase with mitigation, the relative effectiveness of the class slows remain the same.<br />
This is not true at all - apart from the weird formula being used to determine slow mitigation there is another problem.<br />
<br />
Even when the percentage differences between slow percentages stay the same the  DPS of the MOB does not necessarily do the same. Consider this:<br />
<br />
Unmitigated an enchanter slows a MOB down to 30% - a shaman down to 25%.<br />
The enchanter slowed MOB thus does 20% more damage then the shaman slowed one.<br />
<br />
Mitigated by 50% an enchanter slows the MOB down to 65% - a shaman down to 62.5%.<br />
The enchanter slowed MOB thus does 4% more damage then the shaman slowed one.<br />
<br />
Why is this?<br />
We compare MOB DPS but the figure that actually gets affected by slow mitigation is the slow percentage.<br />
MOB DPS is original DPS * (1 - slow percentage)<br />
Mitigated MOB DPS is original DPS * (1 - (slow percentage * slow mitigation))<br />
<br />
The effect of slow mitigation on MOB DPS is thus<br />
(original DPS * (1 - slow percentage)) / ( original DPS * (1 - (slow percentage * slow mitigation)))<br />
or<br />
(1 - slow percentage) / (1 - (slow percentage * slow mitigation))<br />
This formula is not at all unchanging with slow mitigation.</div></div><hr />

For shamans: t = 5 sec (Malos) + 3 sec (Turgur's) = 8<br />

<br />
Xs: total damage for shaman<br />
Xe: total damage for enchanter<br />
Xb: total damage for beastlord<br />
<br />
Relative efficiencies are:<br />
<br />
Xe/Xs for enchanter vs shaman<br />
Xb/Xs for beastlord vs shaman<br />
<br />
When relative efficiencies are equal to 1, the two classes are equivalent. If less than one, the class being compared is better than the shaman, when it's greater than 1 the shaman is better.<br />
<br />
DPS factors out of the relative efficiency, but it changes with duration of the fight.  Resists are not factored in here.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is this:<br />
<br />
Enchanter slow is better than shaman slow if fights last less than 22 seconds.<br />
Beastlord slow is better than shaman slow if fights last less than 37 seconds!!<br />
<br />
You also have to keep in mind that a shaman will likely be casting malos well before the mob gets into camp, so that will affect the relative times. I'm not sure how enchanters deal with the situation, they might be tashing at range on the inc, I wouldn't know. Your calculations need to include the probability of people having some sort of spell haste (pretty much everyone at 65 I would think), as well as the 2.5 second gem refresh time. That reduces the casting time difference between shaman and enchanters by quite a bit.<br />
<br />
Also, you have included debuff spells in the shaman/chanter calculations, but not the BLs. If a debuff is needed, the BL is likely to bounce a lot of attempts and on average take quite a bit longer to slow. I routinely compete with BLs slowing with both of us calling when slows land, and usually I'm only a second or less slower than them in landing slows most of the time, even though I'm malosing first. The only reason they beat me is because they are getting the advantage of my debuff.<br />
<br />
You should also include Nihil in your analaysis, since it's fast cast time and built in debuff should blow away malos/tash slows in terms of time efficiency, and would make it the slow of choice for mitigating mobs in fast fights.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In real situations, casting Malos on incoming is not alway reliable, and is likely to generate unwanted aggro, though clearly not as much as Tash, since the latter includes a poison counter. Spell gem refresh times would favor beastlord even more if no resists were experienced.<br />
<br />
Resists would definitely hurt the beastlord the most, although there is some speculation that there is an adjustment to resist rates for beastlords not identified in Lucy.<br />
<br />
Nihil would be interesting to examine to see how it stacks up. Unfortunately I'm off to class, so I can't do any more calculations today.  May get to it tomorrow.</div></div><hr />

I have seen no indication that mob or player attacks are limited to occuring on ticks like dots or hots are. This would be pretty obvious for melee weapons since haste would do NOTHING in that case. If Attacks where limited to occuring on ticks there would be no difference between a 10 delay weapon and a 60 delay weapon in how often they swing since the delay on the weapon is 1/10th of a second. They would also both be swinging every tick and there for not hastable.<br />
<br />
I'd love to see some parses showing this effect I just don't expect you'll be able to find any.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also as far as agro goes I've found the entire malo(xxx) line to be nearly non-exsistant aggro. I commonly call it 1 point of aggro. You can pull with it so it definitely does aggro a mob but I've been unable to pull aggro off someone with it even when all they've done is shoot it with a single arrow for maybe 100 dmg at most. What ever the actual aggro amount is it isn't much and i've rarely managed to pull aggro with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My damage on Tiks comment may be misleading, but the base attack swing for mob is 6seconds. Hence the tik. I liken the effect of getting that &quot;extra tick&quot; out of torpor. It all depends when the server updates and the mob doesn't get the time to get an extra swing in.<br />
<br />
I've posted the parses before. I'll dig them up again, but they are on the home PC vs my work PC atm.  EQ logs are only capable of showing attacks to the nearest second. If you look at a block of 1 minute, count the number of attack rounds, the chanters slow will be identical to the shaman slow. So the potential damage is the same.</div></div><hr />

I have died a number of time on raids by casting Malos on an incoming mob before it engages with the MA.  Once the MA engages (for example, with a bow shot), Malos can't pull aggro off.</div></div><hr />

You just agreed with me. Of course your going to pull aggro over someone who's done nothing but the fact that a bow shot alone will keep aggro over malos just goes to show how low aggro it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Just because the logs round to the nearest second does not mean that attacks are limited to occur on these seconds. <br />
Correct, but if the next attack does not come for another 6-10 seconds, then there is the same number of attacks for that 1 minute block of time. Plus or minus a 10th of a second means nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Here's one of the charts I made long ago:<br />
<br />
A Valiant Squire  Fully Slowed	<br />
Unslowed    2-3sec swings	  28 attacks<br />
Turgurs       8-9sec swings	   9 attacks<br />
Grummus    3-4sec swings     17 attacks<br />
Tigir (50%)  4-5sec swings	 14 attacks<br />
Forlorn Deeds 7-8sec swings   9 attacks<br />
<br />

When things get interesting is when you analyze all the different mitigations. I did that as well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">So your own logs show a clear difference between a 40 and a 50% slow and you argue that there is no difference between a 75% and a 70% slow?</div></div><hr />

That looks like misses to me?<br />
<br />
As for the 40-50% slow and Forlon Deeds vs Turgurs, thats a 10% difference not 5%.  I wasn't debating the lower percentage slows, nor the merits of a 10% difference.<br />
<br />
And yes, in every fight I parsed in a random 1 minute block of time,  there was no difference. The number of attacks taken was the same. <br />
<br />
The best you can argue for in our favor is that the enchanter slowed mob made his final attack a whole extra second sooner then a turgur slowed mob. <br />
Unless the mob died in that 1 second difference the potential damage is the same though. Possible? Yes, but there is so many other things that can make that 1 second difference as well though: lag, slower player, slower computer, debuffs, haste casting items, haste casting buffs, etc.<br />
<br />
The only reason I did all these tests back then was to see how slow and slow mitigation really worked. All the math on paper stuff doesn't hold up to in game dynamics.</div></div><hr />
