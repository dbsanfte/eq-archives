<br />
How much does the proc aggro? The effect is stun + DD I believe?<br />
<br />
Am looking for a weapon upgrade from Earthcaller in mainhand, and wondered if there is any point in saving up for this (yes I know they are worth a ton of cash, but there are some circulating on Fennin still as it took some time before the sleeper was released)<br />
<br />
I know there are other weapons out there that are upgrades over Earthcaller, but those are mostly no drop and off mobs I do not see my guild doing for quite some time still. So I was looking mainly for a SoD or a Salindrite dagger as a potential upgrade. <br />
<br />
Does the SoD proc aggro so much that there is no point in using it for us in raids/xp groups?</div></div><hr />

Worst case you could off hand this bad boy if yer MT has no clue on how to hold aggro.<br />
<br />
As a Ranger I'd say use it only for exp tho.  Heckfires even then you'd be better off staying outta EC/Bazaar channel and working yer AA skills.  Nothing like starting a pull with a 318 non crit arrow shot. ;)<br />

With some bad luck on a  few quick procs and theres no time to jolt. I used one for a while, but very rarely on ubers. SoD is awesome for exp'ing though. I used to wield SoD main hand, Baton of flame in off hand :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Relv</div><div class="date">05-11-2002, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had one before I sold it (for DKP, not platinum) to a warrior in my raiding alliance... it's good damage but almost completely unusable on raids because you end up having to spend half your time casting jolt.<br />
<br />
I have a salindrite now, it does slightly more damage and the proc is less aggro (it's a 1ft knockback rather than stun).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Twigin</div><div class="date">05-11-2002, 02:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used one yesterday in FG in an XP group with a 59 pally as tank.  The proc is Anarchy 288 DD with stun/knockback effect.  Pally was weilding nature's defender(taunt proc) and casting stun, might etc..  When the SoD procced there was very little the pally could do to regain aggro, the shrooms hated it.  I had jolting blades up, cinder jolt and good old jolt. chain casting jolt/cinder jolt and proccing jolting blades did absoloutly nothing to lower my aggro.  <br />
  No way in hell i would use this weapon in a raid unles i was MA</div></div><hr />

I think its a 0 sec stun, no knockback as far as I've ever seen. When you cast on giants and styff, they take DD, but you get an immune to stun message.</div></div><hr />
