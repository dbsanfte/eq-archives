<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, b4 thursday..i was starting to get a lil peeved at our resist numbers for Ultor and Blood...with Malos and MD and OoS and Tash..sometimes even Sinia...i was getting resists like we always had...pretty bad<br />
<br />
Then last night in VT...everything was landing...i got 1 resist of Blood and 1 of Ultor per named instead of like 3 or 4 out of 10 landing...very happy<br />
<br />
Question I have is, anyone seeing the same thing today (Friday) ?? or was it not supposed to be like that ???  Or did they &quot;correct&quot; this by making it back to the old horrible resist rate<br />
<br />
or was i smoking crak last night and dreamed it all??</div></div><hr />
