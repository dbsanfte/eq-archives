<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wow - that stuff is worse than Totemic and Ry'Gorr.  Recommended level of 50??? Ya right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ogreshm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hey now, it's great armor if you're level 10 or so. I would have killed to have a set of this when I was starting out. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jeraem Gaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok THAT armor sucks from Umbral but there are good items there:<br />
<br />
The bracers that drop off Gantru Dralkenr and some other named are pretty good: <br />
Ac12 15wis 6to saves, ac12 15sta 6to saves, etc.<br />
<br />
Corrupted Elysian near vex thal is kindof tricky to pull single without FD but isnt too hard to kill. Drops ac12 2wis 2int 35hp 35mana 6poison 6disease mask.<br />
<br />
You can kill either of those with 1 group or less.<br />
<br />
Eqmaps has some netherbian scale vambraces listed that are more ac and hp than wolfcallers off a named called Fleshrot but I havent been able to track down any info on him yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'll never understand the Umbral armor. Maybe they screwed up the class tags like they did with rangers. Maybe druids were supposed to get Shojen and we were supposed to get Elysian (seems obvious from the stats which class makes more sense for each type). Maybe since Shojen is droppable, it's just there as booby-prize twink gear. Maybe Verant is incompetent beyond verbal description.<br />
<br />
And, as always, clerics get preferrential treatment. The only Umbral armor shamans can wear (for reasons that are baffling at best) is Shojen. Being a plate class, clerics can wear Shojen and Moktor. Yeah, which one would you choose? :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
I just hope I can get a Bracelet of Sense someday. Having a lot of WIS from just a few slots will allow me to more easily upgrade AC/HP in the others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ya know . . umbral isn't that bad actually . . . if you got me along.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zalf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">And notice how Iksar where omitted from this too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">We had the BP drop when my guild was raiding UP a couple of weeks ago. I was gonna roll for it until I saw the stats :(<br />
<br />
I passed on it.  My Ry'gorr BP is better than that piece of tripe.<br />
<br />
Maybe these will be quest pieces later on.  Or these are for the look not the stats. They are nice shiney plat graphics with the new toons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Maboun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Don't think this could be used as twink gear unless they changed it. I wear the helm for looks (got sick of totemic after 60 levels) and it is definitely flagged No Drop.<br />
<br />
I agree its a real kick in jewels for shaman since the dr00d armor that drops here is arguably better than most Velious questable armor and the elysians can be killed with a few people. <br />
<br />
On the plus side if you can kill any of the named a few do drop some decent shaman usable items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">None of the pieces of shojen armor I collected for laughs were no drop.  They do however have a recommended level of 50.  *giggle*<br />
<br />
Elysians can be soloed by druids.  Much harder for shaman, as they have 20k hps and poison and disease dots don't land.   Grats druids on nice armor.<br />
<br />
-Henora</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I've also seen 15 ac 7 wis shoulders and 10 ac 10 wis 5 sv all neck drop. The shaman armor sucks; the zone has some OK stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Umbral is okay to fool around in, kinda fun for a change.  By all means **** for experience though, from the couple of times I've went.<br />
<br />
Me, cleric, THREE primal equipped rogues and a monk, and stuff still died slow (relative to real exp. spots, that is.)  Cool looking mobs, though.  Did manage to find a named up that dropped one of those all/all bracers, can't remember which.<br />
<br />
Killed one of the dark master boss dealies I think it was..and one of the others, can't remember name.   I remember one of the nameds that was red to me at 60, but dropped nadda for a reasonably tough fight.<br />
<br />
But yeah, the shaman armor is crap..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Geal Icehammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Originally posted by Zalf <br />
And notice how Iksar where omitted from this too. <br />
<br />
And notice how none of the Iksar are whinning about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Wow, that is some true crap.<br />
<br />
I would have to seriously debate wearing that helm over a fricking lumberjack's cap (cap has more AC and some STA) - that makes the helm market value around 10 pp to me.  Wheee!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'd hang on to that stuff. Remember what happened to the Velks loot?<br />
<br />
Stranger things have happened...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Maybe when someone figures out Vex Thal, it will be turn in armor?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The stats are well and truely snafu. Verant have got to change them, as Kronenbourg said Totemic and Ry'gorr is much better!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I've been to Umbral 3 times, and havent actually seen anything drop I could actually wear, much less wear and have crappy stats.<br />
<br />
I hate that zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't all the drop armor in Umbral recently nerfed?  There were quite a few rangers I know screaming in pain a few patches back from having their ubah Umbral armor cut in half AC-wise.  The recommended level tag is prolly a remnant from that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Boraman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Have the mask:<br />
