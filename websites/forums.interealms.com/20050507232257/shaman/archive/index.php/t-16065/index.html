<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Loopi Loo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here's a question for all you shamen who have slowed Quarm. Do you notice that with each consecuative attempt at Quarm, you get more resists slowing?<br />
<br />
I've noticed that on the first attempt at Quarm, I always get only one or two resists before slow sticks. However, after we wipe and try again, none of the shamen or even the enchanters can get slow to stick.<br />
<br />
One of the enchanters suggested that Quarm actually gets harder each time we fail. While this sounded ridiculous at first, its got me wondering, what are your guys' experience with the slowability of Quarm?</div></div><hr />

Funnily enough i had this too on last Quarm session.  Turgirs landed second attempt on first try with no problems or agro.  However none of us could get Quarm slowed after wipe and second attempt.  Seems like a good urban myth to spread...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Havent noticed any difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">check to make sure the bard is using OOS on the second and third slow attempts.  Chances are he is on the first, but not the rest.  That right there (-25 adjust or so, i forget) could explain a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mmshah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Dunno, have had long strings of resists at times with him but nothing I wouldnt just chalk up to randomness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Or maybe the bard is burning puretone (72 min refresh?) on the first OOS, and its not available after that?<br />
<br />
No real idea--I am not Quarm capable; just a thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Loopi Loo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for all the imput. <br />
<br />
My bet is it was the bard. We only had one that night and on the second and third attempts he gibbed right away probably without debuffing. That sure make a lot more sense than Quarm himself actually getting harder everytime we fail!  :D</div></div><hr />

As a bard, I rather doubt that it's a puretone issue. With the increased droprate of Thunderous Drums of Karana from BoT (drop, pfft, you get one for zoneing in ;p) puretone is obsolete, puretone gives a 2.8 instrument mod, and the TDoK is a 2.8 mod.. ^_^ but eh.. what do I know?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I highly doubt any bard who is on Quarm are using Thunderous Drums of Karana from BoT though. There are far more/better things for them on the way to the dwagon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shamsham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Actually no.  Unfortunately, the next upgrade to the TDoKarana are the War Drums of the Rathe, which drop in PoEarth.  These drums also happen to be ridiculously rare.  There are guilds who have been in Earth for months now and only have one set.  BRD instrument drop rate is absurd.<br />
<br />
In any case, the bard not using Harmony of Sound could've been your problem.  Base -resists to HoSound are -15.  With TDoKarana (2.8 modifier), you'd be looking at a -42 mr/cr/fr debuff (2.8x15).  It sounds like that was/is your problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">well it kinda needs to be absurd, considering the avg number of bards per guild who would actually need such a thing.  And the fact that it would be just another piece of rotting loot otherwise.</div></div><hr />
