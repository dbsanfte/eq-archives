That's all my questions. If you find it ritarded tha I ask so much instead of reasearching it then I am sorry. I have reasearched it but I would much rather have experienced people give me a direct post to my questions. I suppose you can call it a personal preference thing.<br />
<br />
Thanks for spending time to read this and posting replies if you choose to. Again I thank you all for helping.<br />

Hail, brothers and sisters of the glade. Okay I realize that there have been tons of people posting about or asking about trials. So the only reason why I am asking this is if there is any new information on trials.<br />
<br />
~Approzimately what is the minimum level of a trial ( 60?)?<br />
<br />
---60 sounds about right.<br />
<br />
~What classes would increase the success rate?<br />
<br />
It depends which strategy you use. Some people prefer to have a very sturdy tank, load him up with damage shielding, and AoE the mobs, while others mez and take them one at a time.<br />
<br />
---The trial of execution is ALL about DPS.<br />
<br />
~How long will trials take?<br />
<br />
---10 minutes if success on the first try.  Weeks, at worst case.<br />
<br />
~Is it worth to give it another shot after a massacure ( escuse the spelling please) ?<br />
<br />
---Only your group can answer this.<br />
<br />
~Does compeleting a trail automatically flag you for PoV and PoS or just one of them?<br />
<br />
---You must run to Mavuin in the jails several times, but the trial is the hard part of the flag.  You get both PoV and PoS for your efforts.<br />
<br />
~Do all trials in PoJ get you flagged to the same zone? If so they which one is the easiest? ( I belive I have been told that Trial of Executioner is, but want to confirm this)<br />
<br />
---Yes, and Execution.<br />
<br />
~For a ranger, should we get EQ and AM3 before attempting any trials?<br />
<br />
---It can't hurt, but not necessary.<br />
<br />
~Ranger's meele or archery is the only way to go?<br />
<br />
---Whichever does more DPS.<br />
<br />
~What are recommendations ( escuse spelling again please) on what bow to use for the trials?<br />
<br />
---Whatever does the most DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gurvy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you need to get lower than 60 classes through for your guild what you can do is put together a really stacked 5 person group and rotate the 6ths and get people flagged. A few friends in another guild did this to get some of their lvl 53-55 members through the trials so they could still play with everybody.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Icye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I thought i heard Lashing or the on that startd with and H were the asiest and they all give you the same flag? Why would anyone do the hard one then besides Loot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jezekiell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">1) Approzimately what is the minimum level of a trial ( 60?)?<br />
<br />
61+ prefered from personal experince, the more the better.<br />
<br />
2) What classes would increase the success rate?<br />
<br />
Magi (pre summon pet), ranger, monk, rogue, bard.<br />
<br />
3) How long will trials take?<br />
<br />
A good 15 min or so.<br />
<br />
4) Is it worth to give it another shot after a massacure ( escuse the spelling please) ?<br />
<br />
Really depends if you can improve on your mistakes, or if it's simply a lack of dps.<br />
<br />
5) Does compeleting a trail automatically flag you for PoV and PoS or just one of them?<br />
<br />
It's not automatically, you need to do a small run around quest. But in the end it does flag you for both storm and valor.<br />
<br />
6) Do all trials in PoJ get you flagged to the same zone? If so they which one is the easiest? <br />
<br />
Exe trial prolly the easiest, in the way that it's mostly about pure dps not much else.<br />
<br />
7) For a ranger, should we get EQ and AM3 before attempting any trials?<br />
<br />
Unless you have some good melee weapons, haveing am3 would be an idea.<br />
<br />
8) Ranger's meele or archery is the only way to go?<br />
<br />
We have summoned nukes that works very well in trial, aswell as Frozen wind/brush fire<br />
<br />
9) What are recommendations ( escuse spelling again please) on what bow to use for the trials?<br />
<br />
Anything from a BFT/wicked bow and better if you have am3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jeffr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd say to use melle and nukes over archery in exec trial.  Those stupid little benches in the room have a habit of blocking arrows on me, and a blocked arrow means no dps and then the mob doesnt die fast enough.  Melle damage is alot more consistent and what I always used in the trials.  The other people really answered your other questions good =)  I would say add shaman to the list of classes and have them AE slow each wave, then just keep them healed =)  Easier to heal 1 person than 4 hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lanilya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I usually can very well archery with levitation and standing on benches. The only problem is that when mobs are stacked I am not sure to hit the right mob. And this may lower DPS and lead to fail. Usually for the last 2 (sometimes 3) mobs, I always switch to archery with EQ/AM3. For Last wave I use disc, and I dont care about hitting the wrong mob sometimes. :)<br />
