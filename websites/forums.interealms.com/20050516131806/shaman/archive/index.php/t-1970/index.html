<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">On another thread Targar was saying he used to train skills by fighting a 60+ NPC that only hit for 25's (the hairpiece merchant in West Freeport newbie zone--since buffed up to hit harder unfortunately).  Since melee skills seem to go up alot faster fighting yellow or red mobs, a long fight with a higher level NPC or mob that you cant kill, ending with running or gating away, would seem like a viable training method.<br />
<br />
Anybody found good NPC's or mobs for this approach?<br />
<br />
EDIT--the hairpiece merchant Fizzlecutter is now light blue to a 47, so it appears they nerfed his level rather than buffing his hitting ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I thought that panther in WL was supposed to be good for that.<br />
<br />
Haze Panther I think is the name of the mob, level 60, doesn't hit very hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Go solo the &quot;right' way for a bit.  Slow a mob, sic pet, tank mob while applying DoTs and melee till it dies.  Defense won't raise all at once but it will raise and raise steadily.  Agil buff yerself and wear some int gear or get a chanter buff if u can.  <br />
I recommend CoM as a zone with lots of blue mobs low hps and they dont hit too hard.  <br />
<br />
Lay off the drood kiting and the grouping for a bit to raise defense skill.  There is no more important shaman skill to work on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Warscar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There is a mob that is perma rooted on velious that warriors use to raise their weapon skills on. They melee it and when they get low they back off. I am sure it could be used for defense raising to. I am not sure how hard it hits though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ever since I got my JBB I have been doing quite a bit of the Root-Blast method of soloing, I decided yesterday I better spend some time getting my Defense maxed. (Defense = Free AC)<br />
<br />
Fungi + Chloro, AGI buffed and let a Blue hit on me.<br />
<br />
Nothing<br />
Nothing<br />
Nothing<br />
Nothing<br />
Nothing<br />
Nothing<br />
<br />
Went like this for almost an hour (while I was watching TV) and NO raise in Defense. I was just starting to get really frustrated when I happened to look at my skill list.<br />
<br />
Defense = 200<br />
<br />
It must have risen from all those Root breaks from the JBB blasts I have been doing. I never noticed and I didn't even think to check first.<br />

????  Land, could you clarify a bit?  I've never heard of anyone buffing INT for skillups, especially combat skills, which seem to be Dex/Agi based.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I found Wyverns in CS to be nice for the 50+ defense raising game.  They dont hit that hard at all.<br />

I started fighting them at 51 with 185 def and was maxed half way though 52.</div></div><hr />

Ever notice that the pure INT casters in your group can get their melee skills way up when they are goofing around meleeing? :p<br />
<br />
caster_01 tells the group, &quot;1hb (60)!&quot;<br />
caster_02 tells the group, &quot;piercing (50)!&quot;<br />
caster_01 tells the group, &quot;1hb (61)! (62)!&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i got 200 defense naturally at like lvl 45 just solo'ing in OT. i always slowed/tank/dotted/melee so i was always getting hit. but if you group, defense will be hard to get up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Shrooms in FG rule. They are soooo easy if you have some resistance gear and slow them. I finished raising my defense on these guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Straif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Max defense by level 42 like I just did and there is no need for high level mob training :)<br />
<br />
35-42 = Tundra Yeti love.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Daedric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I was lvl 43 and running through Emerald Jungle to City of Mist while SoWed.  As I was running through the trees, never saw the MoB, just saw a plaguebone skeleton tries to hit you and misses.  You have become better at defense (200).<br />
<br />
I thought that was really cool. :)</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure the higher of INT or WIS is the determining factor.  However, your average INT caster will have a 200+ INT, while it is very tres chic for Shamans to brag about having a 130 Wis all the way to lvl 60.  If you got your WIS up to 200+ your skills would zoom up just as quick.  But then you couldn't post here with out being made fun of :) (not sure if I'm being sarcastic or not).<br />
<br />
ps - apologies to all french speakers if I misspelled 'tres chic'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dagor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">as for Int and skill ups.  a high INT or WIS...whichever is higher makes it more likely you will gain a skill increase.  Especially in things like Alchemy and trade skills.  <br />
<br />
A while back VI announced what stats contributed to, and DEX and AGI were said to contribute to skill gains in melee/offensive skills(DEX), and AGI would contribute to Deffensive skill increases.  <br />
<br />
So according to this if you melee you should buff your DEX and AGI.  As to whether INT/WIS or DEX/AGI have a bigger impact on skill ups...I don't thing that information is available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Lol, I think we are going to need a bit more evidence to buy the Int argument.  Casters getting skillups from 50 to 60 faster than you can get 190 to 200 is perfectly normal.  The lower the skill, the faster the skillups.  Placebo placebo placebo.  Make sure you buff Charisma to keep slows from being resisted while you are at it . :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
I think its the Mist panther in WL that is 60 but hits like a wimp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">When I was working on my weapon skills (back in my 40s, now that was a long time ago!) I made a batch of Greater Null potions. Good practice for alchemy and also +25 Dex, which seemed to make a difference to how fast my weapon skills raised.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">At 47, I'd suggest the Dire Wolves in Great Divide.  Have to watch out for the wandering giants and other wolves, but that is where I finished out my Offense and Defense.<br />
<br />
Buff up with everything, hit the mob with Incapacitate, then melee.  When low, root it and back off.  Regen some and melee more.  Just don't slow.  You want it to hit you fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Faendryl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If you have knowledge of Siren's Grotto, on the way to the Siren'sroom with the spiraling staircase up (the room where you need to pop into it from the water pool), on the way there, in the tunnels underwater, there is a spot where you come to one of those nasty ae elementals, and 2 mermaid's close behind you, and a seahorse infront of you. <br />
<br />
About 10 feet before the seahorse you can safely drop invis and the mermaid's and the elemental don't aggro ( the seahorses see invis, so I thought when i went through the mobs behind me would aggro but i guess they have tiny tiny radius ).<br />
<br />
This seahorse is perma rooted to his spot by the game, and is still blue to me at 55 now. He could be used to raise defense; just back off alittle and heal up when you get low. He will deplete your hp quickly if unslowed though.<br />
<br />
You could even jb him to death for exp and sit there all day free exp hehe (if he's not cold resistant &gt;&lt;)<br />
<br />
I just killed him with my bow as we were heading to get my friend a few breastplate gems off the sirens ( ranger(me), enchanter, and druid ).<br />
<br />
Course the druid got grav fluxed by the sirens in the spiral room and hit her head n the platform and aggroed a million of them and we died, but the next attempt we learned to stand a few feet back and let the enc pull ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>BryeLLe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">we've been working a thread in combat and tactics forum on this topic. you can raise your skill on pc pets. they don't hit that hard and can be controlled. very useful, but you might have to bribe a necro with some bone chips and some equal time PL'ing one of his alts. :)</div></div><hr />

Also try EW's Ulthorks.</div></div><hr />
