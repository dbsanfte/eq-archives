<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've not been able to see an answer to this question anywhere, althought I suspect I know the answer.<br />
<br />
Do I have to spend Adv points at a camp to gain Favour Points, or do they simply accrue regardless of how much I spend there.<br />
<br />
eg.<br />
<br />
Adv Balance = 0 - I have no points at Rul hills.<br />
Adv Balance = 650 - I earn 650 points at Ruj hills<br />
Adv Balance = 0 - I buy Bane @ cost 650<br />
<br />
Ok, now I want to save up for BAIV, lets pretend I already have 650points from some other camps.<br />
<br />
The question is, even thought I spent the 650 adv points at Ruj do I still have a balance of 650 Favour points there? Will further Adv's at Ruj accrue?<br />
<br />
Does it work like the following example?<br />
<br />
Balance (Adv_Ruj/Adv_Other/Fav_Ruj) = 0/650/650 - I have no points at Rul hills.<br />
Balance (Adv_Ruj/Adv_Other/Fav_Ruj) = 800/650/1450 - I earn 800 points at Ruj hills, total pool 1450 Adv points and 1450 Favour points@Ruj.<br />
Balance (Adv_Ruj/Adv_Other/Fav_Ruj) = 0/0/1450 - I buy BAIV@ cost 1450 using my total pool (<br />
<br />
NB I now the numbers are not 100% but this is just an example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That's correct.  Favor points don't get spent.  They just build up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thats correct, you just have to earn those points once at a camp.  If you earn 650 points at Ruj and buy bane, then go earn 650 points in MM you could still go back to Ruj and spend those points at Ruj.<br />
<br />
So really, once you get 1492 points in each camp, it wouldn't matter where you did your adv's after that because you could spend any and all points you earn in which ever camp you choose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks that confirms my suspicions. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Timesink_01 basically.<br />
<br />
If you could adventure where you wanted and spend points anywhere, you might get bored and quit EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Clawmarks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You bascially can spend points anywhere you want...but you need to of done each camp Alot before that can happen.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mingh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">&quot;you need to of done each camp Alot before that can happen&quot;<br />
<br />
Which is exactly why i dont bother with it anymore.<br />
Plus the fact that if you augment an item, you lose the augment if you upgrade.</div></div><hr />
