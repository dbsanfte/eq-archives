<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>xDeMeNtiAx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i decided to do the rallic pak quest rather than buy one and since hollowshade is bugged to hell and the wolves permanently control the zone i cant find a good concentration of a lot of owlbears to get my pelt i need....anyone know any place/area with lots of owlbears around?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>argoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Haven't been to Hollowshade in a while. Aren't there any owlbears in the caverns on the western side of the zone (just north of the entrance to Shar Vahl)?<br />
<br />
Argoth of Drinal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gummox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's been a few months since I made a Rallic Pack, but the last time I checked there were only 2 known places to get perfect owlbear pelts:<br />
<br />
1. Paludal Caverns - Yelloweyes for sure, and possibly the grimy owlbears also<br />
<br />
2. Hollowshade Moore - only the owlbears in thier home base in the NW cave, they don't drop at any other camp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Talsondar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Grimy Owlbears in Paludual drop em for sure.  I know there are at least 2 spots with a 4 spawn of em.  I killed 4 one day and got 4 perfect owlbear pelts...:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There are also owlbears in grimling forest. If you cant find them in hollowshade. Most likely some ******* has rigged the war to make grimlings spawn in their place to get the haste belt that drops there. If you want to get the zone respawned just help the grimlings take out the sonic wolves too then petition that the zone is stuck and wont respawn and they will usually respawn it.<br />
Here is how Hollowshade works if you dont know:<br />
There are 3 factions: Grimlings, Sonic Wolves and Owlbears.<br />
They attack each other about every fifteen minutes. You see a message like:<br />
&quot;the sound of gnashing teeth is heard. the sonic wolves look nervously to the south.&quot;<br />
A player has to help the attackers defeat the defenders.<br />
this is where it always breaks<br />
In theory, when one mob controls all three camps. Their leader is supposed to spawn at the little wood fort outstide Shar Vahl<br />
and drop a great item.<br />
then in theory the zone respawns when he is killed.<br />
Of course changing all three camps to one mob, especially the grimlings, is a quick way to get on a vah shir player's bad side espeicially if they are in the middle of camping items for the shar vahl quests (both guild and tradeskill ones). <br />
There is nothing more annoying than fighting sonic wolves or owlbears for pelts and sonic wolf bane pieces and then have them suddenly despawn on you.<br />
I reccomend you ask first before changing a faction.<br />
Also if you are hunting owlbears, dont throw away &quot;owlbear pelt&quot; or &quot;owlbear feather&quot; they can be sold to other players for the Shar Vahl tailoring quest or you can do the quest yourself to get tailoring up.</div></div><hr />
