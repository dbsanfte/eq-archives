<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zzing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
Is the coerced channeler on the 2nd floor of Dalnir KoS?  I assume that if so it would mean getting an enchanter friend to charm him.  The guide(www.championsofcabilis.com) I have read does not mention if he is kos or not.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ah went down there just tha other day with a chanter buddy of mine(thank you Plavius!). yes hes on tha second floor, found him by poking around invis for a bit. hes an iksar (looks neato with tha new graphics, heh) anyhoo, we cleared out tha room and went in, lo and behold he was indiff! we charmed him just to be sure (didnt wanna hafta collect more components fer that bastard potion!) got skull np! i had tha other 2 already so i went straight to get muh heirophants stick (nice look on it btw)<br />
<br />
you could probably just clear tha room &amp; do tha turn in np, but like i said, i wanted to take no chances!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">He doesn't have to be charmed.  I did this the other day, just hand it in and you're gtg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">He used to be KoS way back when, but eventually they fixed the quest so that he was indifferent to all for use of the quest.  makes it a lot easier than dragging an enchanter around for a while down there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zzing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Cleared the 2nd floor of Dalnir about 3 or so times and finally the Coerced Channeler spawned AND he was indifferent as everyone has stated.  <br />
I did the turn in, got the 1st skull, headed to Droga, killed the correct Iksar Slave, then SF, got the 2nd skull, headed to Ill Omen, killed a Sarnak Dragoon, turned in the helmet, killed Bruiser Noz, got 3rd skull, did final turn in and WHAM... Cudgel of the Heirophant!  Graphic kinda looks like the Velium Etched Stone Mace.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info guys!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">cleared the 2nd floor 3 times before I got called away to a raid, no channeler.<br />
<br />
:/<br />
<br />
That is a cool zone, I wish I had leveled there more when I was in my 30's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Important note for questors here:<br />
<br />
The Coerced channeller is non-KOS to players..but as a result he IS KOS to other denizens of his floor!<br />
<br />
One time I logged on in a safe spot near his room, and saw him spawn in his spot in the back room..had to answer the phone, came back to the computer and he was gone..&quot;how odd&quot; I thought&quot;<br />
<br />
The second time I was there just in time to see a goo finish him off.<br />
<br />
Finally he spawned a third time a day later, and I rooted and whacked him before the other mobs noticed him...then just for fun I invis'd all the way down to the exit and whacked the Kly.<br />
<br />
Still an all-time great zone...one that's due for a bit of an upgrade imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">is he a random spawn in there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yes.  Just clear around the floor a few times and he'll pop.  Usually back toward where the prison type area is iirc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">anyone know what the Iksar Prisoner is for? (cons amiable)<br />
<br />
monk friend killed it, dropped a traitors heart. When hailed he asked for something to free him from a dwarf. Didnt stick around long enough to try anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sebanis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">That prisoner is for the Trooper Scale bracer quest for Iksar warriors I believe.<br />
<br />
Channeler spawned for me in the bedroom in 2nd floor past where most of the 'coerced' mobs spawn. <br />
<br />
All thats left for me now is to farm some skulls in HS (already have all the bits for the last one)  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have only ever seen the Channeler spawn in the Imprecator room (shackle room) on the 2nd floor. He spawns in the right corner closest the doorway as you walk into the room.</div></div><hr />
