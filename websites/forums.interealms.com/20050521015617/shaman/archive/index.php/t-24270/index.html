<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>zolexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Kind of an odd question.  Is there any site out there that are primarily help forums, etc for GLs and officers?<br />
<br />
From things to help manage flags/keys to help and advise to dealing with apps, complaints, etc...<br />
<br />
I think I'm safe here, dont know of many guildies that check this forum, lol (we only have 2 shaman atm, and if either of you read this, shhhhh).. but I'm going insane.  My guild only raids twice a week.  We are not capable of adding more.  But we are strong in what we do.  Recently moved out of VT into PoP and are just RZ away from EP.  <br />
<br />
Guess I'm just looking for others out ther in similar situations, how they handle things.  What did they do to get past the people who are never happy.  Those that want to stay in VT to 'gear up' vs those who would rather poke their eyes out with a sharp stick then go back.  Those that want to be in EPs NOW, but refuse to help backflags our CURRENT members, let along applicants who need 1-2 flags.<br />
<br />
Is their a support group out there? Heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dunno about the support group and other stuffs, but my guild was in a very similar spot a few months ago.  We had everything from fully time flagged down to people missing most of the flags in the guild.<br />
<br />
At the time, we were killing our first tier3 bosses outside of the zeks, which was still ok since very few zones were keyed (HoHb raids were a real PAIN).  Eventually we got to the point where we were looking at doing only the tier3 bosses so backflagging became an issue.  We ended up having a &quot;backflagging week&quot; which lasted about 5 raid nights (we raid 3 scheduled nights a week - tues, thurs, sun - with sat optional).<br />
<br />
During those 5 raid nights at 5 hours each, we got almost the entire guild completely backflagged (in addition to hitting tier3 bosses).  This cleared up a LOT of the drama being caused by backflags, pickup raids, 85'ing people in, etc.<br />
<br />
My suggestion (regarding backflags at least, and guild progression) is to bite the bullet for a few raids and do all the backflagging you can.<br />
<br />
We also skipped VT so that kinda helped with the sanity hehe.  VT is not needed for PoP progression anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My guild has come quite a long way since my first few posts on this forum. We have up around 350 people in our guild, around 220 of which are main characters, and 11 officers. We have approximately 15% elemental flagged, four people Kod'Taz flagged, and the rest missing varying amounts of POP flags. We currently raid twice per week, a farming raid and a flagging raid. Raid attendance and consistency have been two of our largest barriers to progression, as we do not make our raids mandatory.<br />
<br />
I am not my guild's most diplomatic officer, to be sure, so take my post with a grain of salt. <br />
<br />
If you have people who are never happy in your guild (and every guild does), tell them to grow a pair and get happy or leave. Pretty simple. You're never going to please everybody in your guild. They're either going to have to work to accept your guild's current position, work toward a compromise, or go find a guild that suits their desires better.<br />
<br />
We are in your exact position, just regarding different zones. We have people who like to raid BOT once weekly to earn some nice upgrades, and those who would rather (as you put it) poke their eyes out with a sharp stick. We have those who want to be in EP now, don't want to attend flagging raids, etc. etc. <br />
<br />
You must work to find a compromise, it sounds like. Two raids per week? Great. Raid VT once and take a POP flagging target on your next raid date. Choose, say, Terris Thule, and for one month raid nothing but her on your POP target night. Next month, move to Grummus. Month after that, Carprin and Bert, etc. etc. That way people get their farming appetite taken care of and people also get to earn flags. <br />
<br />
Folks who want to be in EP now? Tell them to go find a guild that's in EP now. Getting to the EP's with those of us who do not raid six nights a week takes time and takes work. If they're not willing to do these things, your guild is not the place for them. <br />

Heh is this my evil twin?  I have a sharp tongue and I'm usually very blunt.   That's exactly what I want to say, just with even less diplomacy, lol.<br />
<br />
Biggest thing I find funny, and another officer who was also in my old guild, agrees on.  Those that think VT is boring and repetative, and want soooo badly to be EP raiding...  Well, we have news for them.  EP raids are no different than VT, only different scenery.  Anyone who's done Dust Event in Air knows that one.  Glass spiders or robed guys, long ass repetition is long ass repetition.  /shrug<br />
<br />
Dont think I was entirely clear on where my guild is in progression atm.  We are alternating raids mostly between trying RZ and doing backflags.  On a roster of about 70 we have 40-45 that are completely SolRo enabled so just clearing up the leftovers/new apps.  Everything lower than RZ (minis solro minis) has been decimated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm not an officer, but I am in a guild that just had to go through all that not long ago from PoP to PoTime to Ikkinz.  I was (unfortunatly) one of those people who needed back flagging when I first joined (they had JUST litteraly broke into EPs when I joined). The guild bit the bullet and backflagged for a week or 2 and decimated PoP for the apps and guildies who needed them.  We didnt lose a guildie no matter how much they complained or didnt log on through it, they stayed and we're the stronger for it (&lt;3 my guild).  <br />
<br />
Another thing that helps greatly though is maybe starting an allience in flag sharring with other guilds on your server.  Trust that you're proably not the only guild going through this, and sharing can reduce stress for all.  We have a cpl of guilds who we did this with.  If thier guild already killed that flag mob, but people missed it, then they were welcome to join us (as long as they welcomed us when needed).  We've done that all the way up through EP Gods.  It helps in lessening the backflagging any 1 guild has to do and gets everyone flagged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>UloffBigkev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Firstly, let me give you some background... As none of you probably know, I'm the recruitment officer for Cold Fury (http://www.coldfuryguild.com) and have been since it's creation over 2 years ago. In that time we've done pretty much all the progression paths-<br />
<br />
Velkator -&gt; Vindi -&gt; NToV -&gt; Ssra/AoW -&gt; VT -&gt; PoP pre-elementals -&gt; PoP elementals -&gt; PoP Time -&gt; GoD to... where we currently are in Txevu. (And obviously playing about in Oow)<br />
<br />
We raid 7 nights a week pretty much without fail for about 4-5 hours a night. We have a smallish roster because a) people in the guild have high playtimes or they're booted and b) we all get more loot :P<br />
<br />
Old content (ie: anything below GoD) we do not backflag for as we don't raid there as a guild.<br />
<br />
That's the background over and done with - let me get down to answering your questions.<br />
<br />
Uloff's tips<br />
<br />
General<br />
* Set goals for the guild and DON'T look back. ie: we'll do Plane of Time until we get to Qvic or we'll do VT until we kill Bertox. Complacency is the devil and counter productive to guild health.<br />
* Be firm and decisive in your leadership - there is nothing worse than have &quot;wishy washy&quot; leaders... (Members can and will abuse weakness.)<br />
* Don't have too many officers. We have 6 officers who make all the decisions for the guild. While we listen to what our members have to say, ultimately they have to adhere to what we decide. We work as a council, of sorts. IMO, the guild as it stands wouldnt work any other way.<br />
* The leadership should stand united. Even if your officers dont all agree, if the majority of officers agree then as far as the guild is concerned you all agree. (This avoids people playing the officers against one another.)<br />
* Be consistant with everyone. (This is a guild breaker if not followed to the letter.) This covers loot, rules, flags, fines/penalties, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
Managing flags<br />
* As a guild when we defeat a new flagging mob we wont raid the new zone until we've completed it twice. With our members high playtimes we're pretty much guaranteed to flag 95%+ of the guild doing this.<br />
* Because we're focused on new content, it reduces the flags we have to worry about. In GoD for example, we can flag people up to Txevu in a night. (In fact, we did it last night for a new member who didnt have Tipt, Ikki4, Uqua and Inktu'ta)<br />
* If people are happy to do it and they can't be on when we flag, people in the guild log on members who need flags. (Obviously we'd prefer not to do this though)<br />
<br />
Guild recruits<br />
* Don't take any crap - at the end of the day if you're honest and open about what you expect and they don't meet it, then you're better off without them. Honesty is the best policy.<br />
* Make sure they understand all the guild rules and don't underplay them.<br />
<br />
Complaints<br />
* Don't let people blackmail you - if they try *regardless of who they are* warn them that it won't be tolerated. <br />
* Try to look at problems in terms of your &quot;vision&quot; for the guild and not what's best for the individual. Despite what people think, you can't please everyone - so you should concentrate on what your guild was created for. It's better for people to leave than be disgruntled. (And as bad as this sounds, they can always be replaced.)<br />
* Don't try to sort out complaints while raiding. The last thing you need is more stress. if someone is really annoyed tell them to talk to you after the raid or tell them to log and talk to you later.<br />
<br />
<br />
There's probably more to say, but thats all that springs to mind. I really enjoy being an officer, and my guild totally rocks! (I loves them all.) Good luck with everything, mate.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>wakonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I started to type, but... Rep bump is what it came down to for Uloff.<br />
I think the biggest line you should remember in his post is, and to clarify a tiny bit, not EVERYONE will be happy, you really cant please everyone, just try to spread the love around as much as possible, depending on loot rules/raiding places/and officer picks.....a Dictatorship will not work.<br />
 But, for a site that can tell you how to set up officership and Guild Leader functions...I really don't know? My best guess would be  sociology 101? =p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well said, indeed.<br />
Only thing I think I can add that I didn't see above, is that some people are going to shower the officers with hate regardless of what you do.  Accepting that you'll be faced with a constant stream of complaints (most of which are beyond your control) is the first step.</div></div><hr />
