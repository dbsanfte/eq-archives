<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all, <br />
<br />
<br />
I'm just about burnt out of POV because of spending like 4 + days played there over the past week and a half and I&quot;m just wondering, whats a good place other than POV where I can solo stuff?<br />
<br />
I have no good 61+ spells but I have all the old world ones excluding Grp PE, Grp Acumen, No Comp Levi, No Comp EB and Primal Avatar. <br />
<br />
<br />
I'm 61 btw, and just got canni 5. Looking for preferably stuff that drops parchments.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also where can I possibly duo with one of my 2 monk friends? One of them is 61, 85aas and has like 4khp, GMU and Primal and some other phat stuff and the other is 57 with pretty good stuff (fungi, epic, tstaff, cof) and run3. <br />
<br />
<br />
The good monk is valor/storms flagged.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks very much for your help. I appreciate it. Also, somewhere anyone could suggest that involved money would be pretty nice :D since I have just spent 60k buying a lvl 55 port bitch, and it expired, and i'm too broke to renew it (and I wasted my money too since with POP I don't even need him)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cudes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you could actually duo in pov and play the tank... keep aggro with bane and just keep yourself torpor'd... you can do non stop pulling np if you have canna 5 and a horse.  it's a nice break from the root parking and still effective.<br />
<br />
there are the crawlers in PoD still blue... but they're boring and exp isn't as good in valor.<br />
<br />
with tnargs you can pretty much duo anything slowable in PoP without much fear of dieing (well tnargs + torpor)...  <br />
<br />
so you could do storms if you stick to the slowable mobs(non mitigated)... with the same strat of tanking that i described above.  <br />
<br />
oh wait i just realized you don't have tnargs... you should try the strat anyways and keep choloroblast mem'd then.  You can keep yourself healed fairly well by just chaining torpor but they can get their lucky streaks and you'll have to catch up on heals, especially if you have just canna 5'd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>jador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When i am at lv 60(no torpor, canni V),  join group at pov much better exp than solo.<br />
I earn &quot;2% AA xp PER kill&quot; in 6 ppl group, 1 hour earn 50%~70% AA xp double or triple exp than i solo FG mushrooms(100% AA).  <br />
Exp  on lv 62 mob : Solo 6% AAxp per kill, Group 2% AAxp per kill.  <br />
Unless you can kill 10+ lv 62 mob in 1 hour,  group is a better choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Undoubtedly, grouping is better... but I've gotten 17aas in the past 6 days in valor grouped and am VERY sick of it. I'd settle for less exp for a change.</div></div><hr />
