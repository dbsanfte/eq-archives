------------------------------ <br />
<br />
** Zone Revamps ** <br />
<br />
- The Deep, Charasis (Howling Stones), Dragon Necropolis, Siren's Grotto, The Hole, The City of Mist, and The Accursed Temple of Cazic-Thule have been partially revamped. Gameplay in these zones has been improved, based on feedback from players and careful review of the content. The changes are not dramatic, but make these zones more entertaining to play in. <br />
<br />
- The Plane of Mischief, home of the trickster Bristlebane, has undergone an extensive revamp. As one of the most unusual places to visit in EverQuest, this zone is a very interesting challenge, if you have a sturdy funny bone. The improved zone is now available on Stormhammer. <br />
<br />
- The Greig's End revamp is now available on the Live servers. The redesign includes new encounters, items, traps, and events that make the zone a challenge for the experience group, with plenty of events for a raid group. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Interface ** <br />
<br />
- /memspellset # - Using this command memorizes one of your saved spell sets. # is the number or name (or shortened name) of the spell set you wish to memorize. Note that if you use a shortened version of the spell set name, it will match the first spell set that has those characters, so /memspellset Dots will find your &quot;Dots and Charms&quot;, or &quot;Dots&quot;, or &quot;Dotsandstuff&quot; - whichever shows up first on your list. <br />
<br />
- A Platinum slot has been added to the shared bank to make transactions between characters on the same account more convenient. <br />
<br />
- Clip Plane - The clip plane slider should work more reliably now. Where before it may not have done anything until lowered to a very low percentage, now the slider should have an effect at any setting. <br />
<br />
- Filters for your own pet's messages have been added. Your own pet's attacks are no longer subject to the Other Attacks/Misses filters. On the options screen there is now a separate button for filtering YOUR Pet attack messages. Also, the ability to redirect your pet attack messages to any chat window has been added to the chat window context menus. <br />
<br />
- /random messages can now be sent to any chat window you'd like. There is no option to filter these messages, however, to prevent any loss of the information in cases where it is needed (meaning, people can't claim that they didn't see the /random that they lost just to force a re-roll). <br />
<br />
- The Journal Window has been changed to make it easier to use and understand. We've merged the the two information windows into a single window. <br />
<br />
- Fixed a bug in the Looking for Group window. The Get Matches button should no longer grey out at inappropriate times. <br />
<br />
- The Bad Word Filter now filters chat channel text as well as other game text. <br />
<br />
- To make things a little more logical, the /inspect command will allow characters to inspect interactive objects for LDoN, and /toggleinspect allows you to toggle on or off the ability to inspect other player characters using the mouse. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Alternate Advancement ** <br />
<br />
- Purify Soul reuse time reduced from 72 minutes to 30 minutes. <br />
<br />
- Divine Resurrection reuse time reduced from 36 hours to 18 hours. <br />
<br />
- Celestial Regeneration reuse timer reduced from 72 minutes to 15 minutes. We have increased the duration from 24 seconds to 48 seconds, adjusted the amount healed, and made this a group effect. <br />
<br />
- Celestial Renewal duration increased from 24 seconds to 48 seconds, adjusted the amount healed, and this has become a group effect. <br />
<br />
- Harmtouch has been fixed. There was a problem with the timer for Harmtouch that would make it appear to reset when the character was logged out, even though it does not reset until the appropriate amount of time has passed. <br />
<br />
- Summon Death Charger and Summon Holy Steed have been fixed. We fixed a bug that caused these abilities to fail until the character zoned or logged out. <br />
<br />
- Endless Quiver no longer grants an endless supply of thrown weapons, only arrows. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Spells ** <br />
<br />
- Unswerving Hammer of Faith has had its mana cost reduced from 250 to 175. <br />
<br />
- Divine Barrier no longer has a damage shield component and has gained three times the healing effect. <br />
<br />
- Celestial Remedy has had its mana cost lowered from 190 to 150. <br />
<br />
- A targeting issue with pets is now fixed. There was a bug that caused pets to be untargetable with the F1 key and with pet spells that target the pet automatically. This was happening only if a pet was summoned and then a mount was summoned. <br />
<br />
- AE Rain Spells were resisted 100% of the time when an NPC was above level 20 and had less than 10% of its hit points left. This will no longer happen. <br />
<br />
- Eye of Zomm would cause a player's pet to kill itself if that pet was commanded to kill the owner's Eye. This has been corrected. Also, the Eye no longer moves at incredible speed under water, but they can now swim up and down in water. <br />
<br />
- PBAoE Songs no longer prevent a bard from singing if used while the bard has himself targeted. <br />
<br />
- Illusions can once again be cast on others while the caster is on a mount. <br />
<br />
- When Invisibility drops due to looting a corpse, the player will be informed that their invisibility has dropped. <br />
<br />
- Pets no longer break enthrall. <br />
<br />
- Armor of the Zealot will no longer be overwritten by Focus of Soul and Focus of the Seventh. Blessed Armor of the Risen and Ancient: High Priest's Bulwark will no longer be overwritten by Focus of Spirit or Khura's Focusing. Also, Pact of Hate and Call of Darkness should stack properly (meaning that they won't stack). <br />
<br />
- Illusion: Guktan was fixed on all servers a little while ago. We just wanted you to be aware that the spell will make the target look like a Guktan, not a male human. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Zones and Quests ** <br />
<br />
- Bazaar - We have increased the limit on the number of traders in the bazaar. We fixed an issue that would cause the &quot;Begin Trader&quot; button to be disabled if a player tried to use it when the maximum number of traders was reached. And the &quot;Held&quot; slot option was removed from the search, since it is not a valid option. <br />
<br />
- The Coirnav Encounter has been modified to respawn faster when the encounter is failed badly (if the attempt fails to reach a certain depth in the encounter). <br />
<br />
- The Illusion: Guktan quest had some issues. We have addressed them. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
** New Player Improvements ** <br />
<br />
- After creating a new character, that character is the default selection on the character select screen. <br />
<br />
- At character creation, left-clicking on an attribute displays text that explains what that attribute is important for. Right-clicking allocates the maximum possible points to that attribute. <br />
<br />
- To help reduce clutter for the new player, the Story window no longer pops up when a player first logs in. <br />
<br />
- When a context Tip window pops up, if the Tip of the Day is still open, the Tip of the Day window will close. Again, this is to help reduce the clutter. <br />
<br />
- We've change the name of the &quot;Camp&quot; button in the Actions window to &quot;Camp (Exit)&quot; for clarity. <br />
<br />
- The Inventory Tip window now explains how to read books and notes, how to give/trade items with NPC's, and how to scribe spells. <br />
<br />
- We've added a text message on the screen to inform players when they are loading a zone, and what zone they are about to enter. <br />
<br />
- Added numeric background to buttons in the Hot Button window to make it easier to tell which button corresponds to which number key. <br />
<br />
- The Mousewheel zoom is now enabled by default. <br />
<br />
- New installations of EverQuest will default to 1024x768 resolution. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Misc ** <br />
<br />
- Fixed a bug that caused some equipment to be invisible on characters created recently (since our update on August 6th). <br />
<br />
- Luclin elemental models will now display if selected, regardless of other settings for Luclin models. You can turn these models on with no other Luclin models active, and you will see the Luclin elemental. <br />
<br />
- Hitting cancel on a trade window or using the /consent or /deny commands will now only send you one message, not two. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">%$@@$ no reduce time for RABID BEAR..........<br />
<br />
i got 318 aa points and 15 unused atm and i don t have rabid bear .<br />
<br />
i don t like the 2 hours reuse time (should be at  45 min or so IMO).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">AE rains fixed!!! =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>CelEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nice patch overall, but the Rabid Bear reuse time should really have been lowered indeed. to 45-60 minutes <br />
<br />
But that wont happen cuz we get an AA te reduce the timer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sancha Delnocha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Very nice patch but I expect there's going to be some additional downtime after we get this online.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grenoble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Increased trader limit...makes me wonder if I'll even be able to move in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think someone said they parsed Rabid bear and it only did like 30-45ish dps? If so, who cares what the reuse timer is, it still sucks. It would only come in handy vs stuff that resists cold and poison and the reuse time would still have to be insanely low to be useful. They should just replace it with a better AA or up the damage to something significant like 150 - 200dps. Of course if I am wrong on my DPS numbers feel free to ignore what I just said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Nice patch overall, but the Rabid Bear reuse time should really have been lowered indeed. to 45-60 minutes <br />

<br />
Yea, I seen the first message about timers getting changed for clerics and thought, &quot;oh wow, maybe they fixed rabid bear&quot;.  Got all excited just to be let down again  :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Innate Charisma &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Rabid Bear</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Autorun finally fixed so that pressing the up arrow key turns it off, as before. Wasn't mentioned in the patch message.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Matey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">New, more annoying than the autorun being broken, change to the way item stats are displayed.  Now they open up their very own window for every item you right click instead of replacing the last item window contents with the new information.  This is SUPER annoying in the bazaar when I want to look through a lot of stuff and end up having to close 50 bazillion windows now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm...I like this feature in the bazaar...it makes it easier to compare items.  (although I can see your point...maybe it should be a flag you can turn on/off??)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It is funny how no matter what is done it doesn't please everyone. I for one have found it really annoying when I am trying to look for an upgrade to have to remember the stats on one piece while I plow through the rest. Being able to put them side by side makes it soooo much easier to decide on what piece to pick up. This was one of the most welcome changes I have seen...... however, Matey, I do see your point. Perhaps a setting to enable/disable would be good.<br />
<br />
To me, this just highlights the absolute lack of hope the developers ever have of pleasing their audience though. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Discordja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">who cares about anything else, /memspellset is $$$</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Foggy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">New /memspellset is t3h pwn as they say.  I bloody love it already.<br />
<br />
Only being able to open a single item at a time is always something that has annoyed the crap outta me - a bit like when we could only have 2 bags open /shudder</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Matey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Maybe it just has to do with the way that I have always compared items in the bazaar.  I just flipped back and forth between them, using short term memory to figure out the differences.  The problem with the new way of doing this is that the windows open nearly on top of each other and requires me to re-position them to see them both at the same time.  This causes me to waste the time of moving my mouse to a completely different portion of the screen, dragging the window out of the way and then going back to the bazaar window when it was so much simpler before.  In fact, I wouldn't have a problem with this change if the bazaar window inspect worked like inspecting armor you have on you or in you inventory.  The window disappears when you release the right mouse button, unless you put the mouse in that window and release, when right clicking on something from your inventory.  In the bazaar window, when you right click and release on something, the window stays up regardless.<br />
<br />
I also wish they would also stop screwing with the UI.  Have we hit the year mark yet for the new UI?  And they're still playing with SIDL.xml and EQUI.xml...  Custom UIs become out of date and broken almost every patch(even if it's just little stuff missing).  This latest patch, modifying SIDL.xml, probably broke a LOT of UIs and I'm sure there are people less savvy than me that don't know why their titlebars and buttons are now missing from their windows.<br />
<br />
/memspellset completely blows both of these complaints out of the water in regards to functionality and I'd rather have /memspellset than have the above fixed, as I'm probably a small percentage of people who don't like the changes above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Needed to run to Ssra last night..<br />

/mems trav<br />
<br />
(ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh)<br />
<br />
Very nice.  One other nice minor benefit -- spell scrolls now list the level needed for each class so everyone can see them.  No more &quot;hey, mages, what level is this?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yea love that new spell info, was long overdue.<br />
<br />
One of the most inane changes though has to be the new camp button.<br />
<br />
camp(exit)...gee after playing this game for 3.5 years I never knew camp meant exit..</div></div><hr />
