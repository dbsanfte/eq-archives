<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wontonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Malo is not worth the effect. Yes it's un-resisable, but the cost 400 mana is wayyyyy too expensive.  I don't think anyone will use it in a regular basis in group or solo.  In raid? Have the mages to use their Mala, does the excate same thing, but cost 100, if not 1000 times CHEAPER than Malo!<br />
<br />
Torpor is nice when you're soloing, also it can be use as a mean of regen mana quickly.  But I'm 62 now, living without it isn't that painful at all. Canni and Mend of Kragg works too, a step down from Torpor, but still regain mana for us.  And at 62 we get Tnarg's Mending, 1300 heal, 3.8 sec casting time.  Yeah, the mana cost is dreadfully high, but it gets the job done.  And as most of us know, Torpor only works on caster, cast it on a tank and he will scrowl at you like the mobs do.  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
So good luck on getting your Torpor and Malo, some people say they're the spells that a shaman MUST have, I don't think so.  Spend your money on your group buffs, on your dots, on your gears, on your horse, if you have any money left, go buy your copy of torpor/malo. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This is a joke thread, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, I'll swear by Torpor.<br />
<br />
Torpor is a game-changer for the shaman, particularly the soloing shaman.  Kragg's is nice, but to be efficient you have to be too injured for comfort AND have 10 secs to cast it.  Truly, it's a whole new game after Torpor.<br />
<br />
Malo, though, gets used only on the big nasties (1st tier bosses and tougher) mostly cuz they have an annoying tendancy to bounce my slows more often than I like.<br />
<br />
If you regularly group with a Mala-toting mage (and let's face it, Mala drops like mad) Malo's not worth it.<br />
<br />
I've been experimenting with Torpor as my &quot;main&quot; heal.  It's amazing how tanks adapt to being told that if they want me to slow, cripple, dot, haste, heal, and do CC, then they have to live with Torpor as my primary heal.  After about an hour with no down time on my part, they get to love it.  I imagine Mass Cann will be another life-changer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There are times when you *have* to land critical spells fast, regardless of the mana cost.  When in chanter-less groups and we'll get repeated adds, I don't need to bounce Turgurs or malosini 4 times.  This is when I lament my lack of Malo.<br />
<br />
No, it probably doesn't need to be cast on every mob.  No, it isn't useless.<br />
<br />
Do I enjoy having to cannibalise down to 25% health in order to get an effective ratio fron Canni IV/KM?  Hell no.  I'm doing the mob's job for it.<br />
<br />
Get down to one and a half bubs of health, cleric is LD, then a wanderer comes in to camp.  You're in big trouble.  Torpor is your friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wontonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sorry if my subject line misleaded any of you. I am NOT saying torpor is useless. In fact it is VERY useful in solo or in group.  But do it worth all the camping and 70k to 90k pp just for that one spell? I am saying it's not worth it.  You can get some uber gears for that kind of moneys in bazaar. If you can get that spell in raid or group, gratz!! You earned it.  If not, go on with your level progress, AA seeking, quest doing or what ever you're in this game for.<br />
<br />
I had soloed side by side with shammy who has torpor and watch them tank the mob after torpor themself.  I can do Kragg of mend as long as the mob is slowed. Or dot/kite the mob and have my pet chopping it's back, or slow, dot, dot, root it.  It just a matter of tactic, you won't lost your ability to solo simply because the lack of torpor.<br />
<br />
I know my shammy friends who would land a torpor before cast slow on some tough mob, just to keep them alive longer for the cleric to heal.  Yes, it's helpful.  But with good timing, tank can hold agro on mob even after you slow.  <br />
<br />
As for malo, I'll say if you have the money to buy malo, get your torpor first. Malo cost around 50k in E'ci.  As I said, You won't use malo often in group. Fighting tier 1 boss? I think it takes a raid to do not a group.  Sure your raid force would be please if you can malo, but finding a mage or chanter to mala or tash won't be that hard for a raid.  Juff, I don't get what you trying to say, You have 4 mob in camp and you malo each one of them? Malo itself takes 5 sec to cast, then 10 sec to refresh.  You would had been long gone before you can land malo then slow on 4 of them.  It's a spell mainly design for raid. <br />
<br />
Again, I'm NOT trying to say either one of these spell are useless. Both of them is very useful in some situation.  But I just saw too many shaman spend an enternity trying to camp them, or throw all their saving away just for that one spell.  I simply think the spell itself doesn't worth all those hours of camping or pp.  Hence the subject line: Torpor and malo too much work, not so good reward. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Malo and Torpor are class defining spells for shaman. Until you have them, you truely cannot appreciate how powerful they are. <br />
<br />
Malo and Torpor &gt; any crap you can buy in Bazaar, should be the priority of any near 60 shaman to devote his time to getting these spells. You don't need a raid force to do it, G wurms can be duoed by high 50's shaman/melee. Crypt can be cleared with 4 people etc. Even a 50's guild can muster forces to clear traks lair.<br />
<br />
There again, if all you do is root dot solo in PoN, then no, Torpor and Malo have little importance to you ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">have to say that torpor and malo are very worth the money.  Torpor is a god send and such a good spell taht its hard to comprehend all the uses, and there are  a lot.   Malo i like a lot as well,  if i am going to malosini something in an XP group i rahter just use malo (350 not 400 mana) because its sure fired to land... plain and simple.  there a reason its costs more mana and longer cast time, you never have to recast it on the same mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have to agree with some of the other posters. I had slowly been upgrading my gear and had broken 2100hp unbuffed and almost 1100ac unbuffed, but I saw an opportunity to trade some of that equipment for torpor, and I haven't regretted it. I did have to fill those slots with some rather mediocre gear (any item &gt; no item), but for me, torpor &gt; armor. I worked a similar deal for malo. I was unguilded at the time, so I wasn't sure when I'd get the opportunity again to get it, so I took it. Like many people say, it doesn't seem like you'd use malo often in exp groups, but these days, I find I'm using it a great deal. Mobs in PoP zones (even tier 1 zones) hit hard, so if I get a resisted slow,... well,.. OUCH! With torpor and a horse, I can keep my mana up pretty well, so the mana spent on malo'ing the mob is mana VERY well spent. While I can't necessarily see devoting ALL of your playtime to getting these spells, I would recommend everyone at least to TRY to get them. KM is nice and really helped push me through levels 58-60. I love that spell, but torpor makes for MUCH safer cannibalizing during combat. hehe And in older zones, you can just stand there and &quot;torpor tank&quot; mobs while the pet and a few dots eat the mob down. Still, to each his own. It's just a game. Spend your time playing it the way that's most fun for you. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Spoken like someone who doesn't have the spells.<br />
<br />
Malo and torpor are the best spells a shaman ever gets short of thier upgrades. Sure you can manage or get along with out them but it isn't just the same. Malo is more tuned towards raiding shaman but I almost always keep it memed and use it constantly in tier 2+ zones in pop even when exping. I don't know what your gear is like but I'd be willing to bet mine is significantly better and i still don't like those golems and such in PoV beating on me unslowed. Even slowed they still hurt.<br />
<br />
Personally I paid 10k for torpor and a blue diamond for malo, yeah yeah I know i'm a lucky bastard, but I would easily pay the 50k and 100k listed for them after having them. Hell i paid 50k for malos and 75k for quiscence just so i could have them as soon as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Without both of these spells my exp bar would probably move backwards more than it moves forwards.  In quite a few of the PoP zones you don't have time to fuss with bouncing sini and pissing mobX off.  Torpor is amazing and it lets you go toe-to-toe with many mobs and get out alive.<br />
<br />
Whether either malo or torpor are &quot;worth it&quot; depend on your goals in the game and what your level of play is.  The more spells and abilities you pick up the better, because they allow you to push the limits more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Quote: You have 4 mob in camp and you malo each one of them? Malo itself takes 5 sec to cast, then 10 sec to refresh. You would had been long gone before you can land malo then slow on 4 of them. <br />
<br />
You cast malo while waiting for Tugur's to refresh so you don't waste all that much time. And yes, any add in camp will almost always be malo'd. It makes mez stick easier (especially if you have a bard for CC), makes root last longer, lets stuns land easier... <br />
<br />
Malo also means that you aren't dependent on an enchanter or mage before you try to land slow. Even in exp groups, malo on incoming then slow as soon as the mob gets to camp. Malo means you don't have to wait on a tank to build agro before slowing on the tough mobs. I don't think there's any way I could play primary healer in PoP w/o malo. You really can't afford 2 or 3 slow resists when mobs are hitting for over 300. <br />
<br />
As for Torpor, I was 60 for a while without it and you can certainly survive that way, especially if you solo or tend to group with clerics. In the middle of combat, you really can't use KM for mana regen very well, you have to canni down too far to get full use out of it (1950hp) but you can cast torpor at 60% and the full use out of it. It makes a difference, even in groups. ... and tanks get over their annoyance of torpor after it's saved the party a few times. <br />
<br />
Seriously, you won't find many (any?) shaman here that have the spells and don't think they're worth it. That should tell you something right there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I used malo on almost every mob I fought until recently.  Fighting PoP mobs in exp groups in my low 60s I needed malo to ensure slow landed first try.  A resisted slow would mean either my death if the tank couldnt hold agro, or the tanks if he could... at best it meant the cleric (or druid in many groups) running low on mana from healing us both.  With malo, slow landed every time.  I could cast malo on a mob as soon as it was in range, and not draw agro from the tank.  As soon as the gem refreshed I cast slow -usualy landing on the mob at 99% health.  Typicaly just as the tank calls assist the slow lands.<br />
<br />
Now, at 64, resists on tier 2-3 exp mobs are rare, and I can slow without maloing.  Even if I get a resist, the mob wont kill the tank (or me) before I can cast a second time.  I still malo every raid mob, and every named or mini I fight.  With canni and torpor the mana cost is irrelevant.<br />
<br />
Torpor is never having to say OOM again.  Canni V made that even more true.  Torpor also means I can self heal very efficiently.  If I am tanking an add while the group kills the first mob I can just torpor myself and still be full health when the group is ready to kill it -thats tanking 250+ hitting mobs without risk, and without using all my mana.<br />
<br />
I was lucky that my guild farmed VP as I was approaching 60.  We had both Torpor and Malo waiting for me in the bank.  I hated that stupid key quest, but it was worth it.  I dont know that I would be able to buy the spells on the open market -they arent commonly sold, and they cost more plat than I have ever seen.  I would definately try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>nenyenye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">One reason peeps demand so much for those spells is this thread, how we're saying how ESSENTIAL Torpor/malo is.<br />
<br />
Although you're right, let's stop saying it!  That way, they'll think it's no biggie, and stop charging the absolutely ridiculous amount they are for it. 70k is the cheapest I've seen for em, and if we stop paying that much (fat chance) they'll be forced to stop charging that much.<br />
<br />
Just a dream, there will always be some fhool that will pay 400k for it because he can, and we normal player types will never be able to afford it.<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Buuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Malo = security in most cases. I use it all the time in groups unless I need to cc right away and then I just chance it with slow or root depending on the situation.<br />
<br />
Malo = incredibly little aggro<br />
Therefore, cast it on inc too avoid the long casting time <br />
Slow right away, at 65 in PoV I still get a 15% or so resist rate on slow without malo. In BoT this rate is far, far higher. I can count on 1 hand the number of slow resists I have had in PoV while using malo, and I have hunted there for 4+ levels, and 15 aa or so all together.<br />
<br />
Malo also makes sure your other spells stick better. That is ToP, SoT, VS, ToS, BoS etc.. nothing is more annoying than casting ToP and having it resisted all 3 waves. <br />
<br />
Malo in raids is key, malo in groups means you don't have to worry about resists almost ever. <br />
<br />
Of course you could wait for malos, on my server it goes for less than malo heh.<br />
<br />
Others have already mentioned the benefits of torpor. 1800 hp for 200 mana.....it's as efficient as a CH that lands for 3600. Not to mention you can cast it prior to being hurt (Canni 5, or big slow attempt) so that it gives you a buffer zone. I never heal active melee with it though because it's just not worth the DPS loss especially since I can Kragg's. <br />
<br />
Same deal here though, Quini is going for only 70k on my server where as Torpor is still 100k.<br />
<br />
I need 70k for quini, 40k for malos (already got ferine) and I will be happy. Focus of the 7th for 150k can wait, as can BoS although it's only 40k atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Marxxus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Has anyone ever been turned down for a HoT raid because you are the only shaman and you don't have Malo? I have. I watched the raid get cancelled. How extreme is that?<br />
<br />
Seems not just the shaman think they need it, but every other class feels the same way. <br />
<br />
I guess what I am trying to say is, if these spells weren't worth it...they would not sell for those prices. Bottom line is supply and DEMAND. If noone wanted, because it wasn't really worth it, then the spells would be more like 5k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Racknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I've yet to get torpor, however I got malo eariler this week.  This spell will change your shaman forever.  Nothing I can tell you will prepare you for it.  It is worth it.<br />
<br />
PS:  70k for quin on your server?  On Zeb I've yet to see it below 200k...  that's crazy.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That was just silly if you ask me. A mage with Mala could do that part of the job almost as well, and as we all know Mala is a toilet-paper spell (in other words, it drops so often that you might as well use any copies you find for TP since every mage has had a copy banked since level 50 and nobody but a vendor will buy it from you).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Buuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">4 copies of Quin 70k each<br />
1 copy of malos for 40k<br />
8 or so for 50k<br />
5+ copies of Blood for 40k<br />
1 copy of ferine for 50k<br />
2 copies of ferine for 70k<br />
1 copy of focus of the 7th for 150k<br />
<br />
Not too bad IMO. Now I just have to raise some platinum to buy it :( <br />

This is on Mith Marr btw.</div></div><hr />

In raid I usually am the 2nd pr 3rd rung Shammie so Torpor and Malo are nice but not DO or DIE. Ive slapped Malosini ooon IV a few times np not say that holds true for all bosses but it is what it is. Torpor would be sweet but I get way more XP in a 2nd tier plane group then soloing in 1st tier. Plus you have to work your BUTT off to solo but you can make dinner for the family while XPin in group :) And the MAIN reason is I REFUSE to spend that amount of lewt on Spells that if Im patient I can get if I bust my tail a bit. Why people spend ENORMOUS amounts of Plat on these spells...Cuz their dumb and impatient, ebayed, or ubered so 150k aint crap to em.<br />

back to the thread, I bought torpor in early december, for the most money I had ever held at that point, I was in debt 35k after I bought it.  Within a month, 3 copies dropped for my guild from sontalak, and shortly after the new year I began to see quiescence in bazaar for less than torpor cost me.  Was it worth it? Absolutely.</div></div><hr />
