<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cramey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heyas all,<br />
<br />
This is a great site, and many many continue to post great info and tips.  I have been reading this site for a while now, but just got off my arse and registered.  <br />
<br />
My question is regarding the boss in Acrylia Caverns and the quest for the ring (Mnemoic of Khati Sha)<br />
<br />
Has anyone killed this mob, know how to trigger the floor in the Throne Room or have any information regarding this guy.<br />
<br />
Info through Allak and other sources is very lacking, and was curious as to what might be known about him or the quest.<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance...<br />
<br />
/peace Always<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd love some good info on him too. Would be an honor to release Khati Sha from his torment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gorg Grimm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I maybe wrong but there is a jail (2 cages with to Val shir in each), in the inner city.  In the cell furthest away there is one cat that will talk to you.  Course in order for her to talk to you you must clear every mob in the room...so 9 total if I remember right.<br />
<br />
Anywho she'll tell ya that there are 3 items which must be destroyed...beyond that i started getting respawn so couldnt get her to talk...one item i know about is a cauldron near the zone out from the inner city...other 2 no clue.<br />
<br />
Anyhow hope this helps in some way if its even the proper way to go about doing this.<br />

had to throw this in there..on CT the cat has a ! over her head so she wont talk right now.  so if you see that quest is bugged till gm resets it.</div></div><hr />
