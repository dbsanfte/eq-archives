<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello peoples..I've got a few questions, if you all've got the time.  First, regarding our epic.  Do the Shaman have a nickname for the epic?  For instance the Monks call theirs the Bubble Maker, the Necros have the Duckstick, I've heard the Chantys' called the Snake Stick...what is the Shaman Epic referred to?  <br />
<br />
Second, as I've attained the ripe old age of 15, I've started to acquire some fairly decent equipment (funded mainly by the life savings of my 52 monk).  Regarding things like the Sarnak Battle Shield, Chokidai Hide Spaulders, and Jaundiced Bone Vambraces, are these items that I'll be using throughout most of my Shaman career?  Meaning, now that I have them, do I basically write off those slots as far as upgrading for a long while?<br />
<br />
Thirdly, it seems that the rot dotting method of soloing isn't that viable a method for me yet, mainly because my DoTs don't seem to do a lot of damage, and Root is unreliable at best.  At 15, should I be more a melee Shaman, or should I just keep sticking out the Root/Rot cycle?  <br />
<br />
I thank you all for your time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well actually, after reading many opinions of the esteemed members of this august assemblage, it would seem that the Barbarians are the bastard red-headed stepchild of the Shaman profession.  What with their lack of regen, night vision, unstunnability, etc, it would seem that Barbarians are the worst case to choose from a Min/Max standpoint.  However, as I've already taken an Iksar monk from 1 - 52, I have no desire to have to work around the tremendous XP penalty and the fact that everyone and their brother hates me.  I figured I'd try a &quot;light&quot; race.  Besides, when the term SHAMAN comes to mind, I think of  enormous, rustic, primitive peoples that generally dress themselves in the carcasses of last nights meal...seems to fit the Barbarian pretty well.  =)</div></div><hr />

2.  Yup, those slots are fine until your 50s.  Your next upgrades should be to flesh out the rest of your cheap JB-available slots (helm, gloves, boots), swap out the Forest Loops (vendors pay almost 300 for 'em) for Imbued Golden Ivory Earrings (better WIS and AC- and super-cheap, 100 pp each max- player made), and some 6/65 rings.<br />

3.  Nice solo guide (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1348).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tailen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">1) I alwasy thought of it as a pigsticker. ;)<br />
<br />
2) Get a regen item if you can, you'll love it.  Otherwise cheap JB is the way to go.   Get a 1hb, 2hb, and a piercing to keep your skills up with, too.<br />
<br />
3) Dont' Root/rot.  Its counter productive, all it really does is leave your defense skill low.  Slow, Rot and whack away.  Try melee type soloing for at least half of each level to keep defense maxed.  If you don't you'll wind up regretting it, like I do. ;)<br />
Walking Sleep is a great slow, makes casting between hits fairly easy, and is effiecent enough to warrent use for group xp grinds even into the 40s.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Equip is more than fine until your 50's, like others said, fill in other slots with JBB and maybe a regen BP.  General consenus around here tis AC over Wis (scroll thru old posts for many rehashes of this).<br />
<br />
You should melee as much as possible in your early levels and max defense, piercing, 1HB and 2HB.  Get's very hard for a shaman to increase any of these when over lv. 45.  I tried to solo 1 out of every 4 levels at a minimum and this seemed to let me work on my skills.  Maxed defense at 49 on Seafuries in OOT.<br />
<br />
Enjoy your Shaman!<br />

Necro Epic is seriously ugly. Seriously. Necro's are supposed to cause fear, incite panic, rain terror on their foes - not have them drop to the ground powerless from laughing so hard.<br />
<br />
Enchanter = Snake stick. Monk = bubble fists.<br />

Shaman? Pokey stick, Spear, Epic, Shaft of Fate (sounds like something from a Shauna O'Brien movie).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Basically, I think your method of solo'ing will change alot over the course of your shaman's life.  Biguss posted a link to a solo'ing guide that is pretty handy.<br />
<br />
Iirc, you are level 15.  Pretty much meleeing is the way to go.  As the guide mentioned, 19-24 are the worst levels for a shaman.  Your spells aren't so hot, the mobs are getting tougher, etc.  Hang in there until you hit 24, it all gets better then.<br />
<br />
I did a combination of solo'ing and grouping throughout Pad's life.  Solo'ing occassionaly is important, to keep your skills up.  The single most important one is defense.  Try to keep it maxed as much as possible.  Defense raises = free defense.<br />
<br />
At some levels, you might feel more comfortable root dotting, at others, tanking.  Some people like Kiting stuff.  I never could get into that myself tho.<br />
<br />
As far as race is concerned, I wouldnt worry about that to much.  Yes, there are upsides and downsides to every race.  And a consensus has mostly been met on which one is the &quot;best&quot;, for most people.  But, the difference isn't gamebreaking, and you can be happy whatever race you chose.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I know this has been discussed to death on this boards, but as an advice to a new Shaman, AC, AC, AC.   Max your defense, get the best AC armor you can wear (usually JB) and worry about wis later (or not at all).  Personally, I found Wis of 150 is more then enough.  Get a good wepon (REIF  RULES), and you will be happy till 45+.   JBB + Horse OWNS all 45 to ?  <br />
<br />
In regards to the nickname for our epic.... I always refered to it as the dream catcher (stick)  People usually know what I am talking about when I call it that / shrug.<br />

Yeah, cos if I'm in England and some guy complains that his trouble wrecked up his Danny Marr and he has to take a Dick Van Dyke to the nuclear if he wants a tumble with his Chinas, I'm not gonna need any explanation not to come away from that one /boggling. :p</div></div><hr />

Forgive me if i am not entirely correct, as i am Australian, and it might lose something in the translation :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">No. That's Cockney rhyming slang. Thus my reference to England. Every country has it's own freakout slang terminology. Whether it's America or England or... well, anywhere. Trust me, after spending a summer in Israel, nothing etymological surprises me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Gytmee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Seems common on Xegony to refer to the shaman epic as the Feather Stick :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Ok, I've heard time and again that it's a good idea to keep my 1HB, 2HB, and Piercing up.  As the pigsticker is a piercer, I can understand keeping this one up.  Now, I ask you:  How much weapon switching am I going to be doing that will necessitate a maxxed 1HB/2HB.  Now, I know there's the argument of &quot;Well, in &lt;insert ubah zone here&gt;, there's this boss 2HB weapon.  We should get a raid together and get it&quot;, and the like.  However, I think it very unlikely that I'll ever be in one of the &quot;Super-Duper-Uber-Kick-your-mother-in-the-face top top top tier guilds&quot;, so having access to the most spectacular equipment probably won't happen.  As I peruse the magelo lists, it seems that at least 90% of the people use spears of one variance or another.  How many of the people that have kept a maxxed 1HB/2HB have found reasonable occasion to actually put that training to good use?</div></div><hr />
