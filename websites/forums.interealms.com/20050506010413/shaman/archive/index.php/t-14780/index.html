<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mowdour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings, <br />
<br />
I was wondering what the best 4-box combo would be. Me and my friend have a total of four accounts, and we want to make the best possible four-man group. We already have a 56 shaman, so we just need to level three characters. I was thinking of a pally, cleric, monk, and the 56 shaman. Anyone have any other suggestions? Also, we'll mostly be 4-boxing in dungeons like L Guk and Sol B. Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You plan on taking this 4 box to the planes? If so I would say you need a snarer... so I would say replace pally with SK and then if you want you can replace the monk with another dmg dealer... perhaps a rogue...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hey! Be careful what your refer to as &quot;4-boxing&quot;. If it's &quot;you and a friend&quot;, then you're each only &quot;2-boxing&quot;. Ok, ok...one of you may &quot;3-boxing&quot; at best. And don't give me any of this &quot;EQ Windows&quot; crap neitha!<br />
<br />
Real &quot;4-boxing&quot; is:<br />
<br />
* 4 accounts,<br />
* 4 computers/keyboard/mice/monitors (one account per), and<br />
* 1 person who plays them all simultaneously.<br />
<br />

&quot;Four Boxing! Not just an adventure...it's a JOB!!!&quot; :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, don't forget it is not easy to 2-box much less 4-box (I can't imagine) so spread out the work between the 2 peeps who are playing.  The shaman would be well served to have the MA who doesnt pull (either pally or sk).  The puller (monk or ranger) should have an easy char also (cleric would be good).  You can always buy crack.  Now this might not be the most exciting group, but it is solid and easy to play.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Crash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heya Valgoth,<br />
<br />
If you had to start all over again what 4 classes would you choose for true 4 boxing?  Considering easy portability with PoP and emphasizing minimal attention would you consider a mage as one of characters?  And SK for snaring and FD pulling?  I might vote:<br />
<br />
Shaman<br />
Shadowknight<br />
Mage<br />
Cleric<br />
<br />
Rangers seem to be easiest to add to a group to give tracking.  Always nice to have the cleric for rezzing without begging.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Honestly I don't think I'd change a thing. It takes a little longer to kill things with a Warrior as the MT in my little group, but with the buff/healing power of all 3 priest classes behind him...he's a LOT of fun to play. However, that being said...I'm really enjoying my Monk right now too. He's on the same account as my Warrior, so he also has my priests to back him up.<br />
<br />
Mage might be ok considering all pet/spells can be hot keyed. Even so, I never liked playing an INT caster very much. Never really cared for SK either, and my Druid fills the roles for snaring/tracking and has decent healing to toss into the mix (as opposed to having a Ranger).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You know what would be a good group dps wise and ease of play wise is a shammy, a ranger(my favorite eq class), a beastlord and a mage. Beastlords got good utility buffs that stack with shammy, rangers got good utility buffs that stack with shammy, mage and bl pets can tank adds and ranger and shammy can root/ghetto cc. And a well geared ranger can tank any mob ya don't need defensive for, and can get agro as well as a sk/pally with snare, flamelick, and dots.<br />
 Beastlord can be fairly easy to play if ya use them mostly as a pet class with some dps thrown in when not medding/healing the pet, while we all know what kind of damage a mage pet provides. One more benefit tohaving a ranger as mt/puller is track, he can tell ya whats up better than any other class in the game. I'm probably looking to add a beastlord to my pair when my hardware supports it, and might give mage some thought as well, although cleric is tempting due to rezz, which I don't want to need though.<br />
Pet classes are nice, ya can really get alot out of them in a multi-box set up. Not to mention you'd have a 4 toon set up with 3 pets adding alot of dps, not to mention mages nukes and beastlords melee. Mage summoned gear at higher levels makes the crew even more formidable, and with PoP ya really don't need a cleric since most of the time in normal hours ya can grab a cleric from pot. Beastlord and ranger can provide some downtime heals (ok not much til 57, but it adds up nonetheless) and the mages ds and rangers self only stack, meaning that much more dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>xDeMeNtiAx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">well me and some friends i know (4 of us in all) play together all the time in HoH or BoT.<br />
<br />
Shk<br />
Shm<br />
Enc<br />
Nec</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I 3-box regularly with a friend, so we control a full group together.<br />
<br />
We planned this ahead of creating (most of) the characters and we chose:<br />
<br />
SHM<br />
SK<br />
BRD<br />
MAG<br />
WIZ<br />
CLR<br />
<br />
The shm is an obvious choice.<br />
<br />
The sk is an incredible tank for exp group purposes. The shm cannot take aggro unless he does something stupid like slow 5 times just to prove he can get beat on =)<br />
<br />
The brd brings mana regen, crowd control and monk-like pulling abilities to the group.<br />
<br />
The mag brings dps first and foremost, also supplies everyone (except the brd) with focus items and pet weapons.<br />
<br />
The wiz is dps, evac and ports.<br />
<br />
The clr is your always-available 96% rez. A clerics healing power should be obvious. The casting time reducer make the nukers' and the sk's life easier (stacks with focus items).<br />
<br />
We always get KEI before heading out. With the 62/64 brd mana regen song that gives you a total of 35 mana/tick, not counting FT, sitting on a horse, canni, etc. Bard hastes himself and the sk, shm hastes the pets. If needed the brd can lull or pull with fading memories (=always working feign death).<br />
<br />
Now since you asked about a 4-box setup, which two characters would I leave at home?<br />
<br />
The wizard has no critical function, so thats easy. Though a wizard on a mount with some FT and getting mana-spoonfed from a bard and KEI is crazy dps. Add in a complete set of summoned focus items...<br />
<br />
The second one is harder. I'd probably leave the cleric behind over the mage. The mage dps, the focus items and the pet stuff rocks too much, especially since you have 3 pets out (mag, shm, sk).<br />
<br />
I'd go with a sk over a paladin (nm warriors). The sk can churn out enough damage with his combined melee and abundant mana (has a mana-collecting proc too) to almost equal the wizards dps.<br />
<br />
A paladin would only be more desirable, if you think the shaman cannot heal enough to keep up and you want the extra healing power for emergencies. In practice however, the shm's replenishment and the bards song give about ~70-80 hp/tick regen, so unless you are up against very hard-hitting mobs it's not an issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">To really understand what a best 4 box would be, you must look at what is needed for a really good group. You need a few things.<br />
<br />
-Tank<br />
-Healing<br />
-Slowing<br />
-Pulling<br />
<br />
That is what you _need_ for a successful 4-box after the 40ish levels. Of course, you then want to maximise DPS, and also it is highly suggested that you have a snarer.<br />
<br />
<br />
With this knowledge you then pick the 4 that cover those bases. Obviously there are many different combinations, and here's what I would suggest.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shaman, especially one equipped with quiescence can cover the slowing and healing bases. paladin tanking in my opinion is far superior to that of other classes, mostly because they can heal themselves, and hold great aggro with stuns. There is a &quot;weak healing spot&quot; in shaman development, where you do not have the 2000 hitpoint percentage heal, and your best heal is chloroblast *cringe*. A paladins ability to heal himself will help you get through those levels. I would then pick a ranger for pulling, good DPS, and snaring. Then finally I would get a mage to further maximize DPS.<br />
<br />
Other combinations I can think of that seem okay...<br />
<br />
Cleric, Enchanter, Shadowknight, Monk<br />
Shaman, Druid, Paladin, Ranger</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I just want to know how some of you 4 boxers run everyone efficently?I know i run 2 pretty well. I sometimes put a 3rd up on my wifes puter but it always just been chanter (now for c3 and haste) and really not doing alot there. <br />
<br />
  Ive watched two different people 6 box and i wasnt overly impressed. I mean the sk in group was nothing more than a warrior. Didnt really pull with him and i didnt see much tapping happen. Was auto attack on. Chanter was like my chanter and sat. Cleric healed of course. Seemed like a cleric /chanter , MAin melee and than the rest were autoattack pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have a friend who has a lot of luck with :<br />
<br />
Paladin<br />
Enchanter<br />
Druid<br />
Wizard<br />
<br />
This seems like an unusual group, but it does cover a lot of bases:<br />
- mez<br />
- haste/slow<br />
- mind buffs<br />
- two dire charmed pets (depending on location)<br />
- damage shields<br />
- regen<br />
- 2 chars that can snare<br />
- 2 chars that can evac<br />
- two healers, though pally is just backup healer<br />
- symbol from pally + druid = good hp buffs<br />
- two good nukers<br />
<br />
One thing to note, the question is &quot;best 4-box&quot;, not &quot;best 4-person group&quot;. Multiboxing requires a combination of classes that require relatively little interaction, since only one person has to play all 4. Bards are obviously right out. Rogues would also be difficult, since for optimal usage they need constant repositioning. Similarly, I would argue having a shaman would not be ideal, not because we aren't uber (we are) but because if you aren't constantly casting or canni-ing or torporing yourself, you aren't running at maximum efficiency. ;)<br />
<br />
You can set up a nuking/healing class with simple macros that do &quot;stand up, nuke, sit down&quot; - making them much easier to play by oneself.</div></div><hr />

Sham slows/heals some crowd control<br />
Cleric  Heals and when you get higher pulls (Pacify)<br />
SK pulling /snaring/tanking <br />
Enc/BL Enc= Crack, BL= crack (well a little) but the Pet for DPS.<br />
<br />
I would suggest a rogue also for DPS but in the long run I think the BL pet would do you better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The ideal 4-box would use a bard, but I don't know how you could possibly play a bard effectively even 2-boxing, nevermind 4-boxing.<br />

SHM<br />
BRD<br />
SK<br />
ROG<br />
<br />
The fundamentals to an xp group:<br />
Tanking (SK, BRD/SHM lesser)<br />
Healing (SHM, SK/BRD lesser)<br />
Pulling (SK, BRD lesser)<br />
Snare (SK, BRD lesser)<br />
Downtime Reduction/Avoidance (SHM, BRD)<br />
DPS (All, really)<br />
Crowd Control (BRD, SHM lesser)<br />
<br />
The above group of 4 lacks in only a couple areas...bad tracking (but better than none), no ports/evac, and no ability to rez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yeah I would have suggested a bard but figured it was too hard to 4 box.  Now if they are going to play just 2 toon's each then sure play the bard and hot key the shaman slows/heals.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>allpain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I have good success with Shaman, Warrior, Cleric, Wizard, and Chanter.  All are level 65.  <br />
<br />
I 4 box.  My newest computer has windows EQ and the chanter sits in the background for buffs and if I need to break a camp the warrior can't single pull.<br />
<br />
There is no way a person IMHO can run more than 2 toons to their max, and even that is questionable.  I 4 box because that makes me self sufficient.  No LFG or begging someone to help me camp X mob.  Also, I'm not bragging but I can run 5 toons better than some people run one. . .just helps me avoid some of the newb factor.<br />
<br />
I would say the most important thing is there are lots of good combos so play the classes you will enjoy most so it stays fun.  I promise if you have 4 toons you play well you will always be able to find 2 more to group with you if you want.</div></div><hr />

Magician<br />
<br />
Just think of the diversity in that combo - heals, slows, rezzes, snares, stuns, debuffs, PBAoE's, Bolts and DoT's, focus items, summoned weapons, pet diversity, fd pulls... the list goes on and on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Um, SKs are pretty much the best pullers available.  In some places monks are superior, but by and large SKs are the better choice.  Why people still use monks to pull I've no idea.  Habit I guess.  <br />
<br />
My SK ... well, not &quot;my&quot; SK, but &quot;the&quot; SK pulls and I run me just fine with the SK pulling.  In fact it's better with the SK pulling than anyone else because I know exactly when I can debuff.  Shamina + SK pulling = good team.  <br />
<br />
With four toons available to you though, I'd be thinking something along the lines of tank (SK/Pally, possibly warrior), 'chanter, cleric, and DPS (wizzie for evac/ports?).  Use the shaman to PL the others.  Pair the tank with the cleric and the chanter and DPS.  Mage would be a good DPS choice too if the person playing the chanter was a skilled 2-boxer.  Mages can sustain 200 to 500 DPS constantly at high level in the right circumstances from what I've seen.  Make sure you use a high aggro tank with a mage though ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warrior (Meatsheild)<br />
Cleric (Dots, Heals, Rezzing)<br />
Druid (Snares, Dots, Nukes, DS, Heals, Traveling)<br />
Rouge (DPS pet)<br />
Shaman (Debuffs, Slows and Buffs)<br />
<br />
Warrior I must admit is probably not the best tank but is sufficient.<br />
Cleric is a must.  Just for rezzing alone.<br />
Druid is probably most useful char on my team.  Moving the team around without him would be a nightmare.  Plus my druid heals just as good as my cleric and seems to have better mana pool for it.<br />
My shaman is probably my favorite char.  Just very powerfull and a 58 war pet to add to group never hurts either.<br />

<br />
I only 2box... a mere babe compared to some of you... 2 accounts and I use 2 monitors, 2 kbs, 2 mice.  On the primary machine I left-mouse, on the secondary machine to my right, I right-mouse.  So it's:<br />
a. mouse -&gt; a. keyboard --&gt; b. keyboard --&gt; b. mouse<br />
<br />
My boyfriend 2boxes but he uses a switchbox.  2 accounts, 2cpus, 1 monitor, 1kb and the switchbox. <br />
<br />
Both of us are staunch advocates about our hardware setups to 2box but I think that because our play styles and chosen classes are different it lends itself to the different optimum setups.  He plays monk, druid, enchanter, bard combos.  I play sk, shaman, cleric, ranger.  (cleric/ranger now retired)</div></div><hr />

Work hard on mastering the Charm skill and you will have a pet outdamaging any other class from lvl 12 to 65 and with that group support you can charm in any environment.<br />

I have a hard time dealing with multiple tanks, so I like one tank and pets.  Blasting and dots are easy with a script (hot key).  Pets make life easy, especially if i am using a mage earth pet that roots, so i don't have to worry too much about pulling agro with one of the other chars.  I tried using a warrior to tank, but my shaman kept pulling the aggro, in the end, I just gave in and I let the shaman pull aggro and get beat on.  If his ac is high, it won't be that bad.  A healer is nice to have (cleric).  A mage is a great addition for pets, blasts and summons.  I would go for croud control next (enc).<br />

The only issue I see with this group is that multi-boxing 2 melees is a pain for mob positioning, especially with a Rogue.  I usually 4-box the following (all on seperate machines)...<br />
<br />
Warrior<br />
Shaman<br />
Cleric<br />
Ranger<br />
<br />
The biggest advantage of using a Ranger instead of a Rogue is that it's easier to multi-box.  Once I hit assist, AM3/EQ on auto-fire takes care of the rest and I only need to worry about mob position on one machine.  The Ranger also adds some utility in the way of Snare and Track when needed.<br />
