<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has no-one done him since last patch. He has been a -little- upgraded<br />
<br />
Partially slowable, triple 1700, same AE etc but now around 600-700khp<br />
<br />
Alot tougher than before !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Exeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sua Sponte took him down on Stromm March 21, 2005.  46 people, average raid level of 66.<br />
<br />
Bard pulled him to zone line area with the MT/ST in the corner.  Everyone around the corner, pushed up as close to the wall as possible to avoid the AE.  AE can be resisted, it didn't land on me the few times I sneaked around the corner to cast.  He slowed easily after a malos.  We had one death, due to rampage I believe.  600-700hp, hmmm, not sure.  Fight didn't last very long.<br />
<br />
Honestly, we had an easier time with this guy than we did with the newly retuned LR shark.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">46?? Previous to the patch a few guildies of mine did it with 10. <br />
<br />
And to be fair, with 46 people 600khp would disappear quite fast, but with the 15 we had on my attempt with wizard, mage, beastlord, ranger (who went TS) we only got him to 87% before the tank dropped</div></div><hr />

We were on our way to VT and he was up.  Hence the large number of people.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Tried him with 20+ folks geared elemental or better and only got him to 55% when the second tank went down. After zoning out to recover and training the corpse camping bugger away from the zone he depoppt on me just as we were ready for a second try.<br />
<br />
Looks like a bard would have helped, that AE is unpleasant. Also I did not expect him to be as resisty as he was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes I found him very resistant too, but im only level 68. He repops 1 hour later Shis for future reference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shlob</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">got him to 14% with 18 people time geared only 1 tank so when he went down poor clerics did to.</div></div><hr />
