<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wow. <br />
<br />
I gave my account to an exGuildmate and he's been playing Talamay w/ his warrior.  He made me a copy of all the install CDs so I installed yesterday.<br />
<br />
Even if I wanted to play, I don't think I could orient myself to the game.  So many crazy changes!  I like the mana amount on the character sheet though, that's pretty hot.<br />
<br />
Guess if I'm going to log in and poke around I should find a usable interface to use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Welcome back!<br />
<br />
The default UI is fine.  I strongly suggest the buff icons by T. King, which you can drop into any UI.  They're a cross between the &quot;new&quot; icons and the old ones we grew up with, but lovely to look at.<br />
<br />
My UI is cobbled together from bits and pieces of the others, so not sure what to suggest for a cohesive whole.  My son likes SARS and EUGEE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Play the demo (it will start automagically when you make a new character).  Very handy.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS - SAVE YOUR OLD MAGELO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grimleaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I like the Sars as well except for the mouse curser. It really bothers me so I use Vert. I keep my main spam window on the left, the tell/say on the right and in the middle I have the hot buttons (left side) and stacked right next to it from bottom to top is my compass, group window and personal info window. I don't like the default buff window so I use the Vert small buffs and keep that on the right side of the screen. I also don't like spell bar so I use the verticle thin Vert one but they do have a nice horizonal spell bar as well. <br />
<br />
I would consider using the Sars if someone could tell me how to remove that annoying triangle off my mouse cursor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Welcome back, Talamay :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Don't be too generous with the welcomes, I may disappear for another two years at any time ;).<br />
<br />
Overwhelmed would be a good word to describe the feeling of simply logging in after two years.  At least I had seen the new UI when they first implemented it, so that wasn't too shocking.  All the extra crap though.. Help windows, Tip windows, etc O_o!  But I got a real laugh at the &quot;notify me when this amount of time has passed&quot; LOL.</div></div><hr />

Neat, just realized how long ago I joined this site :D.  Who's the admin around here these days?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I remember you being around here Talamay. Always seemed like a very sensible poster so welcome back. I wouldnt recommend EQ to any new players as it is now but its different for oldtimers like you so stay while you enjoy it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wazbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Welcome back into the game!<br />
<br />
If you want to get the feel for the game back just start slow and learn as you go.<br />
<br />
Maybe even reading information on the site, tons has changed in two years!</div></div><hr />

I remember the early pics of you in green.</div></div><hr />

Careful with the ego stroking there.<br />
<br />
Faern,<br />
<br />
Lol man I said that a long time ago.  I guess I'm wise, or something.  Talamay isn't... 231 wis lol.<br />
<br />
Talamay was my first class leader!<br />
Shut it or I'll make you into a handbag.  Who was that other shaman class leader in the guild - didn't she run off with someone's account or something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">welcome back Talamay!  Old school shamans in da house :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hey speaking of old school, is there anything I should bother exploring as a solo level 61 SHM with 3 AAs?  I've got mainly Velious/Kunark gear, and a JBB :D.  Heard a bunch of zones have been revamped...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I still have my Barbarian Symbol of the Initiate, which I believe was a quest posted by Talamay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hey Talamay, welcome back. Hehe this thread is like an old class reunion. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Actually you may enjoy exploring quite a few zones that have come out lately.  I'd check out CT, Droga (especially fun for solo shamans), and some of the new GoD zones like Qinimi.  If you wanna exp up a few levels fast, head to PoValor and levels go swiftly there.  Spells from 61-65 shouldn't be too hard to get now that most everyone has them that needs them.  I'd say don't bother with trying to get the runes and specs, just pharm equipment from Droga or GoD and sell it in the bazaar for the cash you need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Welcome back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Welcome back Talamay, I remember you from back in the early days, so to speak. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Myzr Snowman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Bah Welcome back I guess .......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Droga eh?  I'll have to check it out.  Kunark is the bomb and I think I can remember most of Droga from when I powerleveled my monk there.<br />
<br />
Speaking of old school shamans... Anyone know if Eduin is haunting any message boards?  Man he was entertaining.  Or rather, people's reactions to his posts were entertaining.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Welcome Back Old Timer.<br />
<br />
Make sure to check out the Plane of Justice. Especially pay attention to a little hidden door behind a Undead dorf somewhere down there. Great place to play as a shaman. <br />
<br />
<br />
EQ is really different but still the same. <br />

I'm still jealous of your hat though. Damn rats.</div></div><hr />

Oh... leather hat graphic?  I'm using the new models so I don't see the bear hat anymore.  Great sadness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">No! I wanted that hat so badly during the Velious days but I could never get anyone in my guild to go kill &quot;the good rats.&quot;</div></div><hr />

5 HP &gt; 5 AC.<br />
<br />
And no, I'm not kidding.<br />
Yes.  I know.<br />
<br />
I was saying that 3 years ago or whenever it was people were finally learning that AC &gt; WIS.  There weren't many people saying HP &gt; AC, but I count myself as one of those people.  <br />

Eduin was another.</div></div><hr />
