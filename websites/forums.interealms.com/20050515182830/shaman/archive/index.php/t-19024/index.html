<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>nuzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">that surreptitiously SOE has implemented a quest to upgrade all epics, and related them to GoD and not made them insane to get.<br />
<br />
The epic shall be as useful now as they were when they came out.<br />
<br />
This is my dream and wish for G.O.D., aa's after much thought i'm happy with what we got, and will hold judgement till after the expansion.<br />
<br />
Melee damage, well okay i want to tank but I cant do it all now can I.  Got BAIV couple weeks back and Extended torment IV augs and now my dots are good, i'm in a state of happy oxygen over breathing life.<br />
<br />
SO please make my dream come true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Malaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">epic2 came with every expansion release :)<br />
Well.... the rumors did :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Our 2nd epic is already in the game.<br />
Here it is (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=24699) <br />
The quest to get it is lengthy, taking many months to complete, and needs about 71 of your friends help kill all the raid targets to acquire it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>nuzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">that is quite a fancy epic2, but is there an alternate quest.  If not there should be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Its a drop from Plane of Time Nuzm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>nuzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Urdegish, ummmm yeah i knew that as being a smartass</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fynris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">lol... the quest being... get flagged for PoTime... har... still a damn nice item... <br />
<br />
But as an Epic... there is no dedicated story line that follows looting the Antithesis... <br />
<br />
I would also like to see an upgrade to current Epics that involve the Spear of Fate itself. Perhaps a quest that would 1) require the SoF, 2) Would involve relinquishing, augmenting or perhaps destroying the SoF in order to complete the quest for the upgraded Epic...<br />
<br />
Just some thoughts...<br />
<br />
Fyn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">hey, you should just be able to augment the SoF into the TA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fynris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Augmentation through LDoN augments is ok... but not really what I'm talking about here. I'm thinking more along the lines of a complete modification/augmentation of all stats, focus and effects on the SoF. <br />
<br />
Something like... questing after an item that... when combined in a special augmentation type container... would result in the new and improved Epic.<br />
<br />
IMHO... Epics have been diluted in importance with those Ele/Time loots... Epics should respresent the epitome item of our class... IMHO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Epics have been dliuted much longer than since Elementals.  They're Kunark era weapons, and have been replaceable since the immediately followed expansion:<br />
<br />
Velious:  Sprinkler of Spirits (NToV).<br />
Luclin:  Winterstorm (THO), Mace of Dark Thought, and lots of other things from VT with focus effects.<br />
PoP:  Even more buyable things that are better in primary, before you even reach raid level loot, which blows everything old out of the water.</div></div><hr />
