<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking for single supermodels who own their own brewery.  They must be open-minded, limber, and not opposed to sharing me with their supermodel friends.<br />
<br />
Having a twin sister will get you through the &quot;physical&quot; phase faster.<br />
<br />
Currently we are farming Victoria Secrets, however we will do backflagging at any lingerie shop of your choice.<br />
<br />
I envision a &quot;clan&quot; type guild with me as the guildmaster and the first 12  who sign up as officers. (Seeing as how you're all dedicated n stuff).  <br />
<br />
I plan on us getting together about as often as possible, however, with your modeling job I understand that not all can meet every night.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Application to the guild:<br />
<br />
Lvl:  22<br />
B.R.As (bouncy round advancments):  DD, which helps in things that can be important such as swimming (Floatation3), Cushoning (Pillows 2, will get pillows3 as soon as I get a few more B.R.As), Extra taunt (B.T. (boobie taunt)4...you try to ignore a nice set a B.R.As...)<br />
Brews:  Stouts, Ales and a few porters, also a grandmaster in distillery: able to make fine whiskeys and vodkas to get those pesky mobs extra drunk<br />
Flexability:  Very :p<br />
Gear: Come fairly well equiped with lots of Leather (36/28/34 mostly), my wpns are fairly new, a couple of cat-o-9-tails, a peice of leather with a ball in the middle (to silence the mobs), a couple of little clamps (to snare the mob via sticking them to his chest) and a few other toys.<br />
Current Flags:  Victoria's Secret, Friedrek's of Hollywood and a few others.<br />
<br />
Past Guild History:<br />
The Playboy Bunnies...left because they could no longer appease the freak in me.<br />
Hustler....a good group of people, but got a little too trashy for me.<br />
<br />
Why am I choosing this guild:  Because me and my Twin sister heard that it was the funnest around with a casual player base that still strives to please its members in many ways ;)<br />
<br />
Thank you for considering my app.  Hope to see you on many panty raids soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">you forgot to include what you can get your WT down to during raid time.  Please edit your app rather than replying.  withholding my vote for now until I can see you in action in group situations.</div></div><hr />
