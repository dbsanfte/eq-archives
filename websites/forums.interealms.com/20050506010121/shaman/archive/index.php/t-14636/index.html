<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, as it turns out, on top of the board issues I was having, my hard drive just went bad on the server and they are going to replace it this afternoon.<br />
<br />
I'm trying to make back ups now, but I'm not sure how much of it I'll get before it's done.<br />
<br />
Just wanted to let you know we may have some extended down time while I get this all sorted out :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Oooh, did we rollback a day?<br />
<br />
Glad to see the site back up.  :)</div></div><hr />
