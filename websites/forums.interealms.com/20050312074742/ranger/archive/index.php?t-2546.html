Pretty much it i think.<br />
<br />
I had started maxing hps out and stuff and was working to finish off durability and currently have 6 pts saved up.  Well i got to thinking that for 3 more points i could get ambidex and then my next points would be that much faster.<br />
<br />
So given what i have and that i primarily solo these days as i find raids immensely boring and have most of the top end gear available what would you pick to do?  Click dura3 or get 3 more for ambidex or something else entirely?<br />

Saving up 9 points at a time is a bitch, do it now and get it over with, then the most you have to save at any given time is 6, unless you're going to get DR3.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celt</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 02:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Where do you usually xp?<br />
<br />
If you want faster points grab ambidex first, then get yourself finishing blow one if you solo for xp in Maidens at all.  Quite the speed increase on lower dark blues, you will find.  Then ya can save 6 for ND3.<br />
<br />
Since you reside on a Zek, finishing might not be the best expenditure of points since it's a purely PVE skill...however it will increase the grind rate solo at say..the chief tree gorangas in Maidens or umbrous toilers.  <br />
<br />
Really, it's important to note that you are on the Zek..you fight people from time to time..not just mobs hehe...HP are pretty important, and ambidex sorta is a PVE skill too hehe.<br />
<br />
You use a 2hander a lot?  HP might be the best choice for survivability..you have a &quot;few&quot; hp for a zek ranger with no drop gear LOL (for instance..im sure he could be wearing mithril boots/gloves/velium encrusted and/or mosquito earrings etc...)  Over the 3k hump will make ya grin quite a bit, makes smackin the casters around a little easier....thinking about the manaburn guerilla warfare kinda freaks me out over there. <br />
<br />
Anyway in your situation, and wishing I would have started on a Zek, I would build from there...<br />
<br />
Ambidexterity<br />
Finishing Blow 1<br />
Natural Durability 3<br />
Channeling Focus 1<br />
Casting Fury 1,2,3<br />
Mental Clarity 3<br />
Healing Gift 2,3<br />
Natural Healing 1,2,3<br />
Body and Mind Rejuvenation<br />
Combat Agility 2<br />
Combat Stability 2,3<br />
Combat Agility 3<br />
<br />
Ambidex will speed up kiling casters, and pretty much every melee mob you will ever face by enough of a margin to want this first.  With your weaponry I estimate around 6-7 dps average on luclin content increase.<br />
<br />
Finishing Blow makes the grinding more fun, and saves &quot;kill that snared mob that's running&quot; time, 10 seconds of attacking per mob adds up after FBlow 32 in an xp grind day, all at level 1 (2 points).  And, just for kicks..it works with your bow...so why not :)  Cheap 2 points for speed of kills.  Heh, wonder how broken this would be if it worked on pcs...<br />
<br />
Durability because hitpoints are god on the Zeks, and frankly pretty much anywhere for survivability.<br />
<br />
Channel focus because its cheap, and it helps your spells under pressure.  I have level 2 of this skill....I didn't see much improvement from level 2, but level 1 sure was noticable in duels especially.  (double joust run of 300+ total on me during a finishing calefaction channeled through).<br />
<br />
Calefaction and firestrike with casting fury 3 just plain tear up hilly terrain ....if you ever get jumped in Maidens terrain kills our archery in combat there a lot of the time....Oasis memories.<br />
When you crit for 900 you can usually get an interrupt on someone else who is casting, say, manaburn for instance.  It also makes the always on Call of Fire processes a bit more potent.  This skill isn't so hot at the first 2 levels..but if you have the time to max it, do it.  If for no reason than increasing your total killing power.  Luck is good right?<br />
<br />
Clarity 3 because you want the gas to fuel the developed spell skills, and to prep for body and mind.<br />
<br />
Gift 2 and 3 so that gheal will be a heated-combat-useful heal 1 out of 10 casts.  The one that crits will save your life eventually, or your friend.<br />
<br />
Regen for the &quot;attrition kills&quot; rule....We tear things up quickly, but we don't have much of a way to fix our hits other than to kite and regen a lot of the time..and besides you need body and mind :)<br />
<br />
Body and Mind so your blue comes back a lot faster, and the extra regen is pretty nice :)<br />
<br />
Then finish up tanking in no particular order :)<br />
<br />
<br />
If you raided, I'd do tanking immediately...if you PVE primarily, or just want to get the xp-survivability stuff out of the way,  get tanking before developing your spells.  <br />
<br />
My $1.25 hehe, sorry novel :)  AA is a lot of fun :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeril of Veeshan</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 04:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I only wish my problems were all of THIS nature .... &lt;sigh&gt;<br />
<br />
But I do have a similar question:<br />
At 52 I put off leveling for awhile (mostly on account of Vox/Naggy, the punks) and snagged run3 while I waited.  Well, I'm done with those two, and moving on.  I'm one night of hard exp from 53, and planning on plugging out to Warder before turning AA back on.  Now, my question is where to put my next 3 points in general, and I have narrowed it down to three options.<br />
1) Innate Regen 3 - my original plan<br />
2) Innate Stamina (3) - for the HP, duh<br />
3) Innate Dexterity (3) - so that I can ditch some of my dex gear and focus more on Sta/HP gear.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?  <br />
<br />
&lt;ps - sorry if I hijack this thread, hopefully folks will reply to both&gt;</div></div><hr />

do Run3 Regen3 and then save your points.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Feeldary</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 05:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i would pick ambi</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tough call.  That last &quot;point&quot; in Durability (3) is a nice 5% boost in base HP.  Ambidex is nice too.  I went the Durability 3 route (still don't have ambi, saving for it), because I dual-comp with a cleric &amp; just complete heal myself all day long, so HP is where it's at for me.<br />

<br />
Actually, each point of natural stamina gives 2 STA, resulting in a max additional innate 20 STA, or 84 HP.<br />
<br />
If you have durability maxed out &amp; physical enhancement, I believe it's closer to 4.7hp/sta, or a total of 94HP (for 10 AA points).</div></div><hr />

What should be my next focus?<br />
<br />
AM3<br />
durability<br />
Stability<br />
EQ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You get 2, not 1, STA per AA point in Stamina, up to a maximum of 10 STA (5 AA points).  That's 45 HP, given ND2 and PE.  I would max ND before spending any on Stamina though.</div></div><hr />

With sta and dura 3 i have 1806hp naked. That is off the orginal base of 1601. I think it was worth it for me.</div></div><hr />
