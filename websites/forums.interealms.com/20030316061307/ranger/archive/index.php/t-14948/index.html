<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>manlaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">well lol is it? cause in the late game you have pretty nice gear so is the starting stats realy that important?<br />
good hunting...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Elindel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No, it's not that important in the end.  But if you are starting out now, you might as well do it right :p<br />
<br />
I was a true newbie, and Elindel was my first rolled char, and I spread my points around way too much wanting to start with basically even stats.  So I have 5 points in things like CHA and INT.  Do they hurt me at 65?  no, I still easily max my STA and DEX when buffed, and if anything I'd like the extra points in STR and WIS now, but I would never recommend dumping a bunch there at start.<br />
<br />
But I can always even it out with AA now if I want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>entilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It won't be true for everyone but i still feel the pinch (even at 49) from my starting stats... specifically NOT putting any points into STA.  Since this was my first char and i foolishly followed the creation guide on castersrealm which back then suggested dumping into AGI (I think it was made at the time AC was considered king, and i noticed that it has changed since).  Anyhow, my trouble is, I'm not a rich ranger and have found that my clothing options have been limited due to my need to get my STA over 100.  What's worse is some of my current STA is weapon dependent... so when i switch to my swarmy, i dip below 100.  I think i started my woodelf with 75 STA (no points added) which means I need 26 STA points to get it to 101.  Items with more than about 5 STA are just too expensive for this cash-poor ranger so i need to have at least 5 items equipped with STA on it and that limits my equip choices.  Perhaps after I get a shot at some uber or slightly sub-uber equipment it won't be as bad.  Either that or I spend a month farming. If I wasn't so reluctant to go thru hell levels again, I probably should have restarted.  But for now, it's just another limitation I need to overcome.  (though for fun i did start a noob ranger with more appropriate stats on another server just for fun).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">In the long run, starting stats don't matter much, but there are certainly times...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ytrill Stonebow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Drienne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Starting stats aren't important in the long run.  However, it can really change your gear early on.  Like entilzah having to concentrate on STA (although you need 100, not 101 to negate the effects of fatigue in combat).  I'd say it depends on what class you choose.  Human/Wood Elf, go straight STA.  Half Elf, put some points into WIS/STA.  Getting your Wisdom up, even 5 or 10 points, to begin, will help you in the early and mid levels a bit.  However, my very best advice for general use is: all melee/hybrid, put points in STA.  Get to 100 from bonus points if you can, then look elsewhere (STR or WIS).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Philby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Not important. The stamina people suggest to put all you points into stamina - but that is only 120 or so points at level 60. <br />
<br />
Stamina is important to get to 100, so you don't lose combat stats when the stamina bar is at zero.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Viken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Stamina also = Hitpoints</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Toshiden Satori</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you are rolling a new character now... sure starting points matter.  I would think it obvious that all the points possible should be going to STA... but if you didn't do this when you made your character, you would still be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rezz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">At end game, all your melee stats will be maxxed either through equipment, Avatar or buffs.<br />
<br />
WIS will be the only stat you will not be able to max out.<br />
<br />
If I HAD to do it all over again, I would put it all into WIS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Draghixia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would have set 2 prioritys if I restarted now.  100 sta then everything else into wis.<br />
<br />
Once I got STA out of the way then everything else does free you up to gear issues (most before you hit your 40s when it came to stamina.<br />
<br />
Oh and I shure as hell wouldnt have been a half-elf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Arimae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">For those who say it doesn't matter, consider this:<br />
Two weapons drop. Both excellent ratios, one has 10agi 10int, the other 10wis 10sta. Which would you choose??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>timcooper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">if i started again with the pure intention to goto hi lvl i owuld have to say  go max wis, BUT id be twinked so stam well over 100. I struggled very badly with low stamina for along while levelling up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Azareal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I would have to say &quot;Yes&quot;, at the start though. At the end of the day (high end game) it really doesn't matter all that much. Just don't go the way I did, lol - Human and Karana diety (doh!), with almost everything in Dex and Agi.<br />
<br />
Yes, I was a true newbie, had absolutely no idea what Sta and Wis was for. With the lack of any points in Sta, I really seriously cannot (support) tank for any serious amount of time. With the lack of any points in Wis, well, let's just say that I sit around a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Feeldary</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">on the short run, it doesnt count that much<br />
<br />
however...<br />
since items are rare, you might be unable to reach the caps unbuffed.<br />
<br />
just imagine, you have the choice between a 20 sta 50 hp item (10kpp), and a 40 sta 50 hp one (50kpp).<br />
if your sta is 265/305 you'll pick the 40/50 one.<br />
if your sta is 285/305 thanks to your 20 starting points into sta, you'll pick the 20/50 one.<br />
<br />
having better starting stats will make you have lower needs to reach the caps. not so big issue, but it can counts on the very long run.</div></div><hr />
