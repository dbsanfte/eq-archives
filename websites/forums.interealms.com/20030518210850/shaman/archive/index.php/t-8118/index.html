<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey chaps. Whilst putting together links for the epic FAQ, (see sticky) I've been having trouble finding a thread that talks about the order of the epic quest and which steps must be done in what order.<br />
<br />
Could we have a quick discussion on that? What steps need to be done in a specific order? What hand ins must be completed before progressing to the next step? Anything to watch out for? Any tips?<br />
<br />
Please don't post about factioning and skipping, thats covered in other threads. Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">All turn-ins must be done in the order outlined in the walkthrough. Assuming you have not factioned at all, the next mob will not like you if you do not do the previous bit first. For instance, when I gave my woe/envy/marr's promise to the wandering spirit, without doing the test of patience, he ate it.<br />
<br />
The following items can be killed and looted at any time:<br />
Tear from Iskar's Child in Fear<br />
Ghiosk's books from CoM<br />
5 reports and Student's Log from CoM<br />
Black Dire's pelt from Mistmore<br />
Woe/Envy/Marr's Promise from Rathe Mountains<br />
<br />
Everything else - and all the turn-ins - must be done in order. (Kirn, Neh, Rak, the tests, etc).</div></div><hr />
