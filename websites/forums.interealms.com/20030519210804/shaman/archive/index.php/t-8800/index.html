<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xelot Bloodseer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am currently working on the Iron Cudgel of the Channeler. I think I may have learned a few things dealing with the froglok Ton Warriors.<br />
<br />
First, the area that they spawn in is around the iksar brigand camp just south of the FoB zone area (2400, 0). From Cabilis, head off to the right from the city gates past the ruined buildings. You'll see a path starting in or near the water. If you follow that path, you'll see a large column as you get to the end. As you go over the small hill in front of you, you'll see the camp right there.<br />
<br />
It seems that the frogloks are not part of the normal spawn cycle in that little area. You must kill the roaming mobs in the area to get them to spawn. The more you kill, the better chance you have of getting them to pop. <br />
<br />
The Ton Warriors (and others) seem to spawn mostly at night (that was when I made all of my kills). I read a spoiler for the SK Kukri quest that uses the &quot;froglok raiders&quot; and it mentioned them only spawning at night. It looks like it holds true for the Tons as well. It also seemed that most of the Ton's spawned north of the camp and wandered south thru or near the bandit camp. I caught all but one heading south (the one was headding east, but towards the camp). I eventually started hanging out on top of the tents to get a good view of the surrounding area. It made it easier to spot a frog getting worked over of near the treeline.<br />
<br />
I experimented a bit with only killing one type of mob to see if I could figure out which were the place holders. I think I had better luck with the mosquitos then anything else. It's kind of difficult to tell because a lot of the wanderers will add. (Man eating vines, some of the higher level mosquitos, skells, the devourers, etc.)<br />
<br />
If there is one piece of advice I can give, it's to keep the area as dead as possible. The reason for this is that all of the frogs will agro (or be agro'd by) the first non-frog, non-bandit they run into and usually get owned. So, anytime I seen a frog fighting something, I assisted the frog first, then killed him. Otherwise you'll get KS'd by the monster. I had a few of the frog shamans slowing and debuffing mobs for me to tank. :) I saved 3 of the 8 Ton's from death at the hands of other mobs, only to kill them myself moments later (netting 2 of the 4 pieces for me). This is why you never see them on track. They are KOS to nearly everything in that area and if left alone, will die in minutes.<br />
<br />
At 30th level, I was making very good experience off of roughly half the mobs in the area. The brigands would only agro me if I sat down near them or a charmed leech wandered in to the camp area. They otherwise never added to any pulls. The Ton's were all blue as were some of the other frogs that popped. Venomous Lamprays are also blue as are some of the skells and bigger mosquitos. The Devourers were about half blue at 30, the rest light blue. The seem to be pretty high agro and will attack anyone reguardless of level.<br />
<br />
I hope this info helps someone with this part of the quest. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They really do wander quite a bit. Infact I think I only killed one at that camp. The rest of the time I just wandered around with a druid killing every single froglok I found. Took me a few days to get all the pieces. Good post.</div></div><hr />
