<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok, as milestones go, this one is not exactly a &quot;bigee&quot;, and its probably so pathetic that most of you guys will be chuckling into your coffee, but I always dreamed of 1 day having 1000AC and 200wis, self buffed.<br />
<br />
Well, got Lodi shield last night (tanked him for half of fight cos I generated more aggro than all the melees heh heh)...<br />
<br />
Anyway, yup, I got it 1000AC 200wis, self buffed<br />
<br />
Go me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Grats, but I'd seriously consider working on your HP total.  I does make a HUGE difference later on.  Consider sacrificing wis, then AC to do it.<br />
<br />
Still grats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nice work, you're doing better than I was at that level.<br />
<br />
Sell your crystal chitin shield, get an SBS instead. You'll make a significant profit on the deal, gain more hp, more resists, and have money to burn on something else.<br />
<br />
Just my opinion of course :) In the longer term you'll probably want to look at an Orb of the Infinite Void.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I do have a Sarnak Battle Shield - I wear it when I'm soloing, or when I'm in a group or raid situation where I get summoned a lot (KD arena for example). There are 2 profiles on my magelo (a) wis, and  (b) AC. I guess you get the wisdom one!<br />
<br />
The Tribunal smiled upon me again this weekend, so I now have runecrafters greaves as well! Go me again!</div></div><hr />
