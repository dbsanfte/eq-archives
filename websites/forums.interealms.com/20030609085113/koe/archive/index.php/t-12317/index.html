<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For the last 2 days (got it a little early thanks to some website) I've been listening to Weird Al's Poodle Hat album just released in stores today. I must say it's friggin awesome, there's about 2 tracks or so that IMO kinda suck but the rest are either instant hits or will grow on you (50-60% instant hits and 20-30% will be so so at first and then grow on you). There's a parody on Eminem's song that was the theme for 8 Mile. Also there's Ode to the Superhero to the tune of Ode to the Piano Man which is about Spider Man the Movie. Overall amazingly funny and good listening as a whole. The E-Bay song I think is my fav, well that and the Eminem parody.<br />
<br />
P.S. thanks for all the good messages, PM's on Aim/Yahoo/ICQ ets, and emails. I'm feeling FREE, even though it's only been a short time since I logged back on I feel like a new born man, free from the machine, free from the NEED to logon...<br />
<br />
Lastly let me leave you with the lyrics to E-Bay which is a parody off of Backstreet Boy's song Want it That Way... Not sure about 2 lines in the lyrics they where hard to make out.<br />
