<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I believe this is the important part of the text:<br />
Dere be four leetel buggiez dat Grimror still neez, seegeen, scaveen, genereen, and harroon. Yuuz bring Grimror dere skinz and Grimror geeve you anyting yuuz want.' <br />
<br />
<br />
What I understand from this :<br />
There are 4 types of bugs named seegeen, scaveen, genereen, and harroon.<br />
<br />
The names are probably phonetic versions of the actual names, so expect somewhat different spellings.<br />
<br />
Kill the various bug types, collect their skins, and return one of each to Grimror to get whatever the reward may be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A trip to PoD may be in order now...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">scaveen<br />
<br />
This one, at least, is the &quot;scavien fly&quot;, RARE spawn fly to the right of ZI.  Don't know what the drop is though - servers went down about 2 minutes before we could pull it =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Stonienogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">killing worms and puslings in pod tonight, had a scaevian larvae pass us, pulled and dropped Scaevian Larvae Flesh nodrop. maybe they're all worms, or one named of different mob types?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Beginning to agree; its all about the larvae.<br />
In addition to the Scaevian Larva you confirmed, I can confirm Seegien Larva, and The Safehouse can confirm Harrion Larva, all of which drop their appropriate named gooey bit.<br />
<br />
Looks like its back to the worms for me - this had better be something GOOD - these named suckers are RARE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Stonienogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">been camping the worms a couple days now, just got Generian Larvae Flesh from a generian larvae, 2 more to go :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Of course, the quest does sound much like the quest for canni 2, where we gathered rare alchemical ingredients, and simply got a reward, not anything to do with alchemy :( <br />
<br />
  I do pray that the reward is a resipe book though.   Even if in riddle, we would have something to work with beyond just clicking everything we get in teh planes with every herb in existence</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Stonienogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">safehouse solved this : http://pub146.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessage?topicID=5747.topic<br />
<br />
it's the questable entrance to CoD, as opposed to the brute force method of killing Grummus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It's a talisman with insta-click disease resist (forget the name offhand)  and it's also the key to CoDecay.<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Sigh.<br />
<br />
That sucks!<br />
<br />
No alchemy recepies at all?!?!?!?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dunwut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Maybe the guy he works for, Zulort, gives out some alchemy quests?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Edit - D'OH!   I can read.  Sure I can.    I can notice that someone provided a link to the quest.   I didn't scan the top few replies &amp; then open my trap.<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>atarak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I guess I should have posted in here earlier, but since I'm here now, I'll break out the bad news.<br />
<br />
With the exception of the quintesence of knowledge recipe, there are no new Alchemy recipes for PoP. This of course, may change over time, but for now, stop looking, its not there.<br />
<br />
How do I know this? Well, I flat out asked Scott Hartsman the other day. He did tell me they're trying to develop some new ones, so  keep an eye on patch messages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The other bad news is that this &quot;alternate&quot; way to get into CoD will NOT let you progress further into the PoP storyline.  You still need to kill Grummus at some point.</div></div><hr />
