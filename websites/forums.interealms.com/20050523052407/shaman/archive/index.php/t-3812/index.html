<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Dropped Torpor this evening, went to 57 shaman. Only me left now, 54 shaman, to get it from raid. /pray :)<br />
<br />
Didnt know he dropped it either :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">So Torpor is officially less rare than Vibrating Gauntlets. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I actually got my torpor from the Overking, back at level 54.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I go on lots of Chardok Raids; Over 12 King kills, I've seen him drop Torpor once and VoB another time.   Lvl 60 shaman who needed there got Torpor, I did get VOB though.   I crack 1k AC with it cast ;)</div></div><hr />

No in my guild.  <br />
<br />
He's given us Vibrating Gauntlets but no shaman spell.</div></div><hr />

I have it in my bank but I cant decide if I should scribe it or not.  I mean.... what the hell would you use it for if you have group focus?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lovista Atreides</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You stop using it when you get single target focus, but I guess if your in a group of people who don't want focus, then it would serve some purpose, but most of them probably don't really want dex :)</div></div><hr />
