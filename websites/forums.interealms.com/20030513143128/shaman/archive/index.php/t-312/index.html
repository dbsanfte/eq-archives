<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">8th ring insta-click effect is very handy, as is the damage shield.<br />
9th ring is awesome stats.<br />
Well worth it IMO, though I'm still stuck on waiting on the lady for the 8th one.  Some good guides at www.monkly-business.com if you need them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>smashie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For a shaman-<br />
<br />
8th ring is worth it for anybody if you need an instant clicky for indoors and out.<br />
the dmg shield does not stack with potion dmg shield though.<br />
<br />
9th ring is worth it for the 9sta and 50hp.<br />
<br />
10th ring is worth it for the instant cast effect and 100hp. Regen 10hp/tick, 10 atk and 10 dmg shield. <br />
However it does not stack with regrowth. <br />
<br />
Regrowth is 16hp/tick vs 10th ring 10hp/tick. Taking into account that the ring is an instant click effect, it's a free regen buff that stacks with fungi tunic.<br />
<br />
There are very few rings in the game that are better than the 10th ring. And certainly no other ring in the game that provides an instant regen buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmm.<br />
<br />
Should shaman stop the quest at the 9th ring?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">by all means, get 10th if you can, but that's a bit IF. most shammies just won't be able to get past 9th because the 10th war is a long, hard, guild achievement that requires 30+ people near lvl 60.<br />
<br />
9th can be done with 10 peeps or so in a few hours, and it's fun! very abnormal encounters and xp to boot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Um, maybe it's been tweaked, Orakul, but I don't think 30 people can handle the 10th ring war.  Maybe 60 people, predominantly level 60s.  (not kidding)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Snacko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I personally wear the 9th ring, its a very nice ring.  Just did the 10th ring war last night, had about 55 level 60's there to do it, and it went smoothly, all of the hero's stayed alive and the war was won.<br />
<br />
I think 30 for a war of that maginitude is really pushing it.  The first 2 major waves (recruits and warriors) could probably be done.  But the veterans on the final wave are seriously tough.  Not slowable with turgurs, had to break out Plague of Insects, which just gets you killed a lot :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Indamus Mahendra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">smashie - the 10th ring is a perm effect - PERM 10pt regen/dmg shield that most definetely stacks with regrowth<br />
<br />
just so ya know :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gnawl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">10rh ring right click affect does not stack with regrowth or group regrowth. I just got my 10th ring yesterday and tested it. Regen spells overwrite the 10th ring effect. If you try to do the 10th ring effect when you got regen up it wont stick.<br />

<br />
Just so ya know, you are wrong.  Its a clicked effect, not a permanent effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">heh...i'd laugh my ass off if i saw a shaman using 10th ring and a fungi tunic as his main bp =p<br />
<br />
who needs fungi when you got torpor ^.^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The 10th rings effect is an instaclick item and it doesn't stack with regen effects.<br />
<br />
As far as the war it's self goes it probably could be handled by 30 people if they had done the war multiple times before and had practice at it. It would help if you all had dorf faction to be able to use the dorfs for additional help. That is assuming you'll probably get 20-30 misc mid to high lvl people who just want to see the war and join in on your side.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Mez got to ask... mez have no choice....<br />
<br />
Why not do da quest twice at da same time so end up with both the 10th and 9th ring,  or the 9th and 8th ring.  Mez just a stupid ogre but dem rings look very nice and woth da effort.<br />
<br />
Am mez mising sumting obvious?<br />
