<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With the demise of Belgar's Alchemy, I've been reworking his files (with his permission) to adapt them for EQ Traders.  The result is the EQ Traders Corner guide to  Learning Alchemy (http://www.eqtraders.com/learn/learn_alchemy.htm).  <br />
<br />
I've gotten most of the pages pretty much up to date, but I need help with a few big sections.  I need help narrowing down the trivials for the Recipes (http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_alchemy.htm), especially for the reintroduced Old Alchemy.  There are even a few Revamp potions (from the same era as SoW potions) that don't have precise trivials figured yet.  <br />
<br />
I also would love to get the Dropped Ingredient Locations (http://www.eqtraders.com/alchemy/alchemy_drops.htm) checked over by as many people as possible and fleshed out more.  I created it almost entirely off of memories from way back when, and from a little bit of recent experience gathering stuff to test the reintroduced recipes since Luclin.  But I know I've surely missed stuff.<br />
<br />
There is also Belgar's very ambitious What Does Each Alchemy Potion Really Do? (http://www.eqtraders.com/learn/learn_alchemy3.htm)  I have neither the financial resources nor the time to work out potion effects to that kind of detail for every single recipe now available with Luclin, both the brand new 180+ stuff and the Old Alchemy.  But if anyone who uses even one of those potions on a regular basis offers what they know about that one, or if anyone who's got one left over from playing with some herbs takes a little bit to make some notes about precise durations and effects, all those contributions will add up.<br />
<br />
So if you have any more information to offer, about these pages or any of the others, please don't hesitate!  Post it here or over on the EQ Traders Alchemy Forum (http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm68), either one is fine.<br />
<br />
Thanks much!</div></div><hr />

Another thing I loved, on Belgar's old site, being Alchemy is so expensive was the price per attempt. It gave me an idea which potions I should make to increase my skill and not totally bust my bank account. Most ptions do not sell so to make the cheapest one to the trivial level to give me skill increases was important to me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've got that too, under Alchemy Prices (http://www.eqtraders.com/prices/alchemy.htm)...it's linked off of the Learn Alchemy page, just didn't mention it above. :)  It's even sorted by trivial, for just the sort of use that you propose.  Right now I'm trying to figure out how best to indicate which potion line a given potion belongs to, to help people more quickly find the recipe since they are sorted primarily by potion line (Old Alchemy, Revamp Alchemy, Gypsy Alchemy, or Luclin Alchemy).<br />
<br />
There were only two big things that I deliberately removed from Belgar's wealth of information.  The pricing guide was replaced by a brief explanation of alchemy pricing customs in the FAQ.  The loose herb cross-reference would have been too big and relatively not very useful with the new strains of herbs with Luclin muddying the waters.  Other than that, I no longer have pictures up for of each of the herbs, but everything else is there in some form or another.  Only four months later! :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
