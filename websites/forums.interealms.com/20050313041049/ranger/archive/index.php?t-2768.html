Have to say I'm really disappointed that the Planar Oak ones don't look like they'll be comparable to even the weakest of the DN bows for ratio though. These are obviously the best bows we'll be able to make (unless PoP changes things) and, well, they simply don't justify the cost and time-sink required for crafting them when a Wrapped Velium goes for as little as 1 or 2k on many servers. I hate whingeing, and yes the stats are nice, but if the top bow really is 28/43 which would be my guess too then I'll feel pretty let down about the effort I put into getting grandmaster fletching.<br />
<br />
I really wish VI would just coordinate their content teams better - the top end smithed plate is godly whilst the top end fletched bow is unsellable other than as a stat booster or head-turner. Admittedly smithing has been a much harder craft than fletching to get to grandmastery, but even so I find it very hard to believe the smithing revamp was designed by the same people who are responsible for the fletching revamp. The whole philosophy of how the top-end crafted should fit in to the bigger picture seems completely out of whack between the various crafts.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm being overly negative, but I honestly regret going over 200 in fletching now and I just can't see me using it ever again once I make the few acrylia arrows I'll need one day for EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ueauvan</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 03:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well so far with shadewood and acrylia and mithril etc ive had 4 skill ups in 289 attempts to get to 209, dex 217 or wis 208<br />
<br />
receipe alloy plus planar plus knife = beam<br />
<br />
beam plus knife 2 cams plus light mithril string<br />
<br />
the double is beam plus alloy plus knife<br />
<br />
durable beam plus 2 cams light mithril string knife<br />
<br />
thats what i failed on<br />
<br />
the killer here isnt the acrylia it now drops in ten mount the deep grim for and scarlet desert<br />
<br />
enchanting the mithril is a pain but np<br />
<br />
the real killer is celestial temper you need a rogue i think ( was given the temper by a 202 skill warder) blue diamond dust etc<br />
<br />
after 4 hours today im gutted i failed<br />
<br />
my skills are smithing 151, brewing 161<br />

<br />
