<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was reading my servers raid message board, and I keep seeing need lots of clerics need lots of clerics, doesn't that seem quite overpowering? You can never have enough clerics it seems like and if you don't have enough for a raid your hosed. Yet you have 3 shamans after the mob is slow what do we do? Not that I'm ranting about clerics(although I guess I am), but it sure seems unfair that they are in such high demand for just about anything.  On the otherside I would never want to be a cleric.. just doesn't seem anyfun I gotta give them that.</div></div><hr />

 I can't speak for the other priest classes, but I always figured that shamans and druids didn't choose that class with healing being a prime responsibility in mind. Those choosing the cleric class of course did.<br />
<br />
She makes a good point, y'know, I picked a Shaman so I could do stuff besides sit down, stand up, and heal. So why do we all want this? Can't we just ask for a /makeshamancleric command for the heal-envy types?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's the thing, though-I picked shaman because they are supposed to be a priest utility class. Part of the utility is healing. Where I would like to see shaman healing at is the point at which if you can't find a cleric or a druid you can have a shaman heal for a group if they work at it hard, lay off of other things (like damage), and maybe get a little help from a necro or hybrid. Not to near the point of replacing a cleric, but enough to do things without one if I need to. That's the way the vast majority of the game is, and it 's how I think all of the game should be.<br />

<br />
If they can live through that, give em the bloody cake.<br />
In all honesty, clerics aren't just healers.  They have decent utility spells but they are far from the more intresting or or exciting class to play.  A Shaman can do things no cleric could dream of, no reason to complain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I say make a class and give them death touch and nothing else. No one would want to play a class as boring as that.<br />
<br />
Anyone who thinks the Cleric class is boring needs to lean back for a second and think about what a Shaman does. We are so ****ing one dimensional that we have become stubborn. <br />
<br />
How many of you slow the mob on &quot;inc&quot; even when it isn't necessary and the tank can take the beating of it unslowed better than we can even slowed? <br />
How many have been told to wait a second before they attempt to slow during their career and have felt like being &quot;slapped in the face&quot;? Ever wondered why Enchanters aren't nearly as stubborn or overly quic on the draw when it comes to slowing even though they can handle aggro much better?<br />
<br />
Wake up, if you think that a particular class is a lot more boring than most, you are wrong. Balance should be independant from &quot;fun&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There are probably a lot more clerics around than any other class simply because they're so desired. You can't really go wrong with one per group, whether it's an exp group or a raid. Even in LDoN normals where you can happily get by with another class healing, I doubt anyone would complain if you added a cleric to the group.<br />
<br />
Clerics have the best heals, the best rezzes, but they've grown up that way, it's always been that way. In challenging content like GoD, I don't think it's too bad that you need a cleric in your group - it's been that way at the start of each expansion and maybe time will come when it won't necessarily be the case.<br />
<br />
I do think it's wrong where 2 clerics work better in a group than a cleric + anyone else though. The classes this hurts most are the DPS and utility classes - there are several classes who can only really fill a &quot;DPS&quot; slot and if you need 2 healers, there's one less spot for all the rest. Oh, and one less cleric to group with other people too.<br />
<br />
Speaking of overpowered, enchanters get great mind buffs, the best haste, the best crowd control abilities, a slow only slightly lower than the best, and on top of that, add a charmed pet and they're the highest DPS class by far. Yes, it's dangerous, I wouldn't want just any old enchanter to do it. I have seen shamans post that they feel unnecessary with a charmed pet in the group - but I'd suggest that wizards, mages, rogues, rangers - the pure DPS classes - probably feel it worse. At least we can slap a heal on the enchanter when charm breaks. They're being outclassed at their own game by a class that's not traditionally a DPS class at all.<br />
<br />
I don't like seeing other classes nerfed, but a charmed pet in GoD makes SO much difference to a group, it doesn't seem fair to anyone else, and I can't imagine it staying the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">How many of you slow the mob on &quot;inc&quot; even when it isn't necessary and the tank can take the beating of it unslowed better than we can even slowed?<br />
<br />
*Shrug* if you slow it on inc, it's not really taking anything away from what else you could be doing, and so what if that tank can take an unslowed beating, the mob is still more controllable slowed, and the tank requires less healing (so clerics can nuke, hehe) and anyone else who over agros will be safer. I certainly see nothing wrong with slowing a mob even if it doesn't strictly need to be.<br />
<br />
<br />

Ever wondered why Enchanters aren't nearly as stubborn or overly quic on the draw when it comes to slowing even though they can handle aggro much better?<br />
<br />
Some shamans do like to be the stubborn tanks, yes, and enchanters can handle agro better, but if the mob is hitting them hard and they can't channel a spell through, they're more likely to die than us.<br />
<br />
At least we can malos which is low agro, if the enchanter tashes in inc, splat. An enchanter will often tash before slow, and so is used to waiting so as not to get agro. Shamans are used to being able to tough it out if we do get agro. It's a difference of approach that we've grown up with in the game.<br />
<br />
If someone suggests waiting before slow, though, I usually take their advice - there are lots of mobs in the game that I don't want hitting me at all if I can help it.<br />
<br />

<br />
Nah, some classes are more boring than others. That doesn't negate your second statement though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>BelegurthValar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Shrug.  I disagree Giac.  If all you're doing is slowing the mob and hanging back then of course it's going to be boring.  However, a cleric basically gets to sit and watch health bars.  I played one for two years, trust me when I tell you that it gets rather mind numbing.  It's the same with a wizard.  ALl you do it hot hotkey to nuke, concussion, concussion, nuke, nuke, sit med.  Not exactly fun.  I'm much happier with a class where I can play cc/healer/slower in a group, and constanlty run around doing whatever I can.  <br />
<br />
You can't attribute the same feeling to raids on a higher Elemental/Time/GoD tier though.  At that point you're a cog in the wheel, just like everyone else but the puller/Assist.  You do what you can to make life easier, but as our main raid leader said one day &quot;Anyone can change the outcome of any raid.  It's a matter of taking the initive&quot;  It's very true.  And it dosen't just mean slowing the mobs when they arrive at camp, it's watching the MA, helping heal the puller and assisting in whatever way you can.  If you hang back and quasi afk and slow a mob once very five minutes, of course you're going to get bored.<br />
<br />
But you'd get bored with any class then.<br />
<br />
Terms of enchanters:  It takes a bloody good enchanter to be able to pull that off in terms of GoD groups, and for every good enchanter who i'd trust to handle a charmed pooka there are twenty who'd fail miserably and wipe the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">There are a two ways to view &quot;overpowered&quot; and sadly only 1 seems to get much attention.<br />
<br />
<br />
   A class that can do alone what an entire group tries to do, is overpowered.   This had been us one time with doin dragons in WW.  Come PoP it was anyone that could charm something.  Now in GoD it is still those who can charm.<br />
<br />
  The other way you can be overpowered doesn't get as much attention IMO, but it is when you become indispensible.<br />
<br />
  -If no shaman is around you can still raid using an extra healer or 2, a stronger tank and an enchanter.<br />
  -If no warrior is around you have to settle for lower level content or bring a TON of extra healers (at some points not even that can get you by so you need a HUGE supply of backup knights).<br />
  -If no clerics are around, you have to settle for TRIVIAL content, or have a raid that is almost 1/3 druids.<br />
<br />
<br />
  So you can either look at overpowered as being as far as solo capability, or as far as group/raid DEPENDANCE.  I personally don't think that group/raid DESIRE is a factor in overpowering.  Someone will be best at some area which is most critical, even if those 2 clarifications are by a small margin.  However, to have things grind to a halt in the absence of a certain class is really, really stupid.<br />
<br />
  As for being overpowered in the solo field, I don't mind that really.   Those characters will farm up their AA and gear, then move on to an alt when they have nothing else to work on.  Just look at bards with their swarm kiting.  Most all of the high end bards I know rack up a couple hundred AA real fast, then only log in the bard for raids.  If all solo ability overpowered classes were THAT far overpowered it'd make it a trivial concern IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Soulcraver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The problem isn't the class, or its abilities.  It is the craptastic content design that renders lots of ancillary abilities null and void.  Things that used to matter just don't.<br />
<br />
This trend started in PoP and is full blown in GoD.  This is what happens when creativity is scraped and replaced with simply how hard mobs can hit, how much they can mitigate, and how many HP they have, which then leads to the need to continually increase the power (across the board) of all items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Overpowered to me is, is a class that can do something so impactive and yet little or no risk.  Enchanter charm comes to mind, but when it was whacky over a year ago before SOE changed some things.  <br />
<br />
It's also overpowered to me, if a class has several abilities (spells, AA, discs) that other classes may have similar, but the bridge gap is huge in regards to effect.  And if the other classes don't have anything else to fill the gaps with, it's even worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">One word answers your question:  STACKABILITY<br />
<br />
If you have 10 clerics (or 10 wizards) on a raid, it's a good thing.  If more than 4 or 5 shamans show up, they start self-destructing, for lack of anything useful to do ... e.g. &quot;ok, who's on spirit pouch duty tonight?&quot;  You can't have too many clerics, druids, rogues, wizards, rangers - because DPS ALWAYS stacks.  Healing ALWAYS stacks.  If our healing could make a dent, we would stack.  Or, if our healing was moderately mana/time -efficient, we would stack.<br />
<br />
Now that EQ is completely raid-centric (you can't even venture into half of the zones in the last two expansions without a significant raid force around you), the shaman - whose raid utility is seriously lacking - is left out in the cold.<br />

I sort of agree. We (shaman) do have problems beyond content design. However onedimensional design certainly plays a large part too, not only for us but also for a lot of other classes, both in single group and raid content.</div></div><hr />

Gimme 5 shams any raid, theres a reason guilds own the speed record on alot of ep cycles. <br />

sham 4 - rebuffs/rez shm, someone dies-they fill in/ranger fa/ dps <br />
sham 5 - fos rebuff/rogue fa/dps<br />
<br />
Yes on the fa bot, I fear there are more shm bots now than sham mains. And yes to the number of clerics controlling the heart of what can and cant be raided. A 3 cleric, 3 druid, 5 shaman night will be a real rough ride in time =(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why are expansions designed so?<br />
<br />
Time.  Not enough of it.  Expansions are a big cash cow for SoE, so the more often they come out the more profitable EQ is.  Skimping on the quality of content is good business.  Just hold out the carrot of godly, powerful items, and people will gobble up substandard content to get them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Rubitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">When considering clerics you have to take into acount that part of their balancing is based on their inability to solo.  I would have to rank clerics at the verry bottom of classes able to solo well.  <br />
<br />
In a PvE game balancing is less about the power of the class an more about their usefulness in raids, groups and solo (ie the players ability to play the game).  Originaly classes were designed this way with some oriented toward soloing (druids and necros), some oriented toward grouping (clerics, warriors, chanters), and the rest in the middle (shaman probably being about dead center).<br />
<br />
Unfortunaly soe has not stuck by this model and has totaly screwed up all balancing in the game.  they took chanters and gave them dc which makes them much better at soloing (as well as grouping); gave druids increased heals to make them more desirable to groups; introduced beastlords and made them above average in all situations, ect.<br />
<br />
overall i would say that most classes are fairly balanced.  however there are a few classes, particularly chanters and beastlords, that are so far out of balance that it screw up the entire game (though i may be biased and its specificly in the 60+ invorment).  unfortunaly soe is now to afriad to do any real nerfing to these classes nor do they want to make the upgrades required for those that were left behind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I don't consider clerics overpowered, their unsurpassed desirability in groups and raids is nicely offset by the fact that they are one of the most boring classes to play.  <br />
<br />
Enchanter (and probably druid/necro) charm and mana regen spells are overpowered.  All of the PoP raid content that is duo or single groupable is a result of charm.  Ranger Stonewood Bow + AM3 DPS is arguably overpowered.  Bard pulling abilities are arguably overpowered.  Beastlord 60+ spellbook is overpowered, but the mistake there to me was adding new classes in the first place.  Class balance is too fragile to just toss in new variables like that.<br />
<br />
Clerics have never really upset the balance equation imho because all content since kunark has been designed around CH.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Clerics are boring?  Where the heck did you get this idea from?<br />
<br />
  Clerics aren't boring, just so damn many of them are lazy.<br />
<br />
<br />
  When is the last time you saw a cleric that encouraged multiple pulls on incoming and ran their own crowd control?  Or a cleric that pulled for their group, tanked for the group or at least jumped in on the melee?    I know it has been a while since I have, but whenever I want to I just have to return to 1 of the 3 clerics I have ever met whom I will honestly say KNOW thier class.<br />
<br />
<br />
 With the Yaulp 5 spell, the cleric DOES have the option to jump in on melee in almost every grouping environment without mana problems.   The hammer proc is CONSIDERABLE dps.<br />
<br />
<br />
   In zones that they have comperable armor for (ornate for tier 3s, or full Ele for Tier 4s) the cleric can even pull off tanking by using heal over times on themselves and stunning the mob occasionally to add taunt to the already decent taunt of the hammer (that proc is quite nicely balanced taunt wise... a tank wanting taunt can beat it, and a tank not wanting it can stay under).<br />
<br />
<br />
   As for pulling, they got pacify and root.   I have seen a cleric puller for a group who would kite a couple of mobs around the camp if he wasn't able to split them.  But that was the rare case, he was getting singles and chain pulling without much problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
  In another group we had a chance to see the cleric running crowd control on multiple pulls (we were competing with nearby camps for the spawns).   MA pulled, cleric threw an immediate heal and drew aggro from the adds, then root parked them and maintained the root through the fight.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Clerics are NOT a boring class.  NO CLASS is boring if people just quit doing ONLY what the group asks them to and they analyze thier spells to find the fun.   The reason clerics seem to be so boring is that people who play them as twinks only want them for heal/rez (same as someone playing a shaman bot for the buffs), and the ones who play them for mains FAR too often just want to watch TV and click on a CH button.</div></div><hr />
