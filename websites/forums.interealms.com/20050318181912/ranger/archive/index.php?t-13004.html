<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sasandra</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 06:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">in PoP all caster classes (CLR DRU SHM NEC WIZ ENC MAG) get Planer Enlightenment (not sure if that's the exact name) which allows them to raise their INT/WIS caps by 50 which results in 300 more mana they can gain)<br />
<br />
in PoP all &quot;tank&quot; classes (WAR PAL SHD) get Planar Durability which grants them an extra 4.5% max HP which will result in around 300 more hp on a top end warrior<br />
<br />
the problem is the remaining melee classes (RNG BRD ROG BST MNK) get no skills at all in the area pertaining to their area of expertise, damage dealing, which seems like a fairly noticable oversite to me.<br />
<br />
my idea for a skill that fits in that area for the damage dealing melees is Planer Agression, it would be a 3 step AA like planer durability with the same cost that would give an increase in ATK of 2.5% per level which on a high end melee would work out to somewhere around 100-120 ATK at it's final level, this would balance out the lack of an ability in this area.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
the next oversite/mistake pertains to rangers.<br />
<br />
currently in our 61-65 spell line up we get 5 spells effected by Spell Casting Fury:<br />
<br />
Exile summoned: 725dd vs summoned<br />
Frozen Wind: 700dd, cold based<br />
Brushfire: 612dd, fire based<br />
Nature's Rebuke: 170dd proc vs summoned, lure<br />
Cry of Thunder: 150dd proc, lure<br />
<br />
now for 61-65 spells we get that are effected by Healing Adept and Healing Gift we get a whoping 1: <br />
<br />
Chloroblast: 428 heal<br />
<br />
from that observation it is extreamly obvious that we are a nuker over a healer, we get 5 damage dealing spells vs 1 healing spell, the problem is for some reason we get Improved Healing Adept and Improved Healing Gift and not Fury of magic (spell casting fury upgrade), this is either a sizable oversite in that we didn't recive this, or a mistake in that we should have recived it instead of the 2 healing ones.<br />
<br />
even if you look at all high end rangers you would probably find that less than 2% even have any points in the healing aa's and thus far I do not know of a single ranger that has all 3 levels required for the improved one, it's not a skill that pertains to our class nor is it usefull, on the other hand a relatively large amount of rangers have bought at least one level of spell casting fury with numerous having bought all 3 levels which would bhe the requirement for fury of magic.<br />
<br />
my thoughts is that fury of magic needs to be added to our aa line up outright, or it should replace the 2 healing aa's as I don't see many if any rangers spending 21 aa points to upgrade our heal from 428 to 509 and then another 21 aa's for max criting ability with our heals.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
the last aa that pertains to rangers that seem should be adjusted is unstopable force<br />
<br />
this aa increase the chance for an aditional attack with a two handed weapon, by the wording of this vs ferocity (increased the chance to double attack) I as guessing this mean triple attack, the one problem with this is it is only with 2h when rangers are a predomenatly dual weilding class, both beastlords and bards gained the ability to double attack with all their weapons thus increasing their max number of attacks per round from 2 to 4 now the same as us though with less frequency. Unstopable force needs to be changed so that it allows us to gain an triple attack with all weapons, not just two handed weapons which 99% of high end rangers do not use as their primary means of melee damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A supplemental argument for granting us an additional 3 levels of SFC could be the pure melee AA Skill &quot;Ingenuity,&quot; which allows non-casters to score critical procs on their weapons. When non-warriors were granted the oppurtunity to critical their melee weapons warriors were still able to train in combat fury to keep their critical levels higher than the rest of us. However our Planar SFC should not increase damage on our Criticals above SFC 3, it should instead increase our chance to land a Critical Proc/Cast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While sucky to spend more AA's they should scrap headshot and give us a one time train AA that makes Unstoppable Force apply to 1handers as well as 2handers.  Why did we get Headshot anyway?  anything it works on is as good as oneshotted/twoshotted anyway<br />

That or some form of increased bow effectivness/damage since archery is actually viable in PoP.</div></div><hr />

Not much of interest for our AAs this time around.  Most of it appears to be filler to give us something without something, ie Headshot, Snare, 10 AAs for 60 or so hps.  <br />

I do like the rapid puppy.  It is fun to have some sort of offensive disc while using melee.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabine</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the Luclin AA's for Rangers were very exciting, and in fact are where I will probably spend all of my first 100 AA's before doing another PoP AA at the moment.<br />
<br />
I have 81 AA points, and among them are: <br />
<br />
Spell Casting Fury 3<br />
Combat Fury 2<br />
Healing Gift 2<br />
Endless Quiver<br />
Archery Mastery 3<br />
<br />
I picked up spell fury right after endless quiver, and only recently got the lifetap weapon, and loved using it in Luclin and previous expansions.<br />
<br />
In my limited experience with PoP zones I have been tanking a lot.   I prefer to have a &quot;tank&quot; in my group but just has not been happening that often.  I guess my gear is &quot;moderately uber&quot; -- which is to say great gear for a guild doing Tier 2 targets.  In exp groups I have around 5500 hit points and 1600 atk.  When I tank in the PoP zones, I find that if I use dual wield I get shredded by ripostes.  Rangers can tank stuff but it seems that with PoP, we either dodge/parry/riposte, or have a good chance of that 500-700 smack.  If I use my great weapons for dual wield, I find that I am doing an extra few thousand hit points of damage to myself from ripostes, and having to turn off attack for a cheal that started at 40% health so I don't risk a fatal riposte is not efficient. <br />
<br />
I picked up punishing blade, and was kinda wishing there was a &quot;refund&quot; button, since it seems to fire so rarely, less than once a fight.<br />
<br />
Rangers are here to do all sorts of things, but we are supposed to be a high damage melee that can use spells and archery to boost our damage.  Sadly there isn't much in the PoP menu that applies to what we do.  If the Combat Fury scaling stuff that was mentioned a few patches ago actually goes in, then getting CF3, and the PoP versions (4,5,6) would make the most sense.  You get more damage with weapons or arrows, and that would be nifty.  Parses posted here reported no change with CF2 (only a .5% increase over CF1 still).<br />
<br />
I was shocked to not see anything for spell damage, I would do more spell fury in a heartbeat.  I won't be doing ambidex or ferocity any time soon, as it will never get my melee damage anywhere near bow damage, and if not using a bow, I am usally tanking, and cant risk more ripostes from more swings.<br />
<br />
Spell Fury would be great, especially with the new PoP nukes so I have some extra kick in the nukes I use while waiting for a heal or for ENRAGED critter to settle down.<br />
<br />
I think there are several rangers who use healing gift, but very very few who would train healing adept.  I suspect adept is for the rangers with 150+ AA's and the Render of Souls and the Acrylia sword from the Emporer.  I suspect there are not more than 10 of these rangers in the game across all servers.<br />
<br />
If there was a series of AA's to reduce the cycle time on Trueshot/Weaponshield I think many would invest in it.  Weaponshield is a disc I am using almost every time it cycles in PoP - just from the hard-to-predict nature of damage and having no assist healerin my exp group.<br />
<br />
It would be nice if we got some nice class abilities that apply to what we do most of the time.  We are supposed to dual wield, use arrows, cast offensive spells.  I don't think the intention of PoP was to force rangers to 2-handers but if I tank I sure have to use one.<br />
<br />
If I had a few things to say in a ranger PoP meeting of designer folks, I would push for something related to archery, something to up damage with melee that is not just more swings, and some skills to complement spell casting fury.  I use archery whenever I can (mob not in wall, me not tanking), after that I want to swing weapons and nuke.   I think rangers need the chance to get a few more hit points (planar durability) since we still have a taunt key and will often be in front of the mob.  Dual wield (if we tank and use it) will get about 5 times the ripostes as a 2-hander and we need something to help us survive that in PoP.<br />

<br />
it's just not a system that works on EQ and it limits a few other classes for us to use it, mages can't use their epic pets as they root, and you would be surprised at how many mobs can actualy be rooted, mage pets were rooting named dragons in NToV constantly last time I was there, it also limits SK's and pallys from the uber 2hs they get off tunare cause that procs root as well, while the pally/SK one may not really be a big difference the mage one is, epic pet does a ton of damage and a mage not being able to use significantly lowers their DPS.<br />
<br />
I think so little of archery in EQ that there isn't even a bow in my ranged slot anymore 99% of the time, and the one thing archery was good for, pulling, it isn't anymore cause a crit with AM3 and I get summoned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kitae</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do druids get fury of magic? If so I agree with you, we should get it over improved healing gift.<br />
<br />
You have to think a bit outside the box when you look at beastlords and bards getting dual wield. The mele of these classes is truly pathetic. Horribly so. Now both beastlords and bards add a lot to a raid besides mele dps, but giving them a dps upgrade is not overpowering especially at the end game level (level 65). I haven't seen the numbers yet, but I sincerely doubt that they will be doing warrior or ranger level mele dps. Given this, I don't think you can use them as a justification for adjustments to our mele AAs. Just because they get something, doesn't mean we should automatically get something as well.<br />
<br />
We actually get one of the best mele AAs for damage increasing - guardian of the forest. It's situational, short duration, and doesn't increase mele damage hugely, but if you look at all the mele dps enhancing AAs you'll see it's actually one of the best. Guardian of the forest is really really great value for a measley 9AAs.<br />
<br />
The problem in general with mele dps enhancing AAs is that monks and rogues already do too much damage. A top end rogue does about 80% more DPS than a top end warrior.  Verant has no intention of further increasing this gap by introducing mele-enhancing AAs for monks/rogues/rangers.  Rogues do too much damage, as it is but they're not going to nerf them now. Rogues should do 40-50% more damage than a warrior and should be able to scale that up to 80% by spending a tonne of AAs. While it would not be unreasonable to allow rangers to increase our mele dps through AAs (say by 30%), it would be too difficult to do give those AAs just to rangers (monks and rogues and every other mele class would bitch and want the same AAs). <br />
<br />
I feel that ranger mele is just fine, we honestly should not want or expect to have better mele abilities than warriors (though most endgame rangers do outdamage endgame warriors in mele due to equipment choies).<br />
<br />
If we do look for enhancements in our role as damage dealer, we should expect to find those enhancements in situational damage like archery and spells. Fury of magic would be cool. A decent chain-castable nuke (like starfire) would be nice situational damage. Making archery (a) affect mobs touching walls and (b) inform the ranger when her shot is blocked by an intermediary player or piece of world geometry, would be awesome.</div></div><hr />

Why I think this. Why are there no Archery AA skills in POP?  We have no use for a 2 handed skill increasse for the most  part. <br />
<br />
On Rabid Wolf I think 3 AA points for the  first level is a mighty high price to pay for 20 secs  of around 125 attack bonus. And yes I have it. although I do like turning into a black wolf. But hey what are looks any way. I want damage. lol<br />

<br />
And further, I think this points to an ongoing problem with the current dev team. They are great people trying to do exciting new things but after watching EQ over 3.5+ years I am convinced that what happens is this - a class that has vocal backing on the dev team gets attention and classes that don't have that backing do not get attention.<br />
<br />
After watching the poor itemization for rangers in Luclin and then seeing the AAs and spell set for POP, I am bothered by the appearance that we are suffering through a period of &quot;benign neglect&quot;. The lack of anything in the AA tree for us as dual wielders is evidence of this. The AAs for healing instead of nuking are evidence of this. And the excessive emphasis on 2h when we are not even primarily a 2h class is more evidence of this.<br />
<br />
I've already written to the developers once urging action to double check and verify that rangers either maintain their current place or are given a new &quot;role&quot; in the overall scheme of things but I think more of us need to be hitting on this and submitting feedbacks and emails.<br />
<br />
We're not out of control yet but I certainly don't want to see another Kunark-like period.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with Hopwin wholeheartedly.  I think your despondency regarding archery is somewhat overdone.  The bow you have selected in your archery profile works poorly in relation to the current issues we have with archery in game.  <br />
<br />
I would like to see an AA that give a minimal offhand weapons bonus, maybe up to 4-5, I think that will go a long way in addressing the disparity that shows up between 2hs and dual weild.  The AA ability you have descibed is a nice one as well, 120 ATK might be a little too high though.<br />
<br />
Fury of Magic would be a great AA to have, I am still dumbfounded that we didn't recieve it.<br />

<br />
even still archery isn't worth it to me for reasons outside of my bow I have, those being the lag factor for bows, inability to type anything while using a bow, and mage epic pets rooting mobs and halving my damage. I do use archery when it does significant damage like in ToV my bow substantial outdamage my melee with more arounf a 120-130 DPS, but other places including PoP it doesn't seem to, I had expected it to perform in PoP like in ToV, but it didn't /shrug. i've parsed 250+ DPS with trueshot with that bow so I don't really think the bow is the issue.<br />
<br />
I think i've succesfully managed to derail my own thread =\<br />

ok, back to the aa's I was concerned with :p</div></div><hr />

Paladins and SK's can wear plate, so they can naturally hold their own in the tank situation.  Rangers and monks do more damage than they do, but as duel wielding classes, the whole added riposte damage thing can be a pain.  I would love to see some additional enhancements to our damage avoidance.  An upgraded CA or something of the sort.  I personally think ranger damage output fine whether you use archery or not.  We outdamage warriors, SK's, Paladins.  We don't outdamage monks or rogues, true, but with our spells we're really not supposed to.  Give us a way to prevent damage rather than dish more out.</div></div><hr />

I most certaintly wouldn't call Guardian of the Forest a waste of points, the 1st level of this skill gives a larger increase in DPS than avatar does. <br />
<br />
<br />
It does, but the fact that it only lasts for 48 seconds, has stacking issues, refreshes every 15 minutes and Gives us an illusion that gets us killed, I still say it's worthless. If the illusion was taken away, and the refresh timer was drastically reduced, Maybe it would be a decent skill.<br />
<br />
On a side note, this whole ingenuity thing for pure melees is infuriating and needs to be fixed, either remove it from their line up or flag us for it, it's just not fair, especially to Bards and Beastlords, who are more casters in their make up than we are.</div></div><hr />

I do think a spellcasting fury AA is warranted.  I have SCF1 and am working towards SCF2 &amp; 3 once I level up some more, and Healing Gift and Adept are low on my list of priorities.  Sure, not every ranger plays the same way (like using a 10/17 bow with AM3/EQ :) ), but we got both healing and nuking improvement AAs in Luclin, it's inconsistent to stop that in PoP.<br />
<br />
They revised a lot of Luclin AAs, I'm sure with some well-reasoned /feedback we should be able to convince the developers that it makes sense.<br />
<br />
I'm not so sure about increasing melee damage further.  We already get further-improved hybrid casting haste and the usual benefits of levels.  Pushing ranger melee ability higher would necessitate raising warriors as well (we're supposed to equal them in melee).  Then you'd need to raise SK and Paladin melee.  And the cycle would continue... :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, I have enough heal AAs to get the new ones.  Then again, people say they prefer grouping with me over other rangers becuase I actually heal.  Rangers who don't use the healing power they have to save themselves or group members boggle my mind.<br />
<br />
We're a hybrid of a druid.  A druid's main purpose is to heal.  Yes, our nukes are bigger than our heals, but that's the way they are for almost every healing class aside from CHs.<br />
<br />
BRD/BST didn't gain much ability to double attack at all, a cleric still outdamages either in melee, I can't believe anyone would complain about that.<br />
<br />
We get a snare AA, druids don't get that.  We get 1 extra point of mana regen through AA druids don't get.  No one ever said everything was precisely equal.<br />
<br />
Even if you use your nukes real hard, that's what, 10% of your damage coming from nukes?  You really think the 5% or whatever the new SCF gives added on to that means much?  It's like 0.5% more damage overall :P<br />

actualt warriors can exceed us in straight melee damage if they go full AA's, they have the same ones we do in terms of melee plus they get one to ignore parrys, ripostes, and dodges of a mob, that is a masive boos in their DPS, from what i've read somewhere in the range of 20-25%<br />

<br />
i've parsed upwards of 60% of my damage during some fights being from spells damage, procs and nukes, upgrade of spell casting fury would be a noticable upgrade, remember it effects procs as well, and especialy with cry of thunder our procs alone are a noticable part of our damage.<br />

at least two priest classes get the spell casting fury upgrade, clerics and druids, i'm not positive on shammys though.<br />

if I wanted to play a healing hybrid I would have made a pally, I wanted to play a damage dealing hybrid, that's a ranger, and though yes our new heal is a significant upgrade, in PoP it's just as effective as G-heal was in luclin, xp mobs do upwards of twice the damage per hit our heal lands for.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Relv</div><div class="date">11-03-2002, 08:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">in PoP all caster classes (CLR DRU SHM NEC WIZ ENC MAG) get Planer Enlightenment (not sure if that's the exact name) which allows them to raise their INT/WIS caps by 50 which results in 300 more mana they can gain) <br />
<br />
<br />
Honestly, show me a ranger that has &gt; 305 WIS?  We can get 1 more mana regen from AA than casters as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
in PoP all &quot;tank&quot; classes (WAR PAL SHD) get Planar Durability which grants them an extra 4.5% max HP which will result in around 300 more hp on a top end warrior <br />
<br />
And the HP advantage of these tanking classes have been marginalized by the proliferation of 100 HP all/all items which have lessened the HP gap and marginalized their tanking abilities for a long time.  If anything, this HP gain should be innate, and they should not have to pay for balancing.<br />
<br />
the problem is the remaining melee classes (RNG BRD ROG BST MNK) get no skills at all in the area pertaining to their area of expertise, damage dealing, which seems like a fairly noticable oversite to me. <br />
<br />
Uh, have you even looked at the AA list?  Triple attack for 2h, increased double attack, etc.  Reality check on isle 4 plx!<br />

<br />
You are a HYBRID OF A PRIEST CLASS.  PRIEST CLASSES HEAL.  PRIEST CLASSES ARE NOT ONLY DAMAGE.  GHeal is by *far* worse than 'blast, the casting time is much longer, you can heal about 30% better than a level 57 druid with it and save lives, maybe if you stopped complaining and actually cast it you'd like it.<br />
<br />
If you don't want to cast heals and only want offensive spells, might I suggest the SK class -----&gt; that way.<br />
<br />
Here, let's look at this from another way:<br />
<br />
PoP nuke upgrades:<br />
RNG:  450 -&gt; 700 (156%)<br />
<br />
Of course, they're faster casting, a new resist type, and we get two, and they cycle quicker.<br />
<br />
Now let's take a look at the other classes:<br />
CLR:  925 -&gt; 1100 (119%)<br />
DRU: 1175 -&gt; 1550 (132%)<br />
NEC: 1050 -&gt; 1250 (119%)<br />
WIZ: 2100 -&gt; 2740 (130%)<br />
ENC: 950 -&gt; 1100 (116%)<br />
MAG: 1150 -&gt; 1550 (135%)<br />
<br />
No matter which you compare spells: DPS, mana effeciency, versatility with regard to resists, ancient spells or not, rangers got the single largest upgrade for DD spells in EverQuest in PoP compared to casters.<br />
<br />
Oh, and let's also compare our imbue innate spell to the other hybrids (call of fire etc):<br />
RNG:  65 -&gt; 150 (231%)<br />
SHD: 50 -&gt; 65 (130%)<br />
PAL: 65 -&gt; 140 (215%)<br />
BST: 142 -&gt; 155 (109%)<br />
<br />
Maybe you guys should step back from arguing about a very minor spell damage upgrade that doesn't provide even the same upgrade SCF did, and look at the big picture... we got the best spell damage upgrade in EverQuest in Planes of Power, and our new heal is so scary good once you give it a little AA love I'm surprised the paladins aren't complaining.<br />
<br />
Oh, or we could just complain instead.  Woe is the ranger!<br />
<br />
Now if you'll excuse me, I need to get back to tanking tier 2 PoP mobs, giving more ATK than avatar to my group, casting the best spell damage upgrades any class recieves, and saving my groupmate's lives with my &quot;useless&quot; chloroblast, pulling singles all day with harmony of nature, and annoying my rogue friend by outdamaging her by 30% on VT bosses.  Toodles.</div></div><hr />

While it could have been better, its really not bad. <br />
<br />
I liked to heal more myself also, never was a big fan of nuking, and they way i look at it the healing AA's are worth more then the nuke ones.  Nukes are good now, with some AA's they would be nice, but it would be a marginal increase at best on most mobs, however healing AA's allow our heal to really become good and possibly save us or group members.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tolian</div><div class="date">11-04-2002, 04:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing said above caught my eye...<br />
<br />
We're a hybrid of a druid. A druid's main purpose is to heal<br />
<br />
K, let's look at this here...  high lvls druids have a grand total of 3 (yes, 3) heals they use: Karana's Renewal, Nature's Infusion, and occasionally Chloroblast.  Now, shall we count the nukes available to them?  Winter's Frost, Destroy Summoned, Summer's Flame, Karana's Rage, Catastrophe, Winter's Storm,  Ancient Starfire of Ro, Moonfire, Wildfire, Fist of Karana...  need I go on?  And those are just the DDs, not counting the DoTs.  Kind of hard to argue that druids main function is designed to be a healer, and that by extension our main function with spells is healing.  Especially considering we never have more than 1 type of heal spell available to us at any given level, yet there are now 2-3 nukes a 65 ranger can have loaded and use to good effect at any given time, which doesn't include spells like CoF/CoT/NR, or any procs from weapons themselves.  Heh, I'll take SCF3 + Fury of Magic any day of the week over the ability to heal some overnuking robie a little better.<br />
<br />
As for the rest of the thread, great post to start it off, and some good points brought up later.  Hope some devs see it and put some actual thought into the matter.</div></div><hr />

Rangers got the biggest upgrade in nukes because they did such low damage! Percentages don't do it justice. Clerics..a pure healing class..had a 925 nuke. Our best nuke was less than half that amount. And we are a melee/offensive spell hybrid. Our best nuke is still lower than thier nuke from previous expansion.<br />
<br />
Our spells are mostly offensive, or pure utility. Healing has always been the lowest area of our abilities. I love healing, It just isn't what we do best. Never will be, never should be.<br />
<br />
We are a hybrid. We derive skills from both Warrior and Druid. Our AA's should also. Druids don't just heal, btw. They nuke, they dot, they buff, they cast all kinds of utility spells. And port. Thats where we get caught, our parent class is a Hybrid amongst the casters. They aren't as specialized as Clerics or Necros (for the Sks). Bst hardly follows the hard path of Parent class hand me downs. They have a ton of new spells. We get what? 8? And 4 of them are just upgrades to what we already had?<br />
<br />
The Ranger community has always been pretty civil. And thats our weak spot. Verant pretty much gives the classes that scream the loudest what they want.<br />
<br />
We should get AA's tiered more in line with Luclin. 2hs is just boggling. Great post, Sas. I hope you foreward it to the Dev team, heh. Make this a petition and I would sign it in a heartbeat.<br />

<br />
You play differently than other people, so that automatically makes them wrong and gives you an excuse to deride them?<br />
<br />
Sorry, we can heal, but that has never been our primary and most powerful function and with all the spells at 65 it still won't be. Foremost we are nukers in terms of spellcasting in combat. It might be a new path for us to take but I still believe we deserve to have the upgraded Nuke Crit AA.<br />

<br />
you don't recruit a warrior for your guild to bind would people on raids just like you don't recruit a ranger to heal, just because you can do something on raids doesn't mean you should.<br />
<br />
our heals are usefull for down timing healing, they are also ocationaly usefull in XP groups if the main healer starts getting hit and I always keep chloroblast memed for those reason, but i'm not a healer, my guild will benifit far more from me nuking and meleeing than healing, we have clerics, druids, and shamans for a reason.<br />

What is your point here Relv?  that healing is important? sure it is.. I've had to heal a group of rogues before on a riad where we were seeing nasty AE's.. I always do the best I can, but while I'm healing I'm not fighting typically.  My mana pool is larger then a druids at the same level they receive those heals too, but it doesnt make me a good healer.<br />
<br />
If a ranger is forced to save someones life on a raid with heals, it means someone's whose job is to heal isnt doing their job correctly, or you do not have enough healers on your raid.<br />
<br />
There is no balance issue involved here, I know for certain I will never purchase improved healing adept/gift but I might of purchased improved spell casting fury.  Just where will you put your AA points at after you have  maxed out Ferocity and GotF out?  I will spend points on charisma before I purchase headshot :)<br />
<br />
Better yet Relv, why don't you list the AA skills you are planning on, and we can all petition to have the ones your not planning on using removed.. they would be worthless right?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
What is your point here Relv? that healing is important?<br />
<br />
<br />
It's that our healing AAs aren't useless as some people claim earlier in this thread.<br />
<br />
Would people have bought the SCF upgrade if we recieved it?<br />
<br />
Sure.<br />
<br />
Is the ranger class lacking or hurt?  Is it an oversight?<br />
<br />
Absolutely not.  Our DD went from 450-&gt;700/612, DoT 340-&gt;640, and proc spell from 65-&gt;150.<br />
<br />
The basic argument on the first page is, &quot;they got this and we didn't, therefore we should have it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, who else in the game got as big of a spell damage upgrade as we did?  No one.<br />
<br />
Comparing abilities like that is silly, because you don't look at the bigger picture.  It's a bit like when Paladins thought they should get higher weapon skills when we got a defense skill increase, or when clerics claimed they needed group teleports after druids recieved a semi-complete heal.<br />
<br />
When rangers walked away with by far the best AA selection in the game in Luclin, did you consider that imbalancing?  An oversight perhaps?<br />
<br />
When rangers got their defense skill increased from 220 to 240 skill for no given reason at all, did you consider that imbalancing?  An oversight perhaps?  (&quot;Hi, have some free defense skill.  Love, Verant.&quot;)<br />
<br />
When rangers walked away with by far the best spell damage upgrade in the game in PoP, did you consider that imbalancing?  An oversight perhaps?<br />

Even *if* your healing per second does not eclipse mob DPS, and it almost always will if the mob is slowed, it will mitigate it, quite possibly enough for a stronger heal to land in the additional time it buys, or you can even get a crit heal which makes a big difference... whee.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like your guild's healers suck if it takes a ranger to get the job done.  Still doesn't mean our spell focus should be healing instead of nuking.  You ever hear this little tidbit Relv, 'Rangers get nukes to bring up their DPS to approximately Warrior lvls' ?  Admittedly that's a paraphrase, but its straight from VI that we are designed to use nukes to increase our dps.  Not, that we're designed to be backup healers to help out incompetent clerics/druids.  Sorry, but if that's what I was required to do all the time, I'd just say the hell with it and make a cleric.<br />
<br />
Denied.  Thank you, come again  :p.</div></div><hr />

I don't think they suck, because we killed Aten in our first time in VT /shrug.  VT trash mobs have low DPS, they hit for what, 200-300s?  Pretty weak.<br />
<br />
No one ever said our spell focus is healing.  Rather, we recieve buffs, utility spells, heals, and damage spells.  Much like our parent class, a druid.<br />
<br />
Sure, you as a player can say &quot;I'm not a cleric, I'm not casting healing spells&quot;.  You can say &quot;I'm not a wizard, I'm not casting DD spells.&quot;  You can say &quot;I'm not a shaman, I'm not giving anyone ATK buffs&quot;.<br />
<br />
But in any of these cases, you only deny yourself, and sell yourself short.  The ranger is the sum of its parts.  If you don't use all the parts, you don't get the full sum.  Try calculating the DPS lost when someone dies, perhaps.<br />
<br />
I've seen paladins that never heal or stun.  I've seen rangers who didn't even bother to mem root or do the Call of Flames quest.  I've seen SKs that never cast a lifetap and couldn't FD split a single spawn.  I've seen Beastlords fighting in XP groups without a pet.<br />
<br />
The tools are there, it's up to you to use them.  If you don't, you're not denying me anything-- rather, only yourself.</div></div><hr />

We are all entitled to our opinions. If you don't agree with them, thats fine. You are entitled to that as well. But trying to debunk another's arguement simply to justify your own reasoning isn't going to 'win' anything. There is no prize. You want to be a healing Ranger? Go for it. But we shouldn't have to be stuck in that role if we want our AA's to compliment other skills we have. You want to be a 2hs Ranger? Again, go for it. Your choice. I'd rather get other abilities to choose from.<br />
<br />
And get off the Nuke kick, please. Our nukes only got the biggest increase due to the fact our last nuke was Kunark. Hell of a lot of room for improvements when you are at the bottom, no? It's not like Verant said &quot;Omg! Let's make Ranger nukes the biggest improved spells in PoP!!&quot;. They just put them where they should be, and without any 'fillers' in the last 2 expansions, that gap is big. And its a percentage increase. % doesn't mean much when you look at the total. Going from 450 to 700+ doesn't mean our new nukes are super. It means our old nukes were weak. Compare the classes you listed with thier Kunark Nukes vs PoP nukes. We might not be top dogs in increased damage after all. The &quot;Parse Police&quot; will prolly have numbers soon. Lets see how it looks. <br />
<br />
I like our new nukes. I'd just like to see similar paths in AA as we had in Luclin. Remeber, we had more 'cool' AA's in SoL, but we also had to pay more to get them all. Its pretty fair considering most of our liabilities. 240 defense isn't anything to get excited about, unless PoP mobs were hitting like Velious mobs or light Luclin. Which they don't. 240 with chain isn't like we gained any ground. We are just where we always were, weak defensive tanks.<br />
<br />
Just my thoughts...you can agree or disagree. But you cannot prove an opinion  wrong. Sorry, I'd rather be a fool than the person who argues with one.  :D <br />

Are clerics only a melee class who can't heal now since they're &quot;locked into&quot; meleeing with their summoned hammers?<br />
<br />
And did I ever say I casted exclusively heals?  Nope, you'll find me nuking, root parking, snaring, buffing, using archery, meleeing, whatever the situation calls for.  I don't use 2H either, aside from my emp bane sword..<br />
<br />
Many of the classes I mentioned didn't get a DD upgrade in Velious/Luclin either.  Did I mention call of fire was a velious spell?<br />
<br />
And yes, there's a way to win arguments, it's called flawed logic.  And in this case, saying &quot;omg heals are completely useless, and if they got AA ability x we should get it too&quot; just doesn't work.<br />
<br />
Yes yes, you've all assured how useless having the same direct heal as a level 61 shaman is.  Because hey, that spell is useful for a level 61 shaman, but for a level 62 ranger...<br />
<br />
We get archery mastery 3, and previously shared the same archery skill cap with rogues/warriors... therefore they should get archery mastery 3 too, right?<br />

I took Healing Gift 1 because it may just save a caster or mt or me.  I took SCF 1 because I am a damage dealer.<br />
<br />
As far as biggest upgrade 450 was rubbish to start with so thats rubbish.  Pally 65 proc is at 49th not 55th.<br />
<br />
Not having the dd fury thingie is wrong.  I get owned by tier 2 mobs dual wielding, the only reason i live is cos our clerics shaman and druids are good.  The defence upgrade was due chain mitigation &gt; leather but it wasnt.<br />
<br />
Headshot although i havent got is a waste, entrap saves you a spell slot.  My weapons are dual wield but to survive im being forced into 2hs.  I havent got uber gear or aa skills.  Am I whining or stating the facts as I see them, something I think every ranger is allowed here.  Or no whining but Pontificating and preaching is?</div></div><hr />

In my opinion the only reason we received an up grade to any nuke was as a pacifier. They contintued the fire base line of Nukes..JOY! So you with archery broken the mob gets walled we start nuking because there are so many other melee on the mob we can't get near it. Then find it it is totally resistant to fire based magic. Where does that place our options?  <br />
1) nuke with Lighting ....99hp dmg<br />
2) support healer ...low mana base 300 hp heal until 61+<br />
3) Dot.. possible to block a better dot by another class<br />
4) Contintue to shoot arrows into the black hole and take AE <br />
5) send tells to other people because we now can talk since range attack button doesn't have to be pushed.<br />
I am glad they gave us the nukes but If the mobs not walled I am not wasting an 800 hp double dmg to hit a 450 hp nuke. And I am not stopping to heal myself or another unless it is absoulty necessary because my 300 hp heal is not going to help much on a mob that hits double 400 + so why would I waste 3 chances to do 200+ double dmg to heal a 300 hp heal.<br />
And if you didn't notice snare was also reduced in the last patch average is about a 25 percent increase in resist.<br />
In my opionion we should have been given a cold line nuke or a magic line nuke to at least allow us to be helpful on mob which resist fire line or are walled for the safety of the others we are with.<br />

<br />
Yes, &quot;normal&quot; people are going to be found in Velkator's Labyrinth, the Ruins of Old Sebilis, and the Plane of Nightmares, in all cases which Chloroblast can be a powerful heal indeed, particularily in the previous two cases.<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as biggest upgrade 450 was rubbish to start with so thats rubbish.<br />
<br />
<br />
I found 450 damage to be a very powerful DD spell when I got in Kunark at level 59.  It does 180 DPS, which is more than melee, even today.  On raids I still have it mem'd, along with Brushfire and Frozen Wind.<br />
<br />
<br />
The defence upgrade was due chain mitigation &gt; leather but it wasnt. <br />
<br />
<br />
Chain classes indeed seem to have higher mitigation than leather after the &quot;monk nerf&quot; patch, and defense skill is damage avoidance rather than mitigation.<br />

Melee.  However, the mobs you can't use archery on or nuke, are fortunately few and far between.<br />

Useless? I dont think anyone thinks they are useless.  I think the majority of rangers think that Spell Casting Fury would of made more sense.  Giving Rangers Healing AA's and not Improved SCF is like giving paladins Improved SCF and not Healing AA's.<br />

BL's go from 430 to 675 damage.  <br />
<br />
Your information is wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
When rangers got their defense skill increased from 220 to 240 skill for no given reason at all, did you consider that imbalancing?  An oversight perhaps?  (&quot;Hi, have some free defense skill.  Love, Verant.&quot;)<br />
<br />
<br />
I really think Ranger's were given more Defense so that they would not have to nerf Monks so far.  Imbalancing? hell I had no issues with it one way or another.  I dont think monks needed to be nerfed, and even with 240 defense and 1400 ac I can't solo in PoP.<br />
<br />

You seem to place the ability to spot heal as a validation for having Improved Healing Gift/Adept over Improved Spell Casting Fury.  No one doubts that healing is useful, or that it saves lifes.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Atanas</div><div class="date">11-05-2002, 07:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting reading here.<br />
<br />
I myself took both SCF1 and HG1.  Why?, cause both gave me a new ability on the way to EQ/AM.<br />
<br />
Both have their uses.  I blast when I am solo.  I heal when I am raiding.  Not a lot,  granted.  But enough.<br />
<br />
Why do I heal during a raid?.  Clerics are usually focused on keeping the MT alive.  That is their job.  I normally hang around the casters (using bow/arrows).<br />
<br />
If I see a chanter/cleric in trouble I heal.  A critical heal of 856 hps has saved a few lives.  :)<br />
<br />
So,  at least to me, healing skills are very handy to have.  Not my job to heal people.  But,  when I have to,  it is nice to be able to do an ok job.<br />
<br />
Nukes are different.  I only nuke when I can't use bow (mob walled) and it is hard to reach the mob (too crowded).  With some luck (no resistances) I can do similar damage to melee.<br />
<br />
But in most situations I rather fire two arrows (with some chances of hitting for 500+ each shot) than to cast a spell for a few seconds (and with lots of luck get a critical blast,  oh,  and no resists).<br />
<br />
Only time that my nukes actually meant something was doing the trial in PoJ.  Exile summoned worked wonders on them rocks.  :)<br />
<br />
But in most situations spells are my third line of attack (swords, bow and then nukes).  <br />
<br />
As it has been said many times here,  our job is to do damage.  I do more damage with bow/arrows (in the right situation) and swords then with spells.  With lag spellscasting means you are taking even longer to cast..  So you lose DPS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Prior to PoP they had no non undead only DDs at all, only lifetaps, so I compared their best new lifetap, to their best old.  And yeah, they do get a 600 damage DD, but consider that if they're tanking or taking AoE damage they'll be tapping instead.  Also consider this only saves vs. disease, has a longer recast, and they don't two of them like we do.<br />

And I agree completely, but consider the original post of this thread; it was an &quot;oversite&quot;(sic) that we did not receive fury of magic, and the argument was &quot;they got it, therefore so should we&quot;.<br />
<br />
Would it have been nice to get fury of magic?  Sure.  It certainly would have.  I'm all for seeing it pop up on my AA list.  Just like I'm all for seeing ice comet and torpor pop up in my spellbook.<br />
<br />
But do we really need fury of magic for the simple reason pure casters recieved it?  No.<br />
<br />
If balance is assumed previous to change, then all classes must advance by the same amount, to remain balanced.  Right?  With our nuke upgrades compared to the improvements casters with fury of magic get, both from their spells *and* fury of magic, we *still* come out ahead with a larger gain.<br />

I remember when Verant did the balance line and the first thing they stated was rangers are not balanced but are just where we want them to be. Goes back a long way but the improvements that were suggested were never truly put in place.<br />

Oh come now, Comparing Fury of Magic with Ice Comet and Torpor is silly.  Adding 6% more crits, if it even is 6% more is not the same as having spells that are totally unbalanced.<br />

But do we really need fury of magic for the simple reason pure casters recieved it?  No.<br />

<br />
Hell no, not because pure casters recieved it, but because it makes more sense.  I personally want a reason to keep churning out AA's.  I want to be able to increase my ability to kill things on raids.  What I really liked about Luclin was the fact that we could tailor ourselves into the type of ranger we wanted to be.  You could get combat stability/agility if you wanted to tank, Healing Gift/Adept if you wanted to heal and Spell Casting Fury if you wanted to nuke better.  We had choices.. Alot of those choices were removed from us with PoP..<br />

I have always felt our nukes were underpowered, and over rated.<br />
When a mob has Hp of 10K a nuke of 206 and 150 mana use is very ineffecent... Call of Flame then considering the recast timeline on it more than just ineffecent. 2 sec cast 20 sec recovery.<br />
Considering the amount of Dmg our nukes really do if they are not resisted, or lowered because of the resist of the mob. I have a real problem when I am 15 levels higher than a mob and my nuke of 450 dmg and 200 mana is reduced to a 9hp dmg of non melee. <br />
The only slightly effective nuke we have is firestrike, because of the recovery time on the spell. <br />
If a druid can blast for 2500 at 60 then a ranger at 60 should be at min 625. that is 25 percent of the druid. Longer recovery time yes but at least it would be more effective and more balanced</div></div><hr />

What I compared the ranger nukes to were the classes recieving fury of magic.  And yes, SKs do get a &quot;new&quot; type of spell, in that they haven't had a straight DD before.

We still have the ability to solo via kiting, as cheesy as it may be, it works and is reasonably good xp.  I prefer rooting the mob so I don't have to kite it all over.  Hey, I even solo'd the red and yellow con guards in Valor this way-- never thought I'd be soloing a red con.<br />
<br />
We don't melee solo blues anymore, but it's possible with a slow proc on EC and rooting/healing.  It's just a lot more ineffecient than bow kiting; I've tried both.<br />
<br />
<br />
Alot of those choices were removed from us with PoP<br />
<br />
<br />
Not entirely.  We're really the best nukers now than we've ever been relative to druids, with two powerful nukes for both fire and cold, and god forbid a summoned mob wanders near us...<br />
<br />
In terms of healing, we're the best healers we've ever been relative to druids.  The same top cures as a druid minus curse cures, a decent fast heal, and regrowth make for decent spot and downtime heals.<br />
<br />
In terms of tanking, we can still get the CA/CS upgrades.  True, we don't get planar durability, but I've tanked tier 2 mobs np much to the surprise of my groupmates.  Granted I have good gear, but due to the AC cap I take damage just as fast as you do, and usually have a druid healing me so the HP gap is offset.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which is a good point.  Dunno if you've managed to hit 65 yet Relv, but I can tell you, dark blues outside of the planes are few and far between.  Pretty much all of velious and for sure all of Kunark and Old World are a waste of time.  Which again forces us to fight mobs that one round 2-3x as much dmg as Chloroblast does.  Its a fact that ranger heals will never be anything more than an emergency stop-gap until a real healer lands one.  Given that, how can you possibly defend the logic behind us getting PoP healing AAs, rather than nukes which are in fact an integral part of our every day encounters?<br />
<br />
Oh, and wanted to clear up one little misconception I saw above<br />
<br />
But in most situations I rather fire two arrows (with some chances of hitting for 500+ each shot) than to cast a spell for a few seconds<br />
<br />
Actually, our nukes are better DPS than even trueshot when they land full (which is most of the time in my experience).  Yes, we can shoot one arrow and do roughly 1k dmg instantly, however, that's not an accurate way to compare them.  Because on the other hand you could shoot one arrow and hit for 2 dmg, or miss.  In order to determine if your nukes are dps efficient, you have to look at what your avg dps is on a given mob.  If your bow or melee is only doing 100-150 dps, then I'd sure hope you take the time to cast FW, which even without a crit or dd bracer is still 350 dps.  Myself I always have that spell memmed now, and with a KEI I can afford to drop it once per mob and always stay FM.<br />
<br />
Either way, we should have received Fury of Magic.   Any class that uses magic to increase their dmg output should have gotten the skill.  But whatever, I guess I'll just put the points into the healing skills and start reading 'Relv's guide to healing 101' so I too can be a wannabe cleric.</div></div><hr />

<br />
no, beastlords and paladins both get the same one as we do, makes sence for paladins, doesn't for either us or beastlords, SK's get the upgrade to Spell Casting Deftness.<br />
<br />
it probably should be if they insist on only giving each hybrid 1-2:<br />
<br />
SK: Spell Casting Deftness upgrade<br />
Paladins: both heal AA upgrades<br />
Rangers: SCF upgrade<br />
Beastlords: buff duration upgrade?<br />
<br />
beastlords i'm not entirely sure on, but I know the beastlords do a bit of buffing in my guild.<br />
<br />
though in my personal opinion all the hybrids should get the respective upgrade to any of the AA's we got in luclin.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When ya get Chloroblast, want to exp some, and power level a gimp, yea, its very usefull.<br />
<br />
If you want to raid, and kill mobs as fast as possible, screw the healing, yea, Ill load one up to self heal from AE spells time to time, keeping over 2 bubs to avoid death aggro etc.<br />
<br />
As for Sasandra &quot;whining&quot; ****, she's got a point, the Priests and Casters, as well as Tanks recieved their class related AA skills with PoP.<br />
<br />
Rangers, Monks, Rogues for the most part haven't. Rogues and monks are getting a lot more than us also in comparison, seeing as they are now able to critically proc with their weapons just as we are.<br />
<br />
Personally I am a firm believer that Rangers should get the ingenuity AA so that we at least have the option to keep our crit spell rates above those of the non casting classes. And that damage meele should have an AA skill which increases our damage tables in scale to the Hp/Mitigation AA's of the tank classes.<br />
10-15% increase at maxed out skill would seem balanced to me.</div></div><hr />

Dunno if you've seen any parsing on this skill yet, but it seems to be at a lower rate than what we have.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
I'm all for having a high amount of HP... especially considering that we're a warrior hybrid with a taunt key... but sadly don't see this happening.<br />
<br />
Anyway again, I'd be more than happy to see fury of magic added, but let's be honest, PoP has been released and the odds of it being added post release and pretty slim.  And all isn't lost, we did get some good DD upgrades, so we're not completely SOL.<br />
<br />
And yes, I understand not many people care about our healing spells at all, but the ability is there and not exclusive of fury of magic; it's not one-or-the-other.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if you guys feel strongly about this and want to get it changed, email, feedback, dev corner posts would do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tullaian</div><div class="date">11-05-2002, 05:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ward summoned is useful , in the elemental planes for a start where 99% of the mobs are summoned creatures. few other places before that in pop where its useful. situational yes, not entirely useless though. ( big caveat there though that I think the elemental planes are going to be beyond 99% of the playerbase unless there is some easy way there that nobody has found )<br />
<br />
next thing.. we get 2 new nukes in PoP both 63+ which means you need spectral parchments. We aren't as uber as some guilds but we have killed Terris Thule, and unlocked quite a few extra zones and I think we have seen perhaps 4 spectral parchments so far which means that they drop either in zones like Torment and Hall of Honor or beyond. Again thats going to be out of the reach of many players. I cant see pickup raids killing Terris or Arein Dar. Bit disapointing that the nuking hybrid didnt get at least one new nuke sub 63. <br />
<br />
Chloroblast is a nice spell and has its uses. Certainly better than Gheal so its a welcome addition but I dont see myself rushing to buy healing AA just for it. Most of the rangers who have the healing line are lucky enough to have lifetap swords and also have SCF maxxed anyway. Well personally been killing Cursed for ages and still don't have Render nor AHB so I could care less about HA/HM until I am finished with all the melee, all the SCF and all the CF/COA lines then perhaps I might think about a healing aa. <br />
<br />
I would have infinitely preferred the PoP SCF upgrade over healing since I rely on my nukes over heals. And I would think anyone except rangers with 150+ AA is most likely in the same boat. <br />
<br />
I think most &quot;avg&quot; rangers would rather have more crit nukes than crit heals, and I think as the offensive hybrid we are certainly entitled to wonder why we didnt get it over more healing. <br />
<br />
Personally I am very underwhelmed by our AA in PoP other than Ferocity and to a lesser extent Entrap. <br />
<br />
I think the main thing is that hybrids are about options. I dont see why VI didnt give us all the caster AA like we got in Luclin, and then each hybrid could chose his path as he wished. <br />
<br />
I would certainly take SCF upgrade over Healing upgrade if I had the choice. <br />
<br />
Important thing is to remember that the avg. player probably has what ? less than 50 aa and given that.. healing upgrade aa are so far down the list of importance that they are really irrelvent to most of the ranger player base. I for one am very disapointed that the devs didnt see rangers prefer the offensive AA and gave us this over the nukes version. <br />
<br />
shrug. <br />
<br />
I would hope that they will add it to our options eventually.</div></div><hr />

If a druid can blast for 2500 at 60 then a ranger at 60 should be at min 625. that is 25 percent of the druid. Longer recovery time yes but at least it would be more effective and more balanced <br />
<br />
Well, that's interesting, because a druid that nukes for 2500 at 60 is obviously using a focus item and has SCF 3 (max druid nuke at 60 is 1150).  A ranger with the same focus item and AA ability can nuke for 990.  So you've just argued that our nuking is fine.</div></div><hr />

Our Luclin AA's were by far the best of any class period in terms of class power.  Our pop aa's are more vanilla, but they have to be for balance reasons except for Headshot the useless :P.  People keep asking why we didn't get an upgrade to archery mastery or in the archery line...<br />
<br />
We did.  Fury of the ages 3 gives me on average 30 percent of my damage from crits compared to 19 percent before.  What's more, levels scaled our archery damage up, so we hit even harder.  Guardians of the forest 3 combined with trueshot is very powerful for that 48 seconds if you have a tank.  Go buy a gamepad now, you will be wearing out your 4 key or whatever soon :P  The simple truth is that Rangers are SLAUGHTERING stuff that eats many classes for breakfast in this xpac.  Other than rogues, monks, or wizards with prima aa/gear, we slaughter anyone else in raid DPS, unless you count a bard's influence on main tank damage shields.  What's more, if we don't attack buff that same rogue or monk, we match lesser geared counterpart's output a lot of the time provided we own the right bow, and have the conditions met to use it.  <br />
<br />
Sure, our melee dmg isnt right up there with the other damage melees, but it's not supposed to be either.  Darnit I still do dern well, with autoheals offf my processes to boot.  I heal on average 500 more hitpoints a mob, sometimes as many as 2 thousand BECAUSE of our healing aa's so many rangers neglected in luclin, and I haven't invested in the new ones yet either.  But trust me, I will.  I can buff 130 atk and 125 hps that stacks with everything but a beastlord or paladin buff, and 70 atk regardless.  My self imbue proc will soon be 150 dmg, and I can selfbuff a monster damage shield once Protection of the Wild is found.  I regen mana faster with my spells, I can root with damage or without, I can snare for 10 minutes without a spell gem that will never fizzle, heal for 470(940) crit, nuke for 771/700(1383)(1400) crits with brushfire/frozen wind respectively (ring of flamewarding focus=26%)and I deal around 100 dps in straight-up tanking melee without any processes at all in xp groups in tier 2-3 planes.  If I don't have to tank watch out, because when we drop back and use bows our dps jumps by 50 or more.<br />
<br />
The glass is deinately half full.  Would ingenuity be nice?  Sure would be great to have more spell crits!  Take headshot and replace it with that lol, lord knows it's completely worthless until they change it to a guaranteed critical shot for 1.5x max damage that goes off once every 100 shots or so for that eye candy 3.5 grand shot in trueshot we all crave :)  Other than that, really I can't complain.  I'm sorry, but rangers fit quite niceley in the planes of power, and if you can't see the light at the end of the tunnel, you need to xp a lot more :)  Don't give up hope and put points in everything, and you will see the bigger picture.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mage summoned focus items are equippable by rangers, and yes, we certainly do get SCF3.  The issue we've been discussing is that we don't get the PoP critical nuking ability (effectively SCF6), which is inconsistent with Luclin's AA.</div></div><hr />

You should be able to solo mass quantities of golems in valor with your gear, I know I could :)  You can also solo the majority of mobs in halls of honor.  You don't need uber gear to take advantage of archery mastery aa and EQ. Even a BFT or velium bow puts out amazing dps versus these high level mobs, and allows us to kill many things other classes just can't.<br />
<br />
I appreciate the flame by the way, thanks&gt;  First one on this board ever.  It is NOT my fault you don't have many aa, your magelo proves you have a fantastic bow, you should be owning everything you come in contact with in the planes that doesnt summon.  Even with a velium bow NAKED I can kill off mobs in valor, I did it this weekend to prove a point.  Level 65, AA, and a good bow is all we need to tear apart this xpac. (good bow = 30 38 or thereabouts)  If you need any advice on where to hunt send me a tell, but try to keep the flames from overflowing out of your cauldron :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, the glass is half-full. But there is a crack in the glass, and thats where we are losing content. The half is getting lower and lower.<br />
<br />
The whole point of this thread is that the majoirty feel we were given Pally-type AA. Relv started out pretty much telling us to sit down and be happy, that we weren't bright enough to realize that our parent class was really a Cleric (ie: primary role was healing). Having an opinion is one thing. Telling us that we are wrong and should be happy with what we get (and not to expect anything else) is an invitation to higher degrees of debate.<br />
<br />
Celt, what you and Relv did with your Aa and what others do with thier AA isn't the point. Yes, you can heal mucho damage. Great. I have 1 levl of healing gift, and will probably do all of the healing AA's in time. But that doesn't mean we are supposed to. In PoP, you are. Why? after the melee AA's, there isn't anything else. No mana regen, no wisdm increase other than general, no crit nukes, no interrupts...none of the Luclin AA's at all. If you are happy, fine...be happy. But telling us we need to &quot;xp more&quot; is rather insulting. How about I just play your toon, as you make it seem that to be having fun is to do what you do, and have your gear. Again, I ask you (without sarcasm this time) to take a moment to consider the perspectives of others not in your shoes. That's all. I am not attacking you, I just find it hard to accept your version of Rangers being &quot;just fine&quot; when in truth, it is more like &quot;I am just fine&quot;. And you are. Nothing wrong with that. The only guarentee we all have is that we can all get full aa &amp; 65 if we play long enough. Gear is another matter entirely.<br />
<br />
What if I wanted  to be a super healing Ranger? I can't, I only get 2 choices. After those,  your mana abilites are maxed back at Luclin levels. Can't even make your buffs (regrowth) last longer. *edit* and I have about 80 AA atm. Not in the God-like levels some of you have, but its not like I have nothing. So, I don't feel I asked anyone to apologize for having high-low aa. I will have them all eventually if I keep at it. Will I be a complete Ranger? No, I will just have all the stuff that Verant gave us, and none of the things they didn't.<br />

Obviously there are far too many people with the &quot;kicked puppy&quot; syndrome here.  I'm not sure you'd be happy even with fury of magic; it's a mediocre gain at best.

<br />
druids are just as much nukers as they are healers, they are tied with mages for 2nd best nuker in the game, if anything they should split us with fury of magic and one of the two healing AA's not both, that would be the closest match in comparison to our parent class. in actual ability I would almost call druids a wizard/cleric hybrid because that is really where they fall ability wise, calling them a priest class doesn't really fit them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renwin Everfool</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 06:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually the AA system is designed just like that, Relv. If you wanted to play a caster-ranger, you could focus on that. Nukes, or heals, or both. If you wanted to be a melee-ranger, you could. Offense, defense, or both. If you wanted to be an archer-ranger, you could.<br />
<br />
So, a Ranger that takes different Aa's becomes a more specialized role player.<br />
<br />
Ranger #1 takes eq, am3, scf3, mc3....hes a range damage-dealer.<br />
Ranger #2 takes cf3, fb3, ca3, cs3, and Ambi...he's a tank-type.<br />
Ranger #3 takes hg3, ha3, mc3, am3, eq...he's a range damage-dealer, but can heal moreso than #1 and #2. <br />
<br />
 And many other combos.<br />
<br />
Can't do anything like this in PoP. You either go melee or healer, then go get whatever you didn't get first.  Can't mix-and-match. There just aren't that many AA paths this time around. Most are just Luclin +1.<br />
<br />
Again, some of you are happy with things as they are. Great. That doesn't make you wrong. It doesn't make you right, either. Nor are we who dislike the current AA lineup wrong/right. This is just a thread of opinions. <br />
<br />
I like the options of picking what type of AA path to go. I also like Ice Cream. You might not like AA variety, or Ice Cream. It's ok...you don't have to like what I like. But I am not wrong for liking what I like. I am just me.<br />

<br />
/goes a little off topic here...<br />
So...me and my pally friend decided to go do a little test the other day. (dunno if that's relevant; we're both only 52)<br />
<br />
What we did was we went out to find green cons with a decent amount of HP, him weilding his Argent Protector, me a Warblade of the Fallen and sabretooth.<br />
<br />
It was a pretty crude experiment, I have to admit, and we couldn't be bothered doing parsing.  But, net result; he took tyhe mob down quicker every single time.  So now pallies can do more damage, have more hp, ac, and can heal better. Apparently. (correct me if I'm wrong...which I hope I am)<br />
<br />
/goes back on topic<br />
<br />
Percentages, I think, don't have any place in this discussion. 1% of a high mobs health is, after 100% of a lower one's.  Talking in cold, hard HPs, I do believe Ranger's have been shortchanged in the nuke department.  Sure, Chloro is a great heal, but in all honesty, most of the classes you'll come across out there will have the same if not better heal, which, in a group scene, can put us out of the healing business pretty fast.<br />
<br />
I've never been to a high end raid, but, from what I've heard, I don't think it's the Rangers business to sit back and heal everyone.  Yea, throw in the occasional heal, maybe, but that is not our primary purpose.  Which means that our secondary purpose has been upgraded over our primary one, and that ainna good thing.<br />
<br />
It strikes me that what this topic has all boiled down to is this: What is the Ranger's Primary purpose in the game?<br />
<br />
To me, the answer is damage. To others, it may be different, but I'm sticking to my guns. Bow, whatever.... :P<br />
<br />
Oh yea, one last thing...<br />
Can we leave druid out of it? Sure, they're our parent class but no matter what anyone says I AM NOT A DRUID. The Ranger is a class on its own, with its own unique skills that should not in any way be affected by one of its parent classes.</div></div><hr />

Pure melee get PE in SoL AA. Pure melee get Crit Procs (even cheaper) in PoP AA. We don't get Planar Durability. We don't get Ingenuity to increase our proc crits. We dont get Spell Fury in PoP.<br />

Its a no-brainer. We are getting screwed in PoP AA.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shalrath Mandur</div><div class="date">11-15-2002, 12:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play a Druid and I just thought I would drop in and say hello. Since this thread seems to have a lot of commentary of my class I thought I would just add my own perspective here. I'd like to re-iterate that this is *my* perspective and not that of the druid community as a whole.<br />
<br />
Druids on Raids and in Groups:<br />
We Heal, Buff and cast key utility spells (such as Flight of Eagles, Damage Shields etc). Nuking is a subsidiary role that we only engage in when it is clear as daylight that it will in no way affect our primary duties. I seriously dispute the suggestion that the Druid class is tied with Mages as 2nd best nuker. This class in a co-operative environment is best played to mitigate damage, rather than instatiate it.<br />
<br />
Druids Solo:<br />
Obviously, no druid is going to get anywhere in a solo situation unless a hefty amount of damage is dealt out. Though the 'Snare, Root and DoT' method is more commonly used, some encounters are exclusively based on Magical DD - such as quadkiting. Lately, more and more druids are hunting solo using animal pets to almost effectively double our DPS output with a noticeble decrease in mana consumption. The downside has always been the huge increase in risk. This has been somewhat offset with the inception of the AAXP Ability, Dire Charm. Dire Charm is losing popularity in PoP now though, because the level cap on possible pets is rendering them relatively ineffective against the new, tougher mobs. <br />
<br />
My Druidy perspective on whether Rangers should be better nukers or healers is this - To each their own. This is the mantra we teach all the widdle puppy druids. Don't let anyone tell you how best to play your class, since being able to find what works best for you is what will help you emerge as a creative player that thinks on his/her paws. <br />
<br />
IMHO opinion though, the ability to Heal is a hell of a lot more useful than nuking simply because while you will only see marginal upgrades in your DPs in combat. On the other hand, your viability as a single lone player will shoot through the roof. ESPECIALLY in a PvP scenario.<br />
<br />
Just my thoughts.<br />
<br />
Nice ta meetcha bye.</div></div><hr />
