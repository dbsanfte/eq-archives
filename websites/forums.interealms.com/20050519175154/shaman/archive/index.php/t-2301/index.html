<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, I finally got Baron and I am closing on my second AXP point after that. Time to make some choices for my Archetype AXP path.<br />
<br />
I want to go after Cannibalization, so that means I need to do Mental Clarity 1,2,3. However, some other things look nice too.<br />
<br />
Channeling Focus would be damn nice to stop interrupts of Torpor / epic / etc. while being hit.<br />
<br />
Spell Casting Mastery would be a nice mana saver and would cut back on those annoying Fizzles.<br />
<br />
Here is my BIG question though for you 60 Shamen with lots of AXP: if I go after Spell Casting Reinforcement, will it extend the duration of Torpor? And if Torpor lasts longer, does it heal more over that time?<br />
<br />
If Spell Casting Reinforcement works with Torpor, then there is no question that I should get that over the others. And probably Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery too!<br />
<br />
No real interest in Spell Casting Fury, Healing Apedt, or Healing Gift a this time. They would not help me much, given my play style.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thordan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did Mental clarity 3 first and then went to Cann 5 right away. I think Cann 5 is the best skill we get overall so that was a no brainer for me. After that I did MGB because I spend 90% of my time raiding and it was pretty nice to have. Then I did Quick Buff 1 and 2, and after that I did Rabid Bear.<br />
<br />
It just depends on what you do most of the time. If you spend a ton of time raiding then get MGB. I also like Spell Casting Mastery but it really isn't needed since I almost NEVER run out of mana with Cann 5. Rabid Bear was cool just to have as a toy but the points could have been spent better in other places, I got it just because I wanted my class title.<br />
<br />
If you solo alot the quick buff for torpor, channeling focus for the interrupts when slowing and torporing yourself, and spell casting reinforcement for extending torpor would be the way to go. For raiding MGB and spell casting reinforcement are prolly your best bets. Personally I am going for spell casting reinforcement right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kazlaaz Bonedust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just go after MC3 and get Cannibalize rigth away, by this time you'll have a pretty good grasp on what you want next. Rabid Bear is fun the first few times, but very useless. Quick Buff is kinda good, especially for torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Still looking for an answer to:<br />
<br />
&quot;Does Spell Casting Reinforcement extend the duration of Torpor? And if Torpor lasts longer, does it heal more over that time?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yes it does.  just an argument as to how much reinforcement you need to make a difference</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have 2 points in SCR now and always get 1500hp Torpors. I didn't notice if I did with SCR 1 though.<br />
<br />
Jormal Dawnhammer<br />
Oracle of Winter<br />
Bristlebane</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Good advice from Kazlaaz. <br />
First get through Canni5, then you can decide on the rest.<br />
<br />
After Canni 5 the most valuable skills for me personally are Spell Casting Reinforcement for longer torpor and Quickbuff for faster torpor.<br />
Lots of other shaman will do Mass Group Buff.  Lots of people get another class skill for the class title.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">For arch type i did MC 2 and fury 2, i worked on fury b/c i didn't know i needed MC3 for canablization.  So i went for MGB first mainly b/c i'm the ONLY active shaman in my guild.  Trust me, doing  MGB on 60 ppl is very cool.   I actually had a person go LD b/c of the spam :P.  I'm working on MC3 then canablization.  Then quick buff 3 then if i have time before PoP, SCM 3.<br />
<br />
Any shaman with SCM3 could u comment on how it is?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fenril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I did MC1 and 2, then Fury 1 and 2 cuz I'm soloing a lot with JBB and, at this time, critics dd worked on right click.<br />
<br />
When VI changed this, I did MC3 and got Cannibalization yesterday.<br />
<br />
Next in line will be MGB.<br />
<br />
After, I dunno.<br />
<br />
Maybe Spell Casting Reinforcement or Quick Buff or Channeling Focus, not sure which one still but not any other skills ;).</div></div><hr />
