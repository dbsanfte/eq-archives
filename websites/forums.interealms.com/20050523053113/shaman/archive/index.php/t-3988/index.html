<br />
thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Batuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've spent many hours in PoG and I can attest that there are no problems from the bridge to the bank area.  I'm not sure about the rest of the city.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Doubt it. I've hunting PoG pretty much since SoV came out and I stayed bound in FV until SoL came out and I rebound in the bazaar. I never aggroed any of the clerics/pallys in fv, Quite the contrary I actually bought stuff from them.<br />
<br />
I spent all of the time from SoV came out to when SoL came out with ruined PoG faction yet still bound in FV and never once aggroed anything. I have heard there there is one npc around someplace thats part of the druid epic that is on one of the factions you ruin but I sure never ran into them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Staying out of POG will accomplish nothing.  There is no way to get the right factions back, no way that's reasonable anyway.  Not sure why in the world you would wish to get the faction back tho.  Other than for pure roleplaying/obsessive-compulsive reasons.<br />
<br />
FV is safe, just don't go to the cleric/pally guild in the big building, and there is also a ranger around there who will hate you.  I don't remember her exact loc, but it's off the beaten path.  Just don't get too happy exploring the city and you'll be fine.  Ranger NPCs can be evil.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">stay off the stone circle thing that surrounds FV, there's a lvl 45 druid or ranger npc there on the west side who'll run at sow speed. that's all i have encountered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There is at least one roaming NPC on a faction you lose in PoG. And it can path by the bank. There are a few static ones too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The faction for the ranger NPC on the docks can be fixed by giving Muffins to Pandos.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">thanks alot guys. i went to just now and everything is fine. yay! oh and i am complusive about factions....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Plane of Growth:<br />
Servants of Tunare got worse<br />
Clerics of Tunare got worse<br />
Soldiers of Tunare got worse<br />
Faydarks Champions got worse<br />
<br />
Pandos Flintside, West Freeport:<br />
Faydarks Champions got better<br />
King Tearisthex got better<br />
Clerics of Tunare got better<br />
Soldiers of Tunare got better<br />
Crushbone Orcs got worse<br />
<br />
So while you can't fix the PoG faction itself, you can fix the other three.  I haven't bothered because I figure I'll be back to PoG and ruin it again anyway.<br />
<br />
Sisters at the dock in OOT are one of those but they're low level.<br />
<br />
Majority in FV docks are on FV faction, but I couldn't tell you about every NPC that isn't.</div></div><hr />

Also, a bunch of greenies on the way to Kedge, more annoying than anything.  I'm also very KOS in the Kelethin druid/ranger guilds and Felwithe cleric guilds, but that doesn't affect banking in either city.</div></div><hr />
