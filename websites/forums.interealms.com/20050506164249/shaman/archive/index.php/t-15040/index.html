<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Khaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was out 'slummin' the other night with my Barb Warrior Alt in OT, I just so needed to mindlessly wail on some critters when I get picked up by a great group at the SF Ramp.<br />
<br />
There was a Shaman in the group and I really wanted to 'give advice' to him because he was not slowing mobs, Dogdog was not in Alpha Mode and just several other things that just seemed not right.  But, I didn't....I figured he was playing as he liked and it was not my job to tell him how to play his class.  <br />
<br />
Now, should I have given him some hints and suggestions?  Did I do him a diservice not passing on some of the wisdom I have picked up from this great well of knowledge?  What would be the best way to give some 'advice' to a person who has no clue you play his class also and are just trying to help?<br />

Even at 63 I often don't alpha my dog in a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bukbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The dog you probably wouldn't have to mention.  Alpha pet really shines when solo and is just kind of nice in a group.  However slowing is a different story.  It would have made a big difference for the entire group.  Now saying &quot;Why isn't the shaman slowing&quot; or &quot;Slow the mobs you lazy shaman&quot; isn't a good way to go.  You have to find a polite way to suggest it to the group and shaman so he'll learn something of enormous value to help him along and it will help the group a bunch.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Togh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You have to be careful with your advice. Things that may be gospell at high levels may not make sense at low levels.<br />
<br />
For instance, if you are in OT, then the group was probably a mid-30's group.<br />
<br />
At that level, the shaman's dog won't alpha. Our 55 pet barely dual wields. Not sure about 49. I pretty darn sure that our level 34 or 39 won't at all.<br />
<br />
Also, if it's a good OT group, then mobs are dying very quickly and tank/puller is probably not taking much damage. In that situation, it may not make sense to slow at all. Remember, at that level we don't have a 75% slow, we have a &lt;50% slow. It may make more sense just to heal or nuke rather than slow.<br />
<br />
Obviously, a shaman not slowing in a PoP group requires some adjustment and makes no sense. I shaman not slowing every mob in a chain pulling OT group does not necessarily = stupid.<br />
<br />
So I guess what I'm saying is I see no problem &quot;giving advice&quot;, but you need to be careful about the advice you give and not come off as a know-it-all. At least, that's the etiquette as I see it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">At that level, the shaman's dog won't alpha. Our 55 pet barely dual wields. Not sure about 49. I pretty darn sure that our level 34 or 39 won't at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually, it has been proven many times that ALL of our pets dual wield, I have seen it myself in the battle spam for all of our pets (except the 61 one, as I'm not of that level yet, but I know that one will as well). From my experience, the difference is pretty significant too, especially if you buff with HoS or something like it, and haste. I'd say an unbuffed unalpha dog will be lucky to put out half the damage an alphad and buffed pet does. And all it takes is giving 2 rustys (make him even better with proc weapons), can't see any reason to not always have pet alphad, soloing or grouping. It's such a big deal to me at least, that last night I made someone go to a vendor and buy me some weaps while on their way to our camp spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>mgbaron2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Here's my take on the situation (considering the shaman's perspective):<br />
<br />
1)  Alpha dog - he might not have known, I didn't find out until I was low 40's and even then would only do it when I wanted the extra damage while soloing.  Most groups didn't need it, even for bigger named mobs.<br />
<br />
2)  Slowing mobs - I never consistantly slowed a mob until around level 40 or so.  While soloing it was more efficient to drop a poison dot and tear through the mob with melee/mutt.  Around the level 40-43 range it started to become more mana efficient to slow than to dot on most blue mobs.  And when grouped it wasn't worth the mana to slow it at all.  <br />
<br />
Now my perspective as a 53 shaman:<br />
<br />
1)  Mutt is always alpha'd and I kick myself if I ever forget/run out of weapons.<br />
<br />
2)  My view on slow stays the same.  Just last night I was grouping at the giant fort in Burning Woods with some guildies.  Earlier in the night I solo'd the fort.  Here's what I found:  While solo, I'd slow every mob - but only with Togor's (Turgors only on named).  Why?  No need for Turgors - Togors and regrowthed/alpha dog was more than a match for any giant.  While grouped, I didn't slow at all.  It seemed like such a waste to drop a slow on a giant only to have him fall over dead 20 seconds later.  I tried it with slow and without slow and it was more mana efficient to drop an occasional heal on the tank than slow every mob.  Granted that view changes when you head to a tougher zone.  PoI factory group the night before had Turgors on every mob.  In my opinion, slowing strategy drastically changes as you hit tougher zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bukbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Also, if it's a good OT group, then mobs are dying very quickly and tank/puller is probably not taking much damage.

<br />
That's very, very true.  It was something I forgot all about.  I've levelled so slowly that I forgot how fast the mobs drop with a good group at those levels.  I'd start casting slow and by the time it hit the mob would be down to 70%, if it didn't stick I wasted the mana - and at that level slow was a lot of mana.  Also those fast groups were tough to keep the mana up in if I had to heal, buff, haste forget about slowing or even a DD or Dot.  Slowing optional depending on the group.  If there is a chanter mezzing any adds it's worth slowing them so when it breaks the chanter doesn't die, generally the mobs drop so quickly slowing is a waste of mana really.<br />
<br />
Alpha doggie is still optional in the group I think.  Definitely haste him, that's the timer as to when you have to haste the rest of the group.  Nothing makes a tank smile bigger than when that haste starts flashing and it's automatically refreshed.<br />

Yeah we were tearing the mobs apart pretty fast, so I can see not slowing the baddies down...All in all, I think you have hit it on the head: There are lots of ways to play and as long as we're whackin the baddies faster then they are whackin us, it's the right way...no matter what my style is.<br />

And as its been said, at that lvl and in a good group, it may be better to just haste/regen/heal than to slow every mob. especially if the shaman isint twinked and doesnt have a big mana pool</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, it's very bad to give BL pets weapons.  Possible exceptions are HtH weapons, but the standard weapon types all make them do LESS damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Beastlord pets dual wield without help..just like every other pet class's pet does. <br />
<br />
As far as original post goes... The pet at that level isnt very likely to successfully dual wield so giving him weapons would be a waste of time overall, but yes would increase damage marginally.  Not slowing every mob was probably a good plan especially since the high level buff nerf, if he had kei it might have  made more sense to slow or maybe nuke who knows...  The only advice i'd think of giving to a shaman is if he wasnt casting canni ever...if you sit and med you better have a darn good reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Here's how:<br />
<br />
Khaka tells the group, &quot;Wow these mobs are hitting FAST! Is slow getting resisted a lot?&quot;<br />
<br />
As for the dog - weapons make a big difference. How can anyone say different? Not only do the countless tests listed on these forums tell us that, but just watch the battle spam - it's unmissable. If he's not alphaing the dog, do it for him then tell him you did it. He'll learn just by seeing how much more effective he is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>HordainPrima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">One thing to think of, in my previous experience there have been twink (well haste geared) warriors or SKs who could care less about slows and are more interested in buffs/heals - especially when a druid/cleric isn't available when camping the ramp or shelf in OT. If the DPS is decent enough, the cycle rate is high, the down time is low, and the MT is happy who cares? Now hunting in higher levels, well, there's when the Slowing Shaman starts to earn his/her salt....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Curare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hi All,<br />
<br />
I read shaman's crucible for the very valuable info, thanks to all who post here. I am a 45 shaman and I haven't heard this phrase yet - Alpha Dog - from the context I think an Alpha Dog is when it has weapons and a few buff's.<br />
<br />
As for my dog, he's always by my side when in a group or soloing. I find that he helps out in groups. I always give my dog weapons that I loot - if the speed of the weapon is 30 or under my dog gets it. I have found that if I give weapons to him that are 37 speed he can bite faster that that. I always haste my pet and sometimes buff him with Talisman depending on the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well the way I usually give advice is in private messages.  Doing it in public chat makes people get defensive.  Even so, make sure you do it nicely.  Such as:<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I noticed you weren't slowing, I play a shaman as well.  It really helps the cleric and healers if you slow, that way they don't have to heal as much.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that said, when I grouped in DL on my shaman, it was more mana efficent to nuke and sick dogdog on them, rather than slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Spite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Your mileage may vary, but sometimes if you have a nice, sizable damage shield, it's better to not slow.  Or if someone's chain stunning to gain aggro.  <br />
<br />
In Overthere, with how people are twinked nowadays, I'd say it's a wash if it is always useful or not to slow.  Especially if you're killing mobs pretty quickly, people aren't hurting for heals, and there isn't any downtime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Zillanex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">As a noob to the shaman class(only lvl 15) and untwinked since this guy is on another server then the one i normally play on, casting slow for me costs loads of mana and only lasts to mob is down to 50% or so, is it only me or does the chanter slow have longer duration? could be my chanter is lvl 39.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The same thing happened to me, in reverse, at the FM giant fort in my low 30's.  A warrior grouped with us who had a high-level shaman main.  He tactfully asked me (in tell) why I wasn't slowing.<br />
<br />
At the time, I was using Quickness for haste (about 30% haste) and Tagar's for slows (about 33% slow).  Quickness on three melee in the group meant a whole extra tank's worth of damage output, starting from the moment of engagement, and lasting through several fights.  Dead mobs have very little damage output, so more damage from our side means less total damage taken.<br />
<br />
I didn't have enough mana to do both, so I chose the Quickness route.<br />
<br />
He accepted my reasoning, although I got the impression he wouldn't have played it that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>trolebus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Well, my opinion... if pulls go too fast for you to slow all mobs, change to a lower lvl slow (less mana).  I always slow since lvl 14, when i was told of the importance of this spells.  My 2cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Actually this makes more sense than it first appeared.  The thing is, Walking Sleep is doing about 25% slow for only 60 mana, and Tagar's is doing about 33% for 125 mana - more than twice as much mana for only 1/3 more effect.  Wow.  I wish I'd realized that at level 30, lol.<br />
<br />
The &quot;value&quot; of the slow depends on how long the mob lives after slow lands, as well as the melee DPS of the mob.  Assuming a 50dps mob, Walking Sleep mitigates around 12.5 dps, and Tagar's around 16.7 dps.  <br />
<br />
For this to match the efficiency of a Greater Heal (300 health for 150 mana) it only takes about 10 seconds for Walking Sleep to justify itself, but Tagar's takes 15 seconds to pay for itself.  So if a mob with that DPS is living less than 15 seconds after you land your slow, you're better off with Walking Sleep.<br />
<br />
(Note: I have no idea what the real DPS of the OT or FM mobs are, so take all this with a grain of salt.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
This way, put the blame on yourself for having subpar armor and NEED the shaman's assistance.  I am sure they would appreciate that more than something said in group and/or in a &quot;you are not doing it right&quot; kind of way.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I always try to phrase these sorts of things in the form of a neutral group-wide question.  As in &quot;do you think it would make more sense to slow instead of DoT?&quot;<br />
<br />
If you're polite, your group will generally gain respect for you for trying to learn more about the game and improve the overall kill-rate, regardless of whether you are actually correct or not.<br />
<br />
And with the rest of the group behind you, its easier to get someone to adopt the appropriate tactic.  For me, its a lot more rewarding to take charge in a mediocre group and turn them around than just bail and look for a new group.<br />
<br />
I still remember joining a group of high-40s (with a 52 warrior that was still wearing some crafted) to PoD.  When I joined, they were medding to full between kills and raving about the 'great exp'.  By the time we left, we were non-stop pulling two at a time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I dont think the delay matters for a pet anymore.  Didnt they set the delay to be 30 somthing for all weapons?  Anyway, I never looked at the delay really.  The only thing that matters is getting the weapons in your pets hand.<br />
<br />
I seem to recall giving your pet one weapon will automatically cause your pet to duel wield.  Were shaman pets included with that?  didi I miss that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Giving pet 1 weapon will not cause him to duel wield unless that weapon is off hand only (i.e. will equip in secondary slot, but not primary). Normally, you have to give dogdog 2 weapons (both must be 1 hand, not 2 hand) to get him to duel wield. The weapon damage and delay is irrelevant. The only real difference you can make is giving dogdog proccing weapons, other than that, rusty daggers are good enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>robxiii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I dont come here often, so NO CLUE what Alpha dog means, can anyone answer?  3 other posts have asked :P<br />
<br />
  I assume it means giving em 2 similar weapons to duel weild, etc.. but not sure on the phrase...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Alpha dog refers to &quot;Project Alpha&quot;; which is an open secret within the Shaman Community<br />
<br />
Project Alpha was the codename invented by this community for the investigation of our pet's ability to wield weapons, and the effect thereof. Remember, our pet is a wolf, and as such has paws, not fingers. Also, unlike other pets, our pet has no grphic for wielding a weapon. So, when it was discovered that our pets actually can wield weapons, it was generally thought that this was an oversight on Verant/Sony's part. <br />
<br />
Initially, this was seen as an irrelevant oddity, because the weapon damage / delay did not seem to effect the pets DPS. However, it was then discovered that if the pet was given 2 weapons, the DPS increased significantly (in the region of 20 - 30%). When this was discovered, the shaman community were excited, but also remained convinced that this was a mistake by Verant/Sony, so initially, this was treated as a secret, on the premise that if it was discovered, the nerf stick would be waved, and the ability to wield / duel wield would be removed. <br />
<br />
So, the early discussions never directly referred to pets duel wielding - as an attempt to keep everything secret, it was just referred to as &quot;Project Alpha&quot;...and the name has stuck, even though it is no longer really a secret.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hehe, yeah, it is a joke spell... Waste of a slot. For it to be worth casting, the mana cost would have to remain the same and the duration increased to about 45 minutes... Otherwise a waste of mana. And the 7 minute duration? An insult.</div></div><hr />

Besides haste of course.  If only Talisman of Alacrity covered your pet, I'd probably use it over SLTW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Since this thread has turned into something of an &quot;all about pets&quot; discussion, I will just mention the following:<br />
<br />
*Strength buffs increase pets damage output<br />
*Dex buffs increase pets damade output only if a proccing weapon is being used<br />
*Agi buffs do not effect pet's AC<br />
*Stam buffs do not affect pet's total hp<br />
*Direct hp buffs (talisman of altuna, for example) do affect pet's total hp<br />
*Your pet will automatically assume the resists that yo have, so if you have buffed your own, no need to buff pet's<br />
