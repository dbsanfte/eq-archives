<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When I group or raid and we are about to take on harder mobs, I load up Togor's and sinia for some safety net. Well, since I been doing this, the last 8 or 9 times here's my routine........1) Malos 2) Malosinia 3) Turger's (which is resisted) 4) Togor's (which sticks).<br />
<br />
Has anyone else noticed the lower level slow landing before Turger's? I remember one time, against a mini in BoT, Turger's bounces, Togor's lands, so throughout the fight I tried to get Turger's to stick.....cast FIVE times and he resisted them all. <br />
<br />
So, just a really big coincedence with the RNG, or have others noticed this too?</div></div><hr />

That's what I think it is - just random luck.</div></div><hr />

It's called Ortin, sure you can find the exact version you want on http://www.eqinterface.com</div></div><hr />

Looks like a Iceyblue variation. Nice but too cluttered, i like the original that Leoice used to update. Someone took it and ran with it too i think. I know im running a updated version that i found from www.eqgui.com forums. Just FYI incase you wanna look into it. I would assume if there is one variation, there could be more.</div></div><hr />
