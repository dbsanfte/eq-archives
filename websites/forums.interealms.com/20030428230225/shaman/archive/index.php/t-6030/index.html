<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gheff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I give.... I've looked in a few locations and can no longer find the info...<br />
<br />
I saw on a potion list at one time(for old world potions) a potion called Vamperic somethingorother... Takes a herb and a griffon feather to make.... Effect is HP to Mana conversion .. IE Cani in a bottle...<br />
<br />
Anyone have the details on that??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gheff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Brain fart ... found it...<br />
<br />
Vampiric Spirit  Griffon Feathers, Feverfew 115-127 HpToMana (-180 HP, +60 mana) <br />
<br />
Anyone confirm this works before I start shouting to n00bs for feathers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tienen Crazywolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It works, I gave a 10 charge to one of my guild clerics, worked when we didnt have a mage handy. Not sure on the sale value to others, pretty pricey to make.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">druids would love this...why didn't i think of this before =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gheff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Another hidden gem .. is the remove disease potion... Made a few and melees love them... Not sure on how hard it is to collect the components since I basically bought a few when surfing the bazaar....<br />
<br />
Spurn Affliction  Zombie Skin, Reucoat Herb &lt;102 Cure Disease</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sateeva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Vampiric Spirit, a guild raid time saver I was sure. Until I made up a 10 stack for one of our guild clerics. At skill 170 you still fail alot. I think the -180 HP to +60 mana is wrong. She clicked thru the entire stack and the mana back was not worth the cost of making these. They don't even come close to the mod rods. Another sux attempt at achemy by Verant!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Consider that this is old school Alchemy, which was put in the game when the level cap was at 50, and the only Mod Rods in the game were the 44th ones (225hp/ 150 mana).</div></div><hr />

Waitwaitwaitwaiiiiiit a bit....<br />
<br />
Is this a new PoP potion? Didnt find it anywhere else on charts...<br />
<br />
Though we do have a counteract disease potion that cost 7pp per combine, cast time instant, trivials at around 70...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Happylilelf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">No, it's not a new PoP potion. It's an old pre Kunark potion that was brought back somewhere in the middle up Luclin. It's been in game for at least 3 months and it's just as useless as almost all the other potions.</div></div><hr />
