For the first time since downloadable upgrades I was out today and bought 2 of the actual box expansion. Inside to my surprise...<br />

A KEYCHAIN OF OUR EPIC 2.0!!!!!!!!!!<br />

So instead of all the fixes you wanted you can at least show all your friends what your cathead looks like.<br />

/cackleI bought two expansions too, and got the same keychain in both, Shaman Epic 2.0.  Anyone want to trade one for an SK keychain?</div></div><hr />

Anyone know what the in-game item is and what particle effect you get from it?</div></div><hr />

The in game item is supposed to be something you can equip and then click to make a clickie buff. The clickie buff will surround the player with a particle effect which will last as long as the buff lasts.<br />
<br />
SPARKLY...must...have...sparkly</div></div><hr />

So, what does the effect do?  Or is it just a graphic thing?</div></div><hr />

I disagree.  If you have any idea how hard it was to get the engagement and wedding rings for my wife, you'd see things my way. ;)  For her wedding band we HAD to have it custom made, she literally broke out the eyepiece and examined the stones going into her wedding band.  Her and the jeweler were discussing occlusions while I was sitting there pretending to see whatever she showed me, having no idea what she was looking at.  I swear it's like that laser art where you gotta stare at it for hours before you see the rabbit.</div></div><hr />

i think i would like the ice one better, since i am a Barbarian from the north :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I was married, I did not have a lot of money, but we were at the jeweler's for hours.  I was still at school at the time, and I actually spent my tution on the ring.  That should have told me something back then :p <br />
<br />
Once she found the one she liked, she played with it for hours and hours and hours.  It was not the biggest ring, and it was not the most expensive.  It was her's though.  She had to show it to everyone, and she hardly took it off.  It was like me showing off a new technology item or something geeky.<br />
<br />
This is what I meant by easy to please - simply because it is for them to call their own.  It is the journey that is most important and not the destination.<br />
<br />
Anyways, we are going into the weeds...</div></div><hr />

They are boxed and shipped in groups.   In general Each location you buy from will only have 1 of the 4 available key rings.  So if you buy 4 boxes from one store it's almost certain you'll get 4 of a kind.<br />
<br />
Since every board that had a possible keychain (SK, SHM, Zerker and Rogue) is complaining about this I bet a visit to thier board, a little horse trading and some postage can fix everything up.</div></div><hr />
