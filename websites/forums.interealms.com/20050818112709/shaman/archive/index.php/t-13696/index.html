<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Picked one up recently.  I used to drool over the idea of having one, and it fell my way on a semi-pickup VP raid.  Yes, I love the gate out change.  It's a much better zone, you can actually crawl it like a dungeon and leave when the hell you want.  It's a very cool crawl now.  Even if most of the loot is pretty outdated.  We had a mage looting grey suede shoes.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, got this:<br />

<br />
I suppose it's only valuable for soloing, and even then only stuff that can't beat the snot out of you if you try to tank it.  Anyone use it much?  Curious what their experiences are with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I use it all the time when soloing mobs that run.  I use it in groups if we don't have a snarer when fighting mobs that run. <br />
<br />
With avatar on, it procs pretty reliably and quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Still need a key to get in there?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes you do, but key quests like that one I like.  It was fun for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well if I got one I'd use it. It's a lot better than my slime coated harpoon.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm almost guaranteeded to be using it solo, its moderately useful for runners, but by far the best use of it is with hard hitting pop mobs that take a while to kill, simply snare em before you start killing, root/rotting is so much easier when the mob is snared =)<br />
<br />
It was great pre pog fix too, made it quite easy and safe to pull 3 or 4 non summoning mobs at once, although its a bit risky doing that with the pogs back in now though =)</div></div><hr />
