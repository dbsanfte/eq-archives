<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was very curious about something I noticed tonight.  I'm an app for another elemental guild right now, and something curious happened today.  Basically, this guild has been in the elementals for a while now, and have the chance to farm it often.  Basically, from what it's been explained to me, they have had a really ****ty drop rate on anything chain.  This goes from the bracers on down to the legs.  Today though was a different story.  The first and only thing that we killed that didn't drop anything chain, was Pyronis.  Everything else, from Magmaton to each and everything in PoE dropped chain.  We received 2x chain boots, 1x chain coif, 2x chain arms and 1x chain gauntlets.  Before this day, they had not had a chain boot drop in 2 months from anything.  <br />
<br />
So, my question is.... has anyone else noticed that the chain drop rate has gone up a bit too?  My old guild was elemental flagged and although we didn't end up killing a whole lot of things, we really didn't see chain alot either.  It's just sad to see silk and leather stuff drops almost going to the alts of the applicants, when you have most chain users inside the guild still saving points for that one elemental drop that just won't occur.  I'm hoping that tonight was the first of many many chain drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you shouldnt worry about bracers .. theres alot of good preist bracers (elemental, poe bracer, fennin bracer, and the super comman time trial bracer) <br />
<br />
havent seen many chain helms .. i think we have.. um..  5 total</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Owwiefixer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think what SOE was thinking was that for chain stuff- you only have three classes to fight over them (ranger, rogue and shaman)- whereas the other pieces have more (plate- cler, warr, sk, paladin, bard.. etc.etc.).   Even though most higher end guilds don't have equal proportions, the drop rate seems to suggest such weighting.<br />
<br />
And no, I havent seen any large infusion of chain drops- sounds more like a lucky streak more than anything else.   We still see plate most dominant, cloth next and chain still as the most rare.  This isn't such a bad thing though as I'd rather see the tanks/clerics beefed up first on the priority list, and under the rare occasions something chain DOES drop- I'll usually pass to let a rogue get anyways.  Rogues seem to be the highest maintenance for shaman spot healing from AE or when they cant figure out what max melee range is- so firming up the rogues (and improving their Veng/dps to shorten fights a bit) usually has a bigger pay off for us shaman anyways. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We had in feb-mars 62 chaindrops, 103 plate, 84 leather and 68 silk. After this they said they fixed the droprates in a patch or something but afaik that just ended up in dropping leather on each and every boss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Our elemental legs drop rate:<br />
6 Elemental Greaves Mold (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=16373)<br />
1 Elemental Silk Pant Pattern (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=16388)<br />
0 Elemental Leather Pant Pattern (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=16381)<br />
0 Elemental Chain Pant Pattern (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=16367)<br />
<br />
I have to say their random generator sure acts strange at times. Seen similar drop rates from another guild too, only then there was alot of leather, some molds and silk and almost no chain.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Foggy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No chain drops? Sounds like HoT all over again to me :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">in 467 armor drop :<br />
103 chain<br />
93 leather<br />
118 silk<br />
153 plate<br />
<br />
But, some particular slot are already rotting while some other are getting 6+ tells each time they drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Need more chain.  I mean, hell I can see having a bit more plate drop..cause a whole other class might need it.  But, i mean, caster sleeves drop VERY frequently off of the birds in PoF...and of course, that means that half of the time someone's alt gets the silk sleeves, or these stupid caster sleeves.  And look back to what good sleeves there are for chain...... umm..I'm currently seeing two right now..and one is off of the Rathe.  Basically, that means that everyone is going to be fighting over every elemental piece that drops.  Hell, I'm still using my Wolf Callers and it looks like it might be staying that way for a while now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">We keep a running total on elemental armor drops.<br />
<br />
Out of 215 drops, we have<br />
<br />
Chain        49--23%<br />
Leather     44--20%<br />
Plate         67--31%<br />
Silk           55--26%<br />
<br />
Ironically, since we have a lot fewer leather classes, they're cleaning up.  Plate is hurting.  Most guilds have a large group of plate in comparison to the rest of the guild.  They should be having 33% of the drops just by the number of plate classes, but the actual distribution across classes tends to exacerbate the situation.  Plate tends to be a lot heavier in numbers than the other 3 armor types.  Our silk casters tend to clean up as well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">We've been in farming since March and basically the order of most drops are Plate, Leather (20 gloves...the gnome in tactics appreciates this  :p ), Silk, Chain.  We declare it a national holiday when 2 chains drop the same clearing of fire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">chain normally rots for us now, grats twinks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hmmm...got two more chain boots tonight.  In two days we went from having every shaman in the guild complaining (as well at having the rogues and rangers do the same) to having all 4 shamans with the boots and me and the other app sitting there praying that it lasts a few more days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Loopi Loo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You know, after this most recent patch, chain has actually dropped more than usual for my guild too. Its been about one piece a day rather than one piece a week or two.<br />
<br />
I was thinking it was just luck and all that praying to the chain gods finally was working, but perhaps this latest patch is the reason. Anyone else noticing more chain too after this patch?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The best thing after this patch is that legs drops at stage 3 in Time! Im so happy :p Thanks FoH for checking that :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">which chain slot will likely go rot first ?</div></div><hr />
