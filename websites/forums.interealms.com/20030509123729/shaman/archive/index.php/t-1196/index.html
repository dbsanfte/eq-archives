<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kafeen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a lvl 24 troll shammy.   Last night, I was soloing the Treants in SK.  1-on-1, they were pretty easy.  However, the place were they spawn, there is usually 2 up.  I tried rooting one and running far enough away so I could drop the other before the 2nd one got to me.  They are casters, so just splitting them up and keeping them root parked is kinda hard, especially when they can root me back and nuke me.  Futhermore, root breaks so fast, it only delays my ass beating.<br />
<br />
Can anyone suggest a better way of pulling just one, or how to better handle 2?  I will probably have to find a better place to solo, preferably against non-caster mobs hehe.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sengal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I can't think of a way to split them without a mez/harmony type spell or a dedicated pulling class.<br />
<br />
Your best bet would be to find someone else that is soloing and each take one treant :) <br />
<br />
If the treants are &quot;pretty easy&quot; as you say and you finish a battle with gobs of hitpoints - try taking both at once. Slow them and DOT each of them then tank the first one. When he is dead, move to the other one and finish him off. I did this with mammoths in everfrost in my mid to late twenties (and built-up my defense skill nicely too!!). Not sure what the treants are casting though - so this may not work.<br />
<br />
Which brings me to my next advice: go to everfrost and hunt mammys. You can stay there all the way until 31 (I did) and make great platinum to boot. I left everfrost at 32 with over 2000pp in the bank thanks to mammoth tusks.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps :)</div></div><hr />

Will he be able to find a vendor that will sell to him?  I've never been there, but I would hate to journey to the corner of the world and be KOS to everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kafeen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hehe, money is not a prob for me so i doubt I will loot much of anything I kill.  I've played evil since day 1 so I'm used to not having anyone like me ;)</div></div><hr />

Everfrost is probably a bad idea - you will be KOS to just about everything there as far as I know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Soloing multiple mobs at once was difficult for me at that level. I never planned on fighting multiples, but adds do come along every now and then. If your health and mana are good when the add comes along, you can probably take two blues, but you'll probably have to sit a while when it's over. If your health and mana are low when you get the add though, you'll probably be better served by running to the zone or calling for help. In general, I wouldn't recommend you try taking on two blues at once if you're after experience, unless the spawn times allow for you to heal/med back up before the mobs respawn. I have an easier time fighting 2 mobs at a time these days, but in general, I try to avoid doing so unless there is no other way. If root was more reliable, I'd say try dotting one mob, park it and then pull the other mob out of casting range of the other and then tank/dot/nuke until it was dead and then go finish the other. Root was never that reliable for me back then, so I always had to melee/dot/nuke throughout the entire fight, rooting only so that I could heal myself if necessary. Experiment a bit though and see how things go. Some of the most enjoyable fights happen when you get some unexpected guests. When you come out on top, it's a nice feeling. It's also a good way to test your capabilities. However, it will result in quite a bit of downtime which slows down the 'good old experience grind.' Good luck to you! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well you might try using your Flash of Light spell though I would only do that just to get them inishally broken up.   <br />
<br />
Your other option is to root one at the camp run far enough away and root the second and then run out of casting range and camp out to clear agro.  Once out game log right back in and reagro the closest mob and kill it.  Wait to remed and then quickly pull the next mob out.  That should allow you to split the spawn to be able to take that camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ssarahh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">on your Flash of Light comment..<br />
<br />
Great idea it wont make em run right away but if it is beating on you and you run just a little it will run off screaming and if you get far enough away there is a chance it will forget you till you get back to the aggro range (used this method a ton of times in LOIO when i got an add) FoL the add and then run off the one you want will follow you but the add will run off the other direction :) anyway good luck to you and stuff<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Duffe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">losing agro by distance only works on kunark and later expansions. that tactic will not work in the old world.</div></div><hr />

Can't help you with the treants.  I've never hugged 'em, but I've never really hit them either. ;)<br />
<br />
As to the recommendation for mammoth tusks and the worry over finding a vendor in the vicinity, there is an EASY solution.<br />
<br />
Go to Timorous Deep.  Bind in the Firepots room.<br />
Take the SE firepot on the South Wall to Halas.  This takes you right to the docks.  You can invis beforehand if you are worried.<br />
<br />
Once you are full (or too encumbered) of mammoth tusks, gate to the Firepots room.  Now take the firepot to Oggok or Grobb or W. Cabilis (or wherever!) and sell you loot with better faction and better prices (as the NPC's won't already be full of tusks in their hidden inventory).  Gate back to firepots, back to Halas and hunting.  Rinse and Repeat. :)<br />
<br />
btw, this is widely considered to be a probable bug (binding in the firepots room) and might get fixed at the next patch.  Do it NOW.  I bound all my gate capable characters there. :D<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Knarlas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I would have to recommend what Chazic said about root first  treant pull second and root it then running out of cast range and camp. <br />
<br />
To add to this I would log out where you could see the one you pulled. If root breaks during count down then I would reroot and try it again. Would be a bad thing to see it coming at you as you are logging only to get a beat down and dead by the time you get to char screen.<br />

Try the guy who sells DOT spells, the Bearjumper guy. I think anyone can sell to him, just not at top rate.</div></div><hr />
