<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seefar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I read the post about soloing HG's at 39 and wanted to offer this bit of information but the thread was so long and old that I didn't think it would get noticed there.  <br />
<br />
I went to Stonebrunt recently for the first time and killed some Panda's there.  The often drop gems that sell for 60-90pp each.  I know that these guys could probably be solo'd at 39th level. I was there as my 40 level rogue and they conned blue to me.  <br />
<br />
All of the various Panda's drop these gems not just the Elder Panda's, so if it is loot you are after this would be a good option as this zone is not as busy as Rathe Mountains.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hrmm, whats the drop rates on these gems?<br />
<br />
thats a good thought if they drop them every 3 or 4 kills, but otherwise, HGs would net more cash per hour.<br />
<br />
Hrmm...of course......How much HP's did these things appear to have? If they are easy kills, and have an acceptable rate, then they are far better then HG's...<br />
<br />
You said &quot;probably be solo'd&quot;...try soloing some, and see how it turns out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seefar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was hoping that someone with more experience in this zone might chime in with some details.  I only started hunting this zone for the first time last week and did not spend a lot of time there.<br />
<br />
So far it seems that the drop rate for these gems is about 1 in 3.  Right now my shaman is only 30th level and there is no way I can solo an Elder or even a Mature Panda.  The Elder's were dark blue to my 40 level rogue.  I have been able to solo the the cubs and at least one gem dropped from the cub that I solo'd there.  <br />
<br />
I could try soloing them with my rogue to see what happens, but I think we all know what the outcome would be.  <br />
<br />
Since the general consensus was that a 39 shaman would have really hard time soloing an HG and since that zone is often highly camped and competition for HG's is fierce that Stonebrunt is a good option for those seeking loot.  An Elder Panda blue to a 40 rogue would no doubt be green to a 39 shaman and probably easy pickings.  Plus there are lower level Pandas that also drop gems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Pingpang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Slightly off-topic, but I thought /con was based solely on the lvl of the mob vs. your characters lvl and that character type made no difference (i.e a mob blue to a lvl 40 rogue would also be blue to a lvl 40 shaman/warrior/whatever)?</div></div><hr />

It is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Seefar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok I reread my post and I can see why you were confused.  It's a hobby of mine to confuse and confound others and as you can see I am quite good at it.  Of course a dark blue to a 40 rogue would also most likely be dark blue to a 39 shaman-DUH   I got confused in my response and was thinking 49 level shaman.  <br />
<br />
Guess I didn't have enough coffee before I responded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sounds like a decent plan to me, been meaning to try this out myself. Since the Bazaar opened officially, Rathe Mountains has been overrun by druids and quadding wizzies, very annoying as this was my stomping ground at 40. Nothing like a quadding druid pulling every giant under the sun and not bothering to kill any placeholders. But that is another rant all together. <br />
Do the Pandas have any faction attached to them ? Not that I care much, but I don't want to wander to the kitty city there and get trained by them and what not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">where do you find all these pandas? i spent about ten minutes running helter skelter across the zone and could only find one (and it didnt drop a gem).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kenlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">This should work, it's how I got killed by a panda-<br />
<br />
From the Warrens (and only that I know of) entrance, go straight and hit a wall. <br />
Take a left and follow the wall until you are at the edge of a cliff.<br />
Take a left and follow the cliff until you reach a stream. <br />
<br />
I followed this stream a while and saw a few panda(probably cubs) that conned indifferently. So I wandered up to a larger panda for a ss and got smacked, so to speak.<br />
<br />
So I would imagine that if you look on the right side of this stream you should find some wanderers. I have no idea if there are statics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Seefar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/zones.html?zstrat=125<br />
<br />
This is a link to the strategy discussion for this zone on Allakhazam.  I haven't spent a lot of time here yet, I am trying to get a few more levels first so I will have better luck soloing. <br />
<br />
One place you might try is the area right at the waters edge.  You get there by going right out of the entrance and following the wall until you get to the water.  This is the end of the line for the &quot;game trail&quot; and many animals wander this way.  You are safe as long as you are not right on the game trail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hmm.. with my kill speed in Rathe (god how the druids must hate me as they come up to take one of the 4-6 giants rooted around me :P ) I can clear 1k an hour.  And I kill everything (except hte little guards) I come across.</div></div><hr />
