<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kraum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Came home with newly built comp.. wouldnt run after it was running the night before at a friends house... Took out and put back in mainboard battery.. started up fine woohooo.. Screaming fast comp.. I decided that I was going to increase refresh rate of my NEC 19' monitor.. Put it up to 100 hz... screen goes black and I start smelling that distinct smell of burning plastic.... 19 inc monitor is no more :(   Called local electonics place that repairs stuff and am going to bring in monitor tomorrow.. My question is what are the chances that they or anyone for that matter can repair it?    The monitor light goes from the yellow to green no problem.. The screen is just black *sigh* am I doomed or is there hope?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That's what you get for trying to push a monitor that hard...<br />
60hz on an interlaced screen is what you get from a DVD movie.  30 frames per second.  Pretty nice, huh?<br />
Well, most default to 60 or 65.  That's a safe number to go with.  If you've got a pretty nice monitor, you can hit 75.  Looks a little better, a bit smoother.  Your monitor most likely wasn't designed to do 100.  I doubt you could repair it.  Dangerous to even pop open the case to see.  Most likely, since you smelled it, it's fried and cheaper to buy a new one and run it at 65hz than to try and fix that one. :)</div></div><hr />
