<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Domines</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I play a Barbarian Shaman on the PvP server of Tallon Zek, I have recently come back from a 4 month break (thought I was quitting lol) and am more then a bit behind in equipment knowledge, as I'm sure there has been many changes in the interim.<br />
<br />
I am looking for equipment upgrade suggestions, I try to keep the same set up of equipment on for PvE and PvP and obviously since I play on a PvP server resists have been of high priority since day 1.<br />
<br />
Please bear in mind that I am on PvP when making suggestions and thanks for any help you can provide.<br />
<br />
Here is my current equipment on my level 44 Barbarian toon..<br />
<br />
Head = Blackened Alloy Coif<br />
Face = Platinum Ruby Vale<br />
Ear 1 = Blue Diamond Earring<br />
Ear 2 = Blue Diamond Earring<br />
Neck = Sabretooth Amulet<br />
Shoulder = Bloodstained Mantle<br />
Arms = Totemic Vambraces<br />
Bracer 1 = Sentry Bracer<br />
Bracer 2 = Jandiced Bone Bracer<br />
Ring 1 = Velium Diamond Wedding Ring<br />
Ring 2 = Velium Diamond Wedding Ring<br />
Gloves = Coldian Skin Gloves<br />
Breastplate = Fungus Covered Scaled Tunic<br />
Back = Mammoth Hide Cape<br />
Waist = Girdle of the Holy Wanderer<br />
Legs = Totemic Greaves<br />
Boots = Black Fur Boots<br />
<br />
Main Hand = Rune Etched Icewurm Fang<br />
Offhand = Sarnak Battle Shield<br />
Range = Ceremonial Smudging Stick<br />
<br />
<br />
I gave all my twinks stuff and spare cash away when I quit (only to come back), but I have got about 10k available ATM and can quest for stuff and get help camping drops.<br />
<br />
Any help appreciated - Domines</div></div><hr />
