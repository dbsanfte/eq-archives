<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kinadafz60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What is the best spot / plane to xp in for a 52monk (almost 53) and 57 shaman(almost 58)?  I was in PoD yesterday killing the big spiders, but they CH entirely too much so the xp isn't that good.  I have no flags and have xp'd in teh planes only one time (last night :).  Monk is nicely equip'd, shaman is ok equip'd with lizard / epic.<br />
<br />
Also, what mobs drop parchments or whatever is needed to turn in for spells?  How hard are they to kill?<br />

PoP mobs hit to hard, have to many hps etc for what your trying to do. With the monks inability to hold agro your gonna have a hard time with healing unless you tank. Kc mobs are pretty easy at your level and he monk can easily single pull. On my server its easy to get a spot on either side of the moat to pull to.</div></div><hr />

Monk can hold aggro fine...played a warrior to 61 with a broken taunt, thats easy.<br />
<br />
Mobs don't hit too hard, they're in fact quite easy....just the damn ch thing sucks.<br />
<br />
Velks sucks, its no fun to pull 6 adn root park 6 spiders and kill them with monk...was fun the first couple times though :)<br />
<br />
KC sucks hard, worst zone in the game...too many mobs LB also.<br />
<br />
Funny, but kael armory is pretty good xp...I can kill all the mobs leading to the throne, and spawn the cycle, and then kill the first 3 giants...rinse, repeat.  The cash is fricking awesome, getting the blood (1500-2k), shammy spear (2-4k), all sorts of MQ's (1k-20kish), plus tons and tons of toes / helms which can be used for faction or sell for 9p each.  Not to mention the fact that every giant has a sword for 3p.  I highly suggest this spot if you are able to 2box.<br />
<br />
Its no PoP xp, but the loot for the xp is tremendous.<br />

This is not a hijack... really.  It's not.   :) <br />
<br />
Kinadafz, you've got me drooling now.  I duo with a 56SK.  I am 57.  Is the armory something we two could handle with success?  I need loot, CoV faction, and a more interesting place to hunt. <br />
<br />
Now, regarding the topic at hand:  Try the Hedge in PoN.  Level 53 - 55 mobs.  Decent XP.  Zone nearby.  The mobs don't cast or heal.  The banshees summon but it's not that big of a deal.  The monk should be able to single pull with relative ease.  The fights can be stupidly long though, as with most PoP content.  <br />
<br />
My partner and I eventually fell into a catatonic state after a few weeks of numbingly slow grinding.  The XP wasn't slow, but it was just so demmed boring we had to get out.  So, now, we are back in LoY trying to find a spot.  Hell, the Dandolak in Dulak is about the same xp considering you can plow through the mobs.  Not to mention they actually drop something valuable now and then.   :eek:  Tonight we are going to try and duo the Oceancrasher.  Should be... interesting.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Rather than completely hijack this thread, I'm starting a new one regarding the duoing of Kael.</div></div><hr />
