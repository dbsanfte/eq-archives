<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Plaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi, I have currently a level 32 Froglock Shaman, and I want to do the epic.  I studied the quest and can do most of it solo with my 32 frog and 65 paladin.  I also have the tear for MQ from a 65 epic'ed shaman with enough true spirit faction.  Im wondering if I can do the epic at 32 with my present situation.  I am told I may not be high enough for the npcs to talk to me, is this true?</div></div><hr />

I helped a friend for about 5 months ago (he was a lvl 28 shaman at the time), when he did the final turnin the spirit ate it and said something about he not being powerful enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dissonant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Gotta be atleast 51+ to get any epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>howie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I thought I read on allakhazaam that you needed to be 55 to get final epic?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Smellious Oderous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I completed mine at lvl 51...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>tangurena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did the final battle at 51. I had the sow boots before 45 though, and the tear was sitting in my bank since about 47/48. I would recommend not doing the turn of the scale until 50. From my time playing a char with a green name, the GMs have said clearly that epic items are not reimbursed for under level-50 players. If you go the MQ route, make sure that your frog's truespirit faction is max ally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shmokie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've got the epic now.<br />
Just finished it two days ago.<br />
Oh.  And I'm level 46.<br />
It can be done before level 50 -- but the right-clicky effect on it can't be used until level 50.  Heh.  You are not suffient level blah blah blah.<br />
<br />

Can anyone confirm that the epic can be completed before lvl 46? I have a friend that just started a shaman and also a tear rotting in the bank. Was thinking about getting it for him before he hits 30 using the MQ method.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Here's what I think:<br />
<br />
1 - possible to begin epic<br />
19 - solo up through wandering spirit (and even receive the shield)<br />
29 - take a group to Rathe Mountains for battle<br />
34 - solo the two in Rathe Mountains<br />
44 - kill Black Dire with guild<br />
49 - kill Black Dire with group<br />
upper 50s - kill Black Dire solo<br />
39-47 - stables in CoM with group<br />
49 - stables solo<br />
50-55 - Black Reavers in CoM with two groups<br />
55-65 - Black Reavers in CoM with one group<br />
50-55 - Kirn in The Hole with three groups<br />
55-60 - Kirn in The Hole with two groups<br />
60-65 - Kirn in The Hole with one group<br />
46 minimum required - raid in Plane of Fear for Child's Tear<br />
50 minimum required - for click effect on spear to work<br />
<br />
Lowkey says here (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=11224) that 46 is now required to do the final hand-in to receive the Spear of Fate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Havs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have personally met a 30 Shaman with his epic on Fennin Ro - That's the lowest I can verify...<br />
<br />
What all his guild did to manage it, I don't know sorry...But it's certainly doable under the right circumstances.<br />

<br />
I don't know about the rest of them, but I can get non-group spells to land on other toons at level 41 (Regrow, Maniacal Strength, Talisman of Kragg, etc). I only know this from having to PL a couple other people's alts. lol<br />

<br />
This individual seemed to be incredibly ignorant of his class to have ever been 46+, but I suppose anything is possible.<br />
<br />
Can't see any good reason for it myself, though...Repeat 16+ levels and not be able to use the item for 20??  Bleh :)<br />

I know this because he is in our guild and I stood with him in the nexus minutes after his final turnin. But yes, the effect doesn't work till 50.</div></div><hr />
