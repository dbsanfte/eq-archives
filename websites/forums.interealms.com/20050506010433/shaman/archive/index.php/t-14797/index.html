<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have finally beat the game ladies and gentlemen. I log and i see the uselessness of it all. I simply cannot find a reason to log on. In the past 2 years (even thos i was not a shaman for the full 2 years) i did enjoy the game but now times have changed. It is time to finally see what goign outside my house feels like and to catch up with my RL friends. To those of you who knew me i will never forget you and I hope that one day we can meet in another game. Like somebody said hard numbers have ruined this game for me a lot. People measuring everythign in dps sayign oh this weapon has more this is better than that and makign the game more work and making it hard numbers have ruined the fantasy aspect of the game, at least for me.<br />

<br />
I haven't logged into EQ for four months now.  Best decision I ever made ... my life is better in probably every measurable way now.  And yet, EQ was so good/fun that I still miss it, even knowing that I'm better off without it.<br />
<br />
After a while its easier to remember the fun times than it is to remember the frustration, boredom, and camping, KSing, guild-racing, eating dinner at the computer, pissing off my wife, etc<br />
<br />
I have to post on a goodbye thread now and then to remind myself of why I quit.  Good luck!<br />

Take care and enjoy the otherside of the coin. That cold barren harsh reality called Real Life. Sucks when the lines blur like that though...<br />
<br />
Now if I can only get that dent out of the hood of my car, from the orc I ran over this past weekend...<br />
