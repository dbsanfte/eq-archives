<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I'm level 38 troll shaman. I have begun to think about my epic, but i was talking to my friend who is a shaman, and is very well twinked. Well one night i was talking to him and he says, &quot; Oh yeah, we took down the black dire last night.&quot; i was like ***? you like level 34. Well i knew this was his cousins char, and his druid is level 54 or something. But i was like wow, you got your clicky boots? later i was telling him how jealous i am of him, and he says, nah, ill get a group together to take down the black dire when ya ready. This is where i want to ask, How long will it take to do the other parts leading up to the black dire? I've read the guid thingy, just don't know the appromint time. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not counting travel time:<br />
<br />
Starting quest with (name of your preferred mob here):  5 mins.<br />
Walking through Freeport and talking to the spirits:  10 mins.<br />
Test of Patience:  bout 40 mins.<br />
Test of Wisdom:  5 mins per fool.  2 hr spawn time if already culled by somebody wanting their stuff.<br />
<br />
Your mileage may vary.</div></div><hr />
