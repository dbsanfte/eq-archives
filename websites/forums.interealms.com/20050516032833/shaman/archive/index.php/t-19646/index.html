<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Odinson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">...what looks like it is worth buying?  I have just under 200 aa atm, including the 30 banked, so I could go back and finish some healing aas, or try some of the new stuff.  Am actually thinking of the pet swarm aa and the dot crit aa.  Any thoughts?<br />

Critical dots don't mean anything if you can't cast them due to aggro.<br />
With SCS, I might actually be able to load a whole 2! dots and not get aggro all the freaking time.<br />
/em crosses fingers.</div></div><hr />

http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3549&amp;source=Live is its little brother, found only on lower-tier ench-only items.  One from POI, the other from HOH trials.  They are useful only for reducing aggro on tash.  I would suspect that the upgrade you linked to will also be ench-only.</div></div><hr />

just curious ceno...<br />
how you get 250 in tinkering?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>lfclan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Dunno what Im gonna do... Crit dots is kinda lame since it will only increase the insane amount of arrgo we get... of course if you solo its a great AA...<br />
<br />
SCS is good for bosses but when you group and your playing the CC role it could basically screw you.... so kinda iffy on that as well.<br />
<br />
Secondary Forte LOOKED good... before they nerfed it....does anyone know if they changed the level from 100 back to 255? I havent seen any info on is lately...<br />
<br />
Think Im gonna wait and hold my 30 and see what shakes out... to many questions on what will actually be useful atm...</div></div><hr />

Amen to that.  I would rather keep my aggro for saving clerics and CC.  If I want to put out some DPS, I am prepared to pay for it as well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Crit DoT i think is the only thing i care about so far in the way of AA.<br />
<br />
I hoping for 2 things from GoD. More content that is fun and more tot he point, single group doable. The second is, im really hopeing for single group doable 65 upgrades. I refuse to give my life over to a guild just so i can get some upgrades, real life is so much more fun then EQ and im not willing to let it go. So if GoD can provide me with decent upgrades for my shaman, im going to be completely happy with GoD and can forgive the lack of spell upgrades ;)</div></div><hr />

ceno valsuvious was told by a dev that the thing was a typo its supposed to be HP regen not ENDUR regen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Advanced innate run speed, oh yeah!  If I ever get around to buying GoD that'll be the first thing I get, probably followed by some old school AA's and then persistant casting.</div></div><hr />

Can't really say much about this because of the NDA, but I would reconsider your options.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">What time does the NDA expire?  Some NDA's run out before the actuall release of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Other than the run speed one, probably none for a while.  Too many arch(2 sets), class (well, only like 1 there, I think), and PoP AAs to finish first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Can anyone confirm that the pet spell for buffs really is an aa that will enable the caster (or owner of the aa ability) to hit all pets in the group with group spells?<br />
<br />
It really makes no sense that I should pay 20aa to buff others pets, considering most of the time I don't pull my pet out on raids anyway. Wouldn't it be much more useful for the pet class to pay for the aa. <br />
<br />
In that case a pet owner would pay 20aa and it wouldn't matter who they were grouped with (Cleric/ench/shaman/whatever) they would get their pet fully buffed.<br />
<br />
Does MGB hit the pets as well?<br />
<br />
Right now I don't see myself buying this aa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">how am i going to hold agro when i tank with SCS...i was tanking the sword guys in solro last night, the 1300 flurriers=p<br />
<br />
anyway, i am about 290aa with near 30 banked (i got really sick of have xp go no where so i spent some aa)...i am going to get crit dots all the way...hopefully i can cut my fire solo time down by 1/3 with this.  everyone is goign to need to xp again to fill out the massive new aa costs...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">yeah, call of the ancients is a hp ward, just like the cleric and druid one.  Not sure why it still says that, but the developer assured me that it's a hp regen.  I used a beastlord and my cann5 to test, and it does seem that it's a hp regen, approx at level 5 it was 70hp each tick for 6 min.<br />
<br />
Me, i'll take SCS first over anything else.  As the main healer in a group last night, I had to use blast heals on the warrior, 2x beastlords, rogue, and fury and against 1200 hitters, it could have been ugly (specially with no crowd control).  With fully slowable mobs, it was still beneficial for me to slow when I could, and it worked out great and no one died and I never had agro for more than a second even while chain healing.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I think I'll go SCS, crit dots, SF (was going to be top, but when I found out it only maxed to 100 that changed my mind), FoMM then pets.  <br />
<br />
Oh, Secondary Forte was never nerfed.  It just didn't say in the coding that it only went up to 100.  That's why they changed the text to say it now.<br />
<br />
I still think that I'll be able to take and control agro when I want to even with SCS.  Well, at least I'm hoping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I have 30 as well and right now thinking - one level of crit dots (5) and one level of Call of the Ancients (3) to start with.  Those are the only real new abilities that I don't already have.<br />
<br />
<br />
Other than that I am going to wait on buying anymore.  I'd like to hear some more about the other stuff before investing mass points.  So, like how much mana save on Secondary Forte, really.   I am still considering the pro and con on SCS.  As Ceno said, sometimes I need my agro and the only reason I want SCS is to be able to use dots more.  We'll see if it really helps or not.  I'd like to see how fast the new runspeed is.<br />
<br />
FoMM is on my shortlist, depending on the utility of the other things I mentioned above, it may be the 3rd thing I get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">29.5aa banked here, been having to train innate MR because I kept breaking 30 all last week ;)<br />
<br />
I'll probably go for crit affliction, then see if anything else looks fun, guess I will have to wait till tomorrow...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">OK, NDA is lifted:<br />
<br />
Most of the mobs in the initial zones do not mitigate slow. But mitigation still exists. Quite a few of the mobs proc some sort of DoT/Effect.<br />
<br />
Swift Journey: Not going to bother<br />
<br />
Convalescence: Not going to bother<br />
<br />
Lasting Breath: Not going to bother<br />
<br />
Packrat: Whuffo?<br />
<br />
Secondary Forte: I think this will be somewhat useful, but not a priority.<br />
<br />
Fury of Magic Mastery: Will probably do this before Critical DoT.<br />
<br />
Persistent Casting: I'll get this, but don't expect it to 'fire' all that often.<br />
Pet Affinity: 0/1, 20, requires level 65.<br />
<br />
SCS: No way I will be getting this. For reasons others have stated.<br />
<br />
Quickened Curing: I will get this because of the number of mobs that have some sort of DoT/Effect.<br />
<br />
Critical Affliction: Didn't impress me. I think I saw one crit about every ten ticks. Didn't really parse it though since the mobs still die fast.<br />
<br />
Advanced Spirit Call: Affects Spirit Call. Instead of 5 pets, you have 3, and the pets hit for a max of 95 from what I saw. Didn't parse their hit/miss. This one is a toss up for me. I use the pets for push, not damage.<br />
<br />
Call of the Ancients: Will probably be needed on some raids, so I will get it.<br />
<br />
For me:<br />
Call of the Ancients<br />
Quickened Curing<br />
Fury of Magic Mastery<br />
Persistent Casting<br />
<br />
The rest come after, except SCS, which I won't ever get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">From what I understand about specialization, 15 AA to raise your 2nd spec cap to 100 will result in a 5% mana save on that type vs a 2.5% save at 50 skill<br />
<br />
With that ward officially changed to hp instead of endurance, this expansion has absolutely nothing to offer me outside of canni6, and that's hardly worth $30 to me.</div></div><hr />
