<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So as I'm trying to work on my cooking above 143, shooting every now and then making food as I need it, trying to get to 250, but a lot of the good recipies like Patty Melts and Griffon Melts require Non-Stick Frying Pans and as far as I understand it, the only place to get the mold for making on is in Jagged Pine. I assume I'm KoS here, so I was wondering if someone could pick up a mold or two (in case of failure) for me so I can make myself a frying pan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Enmity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have about 10 in my inventory I was trying to get rid of... gimme a tell on AngelofEnmity and one's yours free =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Cool, we're both going to be at the slaying tongiht. Could you bring one along?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nindalf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm pretty sure you can get that mold else where, as I made one the other night. I think it may have been knowledge or tranquility.<br />
<br />
Edit: nm I bought that utensil in the nexus was thinking of something else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>itchyban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This looks to be a somewhat old thread, but as I'm grinding AA in JPF, I'd be happy to pick up a mold for you. Just send a tell -- though if in Bazaar am probably AFK...<br />
