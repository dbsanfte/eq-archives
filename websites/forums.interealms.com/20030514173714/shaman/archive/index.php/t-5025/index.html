<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ougabouga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all!  I was just wondering if anyone else uses this weapon.  I've been trying my best to keep all my skills even, but 2HB has fallen behind.  Anyone have any suggestion for a quick way to get this skill up.  I'm lvl 51 and ATM my 2HB skill is 130.  I love this weapon and want to keep using it, so far my max hit has been 138.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you want to skill up faster, get a low delay weapon, a haste item (Silvery Belt of Contention is a good +WIS haste item) and keep yourself quicked.<br />
<br />
More swings per battle = more chances to skill up. <br />
<br />
Also, if I remember correctly, DEX increases your chance of gaining offensive skills (AGI is defensive). So keep yourself DEX buffed as well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">keep your dex as high as you can ( i evve bought a musroom veil it makes a nice difference +22 dex), buy a haste item (i use a no drop ahste belt you can get in HSM), and when you can afford the mana (or talk the chanter into it) haste yourself! it makes a huge difference i went from 1 2hb skill to aorund 150 at level 51 in around a month. i don't play -alot- so i think thats pretty fast.</div></div><hr />
