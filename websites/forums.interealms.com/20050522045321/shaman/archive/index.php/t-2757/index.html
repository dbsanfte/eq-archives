<br />
Allakhazam ( http://everquest.allakhazam.com ) has posted a pic of the new GUI Interface.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Smasherr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">looks...ugh...busy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I like it!! Busy?  There's lots of stuff I wish I had access to all the time (like invite/disband) and this is a nice/unobtrusive way to have access to it!<br />
<br />
I love the new buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">wow thats really different.<br />
I like the new buff icons.  nifty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Looks nice, though I hope those aren't the final buff icons. If the current ones are too simplistic, those are a little too complicated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Eoin is just afraid of that all his buffs will look like that Heart one.<br />
<br />
It's okay Eoin, show the love!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I *heart* Eoin!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Buffa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It looks okay I think. Having the invite/follow button accessible all the time is pretty nice (I usually play with that window turned off). The new buff icons will take some time to get used to though. I think they look a bit overdone. Oh yeah I also like the separate chat channel window. Now I am just wondering how the new GUI will affect the /hitsmode windows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">hmmm... 9 icons on the spell gem bar, I wonder what the 9th is for.<br />
<br />
Lets hope with the new interface comes bigger inventories, bigger bags, or more things made stackeable.<br />
<br />
That or a way to buy a caravan to follow you. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Buffa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It looks like the ninth icon/gem is to access the spell book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Looks like some bastardized Java Interface... I always disliked the look of Java buttons.  But otherwise it looks ok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I like the updated look of it all.  It looks like they're mainly making things easier with having clickable options for things that already had CTRL access already (eg. the 9th icon in spell window likely takes you to spell book where CTRL-B did the same, invite/disband where CTRL-I and CTRL-D sufficed before).<br />
<br />
I'm guessing that the Window Selector just turns on and off which windows you want up at the time, similar to the ALT commands presently.  Maybe not, and it's something much better than that (I need a button to turn off the window that that turns off my windows!! :p)<br />
<br />
Appears to only be new paint job on the old interface with some functions moved around a bit so far.  Guess that's all you'd expect from an updated GUI, but I was hoping for things like more spell slots or spell slot pages...something revolutionary. ;)  Perhaps they're in there still though!  Here's hoping.<br />
<br />
I like either way.  The new icons are sweet.  Wizards get a special icon for their familiars...what was it before for them?  I don't even know.<br />
<br />
I'd really like if the icons were unique enough so that you never have to wonder/check which buff fell when you weren't looking at the spam, or they've added an ALT type function similar to the spell icons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">btw<br />
<br />
Ctrl I and Ctrl D are invite and follow.  No reason to ever need invite/follow/disband buttons.<br />
<br />
Looks pretty good otherwise, will take some getting used to.  I have no real issues with the current one, other than spellbook going to the 640x480 resolution in a big black box around the edge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ryasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It looks the same to me with just a pretty paint job. Hope some functionality is in it that is not visible in that screen shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Apart from the differing chat windows and the availability of invite/disband, I don't see a whole lot of difference between this interface and the old one.  Just different bitmaps.<br />
<br />
As long as they're changing the chat windows, I sure hope they change the chat text to be a little more customizable.  Looks like they have multiple windows for multiple chats (which is cool) but there is still WAY too much space between lines.  Ideally I'd like to have to ability to select the font, size, line spacing (!!!), color, window etc. for each type of text.  Along with how much I want kept in the buffer for each text type (by size or by time)!!!<br />
<br />
Other things I want?  I want to be able to double click on a line in chat (in the trade channel, for instance) and automatically start a tell to that person.  I want to be able to copy and paste text from the chat window.  When I highlight a buff, I want it to tell me how much longer it has to run.  I want to see mana-bars for my group members (!!!)  Mana numbers instead of just the blue bar would be even better.<br />
<br />
I want a journal, where I can scratch notes (locs, names, etc.) then get them back later.  I'd like icons as an option for the hot buttons instead of five characters of colored text.  :)  Packs with more than 10 slots (maybe bank only, or just make the bank have more slots) - do they really want us to have mules just to hold crap?  The ability to type in numbers instead of selecting them with a slider.  Better auto-follow.  More lines on the hot-buttons text definitions (five is not enough.)  The ability to type a full line of auction text on the hot key text definition line (same text length as chat text.)<br />
<br />
Spell book that doesn't take up the entire screen.  Customizable stats window (so I can see only what I want and make the window as small as possible.)  Rollup windows (that stay small until you mouse over them, then they expand to their regular height).  The bazaar interface.  Much better /bug and /feedback interfaces (what have I /bug'ed before, what is the status, etc.)  I'd like to know where I am in the queue when I submit a petition.  <br />
<br />
Nice to haves?  I'd love customizeable client side messaging &quot;Your hit points are below 15 % !!&quot; or &quot;Harnessing of the Spirit on Rmog will wear off in 2 minutes&quot;.  I'd love customizable real-time log parsing (&quot;You have slain a Ravishing Dvorlag - the battle was 4.1 minutes long - you did 8 dps melee, 11 dps pet, 38 dps spell&quot;)   I'd like secure MQ trading.  I'd like NPCs to be more knowledgeable about their area (&quot;Where's the bank?&quot;  &quot;Let me show you!&quot;)<br />
<br />
That's it from the top of my head... dinner's almost ready, or I'd probably have more.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">/shrug<br />
<br />
I bound the button &quot;B&quot; to open to my book when I hit it, and &quot;S&quot; to sit/sit off<br />
<br />
I use /invite /disband , but then again I'm a fairly decent typer (avg 104) so typing stuff out really isn't a big deal to me, I can see if your a bad typer how using /wordherecommands might be a pain in the ass.<br />
<br />
alt m always worked for me when i wanted to do actions/combat/socials ect....<br />
<br />
I really find no need for that new interface.<br />
<br />
Like said before, it looks like they added 3 or so buttons and just gave it a new look.<br />
<br />
<br />
/yawn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ryasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It is a good thing you don't want much Bigguss!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kuai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">THAT ALL BIGUSS?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I thought Bigguss had some AWESOME ideas, double clicking on the names to send a tell? Brilliant!<br />
<br />
Okay, here's my idea:<br />
<br />
A talker I used to frequent had this really nifty /rev comand.  Using the /rev command you could repeat the last 5 lines of any specific form of text.  Miss a tell in battle spam? /revtell  Missed a really funny shout?  /revshout  Thought you saw an auction for something you really want to buy? /revauction<br />
<br />
I used to use that functionality all the time!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Look at the image, and the names in the /who list.<br />
<br />
See all the GM level 60's? See the names Raphalfelf and Veddartha, they are 59.<br />
<br />
That has got to suck, you're a GM and a tester and they only let you be 59 and not 60...<br />
<br />
/shout LVL 59 Paladin (GM) LFG plz!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Duffe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">it doesnt look all too bad. For those of you tha think it is too busy, there are X's in the corner of almost all the windows so you can close them and get them outta the way just as you can do now with macro hotkeys. the addition of the invite/disband is nice but i never used them anyway. CTRL+I invites and CTRL+D disbands. much easier than usin a button for it.<br />
<br />
overall a pretty nice look, hopefully there will more than 4 or 5 buff icons for all the different buffs available.</div></div><hr />

I think all GMs start at 60, but the ones that are 59 have died enough times to lose their &quot;level&quot;.  <br />

Yes, GMs can die.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I smell even lower frame rates.  I like Bigguss' ideas though.<br />
<br />
What would be neat, is to be able to Shift and Right-Click on an item and bring up a menu with some options, one of them being something like &lt;Add to /auction.&gt;  Choosing that would insert the correct item name into your auction, and the best part, when you auction it, it will be clickable by others who see it to view the stats.  That would make auctioning a lot simpler and a lot less confusing, and just damn nifty.<br />
<br />
Some of the other options would be to link a clickable effect to a /doclick # command, for macros.  Maybe an extended version of that to allow for automatic swapping without having to manually do it.</div></div><hr />

this technology is actually in the game. in a very unfortunate way. <br />

<br />
Agreed, a zMUD for EQ.<br />
<br />
Also for items, just like AO does you can drop an item into the chat window or right click and hold to set a reference to the item. Any time that item or the reference to that item is dropped into the chat window anybody that sees that chat can click on it and get the stats just like if you looked at in in your inventory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I am pretty sure that is projected for PoP stuff, and not EQ2 (due to models) but PLEASE OH PLEASE, someone tell me that is right.  I would love any for of improvement (though I doubt we'll see most of the ones Bigguss stated)<br />
<br />
   Oh, and it was already asked of VI to put a mana indicator in the party window akin to the little blue line on or exp bars.   They said that they had thought of it, and decided that there is no way to explain how on earth you would know your teammates spiritual connectivity, and so you will never get an indication of their mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Verant to hire Bigguss now, k thanks.<br />
<br />
<br />
My thoughts exactly :)<br />
<br />
All I can see is a slightly different graphical look and an extra chat window.  I am assuming that since it has taken them 7 or 8 months minimum already that there must be much more to it then that.  At least I hope there is.<br />
<br />
Edit: I would love to see my mana in numbers, but I sure as heck dont want my groupmates to see how much I have.  I lie about it way too much (say I have more when they are pulling to slow, say I have less when they are pulling to fast etc.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Hehe Kronen, I do the same thing.  Bad of me I know but it tends to generally work out for the best of the group as I test my limits solo as much as possible and can gauge when the group as a whole is doing good/bad etc.  It has bitten me in the butt once or twice though when puller came back with 2 or 3 mobs, I do a little crowd control, get everything finally slowed and report oom, and they call me on it &quot;you were at 80m before that pull, how can you be oom?&quot; &quot;Ummm, slow was resisted a few times =)&quot; Always seems to work and group lives to tell the tale, but whew, what times those can be.<br />
<br />
I like the new GUI personally, just an updated look to what we've been using forever, but a new look can lend more life to an old game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Yeah, I have absolutely NO desire for my groupmates to see my numbers. Then they'll know that I'm lying about how much mana I have and stop pulling. Who wants that?! :p <br />
<br />
Looks like they tried to make it &quot;pretty&quot; but we haven't actually gotten our hands on it so we can't actually test the &quot;functionality.&quot; If it's good I'll use it. If not I'll use the same interface everyone else has been using for years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Supposedly, they are working on other stuff.  Check out the recent interview over on Casters Realm...  background things, like the party logic - ability to transfer group leadership, and automatically doing that if the current leader goes LD.  I can't remember any other specifics, but it's not just all a pretty interface.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">DAoC anyone?  <br />
Man some of those windows look, well, let's just say &quot;DAoC- inspired.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anyway, looks interesting from here.  Wonder when this is supposed to go live?<br />
<br />
And I agree, Bigguss has many good ideas.  Most notably, showing group members' mana (OMG please!) and having a buff timer.<br />
What would be so unbalancing or threatening about these, Verant?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">The buff timer would be great, so I could stop messing with my watch, hehe. I still don't want others seeing my mana tho, maybe an option to allow us to block it from view would be good.  I fib too much to keep the xp rolling in and don't want a tank dictating how much mana I need to do MY job. I've been doing fine for 45 levels, no need to let others in on my dirty little secret, hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Straif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Oh, and it was already asked of VI to put a mana indicator in the party window akin to the little blue line on or exp bars.

<br />
Oh give me a break, are they still treating this game as if it were a role playing game?  lmao...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I think I saw somewhere (some other game, dunno what) icons that had little meters overlaid along the side of them to indicate how much time was remaining on the buff. Would *love* to see that in EQ. Just have a small vertical meter along the right side of the buff icon, nothing obtrusive, just something that lets you know at a glance how much time is remaining.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Looooooooong Over Due.... Glad to see it, busy or not, at least the Buffs Icons look a little less Cheap Cartoonish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Remember you are only seeing 1 view of probably many customizable options. Lets see how it pans out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Woah....who mentioned Zmud?  Are we showing our age?<br />
<br />
D'ya think Zugg plays EQ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">as long as the two chat windows are highly customizable, this interface could be great.  ever since i played daoc, i've wished that everquest's chatwindow was split so *chat* messages came through one window and all other messages came through another (spells, attacks, system, etc etc).<br />
<br />
biggus's ideas are good, but impractical.  there's too much in his list that verant just wouldn't do.  if they did, it would take 10 patches to fix the bugs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">How do I put it..  &quot;javaish&quot;?<br />
<br />
It looks a little Sci-fi to me also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I do NOT want the mana bar to be public.  Sometimes myself, I will exaggerate how low I am, so I ensure the group/raid I need a little more time to feel safe within buffing/debuffing situations.<br />
I don't need people telling me, &quot;oh , you have some mana left, give me buff0rz&quot; when I need what mana I have left to slow an incoming mob.<br />
<br />
What I would like to see, are resists shown to all (if it exists, I haven't noticed it; successions are shown, obviously).  It'll let people know you are at least trying, and others that can help slow/debuff can jump in (if they already are).  <br />
<br />
Buff icons look great.  It may be just cosmetic, but still looks good.<br />
I hope the casting gems are made for the effect.  Our current ones are too generic.  For example: SoW, Turgur's and Celerity, uses the same icon, summoning bread and summoning a pet, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Hail,<br />
<br />
FYI, If you talk to the Guide 1 or 2 NPC's in Ak'anon, they will lead you to anywhere you ask in gnomeville.  Hail him, and he'll give you instructions.<br />
<br />
Try it.  He isn't fast, but he is capable.  Kind of neat.  Too bad they didn't do it for every city.<br />
<br />
Many of the other suggestions would be great, but I'm just going to wait and see for now.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I was on a mini-raid last night, and I thought of a few more:<br />
<br />
Profiles for interface settings.  Every time I go on a raid, I need to turn off certain graphics settings... when the raid is over I turn them back on.  I'd love to be able to flip from &quot;raid mode&quot; to &quot;solo mode&quot; to &quot;group mode&quot; to &quot;merchant mode&quot;.<br />
<br />
A command to tell me my frames per second.<br />
<br />
A channel level &quot;Sticky&quot; note - like the Message of the Day at the guild leve... but instead at the channel level (for raids.)  Great place to put basic instructions, locs, times, requirements (level, resist), etc. instead of having to repeat it to the raid channel every time someone new signs on.<br />
<br />
This one might be affect game balance, but I'd like to be able to see what buffs a person already has.  Frustrating trying to get 30 people ready when new people keep trickling in.<br />
<br />
Another potentially balance-altering one... conditional selection on hotkey macros.  For instance, I'd love to have a hot key macro that casts Turgurs, then sends a group tell saying &quot;%t SLOWED&quot; if it hits, or &quot;%t SLOW RESISTED&quot; (or nothing at all if in a raid) if not.<br />
<br />
Maybe more later.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I disagree.<br />
You could look at your caster groupmates (putting yourself in your chracters' shoes, of course) and tell if they were weak, distracted, or otherwise just not clicking.<br />
This, to me, would indicate a problem with their amount of mana or their &quot;spiritual connection.&quot;<br />
<br />
But hey, what do I know?  I'm just a paying customer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>DemonMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I think the new interface looks alright, but I'm more interested in the new functionalty of it. Since the look will be completely skinnable, I suspect it won't be long before there are many options for skins. If you can't find one you like, you can always try and bug one of your more art inclined friends for your own custom skin =-p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Oh dear, one of the important things in any UI is NOT to clutter it with superfluous text etc.  Is there anyone here who needs a label to tell them which is their 'main chat' window, their 'Group' window, their 'Target' window.<br />
<br />
I accept that the manual needs a picture indicating which window is which, but it shouldn't be a permanent part of the UI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Don't think this has been mentioned, but does anyone see a problem with the invite/disband keys being right next to group members names? <br />
<br />
Just a simple thought...<br />
I give myself about an hour before I click disband instead of a group member name. The cursor seems to get lost often enough as it is in all the canni cast spam. I don't need more bad things to click on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Boraman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Screen looks ok, just  a basic face-lift really.  It will be the underlying functions and commands that make or break it, imo.<br />
<br />
2 things I hope they include:<br />
<br />
A Color wheel for changing user colors.  The damn /usercolor command is too unwiledly.<br />
<br />
Also the ability to change the transparency % of your chat windows (a la DAoC).  Lots of zones I can hardly read any text because to much of the underlying graphics show through.  And while they are at it give me a command to make dogdog less transparent, I never know where the heck hes at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Try out the /wincolor command.  You can set the transparency with that.<br />
<br />
And dogdog is probably going to remain the way he is.  Spirits shouldn't be too opaque, should they?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">New icons are really going to throw my Gems game off!</div></div><hr />

Some better shots, doesn't look all that bad actually.<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
Oh, almost forgot, check out the 8 spells per page in the spellbook...and that it doesn't totally block your view anymore ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Quite a few new interface screenshots here:<br />
<br />
EQLive Interface Screenshots (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/interface/) <br />
<br />
Looks pretty slick.  The pet window might be handy, and the split health bar certainly will be.<br />
<br />
Edit: Doh, I was beaten to it - not sure why I didn't see that post above me when I viewed the thread. :\</div></div><hr />
