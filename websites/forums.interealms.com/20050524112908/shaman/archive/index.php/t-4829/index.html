<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">yeah yeah, i know i know.<br />
<br />
Well ive gone over options, browsed the magelo's(like everyones, lol), and read other equip threads, but im really undecided on what to upgrade too next.<br />
<br />
The problem is that my cash supply is less then i would like it too be, and resists are starting to get really important.<br />
<br />
In 2 levels ill be in ToV, even if im not doing much(My guild just started doing HOT about a week ago, so pretty much everyone 53+ in our guild, which is most of em, is dying to get a shot at some armour drops).  My resists are less then i would like em too be, and gettin resist gear would set me back a pretty penny.  <br />
<br />
Im only a couple of COM kills, and the Hole away from my epic though, which will help boat loads in that department.<br />
-<br />
<br />
Anyway, my basic question is, whats the best way to go about gathering resists, yet getting a bit more AC(i feel i could use a good deal more), and some more HP.<br />
<br />
Im gettin to the point where upgrades are pretty darn pricey, but I've been getting c3 from some of the guild chanters, and headed out to OOT to get some gem drops...Last time i was there i killed em for 2 hours and only saw 1 star ruby, HEH, its a conspiracy i swear.<br />
<br />
Back to the point, i need some advice on getting some better gear, focusing on AC/Resists, and some HP too)<br />

Thanks much</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sentok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Crown of Froglok Kings 20fr/20cr head<br />
<br />
Stone of Morid  30fr/30cr  range<br />
<br />
Can buy the crown for cheap in the bazaar, and stone can be bought or you can kill for it in Droga. We got two in about 6 hours at the pool room, so it's not horridly rare.<br />
<br />
That ought to help out your resists quite a bit.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Noticed in your magelo that your left ring is the non-enchanted (i.e. statless) ring. There, I just gained you 6ac and 65hp ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Oops :)<br />
<br />
Well ill edit that<br />
<br />
the AC is right though, i configured my naked AC to match up w/ it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Go to The Hole for your IGS....  They're AC 20 and +10 all saves, WELL worth your time!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've been looking to buy one for awhile, but dont have quite enough cash for the standard price.<br />
<br />
They were dropping in value for quite awhile, down to around 4k, but i didnt have that much at the time.  They are now back to 6-8k though /sigh.<br />
<br />
Ah well, Hole raid for a guildmates epic tonight, i might get lucky</div></div><hr />
