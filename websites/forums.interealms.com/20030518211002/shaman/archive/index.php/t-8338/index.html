<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I saw some info, including stats, previously that upgrades for religious symbols were indeed in-game and was wondering if anyone has made some headway on the quests.  I am planning on doing the initiate and disciple quests for CT over again in hopes of finding some new text clues as to where to look next.  One thing that I noticed had changed is that the Infected Rat livers are now droppable.<br />
