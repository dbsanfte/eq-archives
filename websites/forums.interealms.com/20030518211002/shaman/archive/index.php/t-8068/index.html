<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>swampbutt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently did the test of Wisdom over and over and over.<br />
Here is a hint that may help some of you that multi box and want to do the turn in this way.<br />
<br />
I took my 54 shaman to RM and killed the the chumps. I handed off the three pieces to my 16th lef wizzie and sat him down near the stone thingie where the paladin spawns. I leave him there while I pass the time farming Hill Giants to support my &quot;Buy a JBB&quot; fund. When I see the paladin spawn on one screen, I run the shaman over and kill both the chumps again. I bind both charachters there and get a port to SFG (as a troll, it is a good thing I spent so much time in BB over my career, so I don't get much of a hard time from the locals). I run both guys into WK and move out into the zone a bit. I trade off the two sets of stuff to some alts that I am not planning on doing anything with any time soon. If you don't have any free, you can easily make some bots starting in Qeynos. <br />
I then gate back to RM and repeat the process. Once I get tired of the monotony of it, I log in the alts, amking sure all of the spare sets I have to turn in are on alts on the account other than the one my shaman is on, all camped out in the same place.<br />
I find a friendly ranger or druid to track the wandering spirit for me and smack it upside the head and run to me, near the Q-Hills zone. When he gets to me, I have him root it and zone. <br />
I now turn in the set of three pieces I have on me. I trade the next set from an alt to the shaman and turn in again. I camp out the alt and back in with the next alt. Gotta make sure you keep hailing the spirit so he doesn't run on you. If he does, have your friendly ranger root and zone again. Keep doing that untill you get all of the accumulated sets turned in, That will give you a big chunk of your way toward getting that maximum faction.<br />
<br />
Hope someone out there finds this usefull.<br />
