<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Otani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hiya, <br />
<br />
Am looking for suggestions for a spot to solo in in the PoP.  Am flagged for PoV/PoS, HoH, CoD, PoI/factory.  Currently soloing in HoH in one of the crypts, but as I can't split worth a darn, am limited to 2 spawns way in the back.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be appreciated<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xanivus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Go solo the Stormriders in BoT. I think the South Courtyard is about the easiest to pull. They are about half clerics and half warriors with a small agro range. Roughly 6% aa exp per kill. The cleric ones tend to nuke away their mana instead of saving it for CH so just keep yourself Torpor'd and you should be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">So far ive been soloing the first set of guards in HoH and PoV glems if they are open. Bolth arent bad AA<br />
<br />
THe guards in HoH i simply pull with malo , run to GY are and root one then zone out and back in. <br />
<br />
Those are the only worth while places i do right now. The storm riders idea is good. That one area they are spread out pretty good , i just wasnt sure of HP so i havent bothered to try yet. I think i will right now though ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Andisoss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Although i only pretty much solo in Plane of Fire currently, when i use to solo in HOH, i figured out a trick to splitting mobs while in the Trail area.<br />
<br />
I simply pull one dude with slow, root him, train the other about 100 feet away, root him and then camp out.<br />
<br />
When you come back, they will both still be rooted, but you will have no aggro, so you simply just engage the one closest to you, and the other one will eventually return back to its spawn point.</div></div><hr />

I keep hearing about shamans soloing in PoFire... anyone willing to share some info on this?  I will be flagged for PoFire after Sol Ro spawns again (my guild killed him last time he was up, but I went LD! :(  )  so I'm looking forward to giving this a try.</div></div><hr />

ha , yea thats a great trick reminds me of my days soloing NG camp before i got can5 and my 61 pet. sometimes that damn wandering frog would pop and screw me up badly ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There are two very good spots for shamans in fire, the first is just in front of the two birds on the bridge (don't do this if they are up). Pull the lvl65 mobs from the castle, 11% aa exp per kill and they have pretty low hp.<br />
<br />
The second spot is past fennin trigger on the ramps there. Pull the red con guards from the area near fennin trigger and root - rot on the ramps. Yields 18% aa exp per kill but they have a bit higher hp than the even cons, approx 40-45k hp so every mob takes around 6 min. Fennin trigger have to be down of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Field of gibs is not bad either.<br />
If the 2 birds of hell are up at bridge entrance, follow the right wall invised and leved above lava to end of bridge.<br />
There is a nice rock there with no roamer, you can pull stuff there and root / dot em to death.<br />
Becareful... Named can roam in the field of gibs and will spank ya badly if they see you =)<br />
Magma guys are around 18% AA per kill. Other stuff is 11-12% and horse run fast )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Megara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have another stupid question... how useful is Spirit Call when soloing?  I have a shaman friend who swears by it, but some others have told me to get some other AAs first.  Do the dogdogs do (and take) enough damage to be useful soloing high end mobs?  Or should I pass on that aa for a bit and work on others?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Pets get killed in one round by these mobs max two, so they only add like 300-500 per 12 min :(</div></div><hr />
