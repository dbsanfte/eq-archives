<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Warwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild can field about 3 groups, averaging maybe lvl 54, with about 4 lvl 60s in the mix.  We've been in Umbral (killed the old Rumblecrush, was a big fight for us-people are afraid of the new one; one raid ended by the swarmcaller) mostly, with a trip to Akheva, Grieg's End, Grey(to easy).  For Months i've been seeing piles of tank gear, caster gear, and even some nice druid only things drop.  Haven't seen anything for Shamen drop yet tho, except for the things in the Grey. :(<br />
<br />
So, Are we just missing the shaman items?  What critters should we be looking for?  Is there a zone that would be better suited to us?  I'm getting pretty discouraged.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">there's a pretty nifty shield for preists that you can quest in katta, tenebrous, and grimling forest..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Shield is called Shield of Bane Warding, AC 25 wis 20 cha 8 sv magic 12.<br />
<br />
For a single group, I'd recommend the Goranga Chieftain in Maidens End.  He is a random pop, from any placeholder, under the goranga tree in ME.  He drops an AC 15 wis 15 int 15 range slot called &quot;Divine Inspiration&quot; that is equippable by Int and Wis casters.  <br />
<br />
Your melees will probably like all the melee drops here, too, including Axagoreth's Belt of Defense, the AC 10 and AC 20 earrings, the goranga club, the stone visor, the goranga idol, a better version of that idol, etc.  You can get nice items here at a pretty rapid clip.  If you kill any of the aliens, keep the charcoal they drop -- getting that drop is the hardest part of the Shield of Bane Warding quest.  By the way, inny worshippers and Iksar are KOS in Katta, where the quest starts, so it's probably not worth it to let them loot the charcoal, as they won't be doing the quest anyway.  Vampires in ME occasionally drop the nice earrings, too, and a nice necklace.<br />
<br />
You can also camp in Akheva for spells and the very occasional bit of melee loot. or camp Shadel Bandits in Fungus Grove for the shadel bandit rings, or The Grey for various armor, earrings, and weapons, most of which drop from the mobs surrounding the temple.  You can camp the Vampire Castle in Tenebrous for a lot of fun and the occasional decent drop, including bloodweave armor.<br />
<br />
In Fungus Grove, the shrooms rarely drop a Mushroom Veil, AC 8 mana 55 sv dis 15 dex 15 all/all, and are great exp.</div></div><hr />
