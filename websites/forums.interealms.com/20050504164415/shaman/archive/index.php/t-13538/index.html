<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Spiritwar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok guys here it is my girlfriend and I play this game. I play a mage and she plays an Enchanter. We like this because we can group or if we do not like where that is headed and want to be by ourselves we can duo and are not forced to have to group. <br />
<br />
 My girlfriend recently started an alt cleric and she wants to be able to duo with me like we always have. I do not want to start a warrior or a pally because I want something with a little more depth to it. I have never had fun playing a tanking class. <br />
<br />
 Anyway, I have always wanted to toy around with the idea of making a shaman and have made several Barb shaman only to see them later not get played because I hated halas and wanted to play a good race. I tried a kitty shaman but I lag to much on the moon so I have a lvl 5 shaman as a character that has been sitting collecting dust for about a year. He never gets played but with PoP and the PoK I have lost my final excuse not to play one. I would love to make a shaman but I do not see the duo working very well. I tried it with a cleric a long time ago and her shaman and I just do not know if we have not gotten down the fine art of it or what but we just have a hard time duoing and it is akward. <br />
<br />
 I would love to be able to make the shaman I have always wanted but I want to be able to Duo with my GF if I would like to for this class but I just do not know if it would work. Any suggestions would be helpful guys. <br />
<br />
Thank you for your time,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Oh dear *shakes his head and sighs*.  I'll give you my advice, because I have had a similiar situation, but only if you'll excuse my occaisional inside jokes.  My real life housemate and friend is currently a 65 cleric, with wayyy too many AAXP compared to my slacker 59 self.  Anyhow, I started her on the game when I was in my 30's (coincidentally we just discussed this during tonight's Buffy episode, so the levels are all fresh in my mind).  She then passed me when I was 53, and she's been ahead of me ever since.<br />
<br />
At all the times we've been able to group together (from the 40's to the 60's) we've had serious difficulty duoing.  What it comes down to is that cleric and shaman are two very good support classes, but together they lack an essential element: Tank/DPS.  So you have the following options:<br />
<br />
1)  Root rot undead together.  Not so fun IMHO.<br />
2)  Have one of the three of you (shaman, cleric, dogdog) tank while the other two try to add DPS and heal the tank.  This works, just not as well as say ... well, most other possible duos.<br />
<br />
However, I'm not a negative person by nature, so I want to leave you with a ray of hope ;)  I just wanted to make sure that I sufficiently crushed the idea of duoing first *grins evily*.  Anyhow, the ray of hope is option #3:<br />
<br />
3)  Grab a tank and trio.  This works incredibly well, and you can use a pretty loose definition of tank.  For Lanalini and I, it can be our friend Enderii (Bard, currently 59), our friend Doc (65 warrior), our friend Ffehc (Ranger, currently retired :( ), etc.  Pretty much anyone but an int caster or a druid (or another shaman or cleric of course).<br />
<br />
In this trio, the tank typically pulls large amounts at a time (in Doc's case) or a steady succession of single pulls (in anyone else's).  The shaman slows, dots, JBBs, sicks dogdog, etc., contributing damage while also saving the cleric mana.  Since the shaman is keeping the cleric from having to heal as often, she has plenty of mana for fun stuff like her wacky summoned hammer pet, wacky handheld proccing hammer, direct damage spells like Condemnation (no wacky hammers, but still fun), and anything else she can think of.  Meanwhile, the tank is just glad to be fully stat-buffed, healed, and most importantly (at least for all the tanks I know) hasted.<br />
<br />
I'll admit, this is all a bit high level compared to your situation.  But if these are characters you plan to play for awhile, you'll reach these levels eventually.  Anyhow, hope you find this helpful.<br />
<br />
P.S.  About that whole &quot;crush your hope of duoing thing,&quot; I was only joking.  If you do go ahead with duoing, I wish you all the best of luck, as we need more players who are experimentative enough to keep trying unpopular class combinations until they find something new and original.</div></div><hr />

Pet classes can fill the 'tank' role quite well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hadn't thought of that, but good point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jenina Icemyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A cleric can tank a slowed mob but you'll be missing out on a lot of dps with this combo.  Basically you'll be soloing and she'll be leeching xp unless you turn it into a trio.  <br />
<br />
Good duo with a cleric is a mage.  Healing a pet used to be no agro so it was nice although I think that may have been changed.  I haven't played with a pet tank since the patch I'm thinking of so I'm not sure if they just changed charmed pets or all pets.  <br />
<br />
But play what you like.  The days you can't find someone to group with you can always go back and duo your mains like you have been.  Or join a pickup group together and laugh at all the idiots.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My fiance used to play a cleric, and obviously I played the shaman.<br />
<br />
Frankly, it sucked. I loved playing with her of course, but it just wasn't efficient unless she wanted to just feed me heals while I canni'd.<br />
<br />
Of course post cann5/Q, that isn't even that great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If the idea of these characters is to have some fun while they level up then go for it. You could find ways to duo any combination of low level characters and have much fun doing it.<br />
<br />
If the idea is to have a pair of characters that will be sustainable at high levels to duo then you'll have problems as mentioned.<br />
<br />
My shaman is on a different account to my cleric now and its just painful to try and duo them because the easiest way for the cleric to function in a caster duo is to have them tanking with MoR doing a good deal of the damage, add a slow to this and you've wiped out one of the few ways a cleric has of doing damage. You could work round it by not using slow, making damage potions and the shaman tanking of course. It'll be frustrating since the shaman is tuned to his ability to slow and isnt a fantastic damage dealer as a result but hey, if you want to make it work, find ways to make it work.<br />
<br />
More often than not I dig out my little druid to help the cleric farm and camp stuff, you've got a snare/fear combo, the utility spells that the cleric is lacking and added damage shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah, it all depends on the levels involved... If you intend to go past 30, stop now. Two low DPS classes means your duoing life will be hell. On the bright side, I can;t see that you would EVER die!! The healing power should be more than enough for anything unless you are *really* out of your depth.<br />
<br />
My advice? Don't play a shaman in this situation ( I never thought I would hear myself say that!!) Instead, if you want a class that works well with a Cleric, but has some depth, the answer is, simply, Shadowknight... NOT your usual tanking class by any means, this one has a lot more depth...<br />

<br />
I am a 56 shammy and i duo all the time with a 58 cleric.. we don't seem to have too much of a dps problem, i bane, ebolt, plauge, and venom them and ice strike from now and again ( yes in TeH FaCe ) with dogdog and cleric to othe back, in teir 1 pop zones it generally takes about a min, mebby min and a half, sometimes 2 mins per kill if I get resisted alot.. cleric ends fight 85 mana or so, i canni down to a sliver, cheal, back in the ring for more.. with yaulp and haste the cleric does great dps and quad dotting with nukes makes for fast damage not including dogdog.. i guess it depends on the players.</div></div><hr />

Thank you for your time,<br />

<br />
I think you'll be happily surprised by how effective you can be with that combo. My wife, cleric, and myself, Shaman, duo quite a bit. <br />
<br />
I guess it's interesting for us because there are quite a few different ways to play the combo (vs healer/tank combo). Either of us can tank after slowed, we can both tank, we can both sit back and root/rot/dd etc. We both have pets that can help and root for crowd control. If we find a good undead spot (nadox lately, HS, burning woods, dreadlands, etc in the past) her dots/nukes come into play making the combo very efficient. We also sit 3 feet away from each other, so either duo or in a group, we're very effective in keeping folks (each other) alive, crowd control, etc because of the instant communication. <br />
<br />
Shaman/cleric is also a pretty good start to any group, especially 2 that play together often (and/or have the advantage above). We group fairly often with the same people but I'm sure if we decided to look for a group it wouldn't take long. <br />
<br />
One last remark, while MoR is reduced by our slows, MoK is not. Haste both of you, get some low delay weapons and you'll see a small but noticeable difference in your fights. For what it's worth, she MoR/K's 90 percent of the mobs we fight and at higher level's you'll find items that cast one of them (can't remember atm and she's not at home) so the mana usage is negligible.<br />
<br />
Again, it comes down to whether you're having fun or not (to us at least). If you're not happy playing a char (tank) and want to play a shaman, don't let the fact that there are better combo's out there stop you. It's a bit like waiting all day for the perfect group instead of taking the folks you have and making it work in a different spot or zone. Heck, you could probably find undead at virtually every level if you really wanted to max efficiency.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>stewardx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If one of you is willing to worship innoruk you could go the fear kiting route for alot of levels.  This would seriously increase your ability to deal out damage as the shaman half could stack on some serious dots, cleric could use hammer and have mana free to do some damage as well (especially with KEI).<br />
<br />
Also, it would open up alot of fun possibilties.  You get and add, shaman could slow, root sick dog so now you have some CC capabilities.  Granted fear kiting can be dangerous but it adds a neat tactical element and would give you some additional options.  I had a ranger alt that I used to duo all the time with my friends bard.  We got up to the mid 50's and did most of it in dungeons. You just had to learn the lay of the land and be careful.<br />
<br />
If that still does not sound fun I would go with a Bard.  Granted DPS is still not great but you can get more versitile and stacking bard Dots and melee is not bad.  Plus you can get some great weapons very cheaply for a bard to really up the DPS.  Good luck with whatever route u decide to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>blakkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">One problem with clerics is their poor travel/utility spell selection.  No invis, no sow, now enduring breath, no levitatate, etc.<br />
<br />
I personally like to duo a ranger with my wifes alt cleric, not a tank class really, but can do alright for exp hunts and do great dps. Also gets all the utility spells, tracking, foraging (nice for feeding the clerics horse)  and a few extra buffs for when the cleric wants to pull out the super big hammer. <br />
<br />
Beastlord would be very excellent.  Again you have many of the utility spells, and essentially two damage dealers, one of which can tank (the warder).  Also you get spells from the shaman line and some shareable mana regen spells.</div></div><hr />
