<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">...Seriously, can we get some of them merged together? having to cast 5 different things on someone after they die is flat out retarded. It would be like druids getting the HP, AC, and Mana Regen on  thier HP buff all split up. <br />
<br />
I'm all for us having useful buffs, but now instead of having one &quot;alright&quot; buff that was bascially only good for HP, and one &quot;situational&quot; buff that was certain resists, we have new focus, overcap stamina, avoidance, melee damage mod, and that same situational resist buff.<br />
<br />
I'd be willing to have em merged into 2 separate buffs instead of one conglomeration. thus give you the following proposed Solution:<br />
<br />
Buff 1:<br />
Merge Wunshi and Spirit of Might<br />
<br />
Buff 2: Merge Fortitude, avoidance, and perserverance. keep it 1 hour, give it a pretty hefty mana cost. Not like it matters with pained memory anyways.<br />
<br />
Replace one of the things that got merged with group 60% haste with a 36 min duration, and the other with a Single target champion for 400 mana. oh yeah 1500 mana for champion is quality, cause I regulary group with 5 rogues and terrorize LDoN normal.<br />
<br />
I know some asshat enchanter or cleric trolling these boards is gonna step forward and say &quot;You made a shaman, buffing is what you do!&quot;. No, I made a shaman to be tall, cast spells, and beat sh!t to death with a huge spiked club, and if I have people harrassing me nonstop for stuff I have to keep rememmeing and casting constantly, I can't live that dream.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I also wanted to add, that this is thier sneaky way of making us buy those buff slot AAs. Curses!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wolfborn01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">LOL your a synic Grizlor<br />
<br />
But I remeber a time when max level was 50 and we were not the uber slowers we are today!<br />
<br />
Just funny how the shamans roll was changed by such a margin when Kunark came out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">also forgot, though it might not mattter for too long, but the avoidance etc doesnt have stats on them so you now might have to cast stats aswell as avoidance mellee buff, another thing i noticed on test aleast was that spirit of might % mellee doesnt stack with the champion one. i dont think that will have changed but it means if you chain casting champ when it needs it spirit/talisman of might is pointless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The beauty part is I don't even have any of those spells so I get to tell them to bug the Shaman who does. But I agree.</div></div><hr />

Pay particular attention to the raiding shaman saying that stuff like group buffs for lower levels  will take time away from devs fixing real probs.<br />
Why is what youre asking for now any different ?<br />
Yep its a bother casting all these single buffs but as stated in the other post learn to live with it.<br />

I was a melee goddess with my Glowing Wooden Crook until around level 30. Never slowed anything!  Wap...wap...wap....wap, heal someone, wap...wap...wap...wap...wap NUUUUUUKE the runner! Repeat.<br />
<br />
I picked a shaman because I wanted a class that could heal and druids were too common and clerics were boring/too limited in utility. I had no idea about buffs (besides SoW) or slows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Buzcam_Aro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well prediction come true. And it only took 1 month for someone to start cryin about how much buffin we all have to do now.<br />
<br />
Hell, 6 mons ago the cry was our buffs don't stack.<br />
<br />
We are so useless.<br />
<br />
There is no way to win with about half the whoa'es me types that have made us the cry baby class of EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I was twinked out with an Enamelled Black Mace, which was pretty uber at the time hehe, even better than fine steel!<br />
<br />
I don't agree that we should have the buffs merged.  It's really easy to buff with memmed spellsets.  However, talisman/spirit of sense really should have +agi on it for completeness. :)  Also, since might and champion don't stack it would have been nice if they had different effects - say might had +strikethrough and/or +combat effects then make champion +15% damage modifier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I quested for the gatorsmash maul. Into the heart of oggok itself. I snuck into the depths and was victorious.<br />
<br />
At level 34 I stood toe to toe with a hill giant. (please remember this is 1999 we are talking about) When the only people able to kill the humongous bastards with regularity were Necromancers. I killed them with necromancers watching and left them feeling the first tingles of fear that those powerful wigglefingers have ever felt.<br />
<br />
I retired Snoww at the beginnings of Kunark because i was being shunned from groups for having the best life enhancing  rings attainable at that time (the 4 ac 45 hp ones)  And more hit point gear than any warrior. (Whose battlecry at that time was Get serpintine Armguards. they give Uber Agility!!) I walked proudly with a wisdom half that of my bretheren. Yet despite thier fancy words and learned ways I stood in the heart of battles cannabalizing my body so my soul could prosper. <br />
<br />
Even though I stood fast, I was melocholy for too many would say Shut, up, Sit down, And heal.<br />
<br />
I walked away and retired to the cold Tundra for many long months before I heard the call again. <br />
<br />
Near the middle of the exploration of Velious, I once again picked up my Maul after finally achiving what I wished to as a thief and was so enamored of the versatility and power of the spirits that once againI walked the land spreading the justice of an insects bite and with Poisen flowing from my lips.<br />
<br />
I slaughtered hundreads of guardian wyrms hunting for the scrolls of Torpor and Malo. And took the cave of Trakanon with Hammer in hand Screaming at the top of my lungs.  <br />
<br />
I walked in the cold depths of the grey, Gasping for a breath that would never come, and killed the Minions of ssra though I have never faced the Dread Emporer himself. <br />
<br />
Somewhere in my travels I carried a Blight. Hammer of scourge. And used it with great effect For many long years. Alongside it I carried the Barbarian Spiritists hammer. It head cold as the heart of a woman scorned.<br />
<br />
A hammer has been in my name for many years. Even when not in my hand. I long for one worthy enough to fill my hand again.<br />
<br />
I tore the Murky Veil of The City of Mist and was granted a Spear of Feather and steel. a Spear granted to me by the spirits and the Title of Heyokah. But i have never left behind the hammer of my namesake.<br />
<br />
At the first chance I could I took the form of the rabid bear. Clawing and Biting my way forward against a sea of putrid foes. <br />
<br />
<br />
I have stood alone against Dragon and Giant. And Killed them both. I have stood before the Tribunal itself and been granted safe passage. I have slain the gods of other shaman, in hate,  and fear. <br />
<br />
I have stood fast for many years, towering above the warriors of the smaller races and surging forward to break the enemy before me.<br />
<br />
<br />
And to this day no matter where I roam, no matter what I do or where I go. I run into countless friend after friend. People who remember me in times past spreading the carcasses of the enemies Lain low. Or watching as they walk past the dead of a minutes past to clasp my hand to slap my back, And to call me comrade.<br />
<br />
Certainly these times ahead will cause much strife with the spirits we must persuade to aid our brothers in battle. There are many more powerful spirits to call from discord. And they are somewhat fleeting in nature. But we are once again becomeing what we once were. The shadow upon which the tide turns. The rock upon which armies break. We may not do this as much from the sheer fury of the damage we inflict, or from the insects we call to slow our foes, but instead from the prepertion of our brothers and sisters.  <br />
<br />
But even if the course of action is to be the wise old bear who increases the might of a force of steel clad death, I for one will stand against all who oppose me. And if I fall the spirits will bring me back to stand once more. The clerics of the smaller races will wish for thier gods to call back this shaman of justice, because with me the warriors walk taller, the thieves strike more true. And even the rangers tend to perish less often. <br />
<br />
I will not stand at the back. And I will not shirk my duty to make sure all walk with the spirits. <br />
<br />
For I am Heyokah Snoww Silverhammer, And the spirits are mine to command.<br />
<br />
<br />
(Ooc It is simple really. No matter what SoE decides I will be that shaman described above. But once I am no longer effective. I will retire once again. To hopefully a game that realizes that it's players are more than Wallet life support systems, and to a game where The enjoyment of its players come before the aggradisement of thier own egos)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Chifari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'd vote for merging sense and might and leaving the rest alone.<br />
<br />
I have no problem with focus and stamina being two separate buffs, or regen, since combining it into something else creates stacking problems with druid regen.... and I wouldn't want to have druid regen not stack with whatever we combined with our regen.<br />
<br />
The really annoying one at the moment is spirit of might, a spell I feel obligated to cast (because 5% is enough to be significant), but which the group version is cruelly at the bottom of the 70 spell chain.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The only issue I see with merging anything is the gap it would create in the turn-ins and whether or not we would get any new spell to fill the hole left.

<br />
actually for might and str and sense with agil there would be no difference as we get no new agil or str stats buffs, it just menas we wont have to buff them seperate. which is my main things i would like merged.<br />
<br />
and even with mergeing some the other things it would only leave 1 or 2 holes. which a new spell might be nice :)  either a new group haste up to 60% or make old one that sort of thing maybe. new malo type debuff  as we didnt get one? new sow attack levi utlravision type buff? all these are missing and although wont fix us would be nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>vincenzovs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yes they wanted people to buy the new buff AA, yes they had to think to think of a few &quot;new&quot; spells at each level after 65 for shamans....<br />
<br />
so we got some bufs....few of them are very nice imho.<br />
<br />
Yes the whole buffing scheme in EQ is a bit crazy, but it's there, and shamans have had the worst time buffing for quite some time...but look at the bright side:<br />
<br />
AT LEAST PEOPLE WANT OUR BUFFS NOW!<br />
<br />
imho that &gt; the inconvenience buffing them.</div></div><hr />

Why do people(like you) always lump all shaman together as being pissed about something when one person(usually clueless) moans about something?  I'm quite happy with our new buffs and the way they are laid out.  I have no use for the extra 5 spell slots yet and I'm getting the best buffs I can(I always have 3 available).<br />
<br />
It could be worse, they could have broken the effects of Wunshi apart and had a separate str/dex buff+overcap.  To the original poster, there has been some consolidation here.</div></div><hr />
