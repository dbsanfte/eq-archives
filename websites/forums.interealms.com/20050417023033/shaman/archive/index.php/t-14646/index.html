<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Your not gonna be douing near hedge at your level. Most of the mobs over there are even or higher to my ranger when he was 55, and they hit for 3-400 a pop. You'd have to at least be 58 to be able to keep up healing wise, and to be honest with a warrior to taunt your looking at instant death with any resisted slow probably until your 60 or higher. You can probably dou in whats known as the treant triangle on my server<br />
but there is the possibility of adds which would mean instant death if they agroed the shammy. <br />
I would say the safest place for you to dou is dulak's harbor or maybe the zone in nadox. I doued the dandolaks run in dulak for 2 weeks, got 2 levels each for my ranger and shammy and made about 20kpp in gems/words/droppables.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Groff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Orgak and I (57 TSK) duoed through 6aa and two levels (started doing aa at 55) on PoN yard trash around &quot;Dead Tree Corner&quot;, Tree Valley and Hedge.<br />
<br />
Really, the Nettlings and Banshees are cake, they hit fairly hard but once slow lands, the heals were fairly easy to keep up with for him at 55.  Of course, I had Troll regen on my side, we both had KEI (so I was tapping health up a bit in between big heals) and the first three AA I ground out went to Regen AA.  I think it's just a matter of getting a rhythm down and knowing how you play.  Aggro is easy to build on pulls at the Hedge (easier than in the other two camps I mentioned) because the wandering mobs are fairly widely spaced, giving the warrior plenty of time to pop a few arrows into them.  Furthermore, the Banshees are fairly slow even without snare, so if need be, he can probably kite them around a bit, taunting and whacking them with arrows (or if he's brave, a couple seconds toe to toe with fast or procing weapons) to build aggro on resists.  <br />
<br />
I realize that warrior taunt is pretty broken, and as such it was much easier for an SK to maintain aggro on those mobs than it would be for the warrior, but I really do think that with Chloroblast, Shaman heals are more than sufficient to keep up with the slowed damage output on those particular mobs.  Clerics like to perpetuate the myth that they're absolutely necessary in the planes, but hell, you folks are much more valuable in my opinion.  I've rarely had a Shammy TRY to add me to the purple club. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Orgak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Damn.  &quot;Orgak&quot; and &quot;Nice&quot; in the same sentence... must be losing my touch.  <br />
<br />
Your first stop in PoN is what has been referred to by my cohort as Dead Tree Corner.  When you zone in, head to the wall next to the GY and then turn right (away from the waterfall).  You'll come to a big dead tree that looks like an overgrown Treant.  You'll still be within sight of the GY.  You can pull to there with little risk of adds/trains.  <br />
<br />
Hedge is doable at 55.  I'm not saying it's easy; I'm saying that it's doable.  I gotta wonder though how much more difficult it will be without snare.  If my slows didn't stick on the big mobs, Groff would just kite it until slow landed.  It may be worth a try to root it first as soon as it gets into camp and then have the War engage after you've gotten the slow to stick.  If it's rooted, then the War has a better chance at generating sufficient aggro and it won't be in your lap when it breaks.<br />
<br />
Fool around with slowing without Malo to figure out which mobs have a higher MR.  IIRC, Wraiths typically didn't resist enough to warrant Malo, but the Banshees did.  Being 54, you don't have Bane of Nife so you might want to stack EB and Plague.  I actually noticed a difference using Cripple, so you might want to throw that in too.  I say give it a shot; the worst that happens is you have to zone.</div></div><hr />
