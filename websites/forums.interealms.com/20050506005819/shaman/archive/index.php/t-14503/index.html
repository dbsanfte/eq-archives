<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">From this SOE press release (http://www.sonyonline.com/corp/press_releases/EQ2_incentives_051303.html):<br />
The incentives will include exclusive crossover quest zones in each game that will be accessible only by subscribers of both games, allowing characters in EverQuest  and EverQuest II to gain access to hidden treasures.... [emphasis added]<br />
And then from the EQ 2 FAQ (http://everquest2.station.sony.com/faq.jsp):<br />
Is EverQuest II an expansion of or sequel to the original EverQuest?<br />
EverQuest II is not an expansion, but rather a parallel universe that continues the ongoing history of Norrath and its inhabitants. EverQuest II will introduce a number of features that have never been utilized in massively multiplayer games. <br />
So EQ2 is an entirely different game that we'll have to buy separately and for which we'll pay a separate monthly fee...yet there will be EQ content we cannot access without having EQ2.  This strikes me as a particularly loathesome marketing technique that is grossly unfair to EQers who for whatever reason aren't interested in EQ2.  <br />
<br />
How do you feel about it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think they are big caca headz :D But I plan on getting the all acess pass so call me a sucker.<br />
If they didnt come out with the pass though, I would never play eq2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I live by this thought process. I already paided for EQ, so I might as well pay until I run it into the ground. But I dont want to play any new MMORPG's. They can put in all the content they want and you still wont see me touching any MMORPG that comes out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">From the beginning the description of EQ2 included some mechanism for an established EQ player to pass on a legacy to his new EQ2 character.  This is perhaps a way of trying to implement that goal.<br />
<br />
Personally, I can't wait for EQ2.<br />
<br />
I saw a link to some caster robe the other day that had 60 AC FT VII and huge stats.  EQ is becoming a joke and I am hoping that EQ2 will restore some reasonableness to Norath.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Beargor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Of course they want more money from each of us =)<br />
<br />
But I'm soon done with EQ1, and I'm not going to play EQ2 unless they back away from that policy. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">SOE needed to figure out a way to pry the reluctant player ba$e out of EQ and get them headed toward the next ca$h cow before $ome competitor came out with a better product.  Relea$ing what is ba$ically an &quot;expan$ion game&quot; i$ probably the be$t way to do that.<br />
<br />
I would bet we $ee more and more overlapping EQ2 feature$ $tart to pop up $lowly into EQ as a way of getting player$ comfortable with the new game enviroment.  SOE know$ that ju$t dropping EQ and leaving all of the old character$ with no connection to a new game that will do nothing but lo$e them ca$h.<br />
<br />
Without some tie-in, EQ2 would fail miserably and SOE knows this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Who says you have to have the stuff from those tie-in zones.  If you want that stuff, you'll pay for EQII, and if you don't care, you won't pay.  This marketing ploy doesn't seem any more evil than usual.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">This flat out pales in comparison to PoP where the casual gamer basically paid for PoK books and 4 zones and not only are they unable to access the xp/gear in the other zones, players that can are rewarded doubly when the casual gamer is finally allowed in and ZEM xp is nerfed.  Hilarious.  Unless whatever's in the crossover zone is on the order of PoK books, who cares?<br />
