As of Tuesday night, it was the same list as was posted before.   I suspect they're holding some back (well, I hope) because they get posted to boards despite the NDA.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm sorry but these new AA's look so worthless.   The only one I can see getting is the endurance ward and that would not be by choice ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree, I was gonna save up all my AA's until God, but why bother?<br />
<br />
I could blow all my AA's just to allow buffs to hit my pets, which won't make a difference most of the time because I buff before entering instanced zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think Secondary Forte and Persistent Casting seem like they'd be worth having...  The rest I'm not so sure about.  If Critical Affliction is actually a reasonable crit rate, I might have to work towards getting that as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">At only around 110 AAs, I have plenty on the current menu to keep me busy. Might try to knock out Improved Innate Run Speed though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Improved Innate Run won't stack with any other run speed modifiers,  so what does it get you other than not having to cast sow?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">For dungeons/indoor zones. Will make pulling and running away  ;)  easier.<br />
<br />
The sow we can now cast indoors is no faster than run speed 3.<br />
<br />
Secondary Forte  and Crit Dots the only things I am really looking forward to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">That's illegal ;P<br />
<br />
<br />
PS - Man I can't wait to quit when those ****ty aa's come out</div></div><hr />
