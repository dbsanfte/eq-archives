<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kankan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok back again.. just want to thank you all for the info down below. I started doing the nobles last night and this morning. Already 2 yellows.. I'll hit 56 by tomorrow. This is great exp, im getting at least 1 blue every 45 minutes. If I had JJB it would of been faster. <br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Ok I have a question i'm sure has been answered many times but I couldnt find a post that fit my situation. Im a 55 Shaman without JBB or a Regen Tunic. I am looking for a place to solo and am not all too concerned with faction (cept would like to keep Shar Val ). My Shaman is a Troll. I like to solo with my pet but could do it without if needed. I like the pet as a buffer in case things go wrong. <br />
I had checked out HHK today as a post had suggested, but found only a few vendors that would give me exp ( maybe looking in the wrong place?) all the guards were green. Any suggestions to this (im sure) duplicated post many times over would be greatly appreciated.<br />
My greatest reason for soloing is I watch my 2 sons quite a bit and dont like to group in case i need to go afk for a bit. With soloing I can run to a safe area and take a short break.<br />
Ok thanks in advance!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">u want the mobs called nobles, they on the 1st floor up the white stairs.  in a green room with some card dealers.<br />
<br />
u left it bit late tho, i started here at 50 )   many are light blue at 55.    ther are 8 spawns to choose from tho!   thers a test for ya  see if u can find em all  hehhe  (tho one has a PH)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Can the nobles be easily single pulled?  I think I've been to that room many moons ago with my main but can't remember how spreadout the nobles are?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually...  On my server (Tarew Marr) you can get the iskar BP for around 4-5k.  The extra 50hp per min isn't a big deal but it is something.  And for me the BP was an upgrade since I was still wearing a Bloodstained tunic.<br />
<br />
At 55 I did the Nobles in the game room.. just the nobles.  It took a while but I did manage to get though 55 there.  Then I went looking for someplace else.... and I am still looking.... but really haven't been wanting to solo which is the real problem.<br />
<br />
CoM there is the gazeboo's (sp?) I think they are still running blue at 55 and turn light blue at 56... again I THINK.<br />
<br />
I have played in skyfire once, but not at 55.  It should be doable, but I never quite figured out how to do the pulls back to my pet correctly... I always out run the mob and loose argo.<br />
<br />
At 56 I can pull the suits solo..but have to use extream range on the slow spell.  And the adds can get you killed...  I am skyshrine aligned so I have to hoof it over to the dragons.  I never tried pulling them at 55.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes they can be single pulled, but I don't remember the level when that happens.  I was pulling them at 54 single.<br />
<br />
Just remember, if you open up your back to any noble, expect to get hit for 150-200+ they backstab.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mercuratrayin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ive found setting up camp in the dining room, waiting for Isabella, killing her then moving to Nobles and using  a slow from the first door, gives you time to wait for them to run around the corner and sic Doggy on them. Have a root up, when they run they tend to drag the Bards into the fight if they make it down that far. Thats a zoneing offence even at 56.<br />
<br />
Im still looking for a good spot at 56 myself. Havent found it yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Actually I never played in the dining room ... guards were just annoying.  I parked in the room 2 doors down from the gaming room.  I would cast slow on the noble...and run back to room if I got the resist (which happens) I would start clicking slow and by the time it fired off the noble as hit me once or twice.... back up and reslow if intrupted, while puppy has the noble distracted, or you just have to channel though the hits.<br />
<br />
DON'T fight in the room right next to gaming room.  The guard and extra noble will argo though the wall, which has gotten me killed once.<br />
<br />
And the last room has a guard that spawns inside...but like I said I found the guards annoying anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">OK, set up in the dining room and pull out DogDog. Give him your best regen, and buffs. He will be your tank, unless your defense is lacking and you need to work on it. Go to the room and target a mob. FACE IN THE DIRECTION YOU ARE GOING TO RUN, and Turgur. <br />
<br />
If resisted just run to the room and cast it from there. You'll get the timing down soon. Let DogDog tank, with his regen spell he'll be over 80% most of the time. Take out the Isabella first, he faction drops fast and she wanders. <br />
<br />
I'm KoS to her, so I kill her ASAP (I'm a barb, been hunting there awhile). DO NOT let the nobles run when at low health, and beware, they and Isabella backstab for high 350's. The bards will help them and you'll have to let ol' DogDog bite the bullet while you run. <br />
<br />
After both nobles go splat, pull the bards..but watch out...they hit harder. Once slowed, they are all cake. I had a horse and a JBB, they help alot. Turn off models and you'll never know the horse is there. <br />
<br />
I let DogDog tank because my defense was high, and could take two at a time if things got ugly. Keep DogDog at more than 15% health at all times. <br />
<br />
When things get sticky with 2 mobs, slow both, and root one away from you, DogDog, and the other mob. Once rooted, JBB the mob DogDog is on, JBB like there's no tomorrow. <br />
<br />
Make sure to keep DogDog alive, he's significant damage for you, and saving you mana by taking hits.<br />
<br />
Been awhile...but one Ebolt, plus DogDog damage, and alot of JBB clicking would finish them off. <br />
<br />
If I think of more later I'll edit it in. Spent 51 - 55 here, it's cake once you get the pattern down. I could do it in my sleep, it's really easy, but the only downside is it's mindnumbingly boring. (No, I'm not exaggerating)</div></div><hr />
