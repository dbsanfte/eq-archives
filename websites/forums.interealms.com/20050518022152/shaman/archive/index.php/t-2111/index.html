<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kakkaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I tried the dorfs in thurg but i kept getting resist on malise and root at 47 the ones at ent and the arena guard.<br />
I was wondering if I can take them then or are they completly resistant to magic I heard they were maybe im just not high enough who knows.<br />
Any info is good.  and if dorfs in EW are better which camp gives blues for exp etc. thx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Takk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I tried at around 56 to kill the dorfs but they were too MR.  If you get a couple  melee heavy groups(you being buffer and backup heal) they drop  a lot of nice armor than can be used by the meleers (of course no drop). <br />
  Giants are usually not too heavy in MR (with a few exceptions).  Besides it feels a bit more statisfying killing a giant than a dorf.</div></div><hr />
