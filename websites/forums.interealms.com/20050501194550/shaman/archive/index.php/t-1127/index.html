<p class="largefont">Click here for full thread: <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=1127">Please scan your systems for Klez</a></p>
<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I don't know how many of you have me in your address book, but a great many of you must be infected with the Klez worm, judging by the boatload of infected mail I've been receiving over the last three weeks.  I've been scanning my system weekly to make sure it hasn't made it from your mails to my pc (so far so good), but there are only so many virii you can receive without starting to freak out :P  If you haven't updated your anti-virus signatures yet, please do so soon!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Souldreamer Bearspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We got the following warning from work about it too.<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
Please delete any email with the following contents: <br />
Subject:  Work Klez.E immunity <br />
From:  Remaxwork&lt;Remaxwork@aol.com&gt; (the sender could be from different names) <br />
<br />
Klez.E is the mose common world-wide spreading worm. It's very dangerous by corrupting <br />
your files. Because of its very smart stealth and anti-anti-virus technic, most common AV <br />
software can't detect or clean it. <br />
We developed this free immunity tool to defeat the malicious virus. <br />
You only need to run this tool once, and then Klez will never come into your PC. <br />
NOTE: Because this tool acts as a fake Klez to fool the real worm, some AV <br />
monitor maybe cry when you run it. <br />
If so, Ignore the warning, and select 'continue'. <br />
If you have any questions, please mail to me. <br />
  <br />
<br />
Please delete the email that shows the above contents and delete <br />
it from your trash folder as well. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For those without AV software, visit one of my favorite (http://housecall.antivirus.com/) sites. You can scan/clean your PC remotely. Klez is in the scan.<br />
<br />
There is also a fix if you are infected here (http://www.antivirus.com/vinfo/virusencyclo/default5.asp?VName=WORM_KLEZ.E) .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Virus scanners are for wussies ;P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I had 200 odd files infected with the &quot;Weird&quot; virus last week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you’re using an Email System that can cause you to obtain a virus, why are you still using it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thankfully Netscape (being web based mail) tends to keep the virii away from my system.  Something amusing: today I got two more copies, and one was from &quot;eqmail@verant.com&quot;  Hmmm......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I got a copy from &quot;absor&quot; Alan Vancouving (sp - it's at home and I'm at work at the moment) sent to my haleice email address which is not the email I registered with EQ with.<br />
<br />
Someone is sending files as Absor. The file i got was called Install.exe, luckily Nortons AV caught it. Not that I would run anything that Absor sent to me ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>AbsorEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It's pretty unlikely that you got that from me.  We're killing it with some very thorough scanning on our end.<br />
<br />
But then, I wouldn't run anything I sent you either.<br />
<br />
:)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I don't know why people bother with Virus Scanners and other crappy software like Norton Crashguard. My game computers are free from all such programs and 3rd party apps. The only thing loaded on the computer is the OS and of course the game itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Madcovv!  Naughty, naughty!  Got one from you today :)  You know, it is honestly very refreshing to know it isn't just the rest of us browsing EQ websites from work (of course, for us it ISN'T work)!</div></div><hr />
