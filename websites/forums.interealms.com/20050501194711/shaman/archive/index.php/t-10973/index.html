<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I have been trying to update my toons equipment for the past 3 months since they new system was installed but I am still getting frustrated with numerous failures.<br />
<br />
Everytime I try to update a slot by typing the name of the equippment and hitting proceed then the items is shown to me to confirm and hit proceed.<br />
<br />
But it doesn't show up in the slot even though I have activated that option. Furthermore when I try to update another slot after typing the new equipment name and hit proceed, it shows the previous equipment and refuses to change.<br />
<br />
Can anyone advise what I need to do to get it working please?<br />
<br />
Much thanks for any help.<br />
