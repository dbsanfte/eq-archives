<br />
Where is the best place for leveling for a lvl 51 shaman and monk. Neither have their epics, or uber gear...that is..no JBB or item that procs on click.<br />
<br />
Dulak isnt bad but its slowing down and most mobs outside of ships are light blue.<br />
<br />
Echo gnomes are few and far between.<br />
<br />
ANy suggestions?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>NniaNeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dulaks is ok, but I was wondering is there anywhere else that has decent exp for a duo like that?</div></div><hr />

Move into the next LoY zone in the progression: Nadox.<br />
Start near the bridge or near the fake wall zoneout and move deeper as you get better.</div></div><hr />
