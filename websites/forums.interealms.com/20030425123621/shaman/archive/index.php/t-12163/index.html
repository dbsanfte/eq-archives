<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm now level 49 and hunting in RM to raie funds (prolly won't last long, damn boring! ;)). I was wondering if i should save all the way to JBB then upgrade some slots such as face or upgrade minor slots then start saving again for JBB. Either way if you can reccommend any upgrades other than JBB i'd appreciate it. (nothing to pricey, 2k Tops per slot, thats pushing it).<br />
<br />
edit: JBB goes for around 15-22kpp on AB)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would save for the JBB.  It will make a huge differance in how well you do till you are 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Telosk if you get bored of HG's in Rathe try farming Acrylia/Windstones + some low value gems from the Grimling Mines in the Tenebrous Mountains, it's probably just as dull but usually empty (no KS) and you don't have to run about as much. The mobs are pretty much non stop (once you have cleared the mine the front mobs have popped again) and you can make around 500/600pp pr hr.<br />
<br />
Personally i would look at upgrading some slots for a little more WIS and MANA as your mana pool is quite low. A JBB is a superb piece of equipment and i would like one myself but a manaless DD isn't going to help you when you need to root 'n' slow those adds or quickly patch heal the only cleric in your group only to find your LOM/OOM.<br />

Just my 2cp<br />

Just reading my post i'd like to point out before anyone says anything that i know HP &gt; AC &gt; WIS and that our class isn't a druid. I have tanked my way to 52 and have had my defense/offense maxed for a good few levels, self buffed i hit just over 2k HP with i do canni down, my AC self buffed is just below 900 so i can take a slapping and often do act as an MT when i group with a Rogue mate (gotta love that backstab) but i love having 196 WIS and a 2.7k mana pool...the balance of HP/AC/WIS can be struck with no need to compromise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks, atm i'm doing EF IG's forp lat and some exp, prolly stay here till level 50 or when ever i raise 20k :P</div></div><hr />
