<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There we were, in the Plane of Growth, giving the treehuggers a good seeing to.<br />
<br />
Off to one side the brave troll shaman sits on his noble steed, while his companions lay the smack down on some wooden dudes.<br />

<br />
Anyway, I got that weird horse bug, that stops people casting spells on you. So I decided to camp out for a moment to clear it.<br />
<br />
I camped, but my horse didn't. I think the treehuggers had corrupted it, as it then bit our cleric.<br />
<br />
The poor thing had to be humanely destroyed.<br />

<br />
What sort fo HP does dobbin have?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was camped (actually LD) for most of the fight, but they were still killing it when I came back, so it took around 45 seconds. Not everyone was attacking though, some were standing around being bemused :)<br />
<br />
So probably only a few thousand hp.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>humburto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">A week or two ago, while I was riding on my horse in KC my friend noticed that when he conned it that it scowled at him :P. I too have horse models turned off, but every time I have conned my mount its amiable. I don't think it would be too fun otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've long lost the link, but someone had posted screenshots of a horse tanking the Cazic Thule (the god) right after Luclin came out.<br />
