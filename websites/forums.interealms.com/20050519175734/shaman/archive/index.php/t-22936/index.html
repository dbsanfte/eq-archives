<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cosik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild is having a group/duo/free for all events in the arena this Saturday.  <br />
<br />
Looking for some tips since I do not have Q and some of the better pvp AA's RC/SC/VP. <br />
<br />
For the duo I plan to be duoing with a level 65 SK.  Not sure what I will have in the way of a group.  I will probably just die quickly in the free for all.<br />
<br />
I am going to try and pick up a see invis neck.  I will also make some ds pots and stinging wort.<br />
<br />
Any other quick tips would be very useful.<br />
<br />
My magelo is in my sig so you can see what I have to work with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sit down when being attacked... makes the death quicker and less painful :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kanudil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My suggestion is keep one or two cures up as you will get dotted, and have one or two clickies (sow boots work well) dots hurt people a lot more than they do mobs these days and especially with something like bane or anathema + epic=bad for other people...when I participated in events like these awhile ago I actually came up 3rd or 4th (Damn pallies and their Soulfire)...do your best and don't go in there thinking you'll die...if this is in arena use the spires to your advantage ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My dueling experience is very limited, but, as I recall, resist buffs are more effective in PvP, so I would have Annul Magic loaded at all times. Unfortunately, so will your caster and hybrid opponents. Be prepared to be dispelled early and often. If your melees know anything about PvP, they will have pumice with them too, which will make your life even more difficult. You do have pretty good resists for the level, though, so it may help against nukes and some DOTs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cosik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">On that note best place for me to buy pumice?  and are they self or targetable?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cosik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Also should I load torpor at all or just stick with Tnarg's?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">lev, dont stop moving except to cast.  Root who you can ASAP (might need to malo them first).  Get your resists up if you can (if you can only self buff, buff THEM ALL! if you can get help, get druid, mage, ENC buffs).  DoT all you can and dont stop, dont waste mana on nuking unless they are only a few % left in health.  Dogdog is a good distraction, while they're focusing on you, your lil wimpy pet is chewing on their butts.  Keep in mind though, DoTs make you lose XP in duels, but if people dont mind eating a few % after rezzes, they are your best friend.<br />
<br />
Spell set up should be:  Malo, slow, root, dot, dot, heal, cure, nuke.  (at least that worked for me when we did this in my old guild.)  <br />
<br />
Run, stop, malo, run, slow, root, DOT DOT DOT DOT!...run...root....rinse repeat.  Not sure what to do in a group or duo situation, but this worked well for 1 on 1.   <br />
<br />
GL to ya and I hope you kill a monkey for me (they are the hardest because of how fast they are...) and kill a few gnomes while youre at it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You've got a few days; run some adventures and try and get every resist aug that you can.  THere is usually one or two on every adventure.  Resists are key in PVP.  You cant do as much damage as quickly as some classes.  A shamans strength is his ability to last.  You said you have Torpor;  that puts your survivability near the top of the list.  <br />
<br />
You say its a free for all, so take out any INT caster that you can first.  Let the melees worry about the other melee's for a bit; your main concern is any class that can take large chunks of your health away at one time.  Make a pet and get some mage weaons for it.  Interupting the casters with procs is important.<br />
<br />
Warriors, aside from having a large number if starting HP, arent as hard as you might think.  Aside from potions or item effects they have no way to heal any damage done to them.  Paladins and shadowknights, asside from being fearsome damage dealers through melee and spells, have the ability to heal themselves.  Carefull.<br />
<br />
And GL.  Staying alive is the most important, not your body count at the end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Regardless of what you do, get that magic resist above 200 unbuffed.  Don't care if you have to sacrifice 300 hp to do it.  Get it done.  Buy pumice, cure poison, cure disease, invisibility, and stinging wort potions.<br />
<br />
Bah, just get out there and duel that sk friend of yours a lot.  You'll quickly learn what you can and can not do.  And that's the best advice you can take because pvp isn't something you can be told how to do, it's something you need to learn through trial and error.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>FreyrSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Go for this lineup IMO:<br />
<br />
Spear of Torment<br />
Bane of Nife<br />
Envenomed Bolt<br />
Pox of Bertox<br />
Malicious Decay<br />
Malo<br />
Tnarg's<br />
Torpor<br />
<br />
Make spell sets for buffs and one with Disinfecting Aura + your PvP spells (so you can switch back and forth quickly).  Keep ~3 clickies available so your buffs don't get stripped and make sure that you have Pumice and Crimson Potions handy.  Oh, shrink yourself as small as you can get and keep moving to make yourself a difficult target.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">A melee with 200+ resists will own any shaman out there if he's worth half a cow-patty.<br />
<br />
Sorry to say it, but every single one of our dots are curable... they're easy to resist... our nukes are very weak in comparison... our pets go down very fast... your only hope is to pick people off as they fight others and hope that something like a level 40 rogue is the only thing left standing at the end.<br />
<br />
Shaman just aren't duelists.</div></div><hr />

 Well, it might not be quite honorable but you could  stay out of the arena area and become a designated healer/buffer for your melee in your guild. Sort of the way you would when dealing with a MR Boss mob. Of course, the only problem is  you have to stay within your casting range of your guild members (and most likely that means you have to occasionally step onto the arena area).<br />
<br />
       I occasionally like  to use  flash of light to blind them....since it  is a lvl 1 spell it has the best chance of sticking on a heavly  MR  melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">if you fight against an enc, make sure that you dot yourself with a long lasting low damage dot (like epic in combination with regen).<br />
They will  really wonder when they mez you and you break the mez again and again  :cool:  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shambler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">no one said use Flash of Light spells? *GASP*<br />
<br />
getting a root to stick on any half decent Magic Resist player is hard, especialy if they are laying into you with weapons.<br />
<br />
it is effective on PC's and very effective on pets. FoL a pet and it cant find you. (well used to be true not sure if it still is)<br />
<br />
maybe you think blinding people is cheap? /shrug works for me<br />
<br />
tactics totaly depend on what class you are up aginst.<br />
<br />
In a group vs group combat where more than a few are melle, tigirs insects would be a nice group debuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you're a 63 going against 65's, there's not really much you can do.  You're going to die.  Malo them and try to root/slow them.  If you can't, just sit down and make it faster.  You can probably get grummus to land, too.  If they have bad MR and you can actually land spells on them, just root them and dot them up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>FreyrSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Unless you know for a *fact* that these people have really crappy SvM (ie. less than 100) don't even bother casting flash of light or root on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Cosik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Ok I have sow booties and I know about the goblin earring but what else is a quick clicky buff?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kanudil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">How'd the whole event go? Die fast or did you make it?</div></div><hr />
