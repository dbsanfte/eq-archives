<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slverwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hrmm, well iv looked over all the shaman quests, gear etc.  but what i dont get is, what is the best, what is stupid and shouldnt be done and what is a valuable to compleet.  none of the guides iv read have been to straight forward, like totemic armor, is it the best shaman armor? if not, what is? what about wpns, piercing or blunt? there isnt really a lack of info on what a shaman can do (over all) but what i havent found is what a shaman SHOULD do (what is really economical to do).  HELP!  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, what you should do is pretty subjective. Maybe let us know what you are looking for in your shaman, and we can give you some ideas. <br />
<br />
I really don't know what type of shaman/player you are. Some people are big questers, and will do the quests even if the armor is outdated, because it makes them feel good - some don't. It all depends on play style and what kind of path you seek.<br />
<br />
From the few things you mentioned, I'd probably keep both pierce and blunt skills up. Piercing primarily because of the epic. The others are nice to have if you ever get some really good weapons aside from a piercer. So if you can't afford to keep all of them up, my advice is piercing because there are some really cheap weapons out there that are really good in the low levels and can bring your skill up fast like the slime coated harpoon.<br />
<br />
The best quested armor really depends on your level. Since you brought up Totemic, I don't think there is any other quested armor that beats that at that level range. But you can try searching some of the Luclin quests, I believe some of that stuff is mid-range level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It would help if you posted your level, what plat you have available or what kind of raiding guild you're in (if applicable).  The answers to your questions depend on a lot of factors.<br />
<br />
But, I think piercing is a good option (try to keep all the melee skills up if possible, you never know when they might be handy!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slverwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">wepons or armor dont matter to me if they are quested or not.  im fine in just doing the epic quest and thats the only one.  but like if the best shamy chest is a quest only, no drop piece and it invlolves a buch of questing id be willing to do it, but im not gona go and just do all the quests, i think that is an  uneconomical use of time.  im not really dead set on doing the quest for better or for worse.  although id like to do more quest than im planing to for my rogue.<br />
<br />
as far as lvl, guild or pp, that really isnt a factor for me, im trying to establish a series of goals to work twards.  some semblice of a cource of action, i think that will shape the way i play my char more than anything else, where i camp etc.  (i hope that doesnt piss anyone off, and they dont think i wasting peoples time by maby asking these questions pre-emptivly)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmmmm, so you want long term goals of excellent shaman gear?  The best shaman gear is probably droppable, although the Velious quest armor (Wolfcaller's and Spiritcaller's is very nice).<br />
<br />
If you're looking at long term equipment goals, I'd just start reading the Magelo profiles of many of the 60 shaman that post here, you'll get to see the items they're wearing, the stats.  Then you can go to Allakhazam's and see where it drops.<br />
<br />
If you want to make a long term goal for the &quot;best&quot; shaman gear, it's important to make a goal of getting into one of the big, high level raiding guilds on your server.  If you hang out at your server board, you'll probably figure out quickly who they are.<br />
<br />
Most of the best gear is only attainable with a large, organized guild force (NTOV loot, RoF loot, Tunare loot, etc).  <br />
<br />
If you're not talking about really high level goals to work for, I still don't know your level or resources to help you figure out what would be a good goal NOW.  <br />
<br />
Gear choices vary greatly from level 20 to level 60, I still need more info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slverwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">yeah, i know how the big guild thingy works : /  ok, since that makes higher lvls gear kinda iffy then what about lvl 20, what would be the best gear to have then, and the best wpn?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It doesn't make much of a difference, really :)  Totemic will serve you well until your 30's.  At low levels, the only gear that really matters are your weapons and your +HP and +mana gear.  If you were to get a pair of 6ac/65hp rings. you'd notice a huge difference.  On the other hand, if you found a +30stamina piece, you'd barely notice any.  That being said, go for any hp/mana gear you can scrounge up, and don't worry too much about your wisdom :)<br />
<br />
As for weapons, a friend gave me a howling harpoon when I was level 8.  It served me very well up until two days ago (at level 54) when I bought a rune-etched icewurm fang.  Slime coated harpoons and spine chill spears will also work well.  As other people have said, don't neglect your blunt skills, though.  I did, and I am regretting it now /sigh.  Unfortunately, I can't recommend a good low-end 1hb or 2hb for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Slverwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">ahhh, ok.  do you remember any names of that hp/mana gear that you speak of?  but like other than that just go for banded? normal armor?  or is there a type like ravenscale that isnt the best but is decent and accesible for lower lvls?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Judging from your posts, your shaman is a barbarian shaman that is less than 10th lvl, with no money.<br />
<br />
http://eq.castersrealm.com/playguides/default.asp?Class=shaman<br />
<br />
that website will give you PLENTY of ideas on how to start off.  <br />
<br />
<br />
As far as armor/weapons goes, AC 6 / 65 HP rings will cost you about 1000pp for a pair.  A full suit of banded will cost barely 100pp and be a much, much better investment.<br />
<br />
Your first 'goal' should be banded, then totemic.  When you start researching those armor, you will get a good idea of what their stats are...so when you get a random piece of armor you will know if it's a better deal or not compared to banded (or totemic)<br />
<br />
<br />
Weapons - use all 3 (1hb, 2hb, piercing)  Eventually a great weapon will fall into your hands and you will want to be able to use it.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>argoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Good low to midlevel 2hb include:<br />
<br />
Runed Totem Staff -- 10 to 15pp<br />
<br />
Glowing Wooden Crook -- 50 to 80pp<br />
<br />
Argoth of Drinal</div></div><hr />

hrmm, well iv looked over all the shaman quests, gear etc.  but what i dont get is, what is the best, what is stupid and shouldnt be done and what is a valuable to compleet.  none of the guides iv read have been to straight forward, like totemic armor, is it the best shaman armor? if not, what is? what about wpns, piercing or blunt? there isnt really a lack of info on what a shaman can do (over all) but what i havent found is what a shaman SHOULD do (what is really economical to do).  HELP!  :confused: <br />
<br />
Economical and good gear do not always go hand and hand.  Especially at lower level.  This is even more true, when, like myself, you are an untwinked main.  Keeping this in mind, feel free to check out my magelo profile<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=62502<br />
<br />
and with the exception of the Jarcrap leggings, the Kunzar Cloak, and the CC Gaunts (all won on rolls in either KC or Velks)  I have had all of the same, roughly low/mid level gear, since about level 20 or so.  Obviously not the boots, but that comes with time and level.  The stuff in the bags are all situational, and with 2 exceptions, nothing exceptional.  At this point, only thing I am looking to improve on (and have been since 35 or so) is the BP.<br />
And, before the CC Gaunts, I was wearing Split Paw Hide gloves... maybe 20pp in EC/Whatever flea market is on your server.  <br />
<br />
Is this the best gear?  Not by a long shot.  Is it the right gear?  Well, it strikes a very good balance of both AC and Wis, and has for quite a while.  At least for me.  It has always been my experience that the best shaman is unique, and has developed his or her own style, and not the cookie cutter that a lot of people seem to want to find.<br />
<br />
As for the weaponry, the only thing not gotten, in a group effort or on my own, was the prod, and I keep it solely for when I am in straight wis caster mode (and, eventually, the howling stones key quest) and the same for the ToV.<br />
<br />
<br />
Figure excluding the no-drop leggings and cc gaunts, there is less than 2-3k of armor there.  All of which has done well to keep me alive and well as primarily a solo, battle oriented shaman.<br />
<br />
(added) While my 2hb weapons may be considered high end (semi, at least), with the introduction of Luclin, all kinds of weaponry has come out that is easily accessable to even the lower level players.  The Troglodytes in Netherbien drop (I believe) Flint weapons (a spear and a 1hb) both of which are lore.  A lot of them rot.  They aren't great, but they both have a wis modifier on them, and both are easy to obtain.  Also, there is a mob there that drops a BP called Netherbien Chitin, which is 20 ac, with (I believe) an STA modifier on it.  Not an uncommon drop.  There is also a mob that drops a soiled breech cloth, which has a decent wis modifier on it, with fair AC (there has always been an issue with shaman and the leg slot) that is also not uncommon.  And plenty of fungus armor, which has similar stats, with some minor modifiers on it, off the fungoids.  And this zone is doable at 22-23, and good to 30 or so.  And the coin drop isn't too bad either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I recommend you spend a little time perusing AllaKhazam's equipment listings.  Probably the best way to do it is by equipment slot.<br />
<br />
Say you're looking for a new arm piece.  Go here (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/dyn/items/), select Arm (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/dyn/items/Arm.html) then select Shaman (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/listitem.html?sort=Armour+Class&amp;invslot=Arm&amp;cfilter=9&amp;statfilter=None) from the &quot;Narrow to Class&quot; dropdown- then press the &quot;Reload&quot; button on the right.  <br />
<br />
You'll get a list of every arm piece wearable by a shaman, with basic stats.  Click on the one you're interested in, and it will generally tell you what drops it, what quest you need to do to get it, or how much it costs (although you should treat the pricing data with suspicion.)<br />
<br />
This is a good way to begin to get familiar with the levels of equipment out there.<br />
<br />
Once you have some more specific questions, feel free to open threads.  The problem is that the &quot;What should I wear&quot; question is too big to answer... we need to know what your race, class, level, available money, current gear, etc. are before we can answer.<br />
<br />
Open a thread with &quot;I'm a level (whatever level) (whatever race)- here is my current gear (list current gear) and I have about (whatever money) to spend - what should I get?&quot; - then we can help you.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Slverwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">well, it seems that a shamys choics are rather open ended (unlike a rogues, whos choices are fairly straight forward) but i think i have a vague idea.  ty for putting up with my vague question :P this advice should keep me going for quite a few lvls.</div></div><hr />
