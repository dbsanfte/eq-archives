<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have had this problem for a couple of days.  OOW loads slow as heck once I get past Login screen.<br />
<br />
Additionally, often I will just lock up in many OOW zones - Walls, Noble's to name a couple.  <br />
<br />
Scan disc, de frag, run full file check, etc, it's only EQ.  May be my Net Gear router (again), but having the GM's move my stuck character 3 times a nite is getting OLD.<br />
<br />
(Sorry to put this here - but frustrated)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My group and I experienced major lag in the City Ruins of Dranik or something like that...someone in another group there said they had bad lag also. Was around 20% packet loss I think someone said. All I could tell was that when I started casting my spells they would take forever to finish and the group chat was lagging heavily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>iskarar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I stare more at the loading screen now then I do playing!  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm starting to hate that new zoning splash screen.  It reminds me too much of a Playstation or some other console game...<br />
<br />
Anyway, yeah, seems like a lot of people are having bad lag in OoW.  A few nights ago I camped one toon to log in a chanter bot for buffs, and logging the  1st toon back in took over 7 minutes! Rediculous!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gammink</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">New expansion, its bound to happen.  Just as it did with other expansions.  Im sure a maintenance patch or two will occur in the not to distant future.  A friend told me he was advised to delete EQgame.exe and eqclient.ini and repatch.  I havent personally tried this, but I may.  <br />
<br />
It is ridiculous that they rush out some of this stuff, but they are in a race to keep their subscribers.  Keep us or lose us.  It is cheaper to keep a user than to get a new one.  So these rush jobs are cheaper for them than getting new players.  BUT you also have to know that the longer a problem goes unfixed the more the expense to fix, compounds.  Therefore they will fix the critical stuff and let the semi-broken stuff (which possibly cause some of the lag) persist.</div></div><hr />
