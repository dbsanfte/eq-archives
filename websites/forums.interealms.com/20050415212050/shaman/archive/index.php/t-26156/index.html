<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gagbum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello,<br />
<br />
 I just started a second account and created a shaman to team up with my alts.   He is only level 1 now since I got called into work so I haven't had a chance to play with him.<br />
<br />
I on my main account I have multiple characters that are in differant level ranges. I am going to have to level him up the old fashion way in the begining basically solo until level 17 then he will be able to group with my level 31 mage and get exp.  After that I plan to group him up with my berserker which is level 41, my beastlord level 62 and finally my warrior which is level 66.  But he is mostly to group with my berserker and mage as I level them up.<br />
<br />
I was wondering when my shaman reaches the level of 60+ I plan to group him solely with my warrior to get exp by either soloing or grouping.  I was wondering if any of you here have expereince in a shaman and warrior dou can tell me if it is possible to get decent exp or aaexp?<br />
<br />

Also if anyone have any tips on how to two box please share since this is my first attempt on doing so.</div></div><hr />

Forget 2 Keyboards, monitors and Mice..   Use a KVM switch (http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=18102&amp;CatId=202) These allow you to use a hot key to swap beteen the two boxes..   I find it much easier then fumbling 2 of everything.</div></div><hr />

There are a lot of topics dedicated to it, lots of useful information buried there, make sure to use the search button or at least look up the threads linked in The Medicine Cabient in this post: http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=16123<br />

To answer your specific question, SHM/WAR is perfectly viable at 60+, probably one of the more effective two-box setups. Just keep in mind that Shamans spend a lot of their time hitting the Canni button, especially prior to Canni5, which slightly limits your two-boxing choices and/or efficiency compared to some other classes.</div></div><hr />
