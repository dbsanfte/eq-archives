<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dangoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I can pretty much kill any class in this game easy except one.  Shadow Knights.   I was wondering how other Rangers win duels vs them.  Biggest problem I have is their life taps for 270 hp over and over.<br />
<br />
Pure melees and Pure casters are very easy for me but hybrids are tough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>NeoTZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ok, Bazaar Arena setting.  <br />
<br />
SK's and Pallies are the best PvPers in an Arena Setting in the game.   You are fighting an uphill battle.  In either case, you have to do more than twice as much damage to then as they do to you.  Best weapon for this is a Tantor's Tusk, which you could use to out joust them,  But if they are as skilled as you are, then you probably don't have a chance.<br />
<br />
Although if you had 45AA points then you might have a chance... Though then they might have their holy steed in which you wouldn't stand a chance =P.   Best bet would be to fight them indoors heh.</div></div><hr />
