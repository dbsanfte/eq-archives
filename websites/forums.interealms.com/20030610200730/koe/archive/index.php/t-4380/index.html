<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mishlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know its been a while since you all have heard from me or even seen me. I also know that my parting took many by suprise and perhaps was not understood by all, myself included. <br />
<br />
I realize that I was allowing my real life issues and frusterations to bleed into the game (subconcously) and that was very unfair to everyone, including myself. I was not consous of it or I would have never let that happen. I think perhaps I was overlaying my real life problems onto events which transpired in the game, thus giving the game events more effects than they should. <br />
<br />
Since that time I have played in EQ very little but have turned to facing my demons of RL that I had been running from. With my new found time I have been able to spend much more time taking care of family and have looked up old friends to laugh about the past and to be there for each other in the future. I have found a caring woman and have vowed to just enjoy the moments I have with her and see where life will bring us instead of rushing into anything. <br />
<br />
I guess what I'm saying is I think I have found my center again and no longer feel as a boat listing in the water. I'm not sure that I will return to EQ as I like my new life now. I may come in from time to time just so I don't loose my skill and to  stay in touch with you my friends. If you would like feel free to drop me a line at freeman_de@hotmail.com<br />
I found that even after I left many of my friends in the keepers stayed true and where there for me even when I could not be for them, or even myself. All I can say from my heart is THANK YOU. My friends you will always have a special place in my  heart even if we do not see each other on a daily bases as before. Stay in touch as I care about each of you. <br />
<br />
On my search in the past few weeks I have found that some of my friends from the past (high school and college) have been called up and are standing in harms way for each of us. For them I post this message below. Merry Christmas and a bright new year to each if I don't see you before.<br />

With Love,<br />

&gt; &gt; &gt; 'TWAS THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS,<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; HE LIVED ALL ALONE,<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; IN A ONE BEDROOM HOUSE MADE OF<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; PLASTER AND STONE.<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; I HAD COME DOWN THE CHIMNEY<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; WITH PRESENTS TO GIVE,<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; AND TO SEE JUST WHO<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; IN THIS HOME DID LIVE.<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; I LOOKED ALL ABOUT,<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; A STRANGE SIGHT I DID SEE,<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; NO TINSEL, NO PRESENTS,<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; NOT EVEN A TREE.<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; NO STOCKING BY MANTLE,<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; JUST BOOTS FILLED WITH SAND,<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; AND ON THE WALL PICTURES<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; OF FAR DISTANT LANDS.<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; WITH MEDALS AND BADGES,<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; AWARDS OF ALL KINDS,<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; A SOBERING THOUGHT<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; CAME TO MY MIND.<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; FOR THIS HOUSE WAS DIFFERENT,<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; SO DARK AND SO DREARY,<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; THE HOME OF A SOLDIER,<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; NOW I COULD SEE CLEARLY.<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; THE SOLDIER LAY SLEEPING,<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; SILENT, ALONE,<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; CURLED UP ON THE FLOOR<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; IN THIS ONE BEDROOM HOME.<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; THE FACE WAS SO GENTLE,<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; THE ROOM IN SUCH DISORDER,<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; NOT HOW I PICTURED<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; A UNITED STATES SOLDIER.<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; WAS THIS THE HERO<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; OF WHOM I'D JUST READ?<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; CURLED UP ON A PONCHO,<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; THE FLOOR FOR A BED?<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; I REALIZED THE FAMILIES<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; THAT I SAW THIS NIGHT,<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; OWED THEIR LIVES TO THESE SOLDIERS<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; WHO WERE WILLING TO FIGHT.<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; SOON ROUND THE WORLD,<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; THE CHILDREN WOULD PLAY,<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; AND GROWNUPS WOULD CELEBRATE<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; A BRIGHT CHRISTMAS DAY.<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; THEY ALL ENJOYED FREEDOM<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; EACH MONTH OF THE YEAR,<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; BECAUSE OF THE SOLDIERS,<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; LIKE THE ONE LYING HERE.<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; I COULDN'T HELP WONDER<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; HOW MANY LAY ALONE,<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; ON A COLD CHRISTMAS EVE<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; IN A LAND FAR FROM HOME.<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; THE VERY THOUGHT<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; BROUGHT A TEAR TO MY EYE,<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; I DROPPED TO MY KNEES<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; AND STARTED TO CRY.<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; THE SOLDIER AWAKENED<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; AND I HEARD A ROUGH VOICE,<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;SANTA DON'T CRY,<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; THIS LIFE IS MY CHOICE;<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; I FIGHT FOR FREEDOM,<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; I DON'T ASK FOR MORE,<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; MY LIFE IS MY GOD,<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; MY COUNTRY, MY CORPS.&quot;<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; THE SOLDIER ROLLED OVER<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; AND SOON DRIFTED TO SLEEP,<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; I COULDN'T CONTROL IT,<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; I CONTINUED TO WEEP.<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; I KEPT WATCH FOR HOURS,<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; SO SILENT AND STILL,<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; AND WE BOTH SHIVERED<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; FROM THE COLD EVENING'S CHILL.<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; I DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; ON THAT COLD, DARK, NIGHT,<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; THIS GUARDIAN OF HONOR<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; SO WILLING TO FIGHT.<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; THEN THE SOLDIER ROLLED OVER,<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; WITH A VOICE SOFT AND PURE,<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; WHISPERED, &quot;CARRY ON SANTA,<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; IT'S CHRISTMAS DAY, ALL IS SECURE.&quot;<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; ONE LOOK AT MY WATCH,<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; AND I KNEW HE WAS RIGHT.<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;MERRY CHRISTMAS MY FRIEND,<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT.&quot;</div></div><hr />
