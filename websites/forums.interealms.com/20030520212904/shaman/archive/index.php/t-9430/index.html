<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>uglytobone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm level 52 and read the post about maxing defensive skills on seafuries.<br />
<br />
Any other noteworthy places that would be good for maxing defense?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">might try city of mist, I seem to remember those mobs where pretty weak, and its super easy to run away if you get in trouble.<br />
<br />
Neriak 3rd gate has some pretty weak mobs.  <br />
<br />
Cynderella by the pof portal hits pretty weak.<br />
<br />
Lower guk has some laughably weak hitting frogs also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Try Jaggedpine...a lot will be LB, some will be DB. The DB there are very close to being LB, and only a few have over a 100 max.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shizbiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Group in velks and get hit, its not that bad. The spiders are rogues just dont let them backstab you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Not sure if it's good at 52, but echo caverns was great for maxxing out defense in my 40s.. Many of the mobs will be light blue at 50-51 (not sure at 52 if it would be any good though).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Solo I would go to the JPF dropoff or OOT and fight seafurbies.  Both don't hit too hard and are dark blue.</div></div><hr />
