<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I keep having my LFG tag disappear went I log.  The LFG window still had the button marked as on but I know it is off.<br />
<br />

<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Loopi Loo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've noticed that both the lfg window and raid windows have been buggy since the patch. Just today we had to cancel a retro because the raid would not allow us to get the unflaggeds in after disbanding and reassembling the raid several times. Hopefully it will be fixed in this upcomming patch. &gt;_&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tanamil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ya I just mentioned something about that in the auction channel yesterday. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/lfg doesnt stay up after u zone u have to keep putting it up after every zone grrr i hate that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It used to stay up when you zoned. I bugged it as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i know /lfg used to stay up till u got a grp or logged<br />
it just started doing this after patch</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My channels have been really buggy again lately too.  Maybe coincidence or maybe it's all related to the server instability they just patched.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The problem I am having with the LFG is when I do a search for matches.  It gives me the message that x number of people found and to click on a name to send a message, but NO names show up.  Anyone else have this problem?</div></div><hr />
