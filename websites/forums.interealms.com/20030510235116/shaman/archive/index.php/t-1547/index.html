<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Arimae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, was wondering what you all think is the best tactic to use in exp groups on slowed mobs so the warrior can hold agro. I find myself using root constantly when encountered with this problem, wanted to hear better ideas ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just accept the fact that you're going to get aggro.  Stand next to the main tank, let him take a few swings &amp; then fire off your slow.  Don't run around like a pansy, just take your beating while the tank regains aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Have you tried Root? Oh, yes, you have. I'm out of ideas :-P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Arimae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Xatrei: actually i'm a ranger (sorry didn't make it clear) and was interested in what my 2nd fav class :) had to say about agro management. From reading another excellent discussion on using root, it sounds like there's not much choice for agro control.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I focused on AC items so that I could handle the beating.  If I don't want to get hit, I can root (if they don't summon) or just wait until later in the fight to cast slow.  Usually I just stand there and melee/jbb for a bit while the tank gets agro back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">ahhh - that's a bit different :)  <br />
<br />
Still the same basic principal though - unless the shaman waits until relatively late in the fight, he will more than likely draw aggro when he lands a slow.  Root can help with this as long as all the members of the group recognize &amp; understand the affect that root has on aggro.  I'm constanly suprised by the number of people that I encounter that don't seem to understand (or maybe they just don't care) that aggro is proximity based with rooted mobs.  I personally don't like to mess with rooting for aggro control except when in 2 or 3 person groups, or in groups of experienced people that I know and trust.   I usually just take my lumps and wait for the MA to regain aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I like having aggro, its so fun.  My ability to tank actually impresses alotta my group mates.<br />
<br />
ive been able to tank reds on occasion, though i do require more healing then our MT ;(<br />
<br />
At lvl 29 i tanked most of a Kunark rhino fight(ledge at OT).  He didnt like me for some reason /grin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">tank it or root, nothing else to do about it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Since you're a ranger it's simple:<br />
<br />
Take those nice procing weapons, and bag em. Buy 2 centi ls or wurmslayer/centi ls(2h? if you have a good one) for the larger fights. Jolt. Stop attacking if you have to. <br />
<br />
If it still hits you, find a MT that can taunt.</div></div><hr />
