<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>itchyban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My dear Dryads have gone green, and The Grey is not what it is cracked up to be, so I am considering camping assorted prisoners on the first level of PoJ. From what I recall, it is reasonably safe to stroll through the upper levels of PoJ as long as you don't poke at things. I also recall seeing hits against PoJ factions the few times in my early 50s we were able to take down a couple prisoners without being swarmed by rats.<br />
<br />
Question -- will mass killings of prisoners (hundreds, probably), as I level up to 58 and probably 59, cause faction problems in PoJ? Will these hits get me to the point where the first level (or deeper) is no longer &quot;safe?&quot; With flagging a major goal at 60 (pretty clear I need the level 60 DD and Banishment to up my DMG/s output for trials), I don't want to make things any more difficult than they need to be.<br />
<br />
Also taking suggestions on other spots for (solo) mage level-grinding at 57 and 58.<br />
<br />
TIA,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Megil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would not suggest killing these. it gets messy and from what i have seen its not that good exp.<br />
 <br />
Where i would suggest to hunt is Katta. these guards are easy, ok money, and good exp. I went from 55 to 60 off nathyn guards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Toddoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There is no faction of concern in PoJ. For Katta, there are several factions. Including two guard factions. The majority of the guards in Katta are on one faction. However, the guards in Nathyn's mansion and court yard are of their own faction. So, killing them will not interfer with movement in the rest of the city.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Delkain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I hunted these for a little bit, but with just root dot they were a pain.  should be no prob for you tho, with yer pet. <br />
<br />
Also, what they mean by naythen guards is there is a small mansion &lt;sp?&gt; in the town that has 2 sonic wolves in front of it.  these guys are also considered to be the evil guards because they don't hurt Shadow Haven faction.  Yes, the guards in SH are on faction with guards in Katta.  Anyway, to get them, go in from Tenebrous Mountains, go straight and take the first left through a gap in the walls down a tunnel.  it goes for a little bit and then hits another tunnel, right goes down stairs, left goes to another fork.  what you want is left, and then left again, BAM! they are right there as you turn.  &lt;what i mean by tunnel is those brick walls on either side&gt;  How I hunted was ran past the guards and wolves to the right side of the building as you face it.  should be between a wall and the building, little kiting area back there with no aggro.  Inside the building is a little hairy with adds, and there's a tempting treasure box to kill, but steer clear of it.<br />

Hope that helps ya itchy  -  Delk</div></div><hr />

Although my pet isnt nearly as strong as yours, it was a relatively easy place to exp at those lvls.  These days ME is virtually empty every time I've run through it on my way to Akheva or UP.</div></div><hr />
