<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is it just me or did GM events used to happen all the time?  I only know of three in the past 10 months or so (one of those was the frogs taking over Grobb).  It's not that I want them to come out and just give out items, but it seems like they have used the events to tell stories in the past.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Korsib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It is true.  GM events used to be a lot more common back in the day.  I myself used to guide, and I must say, there used to be a lot more GM events then there are these days.  I think one of the main reasons that Gm event numbers declined is that the stopped having GMs assigned to specific servers.  Made it a lot harder to get things going.  Seems like the only place where GM events are common are on Stormhammer  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've only seen two GM events on Tunare. The first was in S. Karana,<br />
escorting some gnome. Story was some eagle kidnaped his wife and<br />
kid. Tried to kill the eagle, talked with him, escorted gnome a couple<br />
of zones, found wife and kid under a bridge. That was it. ONE guy got <br />
like 10 gold pieces. The whole time I kept anticipating, waiting for <br />
SOMETHING to happen. It was a real let down. At least there were only <br />
about 20 players helping. <br />
<br />
The other was somewhere on Odus. Had something to do with dragons <br />
vieing for power. I couldn't follow the story, as there were a few <br />
HUNDRED people in the zone, ALL talking. <br />
<br />
One other I heard of had something to do with Firona Vie. After the<br />
last lag-fest event I had no interest. <br />
<br />
I'd like to see more NPC events, like the dwarves and the giants<br />
fighting. Those are fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vivyenne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Another problem is that Guides can't run quests in Luclin zones yet.  So they have to stick to old-world / Kunark.  When there's only 8 players in SK, 5 of whom are being PL'ed, it's not very good pickins for a quest.<br />
<br />
Then there's the high levels who show up to an event geared for level 20somethings in Lake of Ill Omen and nuke all the GM mobs, and those people who spam the zone with /shout and /ooc about how this is stupid and everyone is lame and .. omg I have to get in on that loot that dropped!  I saw a guy do that over and over in Dreadlands when animals were wreaking havoc all around .. how lame the quest was and how GM's suck, and then one dropped a FBSS and he started shouting how he did the most work out of everyone.  It's folks like that that ruin quests for other people, and are one main reason quests have slackened off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Asyth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ug that sounds naasty :/<br />
<br />
I hear tales from my guild mates about the old time GM events. . . I actually was involved in one. . but not involved as I didn't see a durn thing eheh. . . but aye the ooc and shouts sure were livly ahahah<br />
<br />
Halloween used to be the coolest. . I would love to see an all out serverwide holloween event :) Multi zone tageting diff  lvl groups . . . but gee that would require alot of work I know <br />
<br />
/em dreams on</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hmm seems we on MS have it good then as far as GM events go.<br />
Was a whole bunch and most where even fun (ranging from a fishing contest to Arena rumbles and all inbetween)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Asyth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">awwwwwwh /jealous</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">On FV, there have been three GM events in the past few months, I guess that's more than most from what I've read. One involved some sort of vampire good vs evil in the CoM (although it was kind of funny how I read about evil PC's trying to help the vampires, and getting killed in the process by them hehe). There was one in Everfrost which involved a ton of Ice Giants spawing, not sure of the story line. I forget the thirs one, it was about 3-4 months ago, but I definitely remember another on happening then. Of course, I missed all 3, no one seems to tell me anything when they happen :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I was involved with a GM event that went off well.  There was an ogre shouting out he wanted some tusks in SK and a ranger showed up asking for people to help hunt down the poacher.<br />
<br />
I took the ogre's side &amp; started quadding elephants over to him &amp; help nuking, some people tried to stop me &amp; lead the ranger over to us.<br />
<br />
Eventually the ranger banished the ogre and thanked everyone for helping them, not sure what he gave them but he gave me a ruby and sapphire for roleplaying.  Level 20-something wizzy that was darn handy, bought me my next round of spells.<br />
<br />
Those types of events are nice, need to see more of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>T'harkis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">&lt;3 stormhammer =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">About a month ago a few guides got together for did a Good vs Evil tourney in Areana (off lake rath).  Entry fee was 10pp per lvl.  Needless to say, the Good side w/ 4 EQ/AM3 rangers won.  Payout was about 1700pp.  <br />
<br />
Recently the top guild on Saryn (Heaven and Earth) has been doing PvP events in Bazaar.  Kill one of them and win 2k.  Kill the Guild Leader and get 20k (or something like that).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">About the only thing I hear of on Bristlebane now is some form of rumble in the Arena every month or so.<br />
<br />
I remember poking round in Oasis with one of my chars, beating up on crocs and caimen, when suddenly &quot;you hear a strange cracking noise&quot;  and there were HUNDREDS of crocs all swarming the shores.  Hatching time, doncha know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I liked the mass invasions(werewolves in wc for example), like what used to happen back in the day on the text based muds.<br />
<br />
They do them much better when they aren't trying to make them complicated. Spawn 300 of mob x in a zone, make the sky blood red like fear.<br />
<br />
Oh, no, I haven't seen many at all lately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">There was one in Oasis on SolRo, they spawned MASSIVE amounts of spiders, and everyone just an around ganking them. However...the named mob couldn't be hit by the higher level players, and some 30 something killed it and got A Treeweave off it or something...that was really awesome of the GM IMHO. Higher level players just shouldn't be able to run in and gank the mob everytime, I was really happy he placed a level restriction on who could attack him :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I remember.. prekunark I think<br />
I walked into Lavastorm with a low lvl character, thinking it would be fun to hunt some elementals...<br />
<br />
Bam! Hit by Icecomet from a GM controlled character at zone in... yay for GM events...<br />
<br />
<br />
in all honesty 99% of the GM events I've been to sucked.. the only 1 I've been to that was good.. was one where it happened quick, and only like 12 people were there.. all others get zerged to fast by a bunch of asshats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Only GM event I've seen recently was a huge success.  A GM came into the Gfay with some idiotic name I can't remember and tried to get players to listen to a story about Tunare.  <br />
<br />
Only person in the zone who seemed to care was some 40ish pally that wanted to try to gank the GM. (He tried to talk me into helping but I was in no mood to see the wrath of a GM up close and personal.)<br />
<br />
The GM finally tried offering lunch if anyone would come and listen but it didn't help.<br />
<br />
Too many players are jaded by horrible GM events for crap loot that can be purchased in the bazaar for far less work.<br />
<br />
I remember seeing something in a patch a few months back about some database changes making it easier to run an event but it doesn't seem to be getting used much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Apart from a few arena events about 12 months ago A Bayle (euro server) has no GM events ever. If they do happen then I assume they get no support as by 2 am GMT the server is basically deserted and that is US West coast main evening time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">There was one last week on Cazic-Thule, in Butcher Block. Only a small event - an Undead Queen declared war on the zone. She was fairly easy to beat down, but as usual about 20 high levels came in and killed the event within minutes.<br />
<br />
Best thing is, the GM came back after about 20 minutes as all the high levels had gone elsewhere. A 37 magician managed to take her down. She was summoning undead pawns and knights, and was untargettable for a multitude of spells. I never found out which spells actually hit, but the magician didn't have any problems. I, on the other hand, was useless against her.<br />
<br />
Lot of fun though. The whole zone suddenly came alive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Profundo Basso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The total lack of respect for GMs and guides is brought on by ... the lack of them and their focus on the wrong things.  I ran into one camping Siren's Grotto, looking for people using exploits.  But when Plane of Sky is broken, they are like nowhere to be found.<br />
<br />
The best GM event was the giant worm washed up on the beach of NRO and the worshippers that dropped low-level nodrop class specific items.  These lower level mobs kept spawning until someone killed the big beast, which reset the cycle.  I think that was linked to the change in Befallen, but I could be wrong.<br />
<br />
Halloween with huge skeletons in Qeynos Hills happened when my first char was lvl 4.  Got killed pretty quick.  Pretty scary.<br />
<br />
It would be nice to see Mayong Mistmoore back in action.  EQ mobs have such crappy AI that they have to do things like gate, mend and summon to make up for it.  Mayong was GM controlled and that rocked.  He was TOUGH and not just because he had lots of HP.<br />
<br />
I've been playing a lot this year and I haven't seen any GM events at all.  Heard of one in Dreadlands 9 months ago.  I assume Sony has taken this off the list of features (except for Stormhammer), because most players will never, ever see a GM event.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jendain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">i remember a few, over the past years...<br />
<br />
the halloween stuff, where NRo, EKarana, RMountains, WCommons, and probably some other zones got changed into a massive slaughterhouse with red sky and everything<br />
<br />
the LFay event which turned it into the &quot;evil&quot; version for a while<br />
<br />
and then the racewar rumble in the arena. humans / darks / shorts / elves. that was fun, and the human team won :p<br />
<br />
it's been a while though, i must be playing at the wrong times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Last GM event on Bertoxx that was when a guide was annoying a guildie because of his inspect message that an other guild petitioned (&lt;3 on bertoxx)<br />
Was very fun event, we had a blast..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tossen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">We had the Iksar vs Firiona Vie GM Event on The Rathe a few monthes back. You had to find one of the two GM's in the zone before the event began and get flagged for the &quot;dark team&quot; or the &quot;light team&quot; and then it was an all out invasion of Firiona Vie with hundreds of Iksar, player and npc alike trying to overtake the outpost. Sadly, we Iksar were outnumbered and fell to defeat. It was a great ervent, WAY WAY WAY laggy but with the 200+ people in the zone, that is to be expected.<br />
I really wish they'd do more of that kind of stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I think they should close a zone. Allow people to<br />
exit, but nobody else can enter the zone until<br />
the event is through. This would control the<br />
number and (through picking the zone) level of<br />
the players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">GM events have become rarer.. and I am glad.<br />
<br />
I remember GM events.   They were when the GMs killed you over and over.  Yah, that was fun.  There was rarely a story behind it, or if there was, you were dead before you could figure out what it was.  It definately did not add anything to my game experience to spend an evening dying repeatedly and waiting for it to be over so I could get my corpse back.<br />
<br />
It seems that they didnt figure out how to do a decent event until stormhammer -and now they ONLY do them there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>SilverD</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">There was actually a GM event on vazaelle last night in dreadlands.  Four dragon hatchlings appeared around KC named goreXXXX.  A couple of parties formed up (mostly high 40 low 50) and slowly took them out one by one.  Loot was nothing spectacular but decent.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">When I was a guide we used to run tuns of events, usually for mid level charaters. I loved root nuking players :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Shaben</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Participated in a fun GM event last night - Level 1 Gnome race from Ankanon to Ahkeva (spelling?) Ruins. I made it half way through ME before getting ganked in one punt!<br />
<br />
No idea if the winner got anything, but the party in the PoK (mage giving out summoned beer, fireworks and spin the bottle bottles) was fun!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Hehe that reminds me of the time I ran my GF level 10 druid out to ME to loot armor. That was a blast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Irda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">There was just a GM event on Fennin Ro... in Iceclad three mini griffons and a few turtles spawned (all level 60). It was short, but interesting. I don't know what loot there was, if any.</div></div><hr />
