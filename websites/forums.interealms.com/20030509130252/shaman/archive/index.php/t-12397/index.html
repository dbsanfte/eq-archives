When I got my first 20AA or so was when they said they were going to drop regen AA and all those other things because they said &quot;AA descriptions were unclear&quot;.  Anyway... I had to reput my AA pts into regen and was no biggy.  What I HAD was Regen3 Run1 Stam1 Wis1 (yeah yeah I know I put the pts into stam and wis before i was really thinking).  But NOW I have Run1 Stam5....The damn AA pts moved on me!<br />
<br />
Anyone else have this happen?  Oh and I am not talking to the GM about this because i'm still kinda pissy that they made me change my name.  **Yup over 3 years as Gorgos Gookrusher and now Gorgos Goo'Krusher so it doesnt look like Gook Rusher... W T F is a Gook Rusher I asked?!  Damn PC sissy jag off planet we live in now.  I told him to change me to:  Gorgos Da Krusher O' Da Goo.... but they said they couldnt do that.  :(  **<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">AA points were moved when AA Regen for trolls and iksar used be 2x the aa points.  For me having AA Regen 3 was like 6 regen points.  They nerfed the double regen and gave us our points back.  They also nerfed something for mages and gave them there points back.  It was during this time it happened.<br />

What is a Gook Rusher?  During Vietnam War the Vietnam people were known as Gooks.  I assume a Gook Rusher would be one of these people charging at you.  Get the point?  Somebody took offense to your name.</div></div><hr />
