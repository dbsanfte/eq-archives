<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LARRY</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Couple of questions....First ive gone full on enhancement so I can tank because I 2 box a Healing speced drood.<br />
<br />
My question is in a group if Im being used as the tank whats the best way to take and hold arrgo?<br />
<br />
I know rockbiter rules but in a group they all either want fire proc or wiindfury so it over rights rockbiter... <br />
<br />
I can and do use shock cause of the high arrgo but I seem to have to do it 2 or 3 times a fight... that along with 3 totems drains mana at a outrageous rate.<br />
<br />
Im level 38 atm and doing mostly SM and similar instances.<br />
<br />
Ive been looking at my Mail upgrades for when I hit 40 and it seems there is a real shortage of stam/int gear thats mail.... this is only going to worsen the problem... Im looking at loosing close to 20 int to upgrade my AC with all Mail equip...<br />
<br />
Thoughts and comments welcome!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Actually if you check my post further down I ask about weapon buffs and how/if they stack. What people are saying is that self buffs take precedence so you can use rockbiter and still drop windfury and you will have rockbiter and the rest of the group will have windfury. So use that and a shock when you need and you should be able to keep aggro fine. Also, don't go nuts on totems if you are killing at a decent rate. Drop windfury and snare and that's it unless special ones are needed. This will keep your mana up for shocks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">First of all, there is mathematical and anecdotal proof that Windfury produces higher DPS than Rockbiter. Look on the WoW shaman boards for the exact numbers. As soon as you get windfury you should be using that instead of rockbiter in all situations. Flametongue and Frostbrand are situationally useful when mobs are particularly high-armor and low-resists. But Rockbiter is obsolete.<br />
<br />
Also, I've found I rarely need to toss down three totems for every fight. Usually just one or two will give a helpful boost. When there is a boss, I will throw down everything in my arsenal, but if it's just isntance or group fighting, one or two totems do the trick.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for getting and holding aggro, prep by always having lightning sheild on yourself. When a pull is incoming, hit it with Earth Shock. Earth Shock has a much higher aggro than the other shocks. The mob should come to you. Once it starts hitting you and recieving lightning shield damage, it should stay on you until it dies, unless you have absolutely terrible melee damage. Toss in another earth shock when mana appropriates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">How does the DPS from Windfury translate into aggro/threat?<br />
<br />
Rockbiter is pretty explicit that it causes high threat.  I would say go with Rockbiter when tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Aye - Rockbiter has a built in taunt - use that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The additional dps Windfury creates generates enough threat to par with rockbiter. Then you have the advantage of greater damage.<br />
<br />
If you're holding onto your aggro with the 40-60 dps you're contributing with a melee weapon, you have a very lame group. Rockbiter adds so little it's unnoticeable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Disclaimer: this is just how it's been for the first 35 levels, maybe things change drastically later in the game.  *shrug*<br />
<br />
All parses aside, I can guarantee that I'll have aggro in all situations with rockbiter.  DPS and aggro are not as synonymous in WoW as they were in EQ.  With only windfury, the warrior (and rogue) can actually peel them off me regularly.  The taunt on that ability is NOT a joke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have to agree with LaughingWoman. Rockbiter holds aggro better for me than windfury does. Plus the DPS is comparable anyway though most say windfury has a slight edge. But if you can hold aggro with windfury only, great. Only I can say is try and it and see what works for you.</div></div><hr />
