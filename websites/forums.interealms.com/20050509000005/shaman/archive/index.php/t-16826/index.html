<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well good team is united under one flag now that 30 of the top members of Black Crown have left to join the Neutral Team.  In all honestly, it probably was the best thing to happen to the good team because they were taking quality players from us and reducing good teams raiding force.  My question is this, The neutrals have Vex Thal, the evils have the elemental planes.  Our drive is to EP, but we have to gear our members out.  The places we raid most are kael, ssra, PoP boss mobs... is there any place like Vex Thal or EP where we can get a huge # of items and farm them?(no competition for sites just 3 raiding guilds on sullon .. and anyone else is there from another team... we just push them out =) )  I have also heard that no one has made it to EP without farming VT first, is that true?  And if so, any ideas on how to get around it?</div></div><hr />

I don't think there really are any other &quot;loot bonanzas&quot; like VT/EP in EQ that can deliver large amounts of quality gear in one sitting.  Without access to those areas you really need to pop away at Luclin/PoP targets and then possibly reinforce those items with LDoN augs etc.<br />
<br />
You can definitely make it to EP with no VT, but it will be much harder on your guild than if you were to breeze through VT a few times prior.  The horde of Vengence, focus effects, and FT gear that VT offers will take some serious work to substitute.<br />
<br />
I am unsure how the politics are on SZ, but most guilds here seem to skip the bottom floor of VT and go straight for the big $$ mobs.  Bottom floor clean-up would still give you some nice items and possibly make your time easier elsewhere.</div></div><hr />
