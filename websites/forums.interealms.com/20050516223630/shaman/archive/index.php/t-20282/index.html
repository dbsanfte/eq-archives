<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Manson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OMG,<br />
<br />
When did I miss the Shaman maturity level nerf.  <br />
<br />
If all of you angry message posters would just take a brief moment, a deep breath and maybe a pill before you clicked submit you may actually figure out how irritating we look.<br />
<br />
I agree I would love to have SOE give us Shaman improvements!!!<br />
<br />
However even if a Sony representative did like the Shaman class, only  after a few seconds of reading our whiney posts he would grow to hate our complaining butts.  (these things are pretty tough to swallow)<br />
<br />
Please try to write our posts w/ our heads instead of our hearts.  I bet we would have SOE listening to us a little better.<br />
<br />
 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There's just as much heart put into fearful posts that we shouldn't say anything or stir the pot as in the posts that say everything and everyone stinks and is doomed for every so why don't we all just die.  One is as good as the next.<br />
<br />
One will make Sony reps feel better than another.  It's nice if they don't have to feel too bad about things, but on the other hand, they're getting paid for what they do -- all of us mental cases do our posting for free.  <br />
<br />
I doubt they're all flying around in Lear jets, but if they even have the job, I'm sure they either must be or should be used to people speaking their minds.  (Who else's minds are they supposed to speak, anyway?)<br />
<br />
I'm afraid there's no way for things to not get a little messy or unpleasant at times.  Any time you're dealing with the public, that's the way it goes - it's a strain, no doubt, as anyone who has ever done customer service knows.<br />
<br />
We should do our best to be cogent and be sure we give Sony something as concrete as possible to hang onto when they're trying to get an idea of what we want or need.  <br />
<br />
That their representatives won't get a bruised ego or have to wade through the occasional bucketload of poop, though, is unlikely given normal human nature.  I'm sure they wouldn't have been hired if they had no ability to do so, however.<br />
<br />
All we can do is cross our fingers and hope that everyone deals well with the crap -- not that there is no crap at all.  If it was ever appropriate at any stage of the game -- EQ or life -- to expect that there would be no poop to deal with, that time is long past.  People's passions are inflamed, and they're not machines -- we just have to life with it.  Hopefully everyone on both sides can make the best of it.<br />
<br />
But we can no more expect posters to be perfect than moderators, or Sony employees.<br />
<br />
Hopefully we can all have the graciousness and good will to do a little sifting and weather the bad stuff along with the good, and see what it is we can make out of it all that is productive.<br />
<br />
I think it's highly unlikely that such a large number of intelligent people will wind up having nothing good to offer each other.</div></div><hr />

See who posted it. And what Brenlo responded to?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">rule number 1 for a company representative: all that is said against the company is not against you.<br />
<br />
rule number 2: remain calm whatever happens, establish a dialogue with customers, analyse the situation, understand the claims of the customers, report the claims to the dev team within the company, notify the customers on the possibles solutions found by the dev team regarding the claims, enjoy the customers satisfaction on a well done negociation when the fix requested are granted.<br />
<br />
rule number 3: ignore the insults and keep the dialogue up with the customers whatever happens.<br />

I just hope SOE's representatives were trained a little before having them jump in the customers arena :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's not about maturity - that has nothing to do with why people are getting so annoyed. You can slap someone repeatedly and they can be mature or immature, but guaranteed there will come a time when they stand up and shout &quot;Enough!&quot;...<br />
<br />
And for someone so apparently intent on bringing out the less confrontational side of people, you couldn't have started your post much worse if you'd tried to.<br />
<br />
I, for one, would rather see calm and reasoned logic. But, as someone who has seen us beaten repeatedly, I feel the same level of annoyance and despair, and understand those people who are at least being true to themselves and venting it. <br />
<br />
The world is full of different people, they express themselves in many different ways, if Sony want to have them all as customers then I'm sure they're prepared for the variety of feedback they'll be getting. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">People are just frustraited, and need to let off some steam.  Sure some of the posts have degenerated into rants at time, but maybe a good ranted is needed every now and then.<br />
<br />
After the confirmation that the nerf on BoT was planned, and not a mistake,I personaly think that EQ devs need to hear our complaints, as they definatly do not see shamans in the same light as I see them.<br />
<br />
The squeaky wheel gets the grease.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Actually most of the rhetoric generated by members of the Shaman community is of a much higher standard than found on most game related boards or the Internet in general.  I used to read essays by mostly young adults for a living and I can tell you that communications on this board are fairly high quality.<br />
<br />
If you are equating complaining with immaturity then you probably have a problem understanding democracy and republican ideas that seem to be held in high esteem by most of the 6 Billion persons on the planet.  Elements of the game that are working well and are enjoyable to the players do not really require comment.  It is the less than perfect features that need feedback.  Why would you suppose that SoE actually puts mechanisms in the game to allow players to &#8220;complain&#8221; about bugs and other problems?<br />
<br />
In actuality SoE loves it when players &#8220;complain.&#8221;  Each complaint is free research and development.  Even the rare insult laden complaints may be helpful to SoE&#8217;s developers.  It is kind of like working with the genius programmer who is less than fastidious in the personal hygiene department.  You have to hold your nose but the end product is worth it.  As long as the majority of our discussions are relevant to the game mechanics the developers will hold their noses and keep reading.<br />
<br />
Shaman did not have any real problems for a long time.  As some have stated we have just not been scaled up relative to the game content.  This may give the illusion that Shaman of old were mature and Shaman now are whiners.  The fact is that we did not whine in the past because we had no reason, although some pretty wise folks did forecast that we would be in trouble if steps were not taken.  <br />
<br />
Continue to lobby for your class folks.  Do not listen to those folks who think the divine right to rule was a good doctrine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Spineless?<br />
<br />
What should I tell you in a PM? It irks me to see you talking about how the Crucible used to be a &quot;calm&quot; place, when you weren't even around for the heated debates back when Sam or even Eduin were lobbying for this class. <br />
Since you joined these boards, you have quit about 12 times, clustered these boards with useless threads gaining 1k posts in what? The first 6 months? <br />
Yet you post like one of those old timers who talks to the young kids with the voice of reason.<br />
Reading your posts has time and time again shown me what level of understanding you have about Shamans and EQ in general. Many times you have been rambling like a madman about stupid things just to state how you feel your class is perfectly fine the next day.<br />
<br />
I have said everything I had to say.<br />
<br />
For the record and more on topic: <br />
<br />
I am very emotional and when I see crap I call it ****. Back in the day you had Sam and Eduin being just as emotional. That said, I am not telling people to be like me, nor do I think the way I am posting is getting me more attention or anything. <br />
I do like the calm and patient way of posting Tudamorf had or VeeshanMurtak has now, but people need to realize that some of us have getting shafted and have foreseen **** like this for years. If you are very emotional, you end up venting over things like these, because of the constant naysayers who have been getting us where we are now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>hillaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I wish calm would work but sony has proven time and time again the only way to get anything out of them is through anger.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">but people need to realize that some of us have getting shafted <br />
<br />
Not an attack but...  How can some people be getting/have gotten shafted playing the same class as another who is/has not?  Unless you are talking about personal problems you/others have had that was not a class issue.  If it is the later then I can somewhat agree with what you have stated.  Now I know weather or not I agree or disagree with you doesn't make a lick of difference, I am just asking you to clarify that bit or your post.  Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">but people need to realize that some of us have *been* getting shafted<br />
<br />
Quoted myself to correct the sentence adding the missing word.<br />
<br />
What I mean is that some of us have actually been playing this game for much longer than others and painfully experienced the slowly nerfing of our class day after day. Opposed to those, who started in Velious, Luclin or even later, who are just experiencing the final degrading of this class with GoD, but have been those holding us back, when some of us were foreseeing the direction the game was taking and the direct impact this would be having on the Shaman class.<br />
<br />
Hope this clarifies my sentiments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I don't think there's any need for us to turn on each other.<br />

In the past Abashi, and then Absor, chose (or were told) to adopt the role of the Devteam's trained parrot.  That lead to them losing all credibility as they made statements that this or that was fixed, working as intended, classes were balanced, spell drop rates were ok, because a bloke on the Devteam said it was - when hundreds of thousands of people actually playing the game knew damn well it wasn't fixed, it wasn't balanced, drop rates were way off etc.<br />
<br />
It now appears that Brenlo is taking the same route and is paying for it with the same contempt that his predecessors got.  SoE needs to realise that their primary interface with the players must adopt the role of the player's advocate.  He doesn't work for the Devteam, he works for us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good customer service is rare.  You've hit a nail on the head IMHO Crusty.<br />
<br />
It would be nice to have someone that sounded like a straight shooter, and thought he was working for the customers instead of a particular department or sub department of the company.  <br />
<br />
I encourage Brenlo to continue posting here, and I defiantly admit that customer service positions in general are very stressful. Its easy to say thing that can me misconstrued, or taken the wrong way. I also have to say Brenlo, that telling your customers that their concerns are not valid, but only &quot;class envy&quot; seems like a poor strategy for a customer service position.  If I had done something like that at a former CSR position I had held for AT&amp;T, my manager would have called me into his office for a talk.  <br />
<br />
There does seem to be a disconnect between what shamans think we need, and what the devs think. Brenlo, you could really help calm folks down around here if you came on and explained why Sony thinks that shamans need more nerfs (aka BoT cost increase) instead of a healing boost, like almost every other class that could heal received in some shape or form. We would not be as worried if we understood things from a dev’s perspective. You could make us understand the direction that Sony sees for the shaman. It does seem to many shamans that our class has been actively nerfed through game design such as slow mitigation, or passively nerfed through increasing the challenge of game content without giving the shamans any increased skills, or scaling old skills upwards to remain in balance. There does seem to be a long period where Sony ignored our class. I hope that you will end this Brenlo, but please understand that some of us are a little uptight and nervous about things, and will take comments such as “whats a shaman” the wrong way.  You can do a lot of good here with a couple posts Brenlo, I’m looking forward to hearing more from you.</div></div><hr />

I played a rogue way back in the day and was quite happy to see the imporvments the class recieved time and time again, until they were finally a rather powerful class.<br />

Always kissing up to SOE got us where we are now. A couple of visits from a representative from SOE got us where we are now.

Many are still here, but have just grown tired of repeating themselves to people with the emotional maturity of a preschooler.  Logical statements are met with kneejerk gainsaying, obfuscation, escalation, and strawman arguments.  Oh, and let's not forget the personal attacks.<br />
<br />
As pointed out, this board has a good number of deep thinkers.  It's sad that the flamers have made the signal-to-noise ratio so poor, and even worse when people who do have a valid point to make choose to do so in an immature manner.<br />
<br />
Brenlo's stated on other boards that threads with flaming and personal attacks are highly unlikely to ever see his name attached.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, that kinda rules out most threads longer than 3 posts here and at Monkly Business.<br />

<br />
I've seen time and time again the most knowledgeable posts about the game right here on the crucible.   Posts not only about the class but about the game in general.  There is a reason why I play a shaman and a reason why I keep coming back to this board.  And that is the people.<br />
<br />
Yes people like litgruv and ontime posters from other class boards pull us all down into thier little tiny arguments and daily fluxuations between love and hate of this class, but overall there are more people spreading good information and having great discussions.  And you know there is a problem when these people get upset and go ballistic.  Because I know they are intelligent and see the game from all angles I know that there is a real problem, and I back them and defend them when they move out into actually trying to SOLVE the problem.<br />
<br />
You people saying 'shut up' and '**** you whiners' are doing nothing.   Promoting no discussion over a discussion with a little bit of passion is lazy, hypocritical and demeaning to others who spend their free time trying to improve everyone's gameplay.<br />

When i did come here this forum was how i said it. The respectable people where clam thoughtful and reasonable. What i dont see is any of those right now. I see a front page of threads going, and i quote, &quot; the sky is falling, oh woe as me we will never get anything, /cry /cry. This coming only days after a SoE, after slience for so long, finaly comes in here and says they are going to look at things. Not maybe, not have been, but WILL. Now you can believe it or not, no one is saying you have to kiss the ass of anyone or believe SoE word is so believable that the war is over. But is it so hard to shut up for a week and just give them a chance? Do we really need to freak out like everyone has been? What can i say, its getting old and like you claim to be &quot; when i see **** i call it **** as well. Sue me for getting frustrated with the whining when i dont see a need for it YET.<br />
<br />
My point is that they finaly after all this time talk to us and we wanna go nuts on them. Why in the hell would anyone want to talk to you if your just yelling and screaming and degrading them. If you were one of my customers i would be prompt to tell to take your business else where and have a nice day.<br />

You just prove how little you know. Im going to explain this to you 1 last time, see if you can and hear me this time, cause this claim against me is invalid and your just making yourself look stupid by saying it.<br />
<br />
You claim i posted here to get my posts to 1k for a avatar. Well guess what smart guy, i never knew there was a icon thing here till someone accused me of posting alot to get it. Where is my icon now smart guy? Where is my custom title, jesus man i didnt even have a sig till recently. Use your brain dude, i know you have one.<br />
<br />
By you bringing this up over and over you show your disillusion to who i am and why im here. The only time i posted alot here was when i was from work and GOOD LORD HELP ME it wasnt always about shaman material. I tried to bring jokes and entertainment to liven up the board cause there is only so much shaman info. <br />
<br />
If i was spaming to get to 1k  why did no mod ever stop me from posting? Why was i never banned?  Thnx, now lets move on.<br />
<br />

Me talking like a vioce of reason has nothing to do with what shaman i am or my /played time. Its who i am or should i say who i try to be. Just cause its not like you doesnt make me a madman or lessen my information any. <br />
<br />
Your opinion of my class knowledge is valid, but incorrect. Your view is different then mine at times cause sometimes im coming from a different level of game play, sometimes im not. So to you anythign that doesnt agree with you is the bleeting and rambling of a madman, but guess what, they are very valid, just not complementory to your view. This is where we butt heads so directly i think. I am willing to listen to other sides then the one that affects me. While you, in every example i can think of, chose to attack whats not like you in a attempt to eliminate it so that everything can fit your world view.<br />
<br />
<br />
For the record and more on topic: <br />
<br />
I am very emotional and when I see crap I call it ****. Back in the day you had Sam and Eduin being just as emotional. That said, I am not telling people to be like me, nor do I think the way I am posting is getting me more attention or anything. <br />
I do like the calm and patient way of posting Tudamorf had or VeeshanMurtak has now, but people need to realize that some of us have getting shafted and have foreseen **** like this for years. If you are very emotional, you end up venting over things like these, because of the constant naysayers who have been getting us where we are now.<br />
<br />
<br />
I can understand and relate to that Giac, so much more then you know.  Let me break it down as best i can.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is a difference from emotional and being unreasonable. Its one thing so get anger and voice your opinion, but its another thing to hold your breathe and stomp your feet like a child. There is a fine like from intense and emotional communication and bitching and whinning.<br />
<br />
I feel that whats going on here lately is beyond the realm of showing frustration and venting. Its in the realm of unreasonable tantrum throwing. Blinded and unheading negitivity too each other and everything going on. <br />
<br />
What i see is people talking and communicationing trying to solve something then having someone come in and just lay into them calling them stupid and retarded and even threatinging with physical violence. <br />
<br />
<br />
Seriously Giac, can we atleast agree that this game is not worth a fist fight?<br />
<br />
Anyway, as i type this i realize 1 thing. Nothing is going to change you or certain things. never will you be able to look past your incorrect ideas that im just a spammer, never ill you see how much i care for this game and my class and never will you take the time to understand what i do for my server, this game and the people around me. So i leave you with that.<br />
<br />
But to just finalize something. You believe i have nothing to offer and that my oppostion to your opinions and others is unsupported and invalid. But my inbox would beg to differ with you. Especialy the ones that thank me for &quot;taking the heat cause someone needs to stand up to them&quot;. <br />
<br />
I guess when i look back thats who i always been. &quot;The heat taker&quot; lol. <br />
<br />
I bid you good day. If you got anything else to say or if anyone else wants to flame me, attack me, disagree with me, then send me a tell in game. Cause its so reasy to throw stones when your  not face to face with someone. I dare you to get to know me then decide if im useless.<br />
<br />
Peace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">But is it so hard to shut up for a week and just give them a chance?<br />
<br />
How long have people been trying to, in a CIVIL manner, get the attention of those who can make appeals for improvements to the shaman class? Many of the elders here are extremely intelligent, just as some of the newer folk are. The &quot;back when the elders&quot; stuff is bull**** bro, I'm not even close to an older member and I was here before you were (by only a month or so, but my point stands). We've lost some gooduns (Before my time, and after), but we've also gained some gooduns. <br />
<br />
SoE had their chance(s), and Brenlo coming here is a very good sign. But can you really expect some of the more zealous people to trust Brenlo/SoE/Whoever 100% after all this time? We didn't bitch, we did our best to keep our requests respectable (discounting the flagrant trolls/idiots that sometimes spout off). After all this time, we are FINALLY seeing some real progress, which is great. Yet you still can't expect the more frustrated to let go of their grudges and anger just because we were acknowledged by SoE in the manner of a few posts.<br />
<br />
Brenlo coming here is just awesome, and if you focus on only the intelligent posts, there is still a LARGE amount of helpful content here at the Crucible. Brenlo can pick out and ignore the idiots, we weed through them all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Well let me clarify, it wasnt meant to imply that everyone here is a monon that cant stay calm or come up with a reasonable thought. Looking back i can see how it was taken that way. I meant to address the overflowing nature of poster/repliers that seemed to follow a trend here lately. Nor did i mean to imply that its only &quot;us uber/old posters&quot; that have anything to say. My only implementation of time was from when i got here to now, never did i state that i am here longer then other people and that im so much better cause of it, when i said &quot;old shaman&quot; i was speaking of the general board mentality, no individual shaman. We used to look at the druids and go, OMG look at those idiots flaming and arguing and fighting with each other. Infact just the opposite, its the &quot;uber then thou&quot; attitude of certain people that irk me off that think just cause they were here when such and such happened or so and so was here that i makes their opinion suddenly more valid. Its BS. <br />
<br />
Obviously there is alot of people i respect here so i just wanted to clarify that. Otherwise i wouldnt be here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">When I started reading the Crucible, and much later mustered the courage to even start posting, this messageboard was a much smaller community, but even then there was certainly the ocassional negativity, rash posts, whinings and outright hysterical posts. <br />
<br />
Yes, the amount has increased steadily over the years, I'll agree to that. This could very well be because negative, rash, whiny and hysterical people have been drawn to the shaman class. Or it could be a byproduct of Verants (and later SOE's) ineptitude at communicating and servicing their customers. There is some metaphor with a camel that would go well in here, but I forgot how it went.<br />
<br />
Sometimes when trying to communicate with V/SOE it just seems like you have to scream to make your voice heard above the static whining.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm not going to hazard a guess at which it is. I'm only a rocket scientist, this psychology stuff scares me.</div></div><hr />
