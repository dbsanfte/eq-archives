Amen. A shame that it's so painfully evident.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, while they are incompetent at even the simple things, let's also observe that the really good things about the game are emergent behaviours - things not designed in (as if a moron like Brad can design), but which arise unbidden from the interplay between the rules.<br />
<br />
That's why the players keep beating the encounters, and having fun, and why the designers have no grip on the consequences of their actions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When VI put in the hate reduction component of the slowing spells, you people referred to it as 'patch coding' and said that instead of 'fixing' the code, they'd just add more duct tape to it. Now that they 'fix' the code, everyone's saying that it's a sad day that VI nerfed Shadowknights.<br />
<br />
This change should also adjust the amount of aggro chanters get when they tash. The amount of aggro we get when we cast Insidious Decay and Plague of Insects.<br />
<br />
Shadow Knights still have a number of other taunting spells, such as Shadow Vortex. Not that I particularly care. If I die less on raids cos of this change to disease counters, then the fact that SKs, a broken class at the very best anyway, can't taunt doesn't bother me one whit.<br />
<br />
It's times like these, when people change what they want day to day, that I don't blame Verant for appearing to ignore us. When we do get what we ask for, we turn around and demonstrate that he had no clue what we wanted to begin with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Kinda funny to see Eoin bashing VI in this thread, when in &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1053&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; thread Eoin had the following to say:<br />
<br />
&lt;blockquote&gt;Hate reduction doesn't get its own resist check, so this won't make the slows easier to resist. But ya gotta admit, this is a textbook example of how Verant treats EQ. It's like an old junker car that they just keep patching and rigging instead of actually fixing, and we still drive it cause we don't want to walk. <br />
<br />
First, slow generated X hate and was a dispel-only buff. <br />
<br />
Then, they decide (for good reason) that slows should be curable without having to dispel everything until you hit them. To accomplish this, they add disease counters to the spells, allowing them to be cured like any other counter-based spell. An unforseen (but not unforseeable) consequence of this is an increase in the hate generated by the spell. Now slow generates X+200 hate. <br />
<br />
Finally, to correct the hate problem, they add a hate reduction effect to the spells. So now, instead of: <br />
<br />
Turgur's Insects, Level 51, Shaman <br />
Reduce attack speed from 66% (L51) to 75% (L60). <br />
<br />
we have something like: <br />
<br />
Turgur's Insects, Level 51, Shaman <br />
Reduce attack speed from 66% (L51) to 75% (L60). <br />
Add 16 disease counters. <br />
Lower caster on target's hate list by 200. <br />
<br />
because, God knows, actually reworking the way counters generate hate would be waaaaaay too much work for them. I guess we'll have to start paying $20 a month for that. &lt;/blockquote&gt;<br />
<br />
Hey Eoin! For only $10 you actually got what you requested, yet you continue to bitch and slam Verant. I guess some folks just aren't happy unless they're miserable...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kieran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">&gt; Hey Eoin! For only $10 you actually got what you requested,<br />
<br />
Bahrimon, I can only guess you don't program for a living. Breaking SK taunt to fix us is not a solution, the same way that adding taunt reduction was not, nor ... and because it's still not right, we can expect to have things broken AGAIN while they clean up this attempt.<br />
<br />
Those of us who do write software for a living see this kind of thing all the time from novices, the kind of people who live by cut-and-paste-and-edit rather than careful design. It also speaks volumes about the state of the code that so many things break or revert every patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Eoin wanted, specifically, to have hate on disease counters fixed.<br />
<br />
What options are there? Lower the hate or raise the hate.<br />
<br />
Or are you suggesting that they make it so counters cast by shamans have no aggro, while those cast by Shadowknights do? Maybe make disease counters A and B, and when you cast a spell with counters on it, you can click A for ones that aggro and B for ones that don't.<br />
<br />
Consistancy is next to godliness. Ideally, Verant would now look at SK complaints and add some sort of aggro component to their spells. An easy and sensible fix. And I wouldn't be surprised if VI did this within the next few patches. However...<br />
<br />
...Eoin said that he wanted the hate on counters adjusted. Period. They did as requested. Now the SKs are screwed over. If Eoin were in charge, though, it's clear from his quoted statement that adjusting aggro from counters is precisely what he would do. Yet here he is, his demands met, and he's still angry.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry. I'm not a VI ass-kisser in general, but this thread is just demonstrative of how harsh people are on them. They simply have no chance of ever doing anything right in the eyes of 99% of their 'constituants'.<br />
<br />
And no, Kieran, I don't program for a living. I write corporate contracts and related legal briefs for a living. Which is why I can appreciate the being in a situation where you can only please so many people and no matter what you're going to piss someone off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they don't &quot;test&quot; on test server what do they do?<br />
<br />
Test is a test server as much as any other server is.  People like Nixx ruined the test server.  They all caught the uber bug.  Cried when they had to do a server wipe, etc.   I mean hell, it's a TEST server, people playing on it should look at it as much instead of worrying about the next uber loot they want.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For these high level mobs, higher end gear is pretty much a requirement. Especially for a guild like Nixx's that doesn't have huge amounts of people in the first place.<br />
<br />
That said, there's no reason they still couldn't do a reasonable amount of testing on it, they just seem to not bother.<br />
<br />
-Valka/Xegony<br />
<br />
ps. something tells me they will backpedal on this latest hate fix. the band-aid fix they had last time was silly, but it was at least functional.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">He has a point. It takes such an insane amount of time and effort from multiple players to get high end gear, that no testing can be done on test. It takes their server population just as long as any other to level up. <br />
<br />
The reality is that Legends is the real test server. Lots of free goodies and new high end content and no wipes. The added bonus is that folks pay more to beta test.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Tyric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">It would seem the obvious fix in this situation is to simply give Disease Cloud more disease counters to take the aggro it provided up to pre-patch levels...</div></div><hr />

When VI put in the hate reduction component of the slowing spells, you people referred to it as 'patch coding' and said that instead of 'fixing' the code, they'd just add more duct tape to it. Now that they 'fix' the code, everyone's saying that it's a sad day that VI nerfed Shadowknights. <br />
<br />
<br />
Ok - Analogy time:<br />
<br />
You rent a house.  One day the landlord decides to put in a shower for you (moving slow to a 'disease').  In doing so he makes the tap leak (Stupid Aggro).  Obviously you complain about the tap.  As a temporary measure he fixes the leak with a piece of tape(Hate reduction) .Now he comes back and fixes the tap, but now whenever you flush the toilet it spills on the floor (SK's taunt ability nerfed), and you expect us to be happy about this?<br />
<br />
I would be very happy with the slows moved to disease if it didnt stuff up something else.  That is why people complain - it is because Verant can never do one thing without breaking another.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">That wouldn't help anyway because disease counters don't seem to be adding ANY aggro at all. So adding an extra 50 of them wouldn't make a difference.<br />
<br />
The thing that makes me laugh is all the people saying &quot;If they really coded they'd do blah-blah.&quot;<br />
<br />
They're dealing with, what... 5 year old code that's been in patching from almost day one (because people like to exploit things... daggar quest anyone?), and gone through multiple explansions, etc, etc.<br />
<br />
The whole thing makes perfect sense to me (and I DO code. So ner).<br />
<br />
- Can't cure slows... add a counters to cure.<br />
- Counters make mobs really REALLY mad... make them less mad (neg hate).<br />
- That doesn't work so good... remove hate from counters.<br />
- ClassA can't taunt with counters anymore... add hate.<br />
<br />
They can't just code up some fancy new type of counter and slap it on without making a TON of changes to the existing code (and in turn breaking a bunch of other things). So you just solve the problem step by step. You can't forsee every possible problem, and I don't doubt they ran it on the Test server, but it just so happened that in the few days testing no SKs said &quot;Why can't I taunt with Disease Cloud?&quot;<br />
<br />
The game is big. They can't test it all. I'm sure they try.<br />
<br />
Also, in all my dealings with the customer support I've never had to wait more than 10-15 minutes to get a guide or GM. They've always been nice about whatever my problem was and I've had it fixed almost immediately.<br />
<br />
To sum up everything I said I'll fall back on a good quote from Gabe from PA.<br />
<br />
&quot;The worst part about multiplayer games is that you have to play them with other people.&quot; <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Breaking one classes spells to fix another is not an option that should even be considered. And I don't think I'm alone in believing that. I would rather our slows go back to not adding disease counters at all then leave them this way, removing one of the spells that was used to save my Shaman on numerous occasions. <br />
<br />
I know they're trying to fix code that is extremely old, the problem that I and a lot of other people have with them constantly doing this is that they don't comprehend all of the side-effects. I really doubt that they intended disease dots and PoI to become extremely low agro. That's a game altering change, an unannounced one. One that wasn't explained away by Absor on the SK boards. One that hasn't even been mentioned on the developer's corner boards.<br />
<br />
So, yes, they can't win in this situation. They screwed up. The age of the code doesn't matter. They should have done internal testing with all spells that add disease counters, not just the slows. It would seem logical that would be part of their process don't you think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Chkorsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">ahem<br />
<br />
shadow vortex isn't as good as it was for agro :p<br />
<br />
it got &quot;fixed&quot; when the enchanters got less agro on debuffs.<br />
<br />
disease cloud is a mana efficient taunt. or rather. was :p<br />
<br />
other taunt spells are clinging darkness (snare/dot) and heart flutter. <br />
<br />
asystole is only an option when you are lvl 60 :)<br />
<br />
it doesn't take away the fact that they broke our best taunt spell by fixing someone else's problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Kieran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">The real problem here is that the decision to use disease counters at all was completely flawed. And also equally inevitable. There's a big difference between changes that require code changes (particularly to a codebase that is probably in a fairly advanced state of decomposition by now) and those that are done by using the content tools.<br />
<br />
The original aim was to make slows different from other effects that were dispelled using the &quot;cancel magic&quot; line, and to make them removable some other way. This could have been done in many, many ways.<br />
<br />
The exact &quot;right&quot; way depends on internal implementation details of the spell system in the server. The &quot;cure&quot; spell effect could have been changed to recognise slows as curable directly, or else some new kind of effect could have been added like disease counters (as curses are separate) and coded to have no taunt effect. Whether a proper solution would have had any effect that we could see in the spdat is debatable since we don't have access to the server-side code.<br />
<br />
Using the existing content tools and shoehorning things in to use the &quot;disease counter&quot; mechanism was a hack to avoid having to explicitly code anything to meet the new design goal - coders being a rare and expensive resource. Since all the existing spell effects have existing side-effects that are being relied upon, we have the domino effect of unforseen consequences that we've got to observe first hand.<br />
<br />
Proper testing would have helped identify the fact that the &quot;quick fixes&quot; don't work, but then they would have had to face up to the cost of doing the job properly in the first place, which was what they were trying to avoid.<br />
<br />
P.S. Bahimiron, being a lawyer you can no doubt sympathise with the idea of professional conduct and responsibility. Consider that as one reason why those of us who are customers and in the software business (who would like to see programming be more professional) aren't particularly amused by VI's way of doing things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Bahimiron sez: Hey Eoin! For only $10 you actually got what you requested, yet you continue to bitch and slam Verant. I guess some folks just aren't happy unless they're miserable...<br />
- Do you work in the software industry? Going by your comments, I am sure not. I do. If I have made a minuscule fraction of the number of bugs VI has introduced in a commercial product, I would be long time fired. There is no excuse for bugs like these. None. <br />
<br />
The simple facts are:<br />
(1) Verant has no clue about their game (The recent disease counter spells that screwed SKs).<br />
(2) Verant employs the most incompetent programmers (So let's add hate reduction on slows! Oh wait, what happens if you resist it?).<br />
(3) Verant has NO Quality Assurance testing (Bard instrument saga #14232).<br />
(4) Verant has NO source control. (Oh look, Sleeper's Tomb is back to warders, CT back to level 30).<br />
(5) Test server is just another server where people can get freebies and nothing is tested. (Why wasn't this patch on test for at least 2 weeks?)<br />
<br />
<br />
Bahimiron sez: What options are there? Lower the hate or raise the hate. <br />
- It's more complicated than that. Poison/Disease spells are made of 2 things: Spell + Counters. Each giving a certain ammount of aggro. If you lower aggro for counters then YOU WILL impact other spells also, because many spells share the common &quot;object&quot; being the disease/poison counter. Wich has happend with SK spells, and I bet necro disease dots and whatnot. If you lower aggro for the initial spell (Tugrur for instance) then you only affect that spell. But VI employs monkey coders, so that is too much to ask from them.<br />
<br />
Valka sez: Um, call me crazy Warador, but how the **** do you TEST the high end game if all the people on the server turn up naked every few weeks? <br />
- Take a page out of UO's book of doing test servers. When I quit UO 2 years ago, you could log onto test, type a few commands and you got a maxed out character. VI should do same. Then add NPC vendors that sell every possible equipement for 1cp each. Then take a page out of DAoC's book, and incite players to actually TEST on the server. It can be done, it was done in the past. Oh and there hasn't been a wipe on Test server for a long long long time, and also, another page from DAoC's Test Server book: never wipe Test server.<br />
<br />
Kieran sez: Using the existing content tools and shoehorning things in to use the &quot;disease counter&quot; mechanism was a hack to avoid having to explicitly code anything to meet the new design goal - coders being a rare and expensive resource.<br />
- They should have made normal Remove Curse drop from more than one single mob. They should have flagged all slows as curses. But you are correct, using exisisting elements in the game can have bad sideffects, as we've seen it with aggro attached to it.</div></div><hr />

They make mistakes. When it comes to software errors, I will 95% of the time give them the benefit of the doubt. <br />
<br />
I'm certain there are a number of programmers out there. Someone in my own guild works for EA Sports. However, programming driver AI in NASCAR Legends is nothing compared to programming in a game where thousands of people are playing all the time, all of them with their own opinions of how things need to be done. Believe it or not, when you're stopping up one hole in the dam, it's very easy to forget that another hole might open up over here. Beeg has it right. You fix things one step at a time, and eventually it's 'perfect'.<br />
<br />
As for the SKs who are upset about losing their taunt, I'm gonna have to make a few quotes from my board. One SK posts angry that SKs have been 'nerfed'. He's really upset. Here are some responses from other SKs. Pardon the spelling from one of them, he's from Germany and English is his third language.<br />
<br />
Belgarathe, level 60 Shadow Knight:<br />
<br />
&lt;blockquote&gt;i never jused cloud because even if the dot sucksit makes mob changing impos as is to mutch mana fyi not juseful shadow vortex = good taunt and gives you ac and you can chang mobs this will not make SKs lesser in taunt cause we still have uber agro on Harm touch if it gets close to loss agro shadow vortex best taunt spell and gives best output&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br />
<br />
Dabun, level 56 Shadow Knight:<br />
<br />
&lt;blockquote&gt;If I'm taunting I use both shadow vortex and disease cloud. Even tho DC is/was great Shadow Vortex pretty much a huge taunt. If you need something extra use clinging darkness. I've never had a prob ganking aggro at all.<br />
<br />
Anyways, if you ARE the main tank then most likely you're in a group with a chanty. That makes mana cost a non factor. The only disadvantage is that shadow vortex takes a buff slot. One more thing....disease cloud is dangerous to use in places like the hole, where you have to sometimes switch targets cuz of unmezzability. Vedar, almost every sk in this guild is mad old school. We all know how much DC was useful, but its not something I'm gonna cry about when there are other options that can and will get the job done. /feedback it when you log in and see how it goes from there&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br />

Willahm, level 60 Shadow Knight:<br />
<br />
&lt;blockquote&gt;I don't need a lvl 9 spell to make or break me. If you did, sucks to be in your group. =(<br />
<br />
I love my class, everyone that groups with me knows it, can tell it, and asks me back, and I haven't memmed DC since what... lvl 22?<br />
<br />
No reason to get worked up over piddly **** like this...&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br />
<br />
Now, this is only the opinions of three Shadow Knights, but they comfort me with their opinionation that this really isn't that big of a deal. Perhaps their wrong. Honestly, I can see the point made by Kieren. There really was no need to make it disease. Hell, it could have been Curse counters. Use that lame-ass Luclin convention that's been miserably mishandled so far. I just don't think that this is really worth getting that upset over, though. VI was trying to make us happy, and they goofed up. Have a little faith that they'll fix it. They fixed it to make it curable, they fixed it to make it less taunting, and I imagine they'll fix SKs to make them more taunting here soon. It's not a serious issue.<br />
<br />
The only time that Verant really, really pisses me off is when they give us blatant BS lies, and seriously screw around with non-code related balance issues. I seem to recall VI saying that dragon faction and giant faction were equal. People on dragon faction pointed out that this was not necessarily the case. So then VI said that they'd work on the factions to make them equal. Months pass, and then VI releases their first Luclin statement, where they say that while in Velious the factions weren't meant to be equal and instead were a progression, in Luclin there would be equal factions.<br />
<br />
That one pissed me off something fierce. :P<br />
<br />
Ah well. What it all comes down to is a matter of opinion. Maybe I just haven't felt that stung by the stuff Verant has done in the past. Torpor isn't nerfed. Slows aren't nerfed. They didn't take anyone's stupid idea of adding a slow to our epic. We still have makemefast boots.<br />
<br />
Eventually it'll all either work out, or they'll give up, ditch EQ and work 100% on EQ2. And at that point, I'll just go to WoW. ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Spraggon-Test</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Hopefully instead of tweeking the code on disease etc they just create an 'anti-jolt' spell for SK that works as well as a taunt as DC did...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Pingpang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">SK's dont need a new &quot;anti-jolt&quot; spell to get aggro. They already have several line of spells that generate huge amounts of aggro, such as Shadow Vortex and the shroud line. Lifetap spells also generate huge amts of aggro due to their dual action of damaging a mob and healing the SK. All of these spells are not DoT's which render the mob unmezzable after they take effect, a drawback to DC that made me stop using it long ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Eahlfereth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">There's a problem with using other spells for aggro.<br />
<br />
They cost MORE mana,take LONGER to cast, and need to be cast MORE times to equal the aggro DC took us.<br />
<br />
I tried getting away from DC on my Shadowknight more than once as I got new spells. But with pretty much any combo besides Shadow Vortex and Disease Cloud, It took maybe 5 pr 6 mobs before I found myself OOM. Some of us don't have the luxury of having an Enchanter in our group, or even so much as a Necro to manapump. <br />
<br />
Disease cloud was very useful because 1, one could use it and not have to watch thier mana bar go down by a full blue, and 2. It could cast fast, thus making it be a slight possibly that that wizard might actually be alive by the time the spell gained enough taunt to peel him back onto me.<br />
<br />
And if nothing else, think of the pre-22 SKs who have no other major taunt spells beyond the incredible slow casting darkness and the Incredibly high mana Screams. <br />
<br />
If you have found that you could abandon DC at an earlier level, more power to you, you rock, teach me your mojo please. However, I can't help but feel you probably had an Ench or Bard around an AWFUL Lot, had lots of mana gear, or let your casters/priests gain aggro an awful lot more than they could have. <br />
<br />
I can understand why this happened. Verant, like it or not, doesn't really know thier game, since they don't play it as religiously as most of us (Which explains why they keep adding #$%&amp; MORE Keyed Dungeons, on a seperate rant). They probably saw Disease Cloud at the start as nothing more than a damage add that would be useful in the low teens to maybe add a bit more damage, or maybe even just some random spell to keep up the Quota of &quot;an SK should get X spells at level 9.&quot; However, due to many factors, Including Low Mana cost, Low cast time, the extra hate innately designed to spells that DD and DoT and do Disease-based Damage, and the Long Duration, among others, DC quickly became a spell that many SKs kept memmed all the way to 50, and even all the way to 59 post-Kunark. And it was a spell that was the cornerstone of the main thing that kept us and keeps us viable as an alternative to Paladins or Warriors, our mega-taunt factor, no-one except perhaps Paladins could peel the mob off faster and keep it's interest longer while still having a miniscule chance of standing up to it's quad damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">If i remaber right part of the tuant of the spells Shadow Vortex, heart flutter, and aysotal ( lvl 60 one ) was that thay ALL added disease counters. and now thay are way behind other hybrids on aggro production instead of being ahead. rangers can quickly gain aggro throu the use of snare ( movement reduction ) and flame lick ( very rfast casting low mana AC debuff/dot with a agi debuff i think ). pallys have the tuant of the stun spells and root. where SK's are lakeing now is the fact thay no longer have a fast casting low mana high aggro spell in there hands. so for a Exp group that does not have a chanter ( being a shaman when i get in a group if the people know how to play we realy dont need one and its more fun to play with out one ) a SK will go OOM very fast. I also lost a facter that i could pull aggro off others if the case needed it ( would rather me get hit then the robes ). this was done with dots and a belive also posion counters where effected but not for sure.<br />
<br />
And on the breaking of spells to fix another ... do any of you remaber when thay gave the pallys the mana to HP spell and broke our entire rage line? just for one new spell. that took away from us a hole OPTION on how we could play in a group by killing rage tanking. and the trend contues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That was the same batch where they changed Torpor to not mana drain the target.<br />
<br />
I'll keep that change kkthx.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">After three days of group hunting and casting slows, I didn't get a single aggro from casting the spell.  The only aggro I get now is if I heal too much.</div></div><hr />

Does anyone know if poison DoTs also generate less agro?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Baldkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I may be way off base on this, but, Since VI seems to love adding new spells, couldn't they have added a new slow spell...<br />
<br />
Cure Slow, with a 99.9% slow, and a duration of 1 second.<br />
<br />
Yes? No?<br />
<br />
Blah...</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Reworking the way counters generate hate&quot; is not the same as &quot;Reduce the hate generated by counters.&quot; If this perhaps subtle difference hurt your widdle head, I apologize. Allow me to elaborate.<br />
<br />
They had many options, one of which was what I said they should do in the first place (in a previous thread that you're free to waste your time looking for): Reduce the number of counters on slows. Seems like the easiest solution, but it might require a little testing and thought to get the numbers right. Testing? Thought? Wrong game company.<br />
<br />
So if the number of counters was to remain the same, there is only one other easy solution: Reduce the aggro, period. Did this fix it? Yes. Did this shaft SKs in the process? To a degree. Does Verant care? No. They did what was easy (in mental and physical effort), and that's all that matters to them.</div></div><hr />
