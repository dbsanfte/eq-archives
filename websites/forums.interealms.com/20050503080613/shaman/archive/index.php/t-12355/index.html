<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Styantiss Sarnakslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently good a decent 2HB and have my skill up to 190 now. It seems that as my skill goes up, so does the max damage. The weapon is 30/33 and im max hitting at 115 right now.<br />
<br />
 At what point does skill stop affecting max damage? If I had a maxed out 2hb skill(bout 240 at this level), would my max damage output be much greater?<br />
<br />
 Im pretty confused on the issue, any comments would be helpful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Porgy Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You're gonna cap at 200, all Shaman Melee skills do.<br />
<br />
But yeah your max damage should be going up as you gain skill and level, and also as you gain skill you will get more ATK, which will allow more sucessful hits, which is far better than a few more points on max damage (though not as cool looking).<br />
<br />
Increasing Strength will also increase your max damage.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Skill, ATK, STR and mob level/AC all effect how hard you hit.  I'm not sure which order those belong in, but they're the right list.  You won't have much use for 2HB later in your life, cause if yer tanking it, you need a shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">all the rage lately is 1-hander clubs for melee action.  Shields are just too cool to give up, but it's good that you've raised your 2HB so high.  You *might* find a use for it sometime.  There's a really high damage 2-hander from UP like 74dmg 95 delay or something sick like that.  I think the preferred usage was haste and cast spells in between swings.<br />
I guess some people were getting hits up to 250 or so with that bad boy.  <br />
But the preferred weapon skill lately is definitely 1-HB.  Check my preferred primary for a good example of something to shoot for :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Oh, and from what I have seen, your max hit depends entirely on two things: 1) your str and, 2) your level (up to about 40 when the last lvl cap comes off).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>vaniar luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Though once you max skill and cap your str your attack will only give you more hits closer to max.... your max hit doesnt increase with attack.<br />
<br />
I havent seen a max hit increase since I capped way back in the day... and str doesnt seem to effect max hit after 200 STR either.<br />
<br />
Oh and I did some parsing recently with my mithril battle hammer.(max hit 88) <br />
Self buffed 305 all stats except int and cha using 41% haste (Gauntlets of dragon slaying) and SLtW 30 - 31 DPS<br />
Same buffs no haste item (still SLtW) 21-22 DPS<br />
Same buffs SLtW. 41% haste and Ferine 32-33 DPS.<br />
<br />
140 attack makes next to no diff to non melee..... each parse was run for exactly 5 min on the same mob (yes the mob was never killed), and the wep procs a 302 DD (I dont have any AAs or focus that mod DDs) which did figure into the parse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Styantiss Sarnakslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thank you for all the help folks :)<br />
<br />
  I didnt know shaman weapon skills maxed at 200, thanks much for that info. As for the 1HB vs 2HB debate, Im sure you all are right if you have the right 1hb.<br />
<br />
 At level 50, Im not swimming in money like I thought I might be :( So, I havent seen any 1hb in my price range that is nearly as good damage output as my current 2hb. Both skills are near max, so I can be flexible when the right one comes along. I was using the Ykesha War Club(go ahead and laugh) for the longest time, it was the best price versus damage output I have found. Now that Ive found a Great Maul of Hatred, my melee damage output has tripled. Of course, my ac is suffering now.<br />
<br />
 I should start a magelo profile so you guys can give me a good critique.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rebelheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you must tank the mob for some reason (PoN or Pox just keep breaking root/tight space/cant root/summon)<br />
Corpsegrinder is a good 2hb I would recommand<br />
at least you will gain hp from hitting mob, and slow down your hp drain.<br />
<br />
Will it worth losing 40ac or so from shield? I dont know..I know I like to use it on all non PoP mob.<br />
There is also a 2hb from PoF that proc 400 damage and 800 if it crit, I think it will be another reason to give up your shield.</div></div><hr />
