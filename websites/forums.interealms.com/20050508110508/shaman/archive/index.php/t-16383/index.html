<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I had only like 2 days on Beta, and played about 5 different chars so didn't really get a chance to confirm this and not got Ldon yet as it arrives in Europe a week after release in US. But the question is, will all adventures have to be done from one camp only to gain enough adventure points for bane? Because I remember there being you could only spend points you have earned at a camp for that camp. Which brings up the nightmare prospect of having to earn 2k adventure points at only one camp, which imo is stupid. <br />
(reasoning-because if guildies have to exclusively do 1 camp also it splits people up, and it gets pretty tedious and boring only doing one camp)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Oh just found out Bane Costs 650 points from EC..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Check out this (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=16343) thread.  About 5 or 6 posts down Jinheim writes up a good explanation of how it works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">McRoc -<br />
yes, to buy Bane, or anything else, you will have to earn enough adventure points at the camp to buy it.  <br />
good threads on that elsewhere, but a brief recap:<br />
<br />
<br />
You have a cap on how much you can spend on any one item.  That  cap is the number of adventure points you have earned (lifetime) at that camp.  you can spend points that were earned elsewhere, but you cannot spend more than you have earned there.<br />
<br />
<br />
So - if you want to power up to Bane, and ignore the spells for detecting and disarming traps, etc., then you would want to do all of your adventures at the camp where you plan to buy Bane.<br />
<br />
If you spend any points on cheaper items/spells, then you could finish raising your cap and then go &quot;replenish&quot; your points at another camp if you wanted.  Eventually you will have fairly high caps at ll of the camps, and can spread your adventuring around based on other criteria.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah thought it worked like this, and looks like have to earn 650 points for EC camp I believe. Which is like 10-12 adventures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hehe...<br />
<br />
10-12 SUCCESSFUL adventures that is...<br />
<br />
So only about 30-36 attempts, less if you have a solid guild group that listens. Talk about making us work for our spells...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Guess pretty clever of them bastard. Your groups and even group of 6 friends mostly different classes so they are going to HAVE To spend 10-12 successful adventures just for people to get their spells for each person in each place.  Is that right? Sure ive got my 650 points in EC but if my friends SK spell doesnt drop there than he still needs to go get the 650 windon in wherever the sk spell drops right?  Granted not everyone cares so much about their highest new spell but isnt that the jist of how its going?<br />
<br />
  So i go to Ec earn 1000 points spend 650 on bane. I have 350 left but i cant spend it anyplace else til i earn 350 points in elsewhere. <br />
<br />
   I liked it better before i knew the point process. Now i just feel like a mouse in one of those tester mazes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">On the plus side, we don't have to count on quazi inexistent rare drops, random turn ins or the player economy to get our spells. We just have to xp in a specific dungeon with our friends for 11- 13 adventures to unlock the vendor.  A slaughter mission or an asassination takes about 30 - 55 minutes with a good group on normal setting (maximum 85ish), I got on average roughly 3-4 yellows at 100 percent aa and 51 points for a dungeon crawl. It's not quite as good as other places xpwise but it's pretty decent. One to 3 adventures in a play session is very reasonable. <br />
<br />
Personally I would have preferred total points earned to be used for unlocking the vendors simply because not all dungeons profit to all classes which makes it a pain to decide who's dungeon to do first... however I'll still be happy to put in the time it takes because it combines buisness and pleasure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Er..... no?? 12 successes from 36 attempts would pretty much guarantee you had a dumb group who hadn't got a clue to share amongst themselves. An average group with average kit should really be able to hold a 75% success rate from what I've seen so far. <br />
<br />
The maths for 650 at level 65 works back to 13 times 51pts. Which, if you take an average 90 mins a run is just under 20 hours of play time. So having disagreed with the first bit of your post, I'd have to agree with the last bit.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">20 hours of play time is &quot;making us work for our spells&quot;?<br />
<br />
How many hours have people spent farming guardian wurms or the Emperor in Seb hoping for Torpor/Malo?  (hint: it's more than 20 for most people).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hint: Not for me it wasn't.  :p <br />
<br />
Wasn't my point though. Someone put it quite succinctly on a different thread (damn my pathetic short-term memory  :( ) I read elsewhere on here - at least we know  we'll be getting our spells. Yeah, I'd say 20 hours was working for one spell. But we get the spell. I'm not complaining about it, hell no, I'm happy to put in the time to get the reward - way way better than putting in the time for a chance  at a possible  drop that we may or may not  win the roll  on etc etc.</div></div><hr />
