I still play, from time to time.  I couldn't really put my finger on what's killed things for me, for the most part - but this fellow has.  Some very well thought out points about where EQ consistently fails to improve itself (dev complaints that people don't &quot;play the game right&quot; are pretty telling).  I found that reading this also helped me to organize in my mind what I'll be looking for in the upcoming MMORPG's, in hopes of finding an EQ replacement.<br />
<br />
This rant was written when Velious was being announced as a future release.  It's amazing how the issues raised in this post are, for the most part, utterly unchanged today.  It's a longer read than most, but worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sorry, but I disagree that for the most part the issues are still the same.<br />
And as a matter of fact I actually remember reading this when it was first posted on Whineplay and heartily agreeing with it.  For the most part, I don't anymore.    <br />
<br />
I quit playing not too terribly long after this guy did.  I had gotten my character to 50 (not even 60) and I don't like to raid.  I didn't see anything ahead in the game for me other than endless grinding to 60 and then *nothing*.  I didn't play again until long after Luclin was released.  <br />
<br />
The changes in the game were astounding.  There is so much more for the casual player to do.  Heck, they gave us a whole expansion.  There is a good deal less camping of static spawns, particularly with LDON.  There are AA points.  There's tons of new tradeskill stuff.  I'm 65 and I don't see the game becoming boring for some time to come.  Will it ever?  Most likely - NO MATTER WHAT THEY DO TO CHANGE IT.  All games become boring after a while.   I think it is testimony to what a great game Everquest is that it is still fun for so many people after so many years.   A lot of the &quot;promising competitors emerging on the horizon&quot; that that post referred to have come out already and not achieved anywhere near the success Everquest has.  So someone, somewhere, at some time, did something right.<br />
<br />
The attitude of this dev team seems to be a great deal different than the previous one too.  I've actually heard them admit making a mistake - unheard of in the old days.  They seem to try to incorporate what some people want into the game.  I'd say the problem with this is that not all players want the same thing.  Looking at it from the outside, it appears that if you put X, Y and Z into the game, you will please about half the player population and piss off the other half.  <br />
<br />
Sometimes I think it has got to suck being a game developer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I read the whole thing, I'm not sure I agree entirely.  I got my epic way back to prove to some in my guild at the time that a casual player could get their epic.  I leveled to prove I could get the highest level before the next expansion came out playing only a few hours a week.  I never got a handle on keys and flags, too much of a damned time sink, but I'm SLOWLY getting there today.<br />
<br />
I don't really agree with some of his analogies, or his conclusions.  It's just a damned game.  A while back I had a choice to pursue my RL or my EQ &quot;life&quot; and I went with the former.  While it was harder than my epic, I have no regrets and I guage my success by my RL and not my EQ achievements.  Personally, EQ status doesn't really occur to me.  I made a choice to re-guild strictly with a small tight group of friends and we have fun.  More fun than I had when I was pursuing goals.  If you re-evalutae what is and is not fun for you, you can re-establish more meaningfull goals.  For me, it's trying to push my skills and hang out with people I like, working as a team.  For me EQ is fun again.<br />
<br />
I will say the biggest issue here is that the expectations of people are set too high.  If you want to achieve what guildX has done, you need to invest the time.  If you are not prepared to invest time, don't expect the rewards.  I'm not the guy in the porshe ... frankly ... I couldn't give a damn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I will offer the analogy of the Car industry.  The Car industry makes cars for us. We drive them.  Some of drive them slow, some drive them fast, some take them off road and jump over ditches like they were never meant to do, some do stupid things and run them into things.  Now the parallel you will bring up is to say &quot;Yes, and the roadways are regulated, you will eventually get caught speeding, playing crash derby, etc.&quot;  <br />
<br />
The difference is that I use a car because I have a NEED for it, in a real time world.  The game Everquest is merely an outlet that people use to escape from the real environment.  They made an environment, the players interact with it.  If EQ were turned into an expressway with policemen, stop signs, strict rules and no dynamic content, I would not play it.  Right now when I play EQ the only rules I want are &quot;Don't run over people with your car, Don't run into Huge buildings&quot;  In other words.. Don't go TOO crazy, interact and enjoy.<br />
<br />
I think people have a tendency to blame everything else in the world for the problems, in this case the developers of the game.  The truth is, as much as you want to complain, EQ is the most successful game EVER made to date.  More people play it right now than ever have.  New sign ups happen all the time.  How can we sit and say &quot;They are screwing up the game&quot;  Yes, it is all about money to them.  Guess what, if they don't make their payroll and have money for development it won't work.  That's how the economy works. You put out a good product, you market it to all walks of life, you reap the rewards and ride the wave as long as you can.  When you see the peak of the wave beginning to come, you entice more players, retain your current players, cash in your chips and shut it down, or make a new product for people to enjoy.  Right now Sony is doing these things.  They continue to run Everquest, present new content and at the same time are making a new cutting edge game so that their player base can continue on into the next gaming era with their company.<br />
<br />
For all of the complaints about developers, GM's, Sony, and everything else there is no denying they are a merely a company trying to succeed in an industry where 75%+ of companies put out complete junk.  EQ is a pretty darn good game.  It was day 1, it was today.  Whether you enjoy it still or not is irrelevant.  The fact is that even if you don't enjoy it, the numbers of subscribers are increasing.  While you may not be one of the ones they retain, they are appealing to 2 more people in your place.  Right now I enjoy EQ and continue to play it.  <br />
<br />
Ford puts out the Ford Explorer every year in an effort to make money, knowing full well that 1000 people will die inside of them each year.  It's the price of success that companies pay.  They aren't running a AD&amp;D pen and paper game, they are running an online game.  If you like it, play it, if you don't someone else will.. When they start dropping in total number of subscribers they will address it.  <br />
<br />
It amazes me how people get behind the computer with all the answers to the gaming world when the answer is right there in front of you.  Sony is making money whether you are the one paying or not.  Just because their vision isn't yours, doesn't mean they are wrong.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I remember some of those people that guy was talking about. Very accurate portrayal of RN around the Velious era.<br />
<br />
The guy is dead-on in one respect: you are what you wear. If you have have elemental plane loot, you are uber regardless of skill. That's one thing that hasn't changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's just a game.  I'm way into EQ and always get way into whatever MMORPG I'm playing...but I think some people get way more mentally attached than even me.<br />
<br />
I've been playing computer games for years and have played several MMORPGs or over a year each. EQ have provided more long-lasting entertainment than any other game I've played.  Most single player games I've had, including the best of them, don't hold my attention as long or provide me with nearly as much entertainment as MMORPGs like EQ.<br />
<br />
I think it's near impossible for someone to make a game that'll please every single person forever. And, since it is a massively multiplayer environment involving thousands of devious humans, then no matter how well devs design a world somebody will figure out a way to exploit it and make other players miserable.<br />
<br />
EQ does have some flaws, but it's a great game.<br />
<br />
If people just up and decide that EQ isn't fun anymore and want to quit then so be it...they probably did have fun for most of the ride.  I quit EQ at one time and I'm in a 2nd EQ run now and enjoying it even more than the first time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">One thing the success of EQ proves is just how easily people are manipulated. The game was designed with just one goal in mind-lure you into it and trap you inside for as long as possible. Funny how easily it has accomplished its goal. After all these years you can still see people coming out in defense of the game despite the innumerable instances where the lack of respect for you as a player were made all to evident to be denied.<br />
I've played this game since Kunark was brand new, I've always concentrated on the aspects of it that were fun and ignored the greater part of the timesinks. The only reason I've continued playing is that there was simply nothing else out there to compete with EQ. A couple other games have come along, but they are just clones of this game. Whatever improvements they made were quickly added to this game anyway (hello portals, hello soulbinders in every city).<br />
With all the new MMORPG's being developed right now, one of them is bound to get it right. I personally can't wait to find which ones do, I'll be leaving EQ without so much as a second thought.</div></div><hr />

It took me a long time to finally adopt this way of thinking. Once I did, EQ became much more entertaining. <br />
<br />
I remember when that was posted and I remember how it colored my perception of what I could and couldn't accomplish in EQ. I know now that his experience was just that, his. Mine has been very different simply because I stopped letting others experiences dictate my expectations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">During my 4 year EQ career I have played one character.  In the first few years of the life of that character I got frustrated and often went on vacation from EQ for months at a time.  The game was too hard for a casual player.<br />
<br />
I have to admit that I now have more free time, but I cannot remember the last time I logged of of EQ in frustration.  I have been 65 for months and I am still enjoying the game tremedously.  That said there have been elements introduced into the game that I don't like, but they do not out strip the good that has been introduced into the game.<br />
<br />
I don't like the ease of travel.  I actually like boats.  I hate the Luclin models.  They look too FPS to me and I would have rather the effort been spent on additional 2D textures.  Same deal with armor dye.<br />
<br />
In general I do not like the idea that EQ has been so radically dumbed down, but I do have to agree that before the &quot;changes&quot;  EQ was too much of a grind for casual gamers.  It is all just am matter of to what degree a game should be made player friendly.<br />
<br />
EQ and gaming are my hobbies.  No one ever rants against Lionel Trains for producing a product that is used by adults to waste their time.  Folks enjoy the game.  SoE tries hard to come up with ideas that will keep folks happily engaged.  Not everyone is pleased with everything that SoE does but the majority of players obviously are.<br />
<br />
I know from inside information that the old design team was much less player friendly and saw the game as Theirs much like the DM of a paper and dice game.  I have to give them credit for creating the game but at some point the project takes on a life of its own much like a parent has to let a child be his own person.<br />
<br />
The true problem is the appearance of discontent in the game on MB is that most gamers and computer geeks (the vast majority of EQers fit into both categories) are socially challenged and this often causes them to be critical in their communications because it is a way of wielding power.  My guess is that most players are deeply satisfied if the truth be told.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I read most of the post - and finally gave up in boredom.  The game has changed so much from the Kunark era that he is writing about that I felt like I was reading a newpaper article about the 1980s presidential election...mebbe interesting to a few history buffs, but boring and not relevant to the present.<br />
<br />
<br />
The only part I found interesting was how he was complaining that the epic quests were a horrible idea, and that they simply increased competition for already limited camps.</div></div><hr />

Retail mall entrances and exits to the parking lot, the mall, and it's stores are designed to make it easy to get in, but more difficult to get out (ever forget which exit you came in? Where you parked? Notice that the impulse buy goods are near the cash? That the put ladies shoes and purses by an exit? There's a reason for all this).  Magazines and even e-letters aggresively try to get you to re-new subscriptions.  It's easy to get a car salesman to talk to you, but harder to get him to stop.  The reason is no one makes money unless they keep your business, ESPECIALLY if their CS sucks.  It makes no sense to make a game no one wants to play, but if you make a great game, they can afford to provide crappy service.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The whole &quot;Keep up with the Jones's&quot; attitude is imo 90% of the reason people are unhappy with the world ( not saying 90% of the people are unhappy with the world ) , and bout 30% of whats wrong with the world.
