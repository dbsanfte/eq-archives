<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tekmojo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey I play a shaman on morrel thule,<br />
<br />
Ive noticed that any decent guild that does any type of raiding, wants you to have all the pop flags, tons of AA, Keys.. and to have already done tons of high end raiding...<br />
<br />
Now, see here is my dilema... I am a 2boxer... shaman/beastlord, and my 2 best friends are cleric/warrior...   so we pretty much always group together etc...  ive played eq for 4 years but quit a while back, and have recently started on this server.....about 1 month ago.<br />
<br />
I am level 54 now, cleric 58, beastlord 55, warrior 55.  now... i have tons of  playtime... but I just do not see how I can get equiped well enough equiped/flagged/keyed to get into any decent guild... ...also shaman are  now like the lowest on recruitment...which makes it worse for me ?? didnt we used to be gods???<br />
<br />
I'm not even asking for a l33t uber guild that requires you to raid 5x a raid... All i really want is to just experience high level content... and raid about once or twice a week...  <br />
<br />
any advice ???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kaloog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not trying to be a smartas$ here, but play the Beastlord. If you want to see the top end raid stuff as a shaman you will be hard pressed to get there. It's hard enough for established unguilded shaman to find spots these days. <br />
<br />
You also may wanna start with a lower end raiding guild that actively does top Velious/Luclin content to start with, based on your present level. I don't see how guilds of that level would be requiring too many pop flags, tons of AAs, etc. At 54/55 you still have LOTS to do/see.<br />
<br />
Others might have different views, and maybe my server is differemt, so don't take this as gospel...just one opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tat2demon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am also on MT, and once a member of one of the top guilds. I would suggest checking out Mystical Lightfighters (http://www.mysticallightfighters.com/) .<br />
<br />
ATM were raiding mid PoP.<br />
<br />
I wasnt enjoying the top end as much as I use to so rejoined MLF to relax and just play for fun again. Recruitment level is 60 but its worth hammering out those levels if you want to join a great guild.<br />
<br />
Check out the website and see if MLF sounds like the place for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As Kaloog already posted you should look for a lower end raiding guild. Beside velious / lower end luclin doing epics / kurnak dragons would give you chances to learn raiding skills (yes, raiding requires skill too).<br />
<br />
It's sad to say but most raids only require 1 shaman (MGB Fo7). 2 shamans are ok but with 3+ shamans at a raid it gets boring for most raids.<br />
<br />
BTW Joining a lower / mid level guild can be great fun to see / expirience how the guild progress through velius -&gt; luclin -&gt; PoP -&gt; GoD. My old guild on Vaz went from upper velious to top GoD in 2 years (/wave triality)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am level 54 now, cleric 58, beastlord 55, warrior 55.<br />
All i really want is to just experience high level content<br />
Get to high level first, then you can experience it.<br />
You are the right level to be useful for epic fights, and possibly some velious content.<br />
You are of no use fighting mobs that hit for 1-2k.<br />
Chloroblast just isn't going to cut it, and neither will HOS for buffing purposes.<br />
Look for high level content in 10 more levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hail,<br />
<br />
Your 4 person group can level extremely fast by adding one more hotboxer who uses 2 dps classes who plays when you do.<br />
<br />
Smash through adventures and grind in Tier1 PoP.  I recommend Innovation until you are 60, then move to Valor until 62 and then move to HoH if you can handle it.  If your group can get together regularly at the same time for 4-6 hours per day, you can all be level 65 in under a month's time.  At that point you can jump on the pickup raiding circuit and begin knocking out flags.<br />
<br />
Eventually if you are personable and even only moderately skilled you will get some guild invites.  Some of the higher end guilds even have 'feeder' guilds for lower level people to work their way up inside.  These aren't all that common, but can be a great opportunity for you to learn &amp; grow.  Much better than staying in a smaller guild when you have no intention of staying there once you become powerful.  Smaller guilds don't like playing stepping stone most of the time.  ;) <br />
<br />
Find your server boards and lurk there.  Soak up information about different guilds.  Look up their rosters &amp; try to group with uberguilders playing their alts in their spare time.  This can get you better known &amp; may strongly impact your application process months down the road.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">High level content and raid about once or twice a week should not be used in the same sentence.  If you want to join a raiding guild that does high lvl content, Im sure they will expect you to raid more than once or twice a week.  And yes, it is true there is a shortage of beastlords out there.  Better chance of getting in a guild as a BL main.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Exiled Gatekeeprs is another good guild that is willing to work with you on flags. Also Discordians and Feral Redemption off the top of my head.<br />
<br />
Go post in the forum guilds forum http://tinyurl.com/3fmyu. Just explain what you are looking for and someone will pick you up ... if you dont have a dirty rep that is ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tekmojo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah, my friend the cleric is might start a 2nd account. We are debating wether it be a ranger or druid...<br />
<br />
because the only thing we are lacking is tracking really..... CC is never an issue..we have no problems with handling around 4ish mobs...in LDONs....   ranger would add DPS...but they honestly suck till 60 with some AA and a good bow right ???<br />
<br />
but yeah us 3 play at the same time every day for about 5-9 hours... so hopefully we will get up there</div></div><hr />
