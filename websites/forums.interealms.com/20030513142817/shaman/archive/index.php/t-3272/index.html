<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I believe he was changed, when he was first found he was put on the wrong faction and the first people to try hand ins to him were forced to get someone to charm him. He was fixed a short while after, the only thing you need to worry about is finding him and avoiding kos mobs at the outpost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Did you get that canopic jar recently? The quest was broken like a week before I got to the overseer dub. part :(</div></div><hr />

We'll probably give it a try when I finish collecting my pages for the Lord of Pain Kuhkri and have to head into Droga for the keys.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Venomblood Draconis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The Iksar in the outpost is not KoS. Hasn't been for a while. You need to lev, invis up, and go around the sea wall into the Outpost (everything besides the Iksar in there will be KoS to you). Hug the wall and you'll see him.</div></div><hr />
