<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ralahast-BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all,<br />
I was wondering where you stand going into velious without having ever done anything to change faction there. Im thinking of going with my shaman to do some exploring/having a good time, and not sure which cities will like me etc..<br />
Im pretty sure that Ill be non-KOS to dorfs, but as far as dragons and giants are concerned, whats the story on them? any help appreciated :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You will be KoS to giants and CoV (dragons) to raise giant kill dwarfs, dragons and in SS. To raise CoV kill giants in GD, EW, Kael, and WL. And yes some of this is above your lv atm but you will grow into it :) I would sugest looking at the quest items and armors for the diffrent factions then decide which way you want to ally. It depends on who you ask on which they will tell you is best, Some will say keal others will tell you CoV. Now Thurg (Dwarf) armor is the same has PoG. So you can ally to giants and still get the same gread of armor has if you allyed to dwarf. The point to this is that you problly wont see much if any Kael armor till you get 55+. Where has PoG you can get 46+, thurg even lower than that. But I also would not count on a whole lot if any till your 50ish. Mostly it will depend on your guild. Personlly I started out on Thurg/ CoV then later moved to Kael faction for your LV this would problly be a good choice for you to but warrning changing faction can be long and teatious. The mindless camping of greens for hours on end.</div></div><hr />
