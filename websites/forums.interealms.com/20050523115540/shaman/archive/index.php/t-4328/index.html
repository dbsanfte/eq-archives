<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Baldrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am wondering where the best place to duo with my 59 shaman/57 monk is. Neither have epic and only avg to poor gear. I have tried the grey (poor exp but easy kills), ME (same as the grey, cant single pull FG and is way over camped, did akheva last night and appears to be onpar with FG exp and is splittable by 57 monk but mobs have 10kish HPs from what my parser came up with and I lived in SD for the last few lvls but its starting to get crowded with more guilds getting ready for VT and getting the shards.<br />
<br />
I dont want to ruin katta faction as there are a few quests I want to do in the near future. I am 25% into 59 on my shaman and desperately wanting to get to 60 asap. I want to find the easiest place to lvl for me with my current gear.<br />
<br />
Yes I have done searches but most of the people who talk about these great places are either higher lvl or with epics and much better gear. Loot is not that important but always a plus. <br />
<br />
btw gear is in magelos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>vaniar luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Chardok Zone out. Thats about as good as it gets, you have 5 to 9 mobs to single pull (depending on whether or not people are at the gatehouse).<br />
<br />
Best place to set up camp is about hafway up the tunnel there is a mob spawn on the left side kill it and camp there... just shift up the hall at next kill and stay there till respawn then shift back, rinse repeate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kaalisti_Painstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Go back to the old world. Solb &amp; the Hole are a most excellent place for a shammie/monk duo. Plus as a bonus, they're not as camped any more these days, at least on my server. <br />
<br />
Solb<br />
LDC's &amp; Imps, (especially with epic) are a nice steady xp flow. Without epic just take a little down-time =) You can even pick up an extra healer if you find the need. Keep acumen up, nab the guano harvester if you see him. If you have your JBB, the mobs here have very little resistance to cold.<br />
<br />
The Hole<br />
Get your monk some gate potions first for easy exit.<br />
You can shrink yourself with potions to squeeze through the door if you need to. There's a couple of good places to sit and grind around the drop off. Most are blue/light blue to 55+.<br />
<br />
The xp mod in these two zones is quite nice, but the Hole has a better modifier. Solb's comes from being a dungeon, with casters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Snowfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Howling Stones is awesome to 60 and beyond for exp.  Mobs have moderate hps (Harm touches though but no biggie).  I did there from 58 to 60 with a wizard and usually 1 melee.  Never crowded either.</div></div><hr />
