This is the first poll to this thread (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=21999). As I am limited to 10 options I will post this as three polls, please vote on all of them. I will edit this post and add the links to the other polls.<br />
<br />
Shaman need help in the following areas:<br />
* an upgrade to Daluda's. It is simply too small.<br />
* some sort of emergency heal to recover from a resisted slow.<br />
* some sort of group or AE heal for raid usage.<br />
<br />
That said these seem to be the options we could ask for. When voting on them please keep in mind that simply asking for the biggest numbers in each category does not solve anything. Ask for what you think shaman need to be competitive and no more.<br />
<br />
Daluda's<br />
a) improve amount healed to 1800, improve OoW heal to 2100<br />
b) improve amount healed to 2000, improve OoW heal to 2500<br />
<br />
emergency heal[/B]<br />
a) targetable stonestance<br />
c) single-target divine arbitration<br />
e) spirit shifting - drains HPs from shaman and gives them to the target<br />
<br />
[U]AE/group heal<br />
a) group HoT, Torpor style<br />
b) group HoT, Quiescence style<br />
c) direct group heal<br />
d) AE heal, heals 4 injured players in AE range to target<br />
Obviously the HoTs would be MGBable which SOE does not seem to like. The AE may be hard to keep your group alive with but being able to cast direct heals on a cleric group or tank duo may have it's own advantages on a raid.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I like the spirit shifting idea. Its not overpowering given the big downside (we take a lot of damage). Its also nice in that it stays in-form with the shamanistic ideas of cannibalising and mastery of the spirit realm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As posted in the other thread, Spirit Shifting would be more powerful than the Shaman Divine Arb. in the current form as it allows to &quot;heal&quot; for more. <br />
A straight single Divine Arb would have to be used when a tank is below 20% health to be more effective than Spirit Shifting. Thus I feel that that the Shaman's Divine Arb would have to give a health bonus at level 3 or have a reuse of lower than 2 minutes to be on par with Spirit Shifting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd like a targetable stonestance, it would be something unique and would add a new flexibility to the class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I suggested a Stonestance AA for Shamans, I intended it to be a self-only ability for emergencies and to reinstate Shamans as the &quot;tanks&quot; among the casters, albeit only for a very brief time(2 ticks). Just long enough to get things under control usually.<br />
<br />
The targetable Stonestance AA suggestion should be removed from this poll honestly. This section should be reserved to &quot;emergency heals&quot; and if you think about it a targetable Stonestance is no such thing. <br />
It would be easily exploitable by rotating it on a MT on raids, which would only create the number of Shamans(call em bots) to trivialize short DPS fights.<br />
<br />
The Stonestance idea for Shamans(self only, same reuse time as the monk disc) should still be part of the proposal, but I feel it isn't supposed to be included in any of the 3 polls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I am wondering how many people actually know the difference between the single-target Divine Arb and Spirit Shifting...the difference is actually very subtle imo.<br />
<br />
I'll try to explain it, I guess.<br />
<br />
The Spirit Shifting AA originally suggested by veeshanMurtak has a 1 minute reuse time, takes 20/30/40%(3 AA ranks) HPs from the Shaman and heals the target for the exact amount. (A 10k HP Shaman would take 4k damage and heal his target for 4 k). The suggested cast time was 0.5 seconds.<br />
<br />
The single-target Divine Arbitration I suggested was never really specified, so I won't do this now(since this isn't my poll  :p ). However, Divine Arbitration(cleric version) works like this: <br />
<br />
When triggered, the ability balances out the HPs among *all* group members(in the case of the single-target Shaman version this would only affect the target and the Shaman using the ability). To facilitate this we assume a Cleric(10k HPs) is only grouped with a Warrior(15k HPs). The tank gets down to 50% health(7.5k), the Cleric triggers Divine Arb, which does 1250 Damage to the Cleric and heals the Warrior for 1250((10k(Cleric) + 7.5k(Warrior))/2 = 8750). Doing the same when the Warrior has 1k HPs left, would bring both to 5.5k resulting in a 4.5 k heal/loss.<br />
<br />
Just thought I'd clarify, don't mind me!<br />
<br />
Edit: Numbers were wrong the first time, then I just had fun adding more numbers. I suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As for the poll, if I had to choose from those options, I think I'd pick stonestance... but any of them seem like a dev would find them overpowered, to me, but that's just a hunch.  Would be nice to see though, regardless.<br />
<br />
I would personally like to see a fast casting, mana INEFFICIENT heal, possibly with a considerable recast time, for emergencies.  <br />
<br />
They could make it have a hefty mana cost, slap at least a 10 second recast on that puppy, and give it a good amount of healing.  It wouldn't SAVE us as a priest class, but I can think of a lot of situations where it would help... and I don't believe it would be terribly imbalancing, though I'm certainly not the expert on the subject of balance... I think every priest class should have two heals.  Then again, we do already have Q, so not sure if devs would factor that in... even if Q is not effective for healing big spikes of damage in an emergency situation.<br />
<br />
Also, our main heal could use an upgrade.  I worry about the couple hundred increase in points for OOW... if they scale mob dps up for oow as they did for GoD, we'll be in some serious trouble.  <br />
<br />
Still, I think the problems are more within the underlying mechanics of new content, but since they can't realistically change it drastically enough to correct these issues on that end, healing would be a nice place to start.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Pinot Noir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would choose Stone Stance.<br />
Spirit Shifting is a great skill, but if we gave our hp to damaged player, we might provoke mobs by low Hp taunt...<br />
(40% reduction is not so much but it happens)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I would choose Stone Stance.<br />

(40% reduction is not so much but it happens)<br />
<br />
Also, I keep a keen eye on both health and mana at all times, maintaining a balance in terms of Canni vs Regen/Q.  Spirit Shifting would throw me off a bit... small issue, but I think it would bother me, at least a little bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I don't think it would even need to be 2 ticks. 6 seconds would be fine. and 6 seconds of stonestance is broken but chainable Furious-&gt;Defensive isn't?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I don't think it would even need to be 2 ticks. 6 seconds would be fine. and 6 seconds of stonestance is broken but chainable Furious-&gt;Defensive isn't?<br />
<br />
2 ticks actually means a random 6.1 to 11.9 seconds depending on when it's triggered. So yes, 10 Shamans rotating defensive x 2(Defensive = DI*0.55, Stonestance = DI*0.1) that ability would definitely make a difference. Just think about all those short duration raid mobs in GoD. Timed correctly 10 Shamans could reduce the damage taken by a tank by 90% for up to 2 minutes. Clearly overpowering.<br />
<br />
Even limiting it to group only would allow 5 Shamans to make a tank virtually immune to melee damage for a whole minute. Stonestance AA is something that I regard *needed*, but it should be self-only.</div></div><hr />
