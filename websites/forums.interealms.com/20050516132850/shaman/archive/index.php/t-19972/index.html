<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For a low level toon. lvl 9 actualy.  You know, something like that guy in factory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Aviaks in NK are great when you're the right level (teens?). You can agro one and run to the Lake zoneline, set up autoattack and regen and slow and cripple, and go watch television. When you come back at commercial break, you'll find that you got the mob to like 10 pct and he ran away; he'll forget you before he tries to come back. Repeat. Just make sure he's dark blue. I got no skillups in an hour of this against a light blue. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you're levelling a melee, remember there's a long gap between when weapon stats can be maxed (39) &amp; when you can rase them again (50 or 51). <br />
<br />
Just level your alt with his best weapon choice. You'll probably be able to keep 2 maxed per level, 3 as things slow down a bit. When the time comes that you can max the skill, go find a group in DSP or OT &amp; ask if you can beat on their mobs with your low skill weapons (have ants potions handy if you're a large race).<br />
<br />
Not sure about the Aviak idea. IIRC they hit fairly hard, but the only time I tried them was on my first toon, who would have been in fairly poor armor at the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well the thing is im on the new server and didnt expect to see a nice h2h for a long time so i started training in piercing and 1hb figuring this was my best option for lowbie weapons. Well someone gave me a fine steel ulak and a heavy iron ulak ( i have a bst ) so now at 10 i have a total of 9 in my h2h. Losts of down time cause it takes forever to kill something. Level 9 with no power leveling, no twinks no nuffin.<br />
<br />
No big, I was just hoping there was a way to accel getting to 50ish or higher. Thnx for the input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zrakkonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There is a Mob in Paineel right at the entrance to the warrens, a Euridite SK.  He hits like a girl (40 max I believe), and has a boat load of HPs.  No faction hit for killing him either.  He doesnt green out till the mid to late 50's I believe.  I have worked weapon skills on all my melee alts there, and would have worked my shammie there too if I had heard about him sooner.  He is also good for def skill ups since he hits like a weenie and swings fairly fast.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps :)<br />
