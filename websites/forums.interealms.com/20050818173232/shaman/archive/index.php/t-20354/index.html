<br />
After taking the other quiz I felt like making my own, since the questions on the old quiz were pretty vague.  Feel free to post comments/results/questions here, and I'm updating it pretty often now with new questions/results.  Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thanks for the quiz-- although I found myself trying to ignore obvious stuff like the dog...  if there was a way you could ask questions that don't seem to directly determine a specific EQ class, that wouuld probably be better.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, I came out a shaman anyway even though I avoided every single dog answer. hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Koushirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Whoa... I'm a Paladin.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>decessusvenenum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually, the dog questions were more leaning towards druids (wolves), but since very few people have wolf pets IRL, I made it dog, since it's a nature thing...druids are still around today, hang out in the forest, etc. so I just picked an animal like the dog.  It makes sense you got shaman anyways =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Shaman-Calm and helpful, you will assist those in need. You are very stolid, but will fight when your rights or the rights of those you love are in danger. You are very just when making decisions, much like a paladin, but you consider both sides with even more care. You should become a supreme court judge.<br />
<br />
I've generally tried to be impartial to things and not take sides...and I thought it was just because I didn't care. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>jablek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">im a shaman, lol... http://quizilla.com/cgi-bin/result/result.pl</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">LOL - I actually came out as a shaman first try - and I thought I would fail since I didn't answer a single &quot;dog&quot; answer.  Go figure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I couldn't help but notice beastlord isn't a possible outcome :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>decessusvenenum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah I took a few off because of certain similarities...for instance, beastlord answers would be much like the druid answers, involving animals killing things...also took out berserker because of it's obvious similarities to a warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I dont see how im a druid when i burn people with flame throwers, love my dog and release a pack of dogs on the police...<br />

Some how im still a tree hugger lol</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">The quizzes are nifty, but most of the quiz choices are just too obvious like &quot;Take the hits&quot; is warrior, &quot;Bring your dog&quot; Shaman, &quot;Blow it up&quot; is a Wizard, etc.<br />
<br />
I can't answer honestly to questions that read to me as &quot;This option means you're a wizard&quot;  &quot;This option means you're a shaman&quot; etc.  Feels like i'm looking at the answer sheet and the questions at the same time.<br />
<br />
Maybe you could draw a parallel between how your personal outlook on things or heck cosmic alignment or something could relate to class.  Or maybe a cutting edge one like the lucky charms marshmallow intimacy quizzes you see all the time!  Go Go purple horseshoe!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Some of the answers didn't make sense or were not what I would do:<br />
<br />
When your friends are having a disagreement, what would you do?  <br />
<br />
Find out why they are ruining MY day with their trivial bull****, tke them to the local strip club and settle the argument over beers and dollar bills.<br />
<br />
(Note this works for either gender)<br />
One of your best buds gets in a fight with a bully. What do you do?  <br />
<br />
Look around.If we are alone, pull out my concealed 9mm with right to carry permit and inform said bully that I am a darned good shot.<br />
<br />
If in a club, do a roundhouse kick to the side of his knee (8 pounds to collapse), drop him to the ground and take his girlfriend.<br />
<br />
Alright, your friend got the living daylights kicked out of him and he's in the hospital. What do you do?  <br />
<br />
Strippers with beers.<br />
 <br />
Your friend gets out of the hospital and tells you he's going to stab the bully. Oh no! You...  <br />
<br />
Inform him that that has been taken care of.  Failing to act prematurely, I am his or her airtight alibi. <br />
<br />
<br />
 Your friend changes his mind, but suddenly becomes very depressed. What do you do?  <br />
<br />
Strippers with beers.<br />
<br />
Your friend becomes even more depressed and is about to jump from a building. Thinking quickly, you: <br />
<br />
Tackle him, subdue him (arm bar or wrist lock), take him to the strip club for:<br />
<br />
Strippers with beers.<br />
<br />
Well, you couldn't save your friend and he is dead. While sitting at home sulking, police suddenly burst down the door and handcuff you on the charge of first degree murder of your friend. What do you do?  <br />
<br />
Call Johhny Cochrane.<br />
 <br />
Well, the justice system failed you and you're in prison. That sucks. What do you do?   <br />
<br />
Take a week and figure out how to run the place from the inside.  Watch my six.<br />
<br />
Somehow you escape from the prison, and you're on the run. You see policemen chasing after you. What do you do?  <br />
<br />
Escape and evade.  Disappear forever from the landscape.</div></div><hr />
