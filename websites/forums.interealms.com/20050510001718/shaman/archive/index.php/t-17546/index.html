<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm not looking for a spoiler, just basic information on what to expect. I can formulate my own strategy. The thing is, I can't find *any* information on this trial. It's one of the few flags I'm missing for Elemental access, so I've taken it upon myself to collect various others who are missing this flag (be it initiates, applicants, full members of other guilds, etc...) and get the trials done. I have enough information on Alekson garn and Rydda'Dar to feel confident in leading those raids, but there is no information anywhere on Rhaliq Trell.<br />
<br />
So, can anyone who has done this trial shed some light on it? Alekson Garn is the Virgins trial, Trydan Faye is the Rydda'Dar Trial, and this guy is ... ?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The villagers. A bunch of NPCs spawn and stand around while a bunch of stuff in another room tries to come and kill you and them I guess. Stategy is pretty much like Maidens but easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, its essentially the maidens trial without a named in each room after you clear it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No time limit on it either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a time limit.<br />
<br />
What I do is this:  Have the raid split up in to two groups (but still in one raid window).  One group goes to the southwest corner, the other goes to the northeast corner. Knights and rangers kite mobs in the second room while pullers bring them in one at a time to the two waiting groups.<br />
<br />
You don't have to split your raid up, but I've found that it works better that way.  You ARE on the clock, and for some reason, two smaller groups work much more efficiently than one big zerg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for all the information thus far! <br />
<br />
What's the timer on this event?</div></div><hr />
