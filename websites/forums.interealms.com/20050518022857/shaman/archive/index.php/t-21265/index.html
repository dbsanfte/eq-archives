<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm not going to make this long because you've already read this post 100 times in the last few months.  The game went from being fun and addictive to being crappy and addictive.  I finally broke the addiction, so I see no reason to ever go back.<br />

I've spent 231 days of the last two and a half years of my life playing this game.  That is way too much time.  However, I had a lot of fun and now that I am retiring, I can look back and see that I accomplished a lot:<br />

To the Crucible:<br />

<br />
Thanks for giving me a place to post for the last few years.  I learned a lot from this board in my earlier days, and I hope people learned a little from me as well.<br />
<br />
To Sony:<br />

SOE devs if you ever read this:  Screw you for your incompetence and apathy:  you ruined a great thing.  However, I'm more angry at myself for putting up with it for so long than I am angry with you.<br />
<br />
I had to end it where it all started.  Looking at this screenshot brings a tear to my eye :(<br />

Hopefully I'll see you all again in another game (but it sure won't be EQ2).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Smartass with a God-complex, and a damn good shaman as well :).<br />
<br />
Hopefully you're not leaving SolRoRage as well?<br />
<br />
You'll be missed either way, have fun in college.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">thanks for the posts and good time. RIP!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sadly that brings a tear to my eye too.<br />
<br />
I havent done my final camp out, i canceled my billing after i deleted my EQ folder, but sometime before my billing ends im going to camp in halas and take my last screenies to help remember the good times in EQ.<br />
<br />
Its truly sad and i feel that same pain, that the magic is gone and it didnt need to go.<br />
<br />
I hope you stick around here and stay in contact. I know i wouldnt mind bumping into you in a different game.<br />
<br />
Anyway, take care Jin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ah, Jin...I'll miss you.<br />

<br />
Will miss your wit and the sometimes scathing delivery of said wit.  Your's is another name that I shall always look for in any game I play now...<br />
<br />
Good luck with all you do.<br />
<br />
Is it true what I've heard about people?<br />
Do they become stars when they die?<br />
Then I looked up at the brightest star<br />
Up there in the dark gray sky.<br />
<br />
Staring out the window<br />
And up at the sky,<br />
I look at that star<br />
And say, Talayeh Goodbye.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Im begining to wonder if anyone will be left on this forum that actualy plays EQ heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Laters Jin, see ya around I hope in the next big one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">/salute. One of the last great ones has retired..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">/salute  to one of the greats!  Good travels Jin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">See you, man, sorry to see you go.<br />
<br />
Btw, nobody should expect someone of the same name on another game or anywhere on the internet to be the same person as a guy you see here.<br />
<br />
I can't even sign on anywhere these days without finding four of the seven names I've ever used online being taken up, and with every possible variation.  No matter where it is, I've  seen endless Blargs now or variations or Blarg.  Anything halfway decent or interesting gets snatched.   <br />
<br />
And that's just original stuff that has a nice ring to it.  Common stuff is even worse. For instance, I've probably seen, oh, 25 or so variations on my friend Vladimyr's name.  Now when he shows up in any channels anywhere, half the people around mistake him for somebody else.<br />
<br />
Which I guess is at least partly to say, don't blame the original for the crimes of the imitators.  Or assume you're talking to the same guy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thanks for being here Jin. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hope you'll still lurk here from time to time.<br />
<br />
It seems that all the &quot;old skool&quot; Shaman are leaving in droves, but if it's not fun then you shouldn't play.<br />
<br />
Good luck, and take care!</div></div><hr />
