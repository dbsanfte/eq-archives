	<p>Lord Yelinak Paranoid?<br />
<br />
On the heels of the sudden and unexpected takeover of the Sleeper's Tomb by the Followers of Kerafyrm, Lord Yelinak found it necessary to increase security inside the Skyshrine. Choosing to decommission many of the constructs that served as the former and relatively inefficient guardians of the shrine, he has appealed to Dragon Kin for assistance with patrolling the halls of the Skyshrine, to keep it safe from intruders. <br />
<br />
What new dangers and treasures await those that choose to venture into the Skyshrine remain to be seen. The newly revamped Skyshrine will offer excitement, challenge, new quests and encounters for both the allies and the enemies of the Claws of Veeshan! <br />
<br />
(The new Skyshrine will be available after the patch on Thursday, 9/26/02) <br />
<br />
Safe hunting!<br />

	<p>Look Yelinak, the rest of the dragons and I have been having a bit of a chat. Well, trying to, but members of the commitee keep getting ganked by hordes of little rodents about 30 minutes after they get out of bed. Anyway, we think we've come up with a great way to increase dragon security. It's a bit revolutionary, but we think it has promise.<br />
<br />
... Stop issuing all the dragons with magical gear best suited to a 6' tall bipedal humanoid.<br />
<br />
You might want to look again, but most of the kin tend to be on the large scale. Meanwhile the thick scales and huge claws tend to cut down on our need for breastplates and broadswords. <br />
<br />
I suspect that you've tried to save some money by contracting those dwarves again. Try and keep it straight, they don't like us that much. And just because it says "dragon armor" on the invoice doesn't mean it actually is.<br />
<br />
Anyway, must dash... the raid party looks like they've finished buffing so it's time for me to do my thing.</p>

	<p>I did a LOT of wandering in Skyshrine last night and boy I got to tell ya there have been some changes. I have found some new quests, unfortunately it seems like many of them are broken. <br />
<br />
Many of the mobs in the City and lower tower are now green. As you head to the upper tower they get progessively harder. The mobs are now more tightly packed.<br />
<br />
For those of you interested I will include the edited text of my venture. I believe I hailed many if not all of the new NPCs. THis is long and carries much of the lore of the dragons and Kerafym.<br />
<br />
Sun Sep 29 22:48:00 2002] Logging to 'eqlog.txt' is now *ON*.<br />
[Sun Sep 29 22:48:02 2002] Kikimora tells the group, 'okay'<br />
[Sun Sep 29 22:48:04 2002] You say, 'Hail, Jortreva the Crusader'<br />
[Sun Sep 29 22:48:05 2002] Jortreva the Crusader lifts her wings in a graceful motion as she lowers her chin to eye Ironhand in greetings, ''I am Jortreva, Crusader of Veeshan. I am the ear to the whispers upon the shadows and the eyes to witness the tainted footsteps of our enemies that corrupt our path. Your kind, the second generation of the lesser gods' creation, have brought us into being as we are now -- for that, we hold neither gratitude nor contempt. It is your actions that have sent us spiraling through an umbra of immeasurable danger that could secure the destruction of all upon this world, but it shall be through the undying efforts of the [champions] that we may have some chance to ward this darkness back into the oblivion it strives to create.''<br />
[Sun Sep 29 22:48:25 2002] You say, 'What are champions?'<br />
[Sun Sep 29 22:48:25 2002] Jortreva the Crusader says ''We are four elemental dragons bred to be champions among our people -- within this world. We do not seek recognition or praise from either world -- yours or that of Veeshan's brood -- but we seek to protect and maintain the balance that keeps our worlds separate, yet unified upon the same plane of existence. When Kerafyrm was first placed into stasis by our predecessors, the elemental warders, the [council] ordered the arranged breeding of what would be the warders' replacements when the time came for their stations to ascend. However, the unpredicted actions of the second generation have thrown us into a new role -- the role of Crusaders.'''<br />
[Sun Sep 29 22:48:38 2002] An Elder Ruby Drake begins to cast a spell.<br />
[Sun Sep 29 22:48:39 2002] You say, 'What council?'<br />
[Sun Sep 29 22:48:39 2002] Jortreva the Crusader says ''When dragon kind was accompanied upon this world by the lesser god's intrusion, the council of elders was formed. Immediately our ancestors realized the need for our kind to be of sound unification if we were to prevail and remain the superior beings upon what is rightfully our world. As we watched the eras pass through both the second generation and our own cultures, the members of the council changed. Eventually, one known as Kildrukaun would be appointed Arch Priest of Veeshan through divine rite and ceremony -- a sacred part of our institution that I shall not divulge to one as yourself. His first decree would be to condemn the unification of souls between dragons whose elemental influences were of opposition. It was of his belief, and thus the belief of the council, that such a union was against Veeshan's will and would have dire consequences upon the entire dragon nation. Time would pass again before [fate] would descend upon Kildrukaun's decree.'''<br />
[Sun Sep 29 22:48:42 2002] An Elder Ruby Drake begins to cast a spell.<br />
[Sun Sep 29 22:48:47 2002] You say, 'What fate?'<br />
[Sun Sep 29 22:48:47 2002] Jortreva the Crusader says ''Two dragons of opposite elemental powers confronted the council with their desire to mate. Kildrukaun immediately dismissed any blessing and ordered the dragons from ever fulfilling their desires. These two were young still and very headstrong, regarding the council and its rules to be outdated when considering the growing influence and power of the second generation. They fled to unknown corners of Norrath and there, they bound their souls in a sacred union that would forge the first prismatic dragon. When knowledge of this event came to the council, Kildrukaun, a being of great wisdom and calm heart for regard of his own people looked upon the prismatic's creation as that of Veeshan's will, for conceivably unto him, only Veeshan herself could defy her great priest's rule. The council was in agreement and the hatchling, who would be named Kerafyrm, the Prophetic Savior, was allowed to continue existence under close watch that would be [governed by Kildrukaun himself].'''<br />
[Sun Sep 29 22:48:53 2002] You say, 'How was it governed by Kildrukaun himself?'<br />
[Sun Sep 29 22:48:53 2002] Jortreva the Crusader says ''Although Kildrukaun was inspired and intrigued by Kerafyrm's existence, he was wary still for he had yet to be witness to the true intent of Veeshan's will. In this time, the dragon nation had split and were in opposing power -- the Ring of Scale whom fled their native Velious for Kunark, and the Claws of Veeshan, the original order and council of dragon kind. It was known that Kildrukaun was furious with the recent division and he strongly believed that it was Veeshan's will for the dragon nations to reunite once again, lest they become as weak and pitiful as the second generation. He viewed Kerafyrm to be the road that would guide the dragons to unification, although it was a unification that would be borne of an unknown purpose that Kerafyrm served. Kildrukaun never interacted with the young prismatic dragon, but served as the dictator behind his mentors. Eventually, Kerafyrm would rise to a power unseen within any dragon of his still fledgling age and Kildrukaun's [prophecy] would be born.''<br />
[Sun Sep 29 22:48:59 2002] You say, 'What Prophecy?'<br />
[Sun Sep 29 22:48:59 2002] Jortreva the Crusader says ''Kildrukaun was of the mind that Kerafyrm was meant to lead the dragon nation in a civil war -- the Claws of Veeshan invading the great mountain fortress known as Veeshan's Peak that the Ring of Scale had established. He was certain that his campaign would unify the dragons and this was nothing less than the will of Veeshan herself. The council dismissed Kildrukaun's prophecy, exclaiming that although they must find a way to bring the Ring of Scale back under the wing of the elder council, they could not wage a war and abandon the threat of Kael Drakkal. Kildrukaun was furious, although he did not confront the council directly. Over the passing centuries, he would sway three of the [council elders] to his side and would personally oversee Kerafyrm's final stages of growth. Eventually the time would come when the council would [recognize their mistake] in allowing Kerafyrm to exist and their order for his termination would be the greatest impact in their destiny.''<br />
[Sun Sep 29 22:49:13 2002] You say, 'What council elders?'<br />
[Sun Sep 29 22:49:13 2002] Jortreva the Crusader says ''When dragon kind was accompanied upon this world by the lesser god's intrusion, the council of elders was formed. Immediately our ancestors realized the need for our kind to be of sound unification if we were to prevail and remain the superior beings upon what is rightfully our world. As we watched the eras pass through both the second generation and our own cultures, the members of the council changed. Eventually, one known as Kildrukaun would be appointed Arch Priest of Veeshan through divine rite and ceremony -- a sacred part of our institution that I shall not divulge to one as yourself. His first decree would be to condemn the unification of souls between dragons whose elemental influences were of opposition. It was of his belief, and thus the belief of the council, that such a union was against Veeshan's will and would have dire consequences upon the entire dragon nation. Time would pass again before [fate] would descend upon Kildrukaun's decree.'''<br />

[Sun Sep 29 22:49:48 2002] Jortreva the Crusader says ''Kerafyrm quickly ascended the ranks within the Claws of Veeshan and eventually became our most powerful general. He led several successful campaigns against the rising threat of the giants of Kael and his influence grew among the elders of the council. However, something dark grew within him -- his bite became venomous and his talon ruthless in its command over his troops and allies. Eventually, his dominion and influence was nothing short of a monstrous creature of pure malignant hatred and an unrivaled lust for destruction and chaos that the council had no other choice but to demand his destruction -- a rule that Kildrukaun was present to hear and deceitfully condone. Shortly thereafter, Kildrukaun and four council elders whom the arch priest had managed to sway with his charismatic diplomacy and sound argument of his prophecy flew to Kerafyrm's side, where the four of them made preparations for the inevitable [war] to come.'''<br />

[Sun Sep 29 22:50:42 2002] Jortreva the Crusader says ''Although short lived, the war between Kerafyrm's legions and those of the Claws of Veeshan would be a near crippling blow to the survival of the elder dragon council upon Velious. Kerafyrm's legions were severely outnumbered by those of the elder council, but time and time again they displayed their awesome strength and power. Eventually, Kerafyrm was restrained and taken to what would be his place of indefinite slumber. The four traitorous elders fled Velious safely to unknown locations, where they would lay in wait until the time came that Kerafyrm would be released. After centuries of hiding, the Ancients have returned and they now have a near unbreakable hold upon the former tomb of their master, where again they lay in wait -- anticipating the arrival of their master and the time to execute the undoubtedly phenomenal plan that will [bring about the extinction of all great existence] upon Norrath if they are successful.'''<br />

The Sleeper is free and his power grows with every passing moment -- a threat that has descended upon the steel of second generation warriors. You have condemned yourself, as you have since the dawn of your creation, but your actions guided by shallow lusts for power and fame within your fledgling insignificance has spilled into the ancient world that cradles your very existence.

Despite your past actions, having proven beneficial to us in some cause, your recent endeavors that have released Kerafyrm have shown the true hollow of your wasting existing. This does not mean that we have dismissed those of you whom would wish to continue their allegiance to the Claws of Veeshan. It is time for the tides to shift and for your shallow lusts to become discarded for a more [meaningful cause].'<br />
[Mon Sep 30 00:20:25 2002] You say, 'What meaningful cause?'<br />
[Mon Sep 30 00:20:25 2002] Charayan the Crusader says ''When Kerafyrm had proven his mad, relentless nature that opposed all we had established since the dawn of our existence, the elder council of the Claws of Veeshan ordered Kerafyrm's destruction as an absolute necessity to escape existence as slaves to the tyranny of a mad abomination. During this time, Kerafyrm had established allies within the Velious nation -- amongst these allies were four elders upon the very council that sought to destroy him. Kildrukaun, the former Arch Priest of Veeshan and driving force behind the original decree that forbade the existence of creatures such as Kerafyrm was the first to betray the Claws of Veeshan. Vyskudra, the magnificent dragon of the storms and only one of her kind to exist followed the lead of her patron and master. Third was Tjudawos, the scholar of the council. Lastly was Zeixshi-Kar, the general among the Claws of Veeshan who engaged within the fledgling war with the giants of Kael that would last for centuries beyond her departure. These four elders would be'<br />

These all are in the top of the tower. Currently all of the Velious armor quest mobs are much lower in the tower. They are in the first room on your left after you hit the first right click globe.<br />

Now for the minor quests in lower SS. Looks like they are in the middle of implementing these as well, and one of these is definitely a bard quest. I have no clue as to whether or not the others are class specific. Also many of these involve WL.<br />

[Mon Sep 30 00:37:19 2002] Iago Sabuela says 'Excellent. With the help of the texts provided me by the dragon-kin here in Skyshrine I have narrowed my search down to a few locations where I believe the artifacts I seek may be hiding. Before the artifacts may be recovered however you will need a special container in which to store them in. They are quite old and who knows what condition they may be in. I am missing some materials that are necessary for the insulation of the container thus it would be appreciated if you could provide me with a [crystalline silk mesh] and two [oily goo secretions] I will finish the construction of the artifact container and provide with the information I have obtained of the lost artifacts.'<br />

[Mon Sep 30 00:43:58 2002] Liason Dolvak says 'So it shall be then that you will perform a task for the kin. As it happens, I was on a mission to speak with a [contact] of the shrine in the lands that do not sleep. This contact has vital information on the movements of the giants in that region and it is most important that we recover that information.

[Mon Sep 30 00:44:07 2002] Liason Dolvak says 'Her name is Eysa Florawhisper. She is a Countess from the Tunarean Court, of whom we are allied with in this fight against the giants. The court does not want the giants encroaching on the lands of Tunare, for they fear that the giants will cause great harm to the area, should they be allowed to control it. As you can see, this gives us a common enemy, which has forged an even stronger alliance between our two peoples. If you can deliver this report to her in my stead, she will give you the documents we need.'<br />

She should give you an in depth report of the efforts of the Court to date and will allow us to further organize our raids and defenses accordingly. Make haste with this assignment, for we do not know exactly when they will attack next.'<br />

Here is a binding that can be used to store the sections of the tome should you come across them in your explorations.

The dragons and dragon-kin of Skyshrine have need of capable warriors to aid in the war with the giants of Kael Drakkel. Do not consider this a sign of weakness, even the most powerful beings benefit from having friends and allies. The Giants too have many beings in their service, Ogres, Trolls, and unfortunately even Northmen like myself have been hired into the service of the Kromzek. These mercenaries must be put down, perhaps if enough of them are slain, other sell swords would be deterred from seeking the employment of the Kromzek. The dragon-kin have placed a [bounty] on the lives of the Kromzeks mercenaries, any aid you can provide to the Skyshrine would be well rewarded.'<br />

These captains command various units of mercenaries, usually those of their own race. The military prowess of the Kromzek, Kromrif, and their followers should not be underestimated. These individuals are very good at what they have been hired to achieve. There is a bounty available for the personalized mercenary brooches of Captain Glarg, Captain Ulmog, and Captain Mc'Hersh. Recover all three of the brooches and return them to me as proof of the captains deaths and I shall reward you from the treasure coffers of Skyshrine.'<br />

The four mercenaries can usually be found together hunting dragons and dragon-kin. The first of these despicable individuals is a human by the name of Julius Oresco, a warrior of great skill. Julius' dragon hunting band is composed of the Dwarf, Grenth Drakebane, the erudite, Sadeem Oujva, and the northman, Rontar O'Karn.
