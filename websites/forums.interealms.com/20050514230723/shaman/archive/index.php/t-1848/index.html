<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A little question:<br />
<br />
After a servertransfer, i will be naked.<br />
<br />
Question: To get my epic back after a move, is it enough to have someone hand in the tear from iksar child, loot the scales and give it to the final epic mob? I have not MQed anything on epic faction, so my faction is still maxed out.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the input guys<br />
<br />
Edit: spelling</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Quanit Icebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes that will work, providing that the person that has the tear, also has their shaman epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Moving servers has changed, you keep your epic now.  I believe this was done because the Mage epic is a scribed spell so it was a little unfair that they would keep their epic and all other classes would lose theirs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Leebae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">where did you here this? i moved an epic shaman recently and lost my epic along with all other equip</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ask the wisp for a new shield<br />
Kill the Black Dire for the boots<br />
Let a shaman who has already his Epic hand the tear<br />
Complete it<br />
<br />
Maybe the mage keep it as it's a scribed spell, but we are the only ones who need just one item to have it back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Since it is based on faction, you should be able to hand in a tear yourself or have another epic shaman do it.  Then just turn in the item and presto, epic.</div></div><hr />
