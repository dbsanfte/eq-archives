<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I posted this over at the EQ boards just for curiousity sake.  Just wondered if anyone here had any comments.  Probably completely infeasible from a programming standpoint, but kind of a fun intellectual analysis.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, the developers are actually going to look at shaman now that a third of the end-game shaman have retired and/or changed classes.  That got me to thinking . . . what can they do?  Heal over time and damage over time spells are not well designed for a short-fight situations.  Nor does that only affect shaman.  Necros, druids, enchanters, and BLs come to mind as well.<br />
 <br />
I've posted some discussions on balancing before, but I was curious about a thought I had the other day.  DoT classes are kind of screwed in short fight situations (GoD and, from developer comments at fan fair, likely all future expansions).  So from everyone's perspective (NOT just endgame), what do you think the effects would be if they could code something like the following:<br />
 <br />
DoTs (from all DoT classes/procs/items) do the same damage, but <br />
 <br />
(a) do damage every 3 seconds instead of 6 (ie maybe 210 every 3 seconds instead of 420 every 6)<br />
(b) take mana each damage tic or half-tic (spell costs 400 mana and lasts 5 tics, it would take 80/tic before AAs or focus item effects)<br />
(c) the DoT will end when target dies<br />
(d) make casting times substantially faster<br />
 <br />
From what I see at a first pass, it preserves the damage already set, so won't unbalance classes substantially in terms of dps adjustments.  It makes DoTs mana efficient in short term fights if they cut off when the target is dead and the mana is only used as damage is done.  The cast times would allow a DoT class to stack a couple before the mob died.  The faster damage (every 3 seconds) would allow damage in short-fight situations with no real increase to average dps.<br />
 <br />
Thoughts?  Completely outside programming difficulties (which would probably be substantial), what would the above unbalance?  I'm sure I've missed something!<br />
 <br />
Chutoi&quot;<br />
<br />
What do you guys think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Anjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There would still be agro issues that might prevent the use of DoTs regardless of the below changes and there are mana efficiency issues that still haven't been dealt with.  So long as the caster has to rush to cast the spell as early as possible in the fight in order to do reasonable damage, the immense agro that some DoTs provide will prohibit their use in normal groups.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I think there's also mana efficiency issues associated with DoTs that hasn't been addressed.  So long as a DoT is non-stackable by a single person, partially stackable for an entire raid (30 effects on a mob maximum), and prevents mezzing until the DoT has run its course, then I think that there should be very substantial mana efficiencies associated with their use over that of a DD.  There should be some reason you'd take the added penalties for DoTs over DD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A 5 tick dot like Bane cut down to 2.5 ticks might make the dot more usefull, but with poisen dots, the aggro generation is still too insane for regular use.  Even with spell casting sublty, dropping 2 high damage dots and tagging a slow would likely earn you a beating and piss off the MA in any group.  Meanwhile the wizard is still dropping bombs for more damage and isn't even close to you on the aggro list.  I guess this is as it should be, but I'd still be concerned with aggro generation and this would be more of a limit on damage potential than time once times were shaved.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, it's a constructive improvement, but for all the work that would go into it and the greif we'd likely suffer for not having time limits on foucus items upgraded (IE: ala Bane not working on BA4 items till they dicked with the min duration on the items) it doesn't seem that it would make a huge difference.<br />
<br />
Personally, I see the solution in combo spells on single saves (ie: a DD spell thats not great on damage but comes coupled with a semi-useful debuff thats lure-ish).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As great at it'd be in group situations, the soloing power would be through the roof.<br />
<br />
I'd love to see something like this but there would be a lot of outrage from non-dot classes seeing Necros, Shamans and Druids having their soloing time cut down by half. <br />
<br />
If there was a way to code it so that only poison or curse based dots would work on a 3 sec timer then maybe, but that's even more unlikely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's a nice thought, which has actually been brought up previously.<br />
<br />
However, I think it will be a coding nightmare. How do you deal with dots landed by someone who goes LD, zones or dies? How do you deal with the dotted target zoning (pvp)? The dot loses its 'owner' in all those cases, making it very hard to pay the manacost.<br />
<br />
The only way I can see of making this work is to turn dots into dual-icon spells, a'la necro BondOfDeath series. Dot icon on target doing dmg, respective mana-draining counterpart on the shaman who casted the dot.<br />
<br />
Problems arise here too. Every shaman would need at least five more buff slots with this scenario. How do you deal with a dot that gets cured/dispelled? Is there a way to code the mana-draining part to be truly linked to the dmg-part and end whenever the other ends, for whatever reason? Add on stacking issues and you get a mess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think the problem with DoTs in general is that they are DoTs. For short fights if you were to reduce their duration they would become essentially nukes if it were done in a way to make them feasible. Increasing the damage/tick for example would have the effect of increasing shaman dps, and that might have consequences in areas outside of GoD. Offhand I dont know what the solution to the problem is, but it would appear that DoTs are largely obsolete in the modern game, at least as far as single group content is concerned. Personally I don't see that making the damage proceed at half ticks would do much. You wouldn't be dropping a doT on a mob that died so fast that half a tick made a significant difference.<br />
<br />
A few ways to make them more usefull would be:<br />
<br />
1) Have mana consumption per tick rather than on casting, so if a 10 tick DoT lasted 3 ticks because that is how long a mob lived, it would consume 3/10ths of the mana. If the caster ran out of mana while the DoT was in progress it would fade. Pretty much it could operate in the same way as discs do now. Since the code is allready in existance for those, I dont see why they couldnt change doTs to operate in a similar way.<br />
<br />
2) Add a focus or AA skill that worked only on GoD+ mobs, which reduced DoT casting time by X%. Because DoTs do damage over a duration, there isnt much reason for their casting times to be anything longer than a few seconds, and casting time is what really hurts on short fights.<br />
<br />
3) Get rid of the counter agro associated with many DoTs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kenneth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">How about a buff which takes a percentage of your aggro and transfers it to the target of the buff?  It could have DoT like duration and work on aggro that you build while the buff is active -- hopefully making it desirable for you build aggro through DoTs but balanced in way that would still allow you to build too much aggro and gain the mob's attention.<br />
<br />
Just thinking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Anjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Not sure that I think casting time on DoTs makes a difference one way or another in a group.  Frankly, I wouldn't use disease DoTs on mobs even if the casting time was 2.0 seconds.  When the spell has a duration of 1+ minute, a second or two difference in casting time means little to me IF I'm not getting pummeled at the time and if my spell's going to run anywhere near duration.  The only time it matters to me is when I'm soloing and then only for spells that prevent the mob from getting to me (root, darkness, snare, stun, etc).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">That is true, however, we are discussing situations where fights are a lot shorter than full duration. In those situations the time taken to cast a DoT, and the efficiency of it are important considerations. At some point nukes become more efficient, and I suspect that is the case for allmost all of GoD, of not all it. In order for DoTs to have any sort of place in short fights, the efficiency aspect and casting speed need to be adjusted. The efficiency aspect could be applied across the entire game without unbalancing things I think. Reducing casting time might have affects in older content, particularly with the short duration DoTs such as the LDoN ones, but I'm not sure to what extent it might be an issue there from a balance point of view.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">add -500 aggro to every dot is a start</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">the aggro on dots is ridiculous.  I'd say that BUG is the first thing they should look into.  <br />
<br />
Was messing around last night and 1 crit tick of Bane is enough to pull agro off a tank, with a good weapon+Anger aug, when the mob is at less than 50% health.  Bane does 70-100dps depending on focus, for 30 seconds.  A crit tick is like 800-1200 dmg, if every single tick for the duration of the dot crit for max dmg (around 1200 for me with Echo of Trusik+burning affliction)...it would be 200dps.  <br />
<br />
I wasn't casting anything on the mobs I was fighting last night, just bane.  They were unslowable and had a mage doing mala, cause I am lazy.  The mage was chain nuking with Rock of Taelosia, doing up to like 2000 dmg ever 6 seconds + super pet and I was the one who would get agro if Bane had a crit tick.  Rogues, Monks and Rangers in my groups are certainly doing more than 70-100dps and they don't pull agro like me.  Heck, I think the bard in my group is doing 100dps too and he doesn't get summoned.<br />
<br />
Damage is damage.  Why do DoT users have to have such a high penalty for theirs?  Summoning me for Bane dmg aggro when I am doing the lowest DPS in group is just ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Oh, and Spell Casting Subtlety doesnt seem to help with DoT agro one bit.  What's up with that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Anjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">When you're casting a DoT in a fast paced environment, I still don't see how cast times have much effect on their use.  If the DoT gives me 400 damage / tick and lasts 10 ticks, that's 60 seconds for full use.  The cast time added onto that adds only about 5 seconds to the time required for full use of the spell.<br />
<br />
If the DoT goes full duration, then I've done 4000 damage in 65 seconds.  Mathematically, going from 65 to even 60 seconds (instant cast) doesn't change the DPS significantly, doesn't change the mana / HP damage.<br />
<br />
If the DoT doesn't go full duration, the only thing that lowering the cast time can do is to give me a chance of getting one additional tick's worth of damage (difference in cast time / 6 seconds per tick * 100%).  Shave 3 seconds off the cast time, for example, and there's a 50% chance that I'll get one additional tick.  Sure, that would be useful, but I don't think it a dramatic change in the behavior of DoTs and certainly not enough to persuade me that DoTs are more useful than DDs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Actually, while this is kind of an intellectual exercise, that was the point of the changes I mentioned.  If they cast fast, they can be stacked quickly on mobs even in short duration fights.  If the mana is averaged per tic, and the DoT drops off when the mob dies, suddenly it becomes mana efficient no matter when you cast it.  Even if you cast it 3 seconds before the mob dies, it might use 400/5 = 80 mana in that one tic and then shut off.<br />
<br />
The thing is, while this change would filter back down to younger shaman and other DoT classes, I don't see how it could be that overpowering.  When I said it should do damage every 3 seconds, I don't mean decrease the life of the dot, I mean it should do half a tic's worth of damage every 3 seconds.  Thus, applied to bane, rather than do 420 every 6 seconds, it'd do 210 every 3 seconds for the same overall duration.<br />
<br />
It'd be like a tap from a necro.  Damage to mob, but -mana to the shaman.<br />
<br />
Essentially, I was just kinda trying to think of something to make us competitive without totally changing the character of the class.  It forces mana efficiency on us, and allows us to do quick dps without really changing our average dps figure.<br />
<br />
Agro, of course, remains a problem, but one thing to consider--we've had that agro all along.  Irritating, even galling, it may be, but we've had it for long enough that most of us can work around it, or work with it.  I'm not saying that the agro shouldn't also be addressed, but I think the DoT changes (with some burst healing) might actually make us playable again.<br />
<br />
I dunno.  As I said, I'm kinda talking out of my butt here.  I just hate throwing all these problems at SoE without some kind of an answer, mostly because I don't want to end up as a druid lite(tm).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think something should be done with our dots. I do like the idea about the 3 tick deal, screw the soloing aspect, give them to the clerics and wizards too if they complain for all I care. I always thought dots were suppose to be more effiecient then dd, but they are only more effecient for us, then our lame DD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Anything with a benefit spread out over time needs to be stronger than instant gratification. This currently isnt the case, and hasnt been since pop came out.<br />
<br />
All focii applied towards dots needs to be significantly stronger than nuke focii. Burning Affliction should be about 30/35% increase,a nd scale up from there (not to mention actually be more common). Before we begin shedding tears for nuke classes, remember when dots did more damage for less mana than the best wizard nuke? Since we appear saddled with stupid %'s on healing, lets get back to %'s on dots vs nukes. A little more damage over 42 seconds than the best wizard nuke for less damage. <br />
<br />
Aggro needs to go down. Reduce the poison counters on high end dots. You can always use cripple if you want aggro. Boohoo, screws pvp. I personally dont care, balance shouldnt be based around broken pvp anyways. Not like they can landy any spells at the end with everyone w 300+ resists.<br />
<br />
Cast times need to go down. Like 1 second or so. On Bane/Blood etc, you have to wait 6 seconds after it lands before the first drop of damage is dealt, at least make the cast time faster.<br />
<br />
Move BoS and BoN to banes timer. Move Pox and Breath to 42 second timer. More damage in shorter times.<br />
<br />
For the love of god, remove the recast time from Bane. Its not that good a spell.<br />
<br />
Do I want dots to kick ass? Obviously. They did at one point, no reason for them to not anymore.</div></div><hr />

poison counters are a different bag altogether. chanter and shaman slowing class balance is strung on the aggro of poison counters.  Thus I get the feeling that asking for change here is a bag of worms.<br />

this is just ridiculous. I think I've blinked ten times so far, re-reading, that the mob was at 50% health and the crit still got you aggro. Then I checked and noticed you had SCS on top of that.<br />

what mobs are you talking about here Hennie?</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Heh, dunno if the mob really matters much.  It was some mob in Torment though, one of the unslowable trash variety that you clear for getting Orbs.  There's a whole bunch of them in one area, we were fighting the particular type for a while.  <br />
<br />
I've got health of target's target, so it's real easy to see when I gain agro.  Crit tick, MT name replaced by Henora on my little window.  Usually the MT gets it back right away and so I don't even notice, but really, I should never ever be taking agro away from the MT in that situation.  I don't think he was inciting all the mobs, we were being lazy.  His DPS alone is more than mine with bane and so I should never be able to pull agro in this type of situation.  Whether he is taunting, inciting or not...he has anger on his weapon, for pete's sake.  Last night I was watching (it's a pain in the ass to look at your dot damage, since it cannot be filtered out with other spell damage) this behavior cause I was bored and noticed (along with my group) that it was happening way too often.<br />
<br />
Echo of Trusik (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4872&amp;source=Test) is a bard song, it is the upgrade to Rizlona/Muse.  It has spell damage focus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Anjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">True, Chutoi, we've had the agro all along and it's always been a component of DoTs.  In the past, however, fights used to last a couple of minutes and we could afford to wait 20 or 30 seconds before we cast our DoT on the mob to let the MT get firm agro.  Wait 30 seconds now and the mob's already dead before you cast.<br />
<br />
On the one hand, the ability for warriors to generate agro in the short term has gone up so it would presumably no longer be necessary to wait 30 seconds before casting Envenomed Bolt in today's environment.  I'm afraid, though, that the agro produced by our DoTs has also gone up since the days of Envenomed Bolt and that we still have to wait a significant amount of time before we can reliably cast poison DoTs without pulling agro.  We just don't seem to have that luxury any longer, I'm afraid.<br />
<br />
While I think scaling the mana costs according to the actual effect you have would improve the situation, I don't see this improving our lot in life significantly either.  Frankly, mana's not the issue preventing me from casting DoTs in almost any situation.  It's a matter of DPS and the limited time I have available to me in which I can damage a mob that primarily limits me from casting them, agro generation from those DoTs is a close second.  Obviously, the epic DoT is the just about the most mana efficient DoT you could conceive of (damage with no mana cost), but I haven't used that outside of soloing in a year or two because it's not worth the few seconds it takes me to cast the spell for the &lt;100 hps damage it will do.  I'd rather take the time I would have used to click the epic to instead cast one of our anemic DDs or rain spells to do damage, knowing that I can cannibalize the mana back later.<br />
<br />
If in any way it were possible to upgrade DoTs to once again be viable sources of damage, I think the focus items need to change.  When some classes can maximize their damage output with just one or two items (cold focus DD and magic focus DoT item for druids class, for example), it's silly to have necromancers have to collect poison, magic, fire, and disease based focii for DoTs, generic (or poison if one's available) DD for Neurotoxin, and pet focii to get the same percentage increase to their damage output.  Combine the silly focii, IMO.  Have one item that enhances all poison based damage spells, DoTs and DDs, by differing amounts to match the current individual focus items (30% to DoTs, 20% to DDs is the current numbers on the BA and ID4 items, isn't it?).  By the time you begin including damage increases, efficiencies, reduced cast times, etc, it's hard to make both DoTs and DDs viable options simultaneously for classes that clearly require it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Israi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I doubt thier engine could even do this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Zorash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Greetings,<br />
<br />
An interesting proposition, and I like the direction you're heading.  Mana efficient, burst DPS, along with slightly improved burst healing, and a quick way to slow mobs (tweak BoN a little) and we'd be pretty damn useful again.  Throw in some worthwhile buffs on top of that, and we'd be doing damn fine.<br />
<br />
A small problem with your suggestion, though.  Ticks are 6 seconds.  The tick happens when the client updates against the server.  You can't have things happen in 3 second intervals, can you?  I think that's why a tick is a tick.  That's why if I have a spell that lasts for 31 seconds, it's possible to squeeze 6 ticks out of it instead of 5.  It checks at the beginning of the tick..if the spell is on...it stays on for the full tick.  <br />
<br />
So it'd have to update every 6 seconds...but the idea of cutting off the mana consumption when the mob dies is GREAT.  It wouldn't up our dps, but would up mana efficiency a ton.  That, coupled with some fast casting times, small resist mods on the dots (like necro and druid dots...and wiz/mage/druid nukes) and lower aggro, and we'd be able to add some pretty decent DPS in long OR short fights.  What a novel concept, huh? :)<br />
<br />
And Henora, I'm with you, dots are WAY too much aggro.  Why are we getting penalized for doing LESS DPS than most other classes?  Hell, any melee class can pump out more DPS than one Blood or Bane.  That doesn't seem to stop me from getting crazy aggro with it.  And crit ticks...forget about it, I'm tanking at that point.  They need to re-work counter aggro somehow, without making it easier to remove the dots.  Not an easy task maybe, but needed, imo.<br />
<br />

DoTs where already dead in PoP. Last time I checked the PoTime drops for DoT focus (increased damage) I found TATAA one item! Symbol of the Planemaster (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=20898). And the tanks want to gank it for the proc buff :( Don't know if there are another DoT damage focus item in PoP beside the Sarryn earring and the pottering thingy with BA4. Compare this with the list of ID items...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I doubt they are able to work with half ticks without literally reqwriting the game. DoTs taking mana each tick might be codeable but is probably a lot of work or the necromancer lifetap DoTs would not be working with recourses.<br />
<br />
What certainly is fixable though is the ridiculous aggro on our DoTs. As Henora pointed out taking aggro from people who do more damage then you and are doing their best to generate additional aggro is beyond silly.<br />
<br />
If Chutoi's idea is not possible - which I am pretty sure is the case - you could reach similar results by playing with out existing spell lines.<br />
<br />
Take the Bane line, reduce them to 4 ticks, reduce the cast time to 3 seconds, reduce the mana by 25%, remove all curse counters, add a -100 resist modifier. Oh, and reduce the recast time by 6 seconds.<br />
<br />
A complete DoT revamp would certainly be preferable but I doubt it is feasible beyond fixing the aggro issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>jeyche Deychundei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">i like the idea chutoi,  the only think i would like to add would be make the dots use less mana, theyre not THAT efficent, cost is a little steep, IDK that we got canni... canni is a bane more than a boon, as its an active mana regen, now if canni was passive then sure keep the cost. <br />
<br />
other than that i like the idea, but how about making <br />
disease dots last the length of our current poison ones (as they take to long as it is) - scaled up so that they still deal the same amount of damage. <br />
make the posion ones deal damage/3 sec (as yu said)<br />
and make curses (bane, etc) damage 2/sec <br />

yes i know that its been stated that its hard to do (personally i dont know, im a chemist not a Coder) but then we will have varity in spells to choose from dependant on group kill speed rather than dependant on  resists (or using ultor cos it'll lsat the entire time of the solo kill)</div></div><hr />

I can start chaining rains as soon as my spell gems refresh (Tears and Torrent) and contribute more DPS than my dots would have and never get agro. Just forget about my nukes we've parsed them out and they stink. We're supposed to be able to stack our poison dots up to increase our DPS right? Now you're talking agro!

I was under the impression that because our dots took so longggg to do damage that they should do quite a bit more damage and be quite a bit more effective mana wise.  But we all know what they say about assuming…  Maybe I’m wrong about this but it seems to me that we should do double the damage for having to wait 5 to 6 times longer for our damage to be complete.  To add insult to injury the ability to crit on DD spells has given druids, mages, and wizards the ability to do ungodly damage instantly.  But let me (crosses fingers) crit on a DOT and the tank will work round after round to control agro.  Just doesn’t seem right that from the get go DD spells are better or almost better than something that takes two weeks to kill a mob.  Sorry for the rant.  <br />

DoTs taking mana each tick might be codeable but is probably a lot of work or the necromancer lifetap DoTs would not be working with recourses.<br />
<br />
It may not be that difficult. Currently melee discs work as a sort self-dot that consumes endurance. They can be clicked off, and when endurance runs out the disc fades, even if it still has time on it. DoTs on NPCs are currently tagged with the owner (otherwise you wouldnt get agro while it is running), so it should be possible to code them to tap the caster for mana while running. This is basically the same as discs tapping the casters (=melee) endurance while they run. That way once the caster dies the DoT will fade, conversely once the target dies the mana drain will cease. Similarly, once the caster runs out of mana the Dot will fade, in the same way that melee discs fade when they run out of endurance.<br />
<br />
Doing DoTs that way will confer more general benefits as well - no more dieing to DoTs after a target is dead ;)<br />
<br />
They could even use that aspect of the game to make strategic encounters, by requiring that the caster be within a certain range for the mana tap to continue. That would allow them to introduce much more powerful dots without unbalancing soloing through root/rot tactics.</div></div><hr />

So do you want to have a buff icon for every DoT you cast? What about casting DoTs on several different MOBs? My buff bar is limited as is.<br />
<br />

<br />

It is fundamentally different because the disciplines affect the user - a single spell effect affecting a single user. I can not think of a single spell effect that affects both caster and user. That is currently handled via recourse spells on the caster, which is not feasible for DoTs.</div></div><hr />

Since you would have no control over the DoT other than dieing or runing out of mana you, wouldn't need a buff icon. It would just be something that happened, and would manifest itself on your screen through slow loss of mana.<br />
<br />
<br />
Then why are necro lifetap-over-time spells not coded to not use a buff icon?.<br />
<br />
Because the Necro is deriving a benefit from that spell I suppose. The disc system has icons too, but they are shown on a separate screen. The fact that an icon is not shown does not mean that there is no link - the fact that you can still get agro after it is working, and the fact that it reports its damage to you proves that.<br />

Did you actually read what I said? There is no evidence at all that this is possible with the current game engine and very strong evidence suggesting that you do in fact need the buff icon.<br />
<br />
Because the Necro is deriving a benefit from that spell I suppose. The disc system has icons too, but they are shown on a separate screen.<br />
Well, I guess it might work if we got a separate DoT window with 15 or so slots. And even then we do not know if it possible to code effects that are linked to affect another effect when clicked off. No spell does anything even remotely like this at the moment.<br />
<br />
The fact that an icon is not shown does not mean that there is no link - the fact that you can still get agro after it is working, and the fact that it reports its damage to you proves that.<br />
The fact that it reports damage shows exactly that the effect placed on the MOB has an entry with the name of the creator in it. Not suprising since that entry is needed to attribute aggro anyways.<br />

What? How am I affected by my own Bane? Do I constantly loose mana? Do I gain anything?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can get agro on a tick, the damage is reported to you, you get a message when the dot runs out, these things stop happening if the mob dies before the DoT runs out. If you were not affected by the DoT after it was cast, none of these things would happen. In order to get agro on a tick the program has to know your position on the agro list for the duration of the DoT, so it is connecting you to the mob on a per tick basis allready. You just can't see that connection on your screen.<br />
<br />
If the program knows when you cast the dot, when it does damage and when it is no longer doing damage, it could equally well draw mana at those intervals, and stop doing so when the DoT wore off or the mob died. Don't need an icon for that. Do you need one to have damage reported to you? No. The mechanics are all there, they should be able to code DoTs to work this way.</div></div><hr />

Yes, because the MOB is not triggering them anymore. It is a effect on the MOB, not me.<br />

Look, when you get aggro nothing changes your character. What changes is an attribute of the MOB - the aggro list. When I gain aggro nothing at all changes with me, what happens is that the MOB changes its behavior.<br />

Let me give you a very short example of how damage reporting might be implemented (in pseudo code).<br />
<br />
currently<br />
<br />
class MOB{<br />
    var effects;<br />
<br />
    function addEffect(effect){<br />
        effects[]= effect;<br />
    }<br />
<br />
    onEachTick{<br />
        foreach(effects as effect){<br />
            effect[owner].reportDamageTo(damageTaken);<br />
        }<br />
    }<br />
<br />
<br />
code to be added<br />
<br />
class MOB{<br />
    var myEffects;<br />
<br />
    function removeEffect(effect){<br />
        if(delete(effects[effect]) = successful){<br />
            effect[owner].reportSuccess(effect);<br />
            waitForReply(effect[owner]);<br />
            commitChanges;<br />
        }<br />
<br />
    function reportSuccess(effect){<br />
        if(delete(myEffects[effect] = successful){<br />
            reply(effect[owner]);<br />
            commitChanges;<br />
        }<br />
    }<br />
<br />
class player{<br />
    var myEffects;<br />
<br />
    function removeEffect(effect){<br />
        if(delete(effects[effect]) = successful){<br />
            effect[owner].reportSuccess(effect);<br />
            waitForReply(effect[owner]);<br />
            commitChanges;<br />
        }<br />
<br />
    function reportSuccess(effect){<br />
        if(delete(myEffects[effect] = successful){<br />
            reply(effect[owner]);<br />
            commitChanges;<br />
        }<br />
}<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, the actual code will of course be a lot longer and more involved but that is an example of what you might need to do.<br />
<br />
You are looking at the very least at adding more variables(i.e. memory) to every single entity in the game and a lot of functions which have to wait for confirmations from each other.<br />
<br />
Overall effect: more memory used, more processing power used, countless opportunities for bugs. All for implementing mana-per-tick DoTs.</div></div><hr />

In exactly the same way as discs are done currently. They fade when there is no longer any endurance to pay the cost, likewise if a character is LD, dead or has run out of mana, the DoT would just fade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">DoTs would be cooler if they could somehow continue when a mob dies.<br />
<br />
<br />
Make an AA: Continuance... Instant cast, duration = 1 minute.  Refresh = 3 minutes.<br />
<br />
The target of this AA receives the remainder of any dots that are cast by you but had to end prematurely because a mob died.<br />
<br />
So say a dot is 5 ticks.  You cast a dot on mob A.  You click Continuance on mob B.  Mob A dies after one tick.  Mob B gets that dot with 4 ticks left.<br />
<br />
The same exact dot cast by you on different mobs will not stack-- the higher number of ticks will override the lower number of ticks.<br />
<br />
Maybe do something weird, like the ability to make your dots contagious...<br />
<br />
Or perhaps make them like a mini tears of saryrn centered on the mob ;-P (probably overpowered and pvp players would hate this)<br />
<br />
Or have the option to make it that when a mob dies early the dot ends up on you, and have an AA ability that transfers all detrimental affects on you to a target ;-P<br />
<br />
Or have a Convergence AA, the ability to gather all the dots you've casted and retarget them to somewhere else (but same exact dots cast on different mobs don't stack-- the higher number of ticks overrides the other).<br />
<br />
Okay, all these suggestions are dumb-- I'm allowed to be dumb because I should be studying for a midterm right now...<br />

But the point is, DoTs would be cooler if they could somehow continue when a mob dies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are just making it seem a lot longer by neglecting the player side checks per tick in your hypothetical current code. Since these checks allready take place with discs, that code block has to allready exist in some form in the game. All it would involve is adding a few extra lines to deal with mana cost checks as they pertain to DoTs. The drain on mana would continue automatically until the player recieved a return from the mobs code indicating that the Mob was dead (remember - this check happens per tick because you get DoT related reporting per check anyway). <br />
<br />
In the case of the mob's code block you would add a few lines to to recieve an on/off flag from the players code per tick. The mob's code block is checking all surrounding player attributes, such as sitting, position, hate, fleeing etc on every tick anyway, so this isnt prohibitive. It could be done by the addition of an extra flag to the attribute string. That flag would be a simple 0/1 reply. If it is 0, the DoT fades, if it is 1 the DoT may continue if it hasnt timed out.<br />
<br />
The point of doing this is that DoTs are very mana inefficient if they cannot run for full for whatever reason. By making the mana cost reflect the length of time the dot has run they would be somewhat more attractive in many fights. Couple to that much faster casting times and elimination of the counter agro, DoTs will become feasible again on short fights. The proposed changes wouldn't affect longer fights that much, so it wouldnt imbalance the game.<br />
<br />
Another way of handling the mana would be simply to return the unused mana back to the caster if the mob dies before the DoT runs out.<br />
<br />
Now, there may be other reasons for not doing this, depending on how the game as a whole is structured, it might required recoding every mob individually, in which case there might be a resource constraint on doing it. The code itself should be fairly simple though.</div></div><hr />

Oh, all my example showed the code that might be necessary to add the ability to have a DoT cease draining mana after the MOB dies or is cured. The code to actually drain mana each tick is not included.<br />
<br />
I also do not get why you say that such code is already supported. What is supported is an effect draining endurance. That is an effect of the disciplines not a cost. Every new and weird effect in EQ is coded like that.<br />

Thank you for repeating the obvious. I am quite aware what the benefits would be, I am saying that - given just the little we know about the game engine - it does not seem feasible to implement without rewriting big parts of the game.<br />
<br />
Another way of handling the mana would be simply to return the unused mana back to the caster if the mob dies before the DoT runs out.<br />
That requires pretty much the same amount of code, minus the initial playerside confirmation, plus an additional mana calculation, assuming the number of remaining ticks is already traced (which seems pretty likely). And I can already see players equipping their mana preservation item, casting the DoT, then deequipping it to gain more mana back. :D <br />
<br />
Now, there may be other reasons for not doing this, depending on how the game as a whole is structured, it might required recoding every mob individually, in which case there might be a resource constraint on doing it. The code itself should be fairly simple though.<br />

How exactly do you propose handling anything affecting MOBs without requiring all MOBs to implement these changes?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Discs are not merely an effect, they are a cost as well. If you execute a disc, say defensive for example, it draws on your endurance pool for 3 minutes. After each tick you loose x endurance. If, after 1 minute, the loss per tick of endurance would result in your END going below zero, the disc fades, even though the disc still has 2 minutes to run. So, obviously the code is in place to do this sort of thing, it is checking END status per tick, and if it is in place, a version of it could be used to track DoTs. The additional requirement of course would be that you would need an additional attribute for each DoT. The question then becomes whether the data format of the database entries allow for that, or how easy it would be to change that. <br />
<br />
Most of this could be handled client side anyway, all the server would need to do is send and recieve the same updates it currently does, and audit the client mana status on completion of the DoT to prevent hacks. The impact on the server load would be minimal.</div></div><hr />

Do you realize the enormous fundamental difference between:<br />
a) An effect on a player checking on datafield on itself (how much endurance does this cost?), then calling a routine(does I still have that much endurance?) and working with the results of that routine (if the answer was no kill this effect. if it was yes substract mana).<br />
<br />
b) A DoT on a random froglok (or 15 DoTs on 15 random frogloks) checking for a data field on said froglok (which player cast this?), checking for another couple of data fields (ok, how much mana does this take, what damage, what focus effects was it cast with?), then calling a routine (hey, player, do you still have x mana?), waiting for another routine on the player object(check my mana, reply), working with the results of said routine (ok, he had the mana, DoT does damage), calling another routine (damage done, get rid of that mana player!), again waiting for the player(substract mana, return a message telling the froglok if it worked), then finally calling the last routine (if it was successful the DoT stays, if not it dies).<br />
<br />
A discipline is basically a weird sort of buff that also drains END each tick. DoTs can not be coded that way because they cross MOB boundaries, meaning no easy access to the needed data.<br />
<br />
Most of this could be handled client side anyway, all the server would need to do is send and recieve the same updates it currently does, and audit the client mana status on completion of the DoT to prevent hacks. The impact on the server load would be minimal.<br />
You can not do it client side unless you allow the client access to any MOBs data a DoT is cast on - which simply will not work due to a thousand reasons, the main one being that said player crashing will also crash the MOB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Shere Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">The only effects being measured in units faster than ticks I can think of is drowning and lava that fires every second. I doubt you would want dots on this timer though as the spam would be pretty bad. Three dots on a mob would = 90 lines of spam per 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
I will add my voice to this. DoTs have become incredibly inefficient over time. I can't even fathom how SOE can sit there and think that an instant nuke should be more mana/damage efficient than a DoT that takes in excess of  minute to complete it's damage and create more agro. There is nothing superior about a dot compared to nukes currently (unless of course you compare shaman nukes ... BWAHAHAHAHA).<br />
<br />
In short, this is one aspect of game balancing that is totally broken; and obviously so. Healing has blurred edges and I can undestand reticence in changing aspects of healing as it has a large effect on game balance and class balance. The fact that DoTs still remain broken after more than a year and a half of warning and discussions tells me that SOE just don't care. And worse they don't actually understand certain aspects of the game.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Murtak, this information is allready being sent between the server and the client. How else does the client know that a dot tick has occurred (it does), that the dot has faded (it does), that the mob has died (it does). How else does the server know that the PC_01 has now more hate than PC_02, that PC_01's health has gone under a certain point, that PC_01 is sitting, that PC-01 is out of melee range. Of course this information is being passed between the server/client, and the amount of new information needed to implement this would be minimal relative to what is allready being passed. Most of the coding could be implemented on the basis of information that is allready available, with a few additional checks inserted. New coding on the client side would impose an insignificant resource requirement compared to graphics processing, the amount on new data to be transferred would be minimal (a flag bit per tick and an audit string on completion would do), new coding on the server side would be trivial relative to all the other processes needed in the course of a fight. If the server can monitor weapon strikes/misses from melee, and exchange that data with the client, it can monitor dot strikes just as well. And not only that, weapon strikes/misses/spells and god knows what else from other people. I fail to see the difference.<br />
<br />
Saying that new coding is larger than what is currently there is silly, because something is allways larger than nothing. The question is, is it larger than all the other things that are there allready, and I find it hard to believe that is the case. The coding itself would be trivial, the additional resource requirements would be minimal. If it is not feasible to do something like this it would have to be for some other reason, such as database structure constraints, undocumented or poorly documented code etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">There has been alot of talk about different ways our dots can be more effective.  <br />
But in all honesty, what pisses me off the most is the fact that our fastest dot (Bane) keeps getting resisted all the time, even when i malos the mob first.    <br />
  In order for Bane to land most of the time, I have to cast malosinia on the mob, in which there is no time left to cast any dot (not to mention the waist of mana to cast both malos and malosinia).<br />
<br />
On beta, this was a lure spell.  I figured the devs finally wanted to give us something usefull.   Then, when it became live, I couldnt land it on anything until i casted a resist debuff on the mob.   Finally, when i noticed the recovery time on it, I just /q.   <br />
<br />
Then after about a week,  I finally calmed down and loged back in.<br />
(You have no idea how bad I wanted this spell when it was in Beta.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm with warbear on that point.<br />
<br />
While I think some changes should be made to dots, mostly having their efficency/speed updated..why the hell are nukes more efficient?  Not to mention aggro; one quick and easy fix that I would REALLY like to see is our curse line getting a serious resist modifier.  We can only cast these spells once every 24 seconds, so why the heck should we get resisted on anything but a raid level mob?  A -100 or so resist modifier should do just fine.  <br />
<br />
This would at least provide me SOME means of doing damage against higher end mobs.  As it is, I malos, slow, bane...and bane is resisted about 30-50% of the time.  What's my other option, nuke?  Great, then give me some serious nukes.  675?  please.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">I think it's just the permanent mind set that went in ever since Ydelma was first posted as a mob we could solo -- limit the shamans, they're just too powerful.  Don't let them do so very much, so incredibly quickly(*cough*).<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, making our spells cast slow, cost more, and resist more to hold us back so we won't be too awe inspiring against Velious mobs makes no sense many expansions later, when mobs are designed completely differently, and soloing is almost always so incredibly inferior both as a way of leveling and getting loot that it really doesn't figure in as a serious way to define the power and usefulness of our spells and our class.<br />
<br />
Sony simply has a mind-set.  You're not going to have that change, I don't think, because you can't change a mind-set with logic; fixed outlooks and ideas are impermeable to logic or persuasion.  I think the only way Sony would adapt their own thinking to the modern game is if their people would seriously do some long term playing of it as high level shamans, which is just not going to happen.  They've got a business to run, not a game to play.  And outdated ideas and a locked mind-set are more than adequate for that.  <br />
<br />
Not for us -- not for meeting our goals or addressing our concerns, of course.  But for them, yes.  <br />
<br />
We can hardly tell them that they dare not lose us when our other argument is that we are useless in the game.  That contradicts itself.  It's precisely because we are useless that they can easily afford to lose us as many of us as want to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Budana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">That fact still remains that Dots as a whole are useless.  DD spells shouldn’t have ever become more mana efficient period.  *** is the point of havening spells that take a full minute to kill.  A druid I group with can and does twice the damage as me in groups no matter what I do.  Even if I stack 3 Dots I might do 800 damage every 6 seconds when he can blast for 3k with a crit and sits for what 30 seconds and does it again because now I have agro period.  Even if he doesn’t crit he can chain blast 10 seconds from start to finish for Winters Frost.  So in the time it takes me to cast BoS, Bane, and Nife the druid has blasted twice and can be on his 3 cast with no chance of agro because I have dots running.  So total mana spent by shaman would be 1450 for 5618 damage and agro lock our friend the Druid has spent 1170 mana for 4650 damage.  Has anyone played with a druid that has Crits maxed asks them if they ever dot anymore even in pet groups.  I believe you wont find many of them around.  The simple fact is that for the same mana you can blast and get instant damage with the chance to Crit to make it twice as effective.  I shouldn’t really use druids in this example but this is the class I play with most.  The fact is Dots are completely useless for 95 percent of the game.  The 5 percent they can help are solo but Sony hates soloing anyway so why base classes damage on this….  <br />
