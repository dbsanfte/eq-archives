<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wanted to post this in general as we had several friends and unguilded members that joined us. <br />
<br />
This was intended to be a ToV raid, but we did not have the force, so went to Kael instead and worked over the bridge.<br />
<br />
Not much loot (drops were chincy), but a lot of good faction and fun was had by everyone I believe. <br />
<br />
Neverflee Mask of War<br />
Terackia  Bow of the Huntsman<br />
<br />
Gnumbot also looted the head of Staff Sergant Drioc for MQ.<br />
<br />
Wanted to thank Dar for helping with groups and volunteering to be the add tanker. <br />
<br />
Also wanted to say special thanks to Wulfran to taking a pounding, so the rest of us could have some fun. Thanks bro.. you took several for your mates to have a good time. <br />
<br />
Thanks again for everyone who could make it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Daelen Mindreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I wanted to thank Dar and Klydon for inviting me on the raid, and to thank <br />
all KOE members who were on the raid for the great time.<br />
Especially Wulfran who took 1 too many for the team.<br />
<br />
This was my first real multigroup &quot;raid&quot; and will have alot of fond memories.<br />
First of all getting to Kael - I was looking at the map and thinking Kael <br />
entrance was a bridge - only to my surprise i found out it was it a cavern <br />
after I launched my sow speeded body off the side of the cliff.  After <br />
hitting the side and bouncing twice for about 1k damage, I sheepishly cast <br />
lev, and went down to the bottom to lick my wounds.<br />
<br />
Getting the Bow of the Huntsman - wow what can I say - I felt just was <br />
lucky enough to be along but that was icing on the cake.<br />
<br />
I have to mention the time that Wulf says &quot;Tera Follow me&quot;<br />
So I run up there and start following him down the hallway - after a bit he <br />
turns and looks at me and says - &quot;um... Not you I meant the other Tera.&quot;<br />
Ooops!<br />
/em blushes<br />
<br />
<br />
And finally to whoever (sorry i forgot your name) escorted me from the <br />
entrance to the bridge in mid raid, a special thank you without your help I <br />
could have never made it.<br />
<br />
