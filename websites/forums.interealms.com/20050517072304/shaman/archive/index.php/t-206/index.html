<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Probly been asked but, could someone explain or post a link to what it means when people say &quot;slow now uses disease counters&quot;  I assume it simply means slow is now &quot;cured&quot; with disease type cures, and that each slow of ours has a certain number of counters makeing it more dificult to remove.  However, what impact does this have on us (if any).  Should I expect them to last longer, get resisted less, check off disease resist in some way, ect.  Also, exactly why was this done?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You know, I don't know what the heck it means.  At first I thought it meant that slows still checked via magic but could be cured via abolish disease in order to make it possible to cure tanks that were slowed without annuling their good buffs.  That doesn't seem to be the case, so I'm not sure what the point is.<br />
<br />
The only other instances where it might have helped us are mobs that used to dispell themselves making slow difficult (Sontalak, dude in Ssra) are now immune to slow so POI isn't even an option.<br />
<br />
The change seems to have:<br />
<br />
* Made Sont and Srra fight harder<br />
* Changed nothing about getting slow off a tank<br />
* Increased aggro to deadly affect<br />
<br />
Thanks Verant!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They are still on magic for the resist check. You can however cure them on your tanks by using cure disease. Dispell will no longer remove slows. This goes for both mobs and players. useful on things like TT's in Fear and such.</div></div><hr />

What do you mean by this?<br />
<br />
I can cure the enchanter deeds (shiftless, forlorn, tepid, etc) line and the shaman slow(turgurs, togors, tirgirs, etc) lines now with Disinfecting Aura... and also Bane of Thule is cured with it.   <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Malkaven Maddness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">IMO wouldnt this be a nerf?  more'so against shamans that pvp.  Pretty much everything we cast can be cured...acept our epic, gl getting that off in a duel hehe.  I dont know about you guys but it seems turgurs agro has been increased. Has anyone else noticed this? maybe im just paraniod.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">All it does is add disease counters, it still checks versus magic.<br />
<br />
<br />
Changes that this will cause:<br />
<br />
- Those slowed in zones like Ssra where mobs love to cast Tigir's and other slows can now be cured without having to dispell half their buffs.<br />
<br />
- Mobs that AE dispell will not dispell their slow anymore.<br />
<br />
- Players can no longer dispell the slow on a mob in a means to cause grief to a raid because you can't cast Abolish Disease on an NPC.  (ie. No more dispelling Statue of Rallos Zek to get raids wiped).<br />
<br />
-  Shaman that manage to slow themselves after torporing themselves and forget to change targets can easily remove the slow without having to remove all your buffs.  :p</div></div><hr />
