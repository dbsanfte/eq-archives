<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Miula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">VL<br />
Bodyguards in EW</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sarothias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sebs also  decent :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eldared</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What would it take to solo in seb at 60? Also what camp would be safest/best?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eoghan Blaidd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Solo in Western Wastes, not only is exp good there but you will grow rich too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sarothias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If done carefully I can solo by NG camp using swarmy for slows of course..also i get a c3 first otherwise wouldnt be worth it..to much downtime.<br />
<br />
If NG is taken i just do entrys /shrug  Still even doing entrys you may see a RBG or ODS drop :D :D<br />
<br />
Btw my gears far from uber and i do fine :) check magelo in above post if want hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Oatasgai Alenxia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I love FG more now than before - get some DR gear so you're sitting around 130ish and just go to town.  Zone is always empty now, I love it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">FYI, you can still get slowed at a DR of 136, I recommend 140. It doesn't happen often, but it can ruin your day if you are solo and get unlucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Oatasgai Alenxia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Good to know...I usually have DR at 141 and I've yet to have a slow/stun land on me since I reached that number (the Curse seems to have a much tougher resist check).  Figured a bit lower would be ok, but I'll go with what you're saying on that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>TrackinU</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Or just do like I do and take yer 53 shammy bot with C3 there and go to town.  =)  (in FG)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Daerik Arrowthorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Have been trying FG for those times when I have nothing better to do, but I find it a bit slow due to the downtime, and I've come close to dying a few times.  If swarmcaller refuses to proc, as it often does, the fights can get close, with me having to channel off a few heals to myself. It goes much faster if i bring a healer partner along. I think part of the problem is i have to drop a good deal of HP in order to get my disease resist up there. If i was less lazy and tried to get an Aego/Virtue and possibly KEI before hand i'm sure it would be better :p Nice empty zone though as others have said, which is a big plus in my opinion and a good part of the reason I avoid PoJ.</div></div><hr />
