<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After getting my booties, I put my epic &quot;on hold&quot; for a while, so I could help my guildies with their epics...anyway, the time has come for me to take my epic off the back burner.<br />
<br />
So, I hace been spending a bit of time in CoM, and have got the 6 pages (got the stundent's log of the spectral courier last night, heh heh). I have already got the 3 books of ghiosk, from all the damned reaver raids I have been on.<br />
<br />
The problem is, that I seem to have &quot;misplaced&quot; the container in which to combine the 6 pages so I can hand them back to the Spirit Sentinel. I hailed the spirit sentinel several times, and although he /cons amiably, he doesn't seem to want to talk to me.<br />
<br />
Do I have to redo the Mistmoore Dire Wolf thingy, or is there some particular thing I can do to get him to talk to me and gimme a new booklet so I can hand in the pages and book?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help my learned brothers and sisters</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">re-read the quest, and go back to the spirit in EJ (from whom you got the boots) and ask the question again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Try saying 'Tell me how it all began' to the Spirit Sentinel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Same thing happened to me.  Just pick up where you left off at the sentinal.  I started with &quot;What is Heyokah&quot; and worked through, but you may be able to skip to the end and say &quot;Tell me how it all began&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Frostbyt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I asked him who's yo daddy but he bit me and then I asked him &quot;tell me how it all began&quot; and he was like here, make me this book</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Tried last night, as per your suggestions, and i worked just fine. Pages handed in, 3 books handed in (fooled by the sentinel being under water - wolf with scuba?). Off to The Hole Igo, for a hot date with High Scale Kirn - hes gonna squeal like a pig</div></div><hr />
