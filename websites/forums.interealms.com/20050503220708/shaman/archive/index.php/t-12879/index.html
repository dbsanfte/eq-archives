<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was just wondering if folks had ideas of things that my guild could kill... we are tiny it's actually just a hand full of us but we are hanging with some friends and we Plow through Minis in PoS and Va'Dynn and have the classes needed for bigger guys.<br />
<br />
I'm really just looking for a list of the order to head for bosses... have been told we can do Vindi, any other suggestions and what order we should try them in?<br />
<br />
BTW, we are all PoT enabled and we have the pieces to get everyone their HoH in the next couple days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Totally depends on classes/levels/numbers/gear. Vindi really much is harder than Vadyn on the pull and since he's not slowable, but the right 12 (or less) can easily kill him. <br />
<br />
Personally, if I ran a small guild I would focus on BoT mini's. Charm nerf has destroyed farming and the rewards can't be beat on that quick a respawn. If by small you mean 12-18 people level 55-65, try HoT for armor, ST's motg-prog for primal and bot minis for runes/armor/items.<br />
<br />
BTW, I expect all Chicago-area shaman at the Fan Faire this fall :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Fan Faire.... been there done that up in St. Paul.  Have to say the RL quest thing was kinda fun...the drinking was a blast but other than that it was a whole lot more money than I'd typically pay for a crap dinner.  <br />
<br />
They didn't show much spoiler info, a few of the GMs I met were real jag offs (a very slim few were cool), and the $5 for a watered down Gin and Tonic made me feel like the typical &quot;working as intended&quot; you get when around VI.<br />
<br />
But I digress... round numbers it would be 3-5 groups of 60+ though only 1/2 of those people have the AA and good gear.  By &quot;Good Gear&quot; I mean about like me... nothing spectacular but SS or better.  The rest of the folks have typically full Thurg with some SS in there also.<br />
<br />
3 Warriors with 1 65 that is full SS or better all defensive AA (65, 60, 60)<br />
2 SK with full AA and decent gear (60, 60)<br />
2 Sham with me being the primary (62, 61)<br />
2 chanters (65, 63)<br />
3 clerics (65, 60, 60)<br />
2 wiz (61, 60)<br />
1 monk (64)<br />
2 rogues (the other rogue has the same gear as Gargas) (64, 61)<br />
1 necro (65)<br />
1 druid (65)<br />
<br />
This is the basic set up.... then we throw others in and out as they come with us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Juka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you're just a handful of good friends, I'd suggest doing BoT mini's like mormegil suggested - their (rare) loot is exceedingly good for the effort required to kill them, especially if you have a CoD ench / CotAM mage. <br />
<br />
Some other things that require a small force which drop decent loot off the top of my head: Ring of Ooze in Cazic Thule and the Restless Burrower in Akheva...both are easily done with 12 people, perhaps 18 if you've got some people who aren't 65 yet.<br />
<br />
As mentioned above, if you've got a solid core of key classes; ie, good warrior, good cleric or 3, good DPS and some of the critical support classes, you'll be able to take down quite a lot in Planes of Power, but you'll still be frustrated by Velious and Luclin uber mobs which still stick by the classic Verant formula of making an uber mob uber simply because he pumps out suchandsuch DPS and has suchandsuch HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Get you wizards giantbane, and you can do vindi easily, maybe easily without GB but we always had a couple of wizards and giantbane does a lot of damage over a long fight.  <br />
<br />
Make sure your clerics can do a cheal rotation.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com has plenty of cheal rotation how tos, search the forums.  Depending on how many hps your warriors have, you might want to consider whipping up several 10 charge stinging wort potions as well.<br />
<br />
Read up on how to pull him, give your monk/SKs some time practicing how to cheese split his guards off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No bards, no ring of slime(and a few other things)...you're missing a couple key classes from really being able to get out and do some things.<br />
<br />
Grab one or more rangers, pallies, bards, mages and your gaps will fill in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Heh, the guys that I didnt list that will be there most every time are actually a 60 bard, a pimped out 63 paly a 60 mage and one of the wiz has GB :)<br />
<br />
Really appreciate the help though guys.  Lots of good info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rewts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would think that you guys could do some damage in NToV if you can stay online for long enough (may take a while to clear to named)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">With that group of people you should be able to kill anything in Velius and earlier. Vyemm, Zlex, Tunare, Sont, and AoW might give you some trouble, but nothing else should.<br />
<br />
If you have enough time, farm NToV for gear. If not, race other guilds to kill Vindi/statue/tormax. They are easy kills for some pretty good items. Dain's also a good choice, but he's more annoying and drops lesser quality items compared to the others. If you want to do the 10th ring war, leave Dain alone.<br />
<br />
In Ssra, you can kill XTC (2 groupable) and glyphed--although you may want to inform a cursed capable guild so the cycle don't get fubarred for a few hours.<br />
<br />
Other Luclin mobs may have too many hps for your raid force. As far as pop goes, aside from BoT nameds you should be able to kill the Junk Beast (killable with 5 people) and maybe the dragon in PoI (doable with 18).<br />
<br />
If I were you I'd work on some ST keys since you have very few people to worry about, and that would net you decent gear in a zone without much competition. Most FB dragons are killable with 3 groups or less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">No offense, but i really doubt that group could tackle much past eashen/ikky in ntov. 16-30 people and only half in ss gear...kinda light on melee too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">PoP buffs and a lvl 65 tank with AAs made a lot of old content considbly easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Another suggestion are UP named. Radir, Tawro etc. Maybe even Rumblecrush</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Dozekar, HoT named, we do them with 1 group.  Rumblecrush probably doable, as long as you can land a slow quick.  Vindi would be a great try, he's unslowable so it'd be pretty tough to get down, but once you got it I think it'd be ok.  Velk even easier, though his loot kinda sucks (all caster'ish).<br />
If you want another tough fight, try Itraer Vius in Akheva.  Once you get the pulling / clearing down, you can get down to him pretty quick, and if your paladin is pretty decked out and has SU3, he can do some massive damage.</div></div><hr />

I am one Chicago-area Shaman that will try to be at this Fan Faire. Not a big one on conventions but since I wasted 3 years worth of free time on this game I feel a couple days won't matter.<br />
<br />
Hip flask is the way to go in Chi-town - none of this $5 gin and tonic junk for me - I have student loans to pay. Binny's has reasonable liquor prices. If you want to go for less money - try to book a hotel up north or down south or even west if you can find one next to the &quot;L&quot;. From where I am (Evanston) I can make it to the city in 35 mins on the train and hotels will be much cheaper in the outlying cities.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>tannus vidar 2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Rumblecrush would be doable, just debuff before the pull and get CoH back to camp, then he comes in slowed and ready to die :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">yes, the trick to Rumble is a quick malos/turgur combo (usually leaving the malos shaman in the dust), slowed he's a wuss.<br />
Vindi with SS gear tank is a 4 sec CH rotation with your 3 clerics, might extend to 6 if you see you're doing well.  Have your two spare tanks grouped with a shaman each to off tank the slowed pets, and you should be good to go.<br />
One hint to the shaman so - make sure you rampage tanks hit vinid fast, if you malos first you end up on the rampage list, and that is 2000 dmg per round easily. Pallies doing a LoH for the first heal on the MT is good, but you seem to be lacking in that department.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If you're going to two-group XTC with those classes/levels listed those three clerics best be ft15 and those rangers/monks/rogues all damn pimp. Oh yeah, RGC or don't try. Yes, XTC is 2 groupable, but it's like 45+ minutes with good dps and that group is dps light. Come now.<br />
<br />
Other than that, many good ideas here.<br />
<br />
If you have 18 balanced players around level 60:<br />
<br />
Vindi (great mob to practice basic raid skills on)<br />
Statue<br />
Rhag1 and Rhag2<br />
UP rares like zelnithak/RC/DS<br />
HoT + Doze/rares<br />
BoT minis<br />
AC Burrower<br />
PoN Hedge<br />
ST motg-prod<br />
Klandicar<br />
Zlandicar<br />
Coggleboggle quest in CT<br />
FG caller cycle<br />
PoS minis (dunno about lords)<br />
Velk/Lord Bob<br />
Old world bosses (yael/vs/trak-sev-gore-tal)<br />
Vadyn<br />
<br />
If you have 24+ level 60s, many things open up.<br />
Tmax<br />
Yelinak<br />
Dain (if you know the pull)<br />
maybe XTC<br />
Xanamech<br />
wtov rares<br />
some ntov<br />
IV<br />
<br />
I dunno, I'm sure there's more. These just jump to mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Thanks for all these ideas :) and the list is a great source, I think I'll make it a check list for us to work our way down :)<br />
<br />
We decided to do BoT minis and the first thing to remember is to forget slowing and just stick to assist healing with the shaman... not sure what the mitigated slow on those fools was but I couldnt tell the difference from when they were slowed and when they werent.  <br />
<br />
We got Hreidar Lynhillig and Oreen Wavecrasher (wanted that damn Mask of the Hailstorms!) both were empty.... other than the Ring.  But we mopped them up with no problem with just the core group of 5 of us two boxing.  <br />
<br />
Finally this game is turning around, for too long now it's been lame crawls and we can start killing named guys no matter how Un-Uber we are compaired to the rest of the guilds killing these guys.  Heh for a Guild of 6 RL friends (all but one) two boxing, we are finally having a good time in this game again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">both were empty.... <br />
<br />
Welcome to the world of PoP named mobs.  No loot at least half the time, a spectral 40% more, and if you're lucky, ornate armor or a rune the other 10% &gt;&lt;  Tactics named seem to be a little better than BoT, but expect to see mostly spectrals vs good stuff.</div></div><hr />
