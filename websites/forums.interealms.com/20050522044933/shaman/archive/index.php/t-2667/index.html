It's the one posted on this board earlier. I made a mistake in creating a new thread. Why do people get their kicks with stunts like this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">omg thats hilarious</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Goodbrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">personally i think it's funny as hell, considering the bile the ppl targetted were spitting.  as long as it was not done at length.<br />
<br />
would be an absolute hoot to watch from a distance with creeping vision.<br />
<br />
lmao<br />
<br />
and i really like the lvl 5 bard trick with selo's training multiple SGs on the unsuspecting evil groups.  <br />
<br />
go fansy!<br />
<br />
ps...you have to expect a certain amount of animosity on a PvP server. hell, we get that on blues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Browu Frostforge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Personally, I thought it was pretty funny.  If those people dont want to live in anarchy, they should not be on a PvP server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jendain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">personally, i think he's an ******* with no life, but hey that's just my opinion.<br />
<br />
exploiting game mechanics to xp-kill others is &quot;cool as air supply&quot; ... erm. not.</div></div><hr />
