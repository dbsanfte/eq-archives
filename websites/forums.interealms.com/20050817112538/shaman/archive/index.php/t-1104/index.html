<br />
I remember from the old days that one needs to maintain skillz to a sufficient level.  For my rogue it was easy.  As far as weapons go...pierce all the way..some slash or blunt if you wanted to be different.<br />
<br />
Now, my lil 8 Ikky Sham is trying to maintain both blunts and pierce..and as a casual player, it wears on me a lil.<br />
<br />
As an Ikky Shamm..should I ENSURE I maintain at least one of those?  I want to concentrate on one, and keep another weapon skill at about 50-80%..in the event I get a worthwhile weapon.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Your epic weapon is a spear, so by all means keep piercing up. There are also a lot of nice weapons for mid-to-high level shaman that are either 1hb or 2hb, so I worked to keep those up as well (see Blight, or Poison Wind Censer).<br />
<br />
Keeping 2hb up is easy--go to Lake Rathe, get the Abandoned Shovel, and when you are in groups, just whack at the mobs--you won't do any damage, but your 2hb skill will go up pretty quickly. 1hb--just find the fastest 1hb you can get (damage is irrelevant) and do the same.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The experience necessary to go from Level 1 to 10 was recently reduced, so there's no way you're going to keep all your melee skills up during those levels. Eventually, especially if you solo a lot, all three weapon skills (and maybe HtH, if you're insane) can be maxed out.<br />
<br />
I'd say which weapon skills to focus on depends on two things: (a) whether or not you'll be soloing, and (b) whether or not you're twinked. 2H Blunt is great when soloing, and there are a number of good staffs and the like. If you're grouped, a one-handed weapon with a shield is best for the extra AC and any stats conferred by the two slots. The reason why I brought up twinking is that, if you're untwinked, it's really difficult to find good stat-boosting items in the low/mid levels and you may therefore want to focus more on 2H Blunt. Also, low-level Piercing weapons are awful.<br />
<br />
Another thing to consider is that Piercing is generally the easiest to raise at a later date, because of the lower delay on Piercing weapons, while 2H Blunt can be difficult because most of the weapons are slow.<br />
<br />
Just try to always have one maxed (your best weapon) and the other two within a reasonable range of max, and you should be okay.</div></div><hr />
