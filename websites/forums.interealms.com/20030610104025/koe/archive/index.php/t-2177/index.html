<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zhentil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i started a warrior and im curious as to when you know to switch from 2hs to dual wield?  and do any of you warriors have a link to a good warrior web site besides sword strike? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ludaian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I kept both 2hs and 1hs maxxed until my 40's.  At about 40 is when it started getting tougher for me to hold agro with just taunt, so I had to start dual wielding all the time.  It's good to keep them both maxxed though.  It's nice to be able to do some damage even when you don't want to get hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eliyra Darkangel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I found with my ranger that 2hs did significantly more damage until at least mid to late 20's.   She got dual wield at level 17, and every level I dinged I would dual wield until I got my five points, and then switch to 2hs.  Sometimes though, I just couldn't resist dual wielding...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was primarily a 2HS tank until my 40s. I was a little slow on the switch, mainly because I was in love with the eye candy critical hits that I could do.  A crit of 160 loooks much more impressive than 4 of 45, even thought the net damage is lower. Part of my problem was I was dirt poor and couldn't afford much for weaps either ( ok that hasn't changed much: still saving for my tinkerer's bag :p but now KOE twinks me, instead og me having to fend exclusively for myself :p ).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was primarily an undecided tank in my 40s, I agree with both Lud and Wulf's points.  What I did was when I reached the midway point of my level, I would switch to my other weapon(s) to max both skills at the same level.  That was very effective for me.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps, and check the link out</div></div><hr />
