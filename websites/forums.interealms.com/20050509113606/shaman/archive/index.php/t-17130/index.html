<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Arku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Had my first go at Oreen tonight in BoT.  Actually I had had the pleasure of saying &quot;Hi&quot; to him twice, tonight.  First time, group was pulling to Oreen not expecting him to pop and he does.  Casted Malo then Tugurs and got resist.  Next casted Malosini and was resisted. Tried Tugurs again and resisted. Casted Malosini twice and finally landed.  Tried casting Tugurs 2xs and both time resisted. At this point things aren't going good so Wizzy evacs out out so we can try again.<br />
<br />
2nd time, figured I'd try Cloud of Grummus.  First Malo + Malosini (resist). Then I casted Insidious Decay.  Next, cast Cloud of Grummus (resist) and then tried Malosini which landed.  Finally, Cloud of Grummus landed for a partial slow.<br />
<br />
Now, I checked Slowablity charts and it stated to use Magic based slow on Oreen.  My question is what lvl did you shammies start landing Tugurs on him?<br />
<br />

Thank you</div></div><hr />

Oreen is the water mini right?  Yeah you're not going to land Turgur's on him.  He is strictly disease slowable.  You're going to get some freakshow shaman that landed Turgur's on him but the safe bet is disease slow.</div></div><hr />

Hey Gind!  Send a tell to Jawaj sometime, that's my &quot;new&quot; beastlord.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Skeeter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I play with a regular group that tries to take all 4 minis once a week when we can -- 65 war, pal, enc, clr, wiz, and shm.  Other than the north wing mini which can't be slowed, we have always been able to slow the other three -- including Oreen.  Once pulled, I malos while chanter tashes -- then both of us spam slow until it takes, then spam cripple.  I generally get Turgurs through by the 5th attempt, if that helps.<br />
<br />
Got the legs -- free root rocks!  But still haven't seen the belt in about 15-20 kills -- just 4 chain patterns and a number of spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>wrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">one thing i've noticed with most of the bot wing names is they are tough to slow solo, malos (or in your case malo) ... get the chanter or bard to provide further MR debuff then land sinia and slow, maybe will get a resist or two then but should be able to land.<br />
<br />
If you have no enchanter or bard you want to debuff as normal malo / malos then try to slow a couple times.. you might get lucky but most likely you'll find yourself healing the MT to offset the damage its doing for not being slowed.  Its better to do this than to sit there and spin your wheels not slowing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Malos/Tashstick/MAlosinia<br />
<br />
Turgurs does land, but its a toss up on if you wanna go with disease slow first. Sometimes it fcan be difficult to land sometimes its not, so i try all that a few times and if he doesnt slow then switch to disease.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I land turgur's on him all the time... sometimes it takes 5 or 6 tries tho..<br />
<br />
I never use malosinia on him, it's a waste of mana. Just Slow, then canni, then slow, then quick heal tank, then slow again, etc.. but be sure not to over-agro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Outkast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">62 Shaman here and I did land Turgur's on Oreen but only after Malo and prolly 6-7 attempts. Didnt drop crap though. Spec, ring and some other piece not worth a gnomes ass. <br />
<br />
Now I also tried that Guntr or whatever in deep south and after 10 attempts decided to give up and go offensive. Checked Illia's and most notes say he is extremely hard to slow and to use your mana on offensive spells instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Carry a tash stick around, give it to an apropriate person (I usually either do it myself or give it to the wizard or something) to proc while you try to debuff. It's like an extra -23 to magic resist, which can mean all the difference.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, if you have a SK in the group, have him/her use Aura of Darkness. it takes 10 to all resists from the mob, and gives the party 30 to all resists for the duration. It's disease based so it can't work on the Earth guy, but works great on all the other mobs. Malicious first so he can land it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I've almost always got him first cast with disease slow, doesn't matter what his life was at. Follow that up with turgurs if you want, but the 50% slow right off that bat makes a huge difference compared to not slowing until the 5th or 6th cast of turgurs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Holdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">75%..heh that's pretty funny.  I'll try to slow once or twice if we don't have a chanter/bard in the group.  If it doesn't land, I just help heal and we kill them like laef.  With a bard/chatner I am usually able to land slow by the second cast.  Tash/ooc seems to be the breaking point for me to get them slowed with Turgur's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Dang i thought everyone knew this. Oreen cant be slowed til he is at 75% life. <br />
<br />
I'm 99% sure this isn't true.  I know I've slowed him, and I'm pretty certain it was before he was at 75% health.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It isnt true.  He's really hard to magic slow without a chanter but he IS slowable before 75% health.  Its about 1/10 chance with just malos in it seems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">He's really to hard(to worth it) to slow without a tashan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">at 65, I usually land turgurs within 3 or 4 attempts (although sometimes I get streaky bad luck) after malosini/tash stick; I don't use malosinia really because I can just use my neck item to do the job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shamus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Being level 62 isn't helping you get him since he's level 65 and red to you.  First time i tried him at 62 it was VERY VERY hard.  Now at 65 and the rest of us in group being 65 he's a JOKE.  SLow if you like but if the tnak has decent Ac and some good resistances you'll just own him through sheer DPS and the tnak resiting his casting.  Laef on the otherhand is still the biggest pain in the butt IMO.  Being he's unslowable and has some MAD MAD DPS it's all about the healing game and your DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have taken out all 4 nameds ALOT.<br />
<br />
To me it seems to be pure luck or some times just being unlucky, at times I can land slow on first try and other times I can cast it 15 times without landing it.<br />
<br />
Just want to say to all those that try to sini him before you slow, why?<br />
Sini has the same chance to land as slow does, malo(s) him and then try to slow and spot heal if needed.<br />
<br />
IF you can PREdebuff a mob I can see a point in trying to land sini before slow, you can offcourse slow sini slow sini and so on since of the recast time on slow but I would say spot healing and try to slow is better.<br />
<br />
Only named you really want to try and land slow on is Gaukr, his nasty proc with unslowed mele can be tricky at times but clr and spot healing can beat him aswell.<br />
Oreen as you said is imo the easiest to beat unslowed.<br />
<br />
Edit:typed gaukr instead of hreidar :)<br />
Edit2: think I am having a blackout today, retyped Gaukr</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I went up against him for the first time last night after freshly dinging 62. Malo, Sini - five casts and nothing. I cast Insidious Decay and Grummus and he was slowed right off the bat. I kept the SK Torpored while I was slowing to save the Cleric some mana, since he could keep aggro slowed anyway. First cast of disease slow, no problem. I tried Turgur's after that through the whole fight - just to see if I was having streaky bad luck for the next time - and could not land it. <br />
<br />
And Nerun: stop making me look bad, start sucking a little on raids or something :-P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Just want to say to all those that try to sini him before you slow, why?<br />
Sini has the same chance to land as slow does, malo(s) him and then try to slow and spot heal if needed.<br />
<br />
<br />
2 reasons:<br />
<br />
1. Spamming slow will [likely] get me aggro, and although I have ok gear, I still heal and debuff better than I tank something like that<br />
2. Slow is what, 250 or 300 mana a pop? (don't remember off the top of my head) Spamming the malosini necklace is free, and leaves mana for healing, etc. It also has no recast time since it's a clicky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Do you really think that that many ppl have a clicke necklace to make it a valid point?<br />
<br />
Even if you tash and malo(s) the nameds it can be hard to land slow at times, so getting in sini before slow is not very high on my priority list when fighting these nameds.<br />
<br />
If you have a warrior as a tank then offcourse casting slow non stop is not wise but do I really have to point that out?<br />
When I fight I usually twobox my SK 95% of the time and when I do I can spot heal and slow ALOT without getting agro, so spot healing when needed and slow the rest of the time.<br />
<br />
Usually I only bother to try really hard to slow gaukr, if I land slow on the other two its just a bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">i would try this, malo, malosinia, malicious decay then cloud of grummus<br />
<br />
If your primary intention is to get him slowed, you are wasting quite a bit of mana and time...<br />
<br />
Neither Malo or Malosinia are helping you. Neither drops DR. Malicious Decay is unresistable. Grummus is DR.<br />
<br />
If you are doing MalX to help other casters, that is fine, but it is doing exactly nothing to help you get him slowed - it is actually slowing you down to no benefit. Of course if you have a Warrior tanking you might want that extra time to let him build some agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>jondolar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">These days from doing oreen a bunch of times i simply<br />
decay then cloud then work on the malos/malosinia turgurs.<br />
Disease slow lands pretty much 1st or second time.<br />
<br />
Now someone said malosinia is a waste of mana.<br />
Isnt the point of using malosinia that its much less agro than<br />
turgurs hence you can chain cast it without(hopefully) getting<br />
agro such that you have a much better chance of getting<br />
the turgurs to land?</div></div><hr />

I was responding with my personal viewpoint.<br />
<br />
Even if you tash and malo(s) the nameds it can be hard to land slow at times, so getting in sini before slow is not very high on my priority list when fighting these nameds.<br />
<br />

When I fight I usually twobox my SK 95% of the time and when I do I can spot heal and slow ALOT without getting agro, so spot healing when needed and slow the rest of the time.<br />
<br />
Usually I only bother to try really hard to slow gaukr, if I land slow on the other two its just a bonus.<br />
<br />
That's great, I usually group with a warrior though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">My trick to slow(magic) minis in BoT is:<br />
<br />
Have someone cast or proc Tash, then Malos and overwrite it with Malosina, then most slows land.<br />
<br />
Disease... well, just debuff and good luck.  ;) <br />
<br />
I dont remember if i was landing much before 65 or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">They mitigate, though. At least the one I've killed several times in West does. It's faster to cast Insidious/malicious Decay and slap a Grummus on that gives you a partial than to spam Turgurs after Tash amd malos and sinia.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Of the wing minibosses, by far the hardest to slow is Gaukr Sandstorm. You NEED malos and level 65 to land it on him, or you will need an echanter with tash or Bard with Harmony of Sound... Or you have to be so close to lady luck she's ****ing you. All of the bosses mitigate slow &quot;partially successful&quot; which equates (from what the shaman community can tell) to approximately a 50-60% slow.</div></div><hr />
