<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm really curious to see if anyone has any information on what the XP penalty is for the different races. I was grouped with my bro (59 DE Rogue) and a friend that was the same level as me (56 SK) and I really noticed an xp penalty on my 56 Iksar shammy. After an entire day in Chardok, I gained 4 blue. The same level SK gained 6 blue and our lvl 59 Rogue gained almost 4 blue also. I don't know if the SK was just saying he got more xp then he did or if the xp penalty on an Iksar shammy really is that big. But, I can say that I gained xp almost identical to a lvl 59 char while only being 56, and that is big.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any info on xp penalties for races and class? Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Troll and Iksar - 20% penalty<br />
Ogre - 15% penalty<br />
Barbarian - 5% penalty<br />
Halfling - 5% bonus (or is it 10? can't remember and never really cared...).<br />
All others - no bonus/penalty</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">5% bonus on halflings, all others are 0.  Rogues and warriors originally had an additional bonus, I don't know if they removed that when they removed class penalties (mostly for hybrids).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Are you saying that the XP penalty was removed from game? As in, all these people I group are exaggerating when they say they are gaining way more xp than my Iksar?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Uurgugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nope just the class penalties were removed, the race ones are still there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">any idea about vashir penalty?  5% i assume same as babr?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Warriors still get a 5% bonus.  Can't say about Rogues.<br />
<br />
I have read that a Halfling Warrior will take approximately 1/2 the xp required for a Troll ShadowKnight to get to lvl 60<br />
<br />
How that works I dunno...+10% for the Halfling Warrior vs -20% for the Troll ShadowKnight.  Perhaps this was back before the 40% penalty for hybrids was removed?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Warriors used to get a bonus.  They no longer do (and haven't for a number of months--it was abolished when the class penalties were changed).<br />
<br />
Based on 100% being the 'base' experience to level, the races need the following to level:<br />
<br />
Iksar 120%<br />
Troll 120%<br />
Ogre 115%<br />
Barbarian 105%<br />
Halfling 95%<br />
All other races 100%<br />
<br />
Thus, it takes longer for any race over 100% to level, and halflings level faster than all other races.  There are no longer any class penalties.<br />
<br />
I hope I was lucid.  I'm running way low on sleep atm!  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Warriors and rogues both have the same xp bonus because Verant didn't want to be seen as nerfing the class. I could've sworn it was a 10% bonus, not 5%. It's been a while since they did the changes, so I could be wrong though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Maximillien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Why do Barbarians have a 5% penalty?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think in the &quot;Old Days&quot; a troll or iksar Shadowknight labored under a crushing 140% exp penalty: 20% for race and 20% for class. Ouch. <br />
<br />
Personally, I don't mind the 20% penalty on my troll. The extra time per level gives me more time to max my skills and more time to do more of the zones appropriate to each level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">This is from Absor, back when he made the changes (Jan 2001):<br />
<br />
Race-based penalties are appropriate. An ogre, for instance, does indeed make a better warrior than a halfling. It is not so little that the faction and size problems make up for it, and not so much that it is really unbalancing at upper levels, but enough that the penalty should apply. Secondly, the penalty is not so severe (compared with class-based penalties) that it would cause groups to break up on the journey from one to sixty due to level differences. <br />
<br />
Class-based penalties are not appropriate. Classes are roughly equivalent in power throughout the level ranges, and the versatility does not make up for that penalty. In fact, the majority of changes made to classes in the name of balance in the last year were based on the assumption that, at the high end, each class should still be roughly as needed and balanced as any other. <br />
 <br />
Class-based experience bonuses (which warriors and rogues get) are also not appropriate, as they cannot be so if penalties are not. However, we've decided to leave this as-is, since the bonus is not so severe as to be unbalancing. Bottom line: we don't feel the bonus is enough to warrant a fix that could be interpreted as a 'nerf'. <br />
<br />
<br />
Barb's get a 5% penalty becuase they are better Statwise than Humans (I'm guessing).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thanks for the correction, guys.  I didn't know that about the warriors and rogues!<br />
<br />
I believe the stated reason for barbarians having an exp penalty are a combination of higher stats and the fact that, as a large race, barbarians get the same slam (or is it bash?  I forget) ability as ogres and trolls.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Smert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">actually, from what I read, the old class penalties were multiplive, not additive.<br />
<br />
So a Troll/Iksar SK paid 120% for race and 140 % for being a SK.. for 1.2x1.4 = <br />
168% exp.  Me SK, Vicktor, was in his mid 30s when that went away :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Icklymuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Anytime someone asks about exp I always refer them to the following site.<br />
http://www.geocities.com/sstair/<br />
It even has a link to the EQ announcement about the exp changes, so you can understand it all...<br />
Be sure to read the announcement first so you can understand the differences in the tables. Becuase they were never updated after the update...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Egad! That is horrible. My hat is off to anyone who leveled a Troll or Iksar SK up before the hybrid penalties were removed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">You know.. given the halfling starting stats, I wonder what the designers were shooting up the day they decided that halfling were so unappealing as a race that they needed an exp bonus<br />
<br />
*boggle*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Falyin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Halflings get a bonus because VI screwed up at the begining.... actually, that bonus was meant for humans, but the gifted programmers/techs  at VI accidentally gave it to Halflings. They decided not to change it.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Oh, and warriors/rogues still get their XP bonus, they did not change that when they changed the other classes... I know someone mentioned it, but I am mentioning it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">actully the bonuses for the class that still remain in the game are:<br />
<br />
warriors = 10%<br />
rogue = 5%<br />
<br />
this was to help balance the damage done by the rogue with the rather straight forward play of the warrior. and as far as being additive or multiplyed this is what i belive it was that hybrids got a 40 percent exp penalty added on top of there race. so a iksar/troll SK would take 160 percent exp to lvl  and a halfling warrior would take 75 percent exp to lvl. so yes a half ling warrior would take roughly half the exp that a troll SK to lvl. now the ratio is down to:<br />
<br />
iksar/troll SK: 120percent<br />
halfling warrior: 75 percent<br />
<br />
And as i know it int casters had a 10 percent class penatly to there exp. and i also belive that shaman had a 20 percent class negitive. so the hybrids where not the only one helped with the removeal;e of the penaltys.</div></div><hr />
