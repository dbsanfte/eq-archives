<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>crollub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How do these work?<br />
<br />
I have a helmet with + 17 defense and a cloak with + 8<br />
<br />
So +25 defense. When I look at my skills it says<br />
<br />
defense 165(+25)/164<br />
<br />
Does this mean things try and hit me as if i was five levels above them?<br />
<br />
Does this translate into someting really good or should I just get int stamina gear?<br />
<br />
I can spend 5 shaman talent points to get a total of + 10 defense, on the third or fourth teir in the enhancement talent tree. Surely this means these + defense items are really good?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You've pretty much nailed how +def stuff works as far as I understand it. For each five levels of defense, you essentially gain 1 xp level of defensive capability.  I don't know where the trade-off point is, is all. As with all these +skill vs +stats items, you don't want to sacrifice too many stats for +skill items.  I don't know how much shaman tank at the upper levels, so it's up to you to strike a balance between better tanking ability and loss of other stats.<br />
<br />
After all, just like in EQ, better tanking is only useful if you're being hit by melee; if you're eating AE's/spells then it don't do jack, whereas hps are always working for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have a level 50 Gnome warrior, as well as a Level 60 thief a 41 druid and a Up and coming level 20 hunter. <br />
<br />
From what I have seen with + defense items is if you are fighting something higher level than you they dramaticly level the feild in damage taken. When fighting things lower level than you it gets easier but doesnt completly negate the hit point loss of the lack of stamina gear. <br />
<br />
I carry around three spare peices of gear that have + defense on them. (Helm boots and a cloak) I lose about 250-300 hit points if I equip all three, but I do notice alot more staying power in a hard fight.<br />
<br />
I really need to compare them while soloing, Hmm maybe Ill work on that for a few tonight if I get some alone time. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>crollub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aye snoww,<br />
<br />
Think I'll have to do some compares against different mob levels and see what occurs.<br />
<br />
I wonder how defense and armour combine to work out whether you will be hit or not....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I tried a very unscientific test last night with my 50 warrior.<br />
<br />
I have three items with + defense that adds up to +49 defense. I also have three peices of gear with stats and such to go in the same slots.<br />
<br />
I tried a total of 10 fights. Level 47 48 49 50 and 51 mobs same name and same level each with + stat gear and + defense gear.<br />
<br />
In all but one of the cases I took more total damage with the defense gear (I am truly suprised to be honest) The level 48 mob did slightly more damage to me with the stat gear on. (Prolly a lucky string of crits)<br />
<br />
But I did descover that just walking up and autoattacking I could beat all but the 51 fairly safely The 51 I used 6 heroic strikes during the combat each time to sway the win in my favor.<br />
<br />
<br />
Intresting results I wish I cared more to test it further but I am just not that kinda gnome. Much rather be beating the snot out of stuff.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When you mouse over armor stats, the ballon will will display the mitigation percentage.  <br />
<br />
Is this message affected by the +defense items, as well?  I assume that a test of this would work best if the items swapped in and out had the same ac ...<br />
<br />
The discussions I saw on the Blizz forums formed a consensus that +defense was less effective that an equal amount of ac or agi.  (Like most of the discussions there, it was pretty light on actual testing.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">At level 60, each point of defense raises your block, dodge and parry by 0.4%.  So each 25 points of defense increases your avoidance by almost 2% (very nice) and improves your shield block by 1% (very lame). <br />
<br />
Defense also supposedly reduces crits against you, and a substantial amount of anecdotal evidence supports that.  However, nobody knows the formula for that.<br />
<br />
It is widely speculated that +defense has no effect in PvP.<br />
<br />
+ Defense is nice, but it is nowhere near as good as raising your effective level defensively (which would be insanely overpowered, considering the fact that warriors with +90 (or higher) defense are not that uncommon).</div></div><hr />
