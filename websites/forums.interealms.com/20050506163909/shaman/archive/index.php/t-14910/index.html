<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kittyshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My sister bought eq because she saw me playing it and wants to play.  She is so lost though...  She wants to play a Vah Shir Shaman (like mine), but she doesn't have a clue about how to play.  I try to give her hints and teach her stuff, but it is over the phone.  I can answer her questions, but she doesn't know what to ask...<br />
<br />
Does anyone know of any existing newbie guides that tell newbie - newbies how to play eq and gives little hints and secrets?  There seem to be lots of guides that tell everyone where and what to fight, but she needs very verbose info on playing eq in general.  <br />
<br />
I couldn't find any guides with general eq super newbie info.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>T'harkis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i would never have guessed you were a vah shir shaman !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>BluntDoctor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sounds like the tutorial would be the way to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kittyshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">she did the tutorial!<br />
<br />
oh well, i guess i will just tell her that the best way to learn is to buy a high lvl char off of an auction and group with you guys!  jk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Best way to learn is to just play.  You don't lose xp under level 10, you spawn with all your gear, you really have little risk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd suggest showing her around in game. Not powerlevelling, but just talking her through it as you go. Maybe you could also start up a newbie to play with her at the same time.<br />
<br />
One thing though - I would try to suggest she play something different to you, so you can group together effectively when she's caught you up enough to do so!<br />
<br />
Plus, there'll be less rivalry between you if you're playing different classes. Not saying it'll be anything unpleasant, but trust me, it'll be easier if you're playing something different. I know from experience! :)</div></div><hr />
