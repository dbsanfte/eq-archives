<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">. . . that I would bag my JBB as &quot;secondary gear.&quot;<br />
<br />
But tonight I handed in my chain SS bracer (thanks again Spitulski for the gems :) ) and got the Wolf Caller's in return.<br />
<br />
Before the turn in, I had a Bracelet of Sense and a JBB.  Replacing the Bracelet of Sense would have giving me like 2 extra AC (yay) to play with and the ability to wear my JBB full-time.  But I would also have to have taken a 15 WIS hit, which, since I am not 200+ WIS as is, is more than I am wanting to lose right now (besides, 2AC and 15 HPs for 15 WIS does not balance out IMO).<br />
So I decided to replace the JBB.  So I can't squeeze out two extra AC, big woop.  And I look at it this way:  When I am soloing, I can always just switch them out again for the nuke, and bring back the Wolf Caller's when grouped for the added HPs and AC (especially for the HPs since I am working on getting Cann5 again).<br />
<br />
But anyway, I am steadily getting to were I can take the Cann5 hit.  Just need to hunt down a Shadel Ring sometime and grab at least a Tattered Mantle (which is uber compared to my Kunzar) to help with the HP boost.<br />
<br />
I just hope this upgrading trend continues :)</div></div><hr />
