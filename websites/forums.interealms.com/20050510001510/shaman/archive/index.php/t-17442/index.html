<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There's been alot of talk about new abilities that may be useful in future expansions.  There's also alot of complaining about the lack of usefulness of shamans beyond the first one or two on a raid.  I have an idea that might solve the second problem and be cool addition to the game. <br />
<br />
What I'm thinking of is a line of spell like abilities called chants.  These abilities would be more powerful the more shaman there were in the in the raid/group, ie the more shaman there were chanting.  You could have slows that would be more effective based on the number of shaman--either by making the mob more slower than the normal percentages, or by overcoming mitigation.  We have mobs that mitigate a single shaman's slow, but what about the combined strength of many shaman?  Perhaps a shaman slow chant would have an AE effect in that any mob that came within the chants effective radius would be slowed.<br />
<br />
You could apply this to more than slow.  Dots that were more effective based on the number of shaman chanting.  How about buffs that were more powerful based on number of shaman?  The ideas are pretty unlimited.<br />
<br />
You'd probably want to limit the ability in some way- say by allowing only one chant at a time.  Perhaps different chants interrupt each other by causing disharmony or something.  But a single focused chant by a number of shaman would be an aweinspiring thing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sounds like bards in a way.  Bards would probably scream and cry about it. <br />
<br />
Interesting idea, but I dont think it would fly</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>nuzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">actually not a bad idea, have like a chant induced slow, RAWR</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kubke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">so what if the bards go sour...would be awesome to have 4 or 5 shamans doing /dance animations to the deathcry of a boss mob<br />
<br />
RAWR !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">its a fun idea, but i dont see it being added in game to any class, ever :(<br />
As others have said, if it was added in game, expect it to be a bard ability.  Would be fun if all spell casting classes had some sort of chant though..such as clerics doing an AOE heal chant, wizards doing an AOE damage type chant, enchanters doing an AOE mez chant or maybe AOE mana regen chant, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If it means we have to prance like a Bard....forget it.</div></div><hr />

.....and shaman getting a AoE dex buff chant......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hemmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">An extension of this idea is some sort of team cast slow spell...not a bard song or something but like a ritual involving several shaman working together.  The benefit would be a greater % slow or lower resist or great dot with aggro spread over the several shaman vs. a single one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
...rofl! so true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Oh, puleeze.. it wouldn't be a Dex buff - that would be to usefull. It would be a Cha buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Sounds like a good idea to me. Would really be fun and would get all the shaman together. Doubt it'll happen though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Juka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The chant idea doesn't make a lot of sense to me; it sounds cool but do we really need an ability that will make it better to have 2+ shamans in the same group? Not to mention the fact that it seems like something out of DAoC. The only times I ever get grouped with another shaman is in a raid situation; mainly due to the fact that my former guild had an excess of shamans (9 at last count). Last time I XP'd with another shaman in the group was around level 30 or so, 3.5 years ago. Personally I'm happy with the shaman class, and I think we're much better balanced than a lot of other classes who have some very legitimate concerns at the moment. I do think that the chant idea is a step in the right direction in regards to making more than 2-3 shamans on a raid redundant, but Verant came through several months ago by making our DoT's stack as opposed to only 1 of each sticking on a mob at once. With so many boss mobs being immune to poison / disease, they also came through for us recently with the addition of magic-based curses to our spell line.<br />
<br />
By the way, monks are asking for a similar ability - stolen from Monkly Business (ie I did not write this):<br />
<br />
Originally posted by Schezanna: Personally, I'd like to see something along the lines of 'auras' for monks. They could be either level locked quests or just a one point trained skill at appropriate levels. This is just a further refinement of my earlier idea for bard-like utility for monks, basically.<br />
<br />
They would go into the bard buff bar, and would have the same stackability as songs, including being overwritten by bards in group. As long as the aura is in effect it refreshes every tick. Once an aura is 'released' there is a 30 second wait (recast delay) before another aura can be activated. They would be instant cast, and wouldn't be interruptable by stuns or anything other than death of the monk. They would all have a range of 75 or 100. These would be group only buffs, so no AEing for the raid. Auras with similar effects would not stack with each other.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Juka, are you advocating making monks a casting class?<br />
<br />
And whats with you proposed idea of giving monks a better speed spell than SHAMAN get?  BOOOO!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It would be interesting, but I REALLY don't want to see my guild with more shammies than clerics.  Maybe if you got a max &quot;chant&quot; effect from 3-5 peeps or something it would be a little easier to handle.<br />
<br />
Outside of limited PoP raid content, all you get is even more /ooc  L65 shm LFG! :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
No no no, I was just pointing out that monks are asking for something similar. I think it's stupid, personally.</div></div><hr />
