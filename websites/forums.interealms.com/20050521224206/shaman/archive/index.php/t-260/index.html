<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kulgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yeah thanks you two found it shortly after I posted. Now my next question. How many of them grumble grumble bonechips i need to turn in and Can I ever get enough faction to walk through Calibis? I'm KoS to most Good Cities why not be friendly to the evil ones :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dementhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I am attempting to gain Cab faction to do the quests. I went to the gobby fort in WW and cleared it continuously for 3 hrs.  My dog-dog and I whupped up on those gobbies :)  Didnt even use any mana except to haste my pet.  Got a shrunken gobby head earring to off of grachnist ( after 14 kills lol) and and am now dubious to legion of cabilis.  You have to be at least dubious to be able to turn in the bone chips.  Supposedly you need between 6000 and 8000 chips to get all of your Cabilis factions to at least dubious.  The exception to this is the necromancers.  I think you will still be KoS to them even after your other Cab factions are non-KoS.  I just wish there was somewhere to buy bags full  of chips from a vendor.  It would make this all so much less painful and boring to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Huh?  How does the game know if you know anyone bound there?  Doesn't the vendor just sell to anybody?<br />
