<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sudancia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wanting to post I was looking for a ToSR raidind group to join when I realized, hey there isnt a Raid request channel on these boards where you can talk about raids and request when the next raid will happen in certain areas.  Oh well, just a thought I wanted to pitch out there.<br />
<br />
Anyway , I am looking for groups or those that are raiding ToSR (Tower of Solusek Ro)  or those that will be raiding.  I would like to try for the shield dropped by Xuzi, I hear it drops nearly every time.  Someone mentioned this could be done by only 1 group of high lvls but people in my group in BoT swear that they all would have to be in elemental to have a prayer against the lvl 68 beast that drops the loot.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Groups hunting only in BoT tend to think everything in the world is scary and fierce and beyond their capabilities.  That's why they hunt in BoT.<br />
<br />
As for raids happening, well, you won't find that on this message board.  Go to your own server board and look there.<br />
<br />
A single group of people can kill Xuzl though.  It depends what kind of group makeup you have though, and your gear/aas.</div></div><hr />

 Please enlighten me in regards to the guards please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've taken him down a couple times now. I think we may have had a little over 6 people there. Our tank had only a couple pieces of EP gear, we might've had two clerics. Aye, he's sword pets are worse. Just make sure you get them all before you attack. =P<br />
<br />
Shield dropped for us both times, I think the second time it dropped two. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's just not practical to look for server specific raids on the Crucible.</div></div><hr />

I just went to the Nameless Tavern and they have no area for Raids request either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Karana has a channel for open raids. Perhaps the Nameless does as well, or perhaps you could start one.<br />
<br />
Xuzl is rather pathetic and does not require elemental-equipped people. He's only level 68. Easily done with 2-3 groups, and one-groupable by very well-equipped people. Enlighten you on the guards? The page you linked in your post ... go to that page, and read down the page toward the bottom. Plenty of people have posted information regarding his guards. It just takes some reading.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kanamori Hitatomi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've done this guy with 2 groups several times and he was a push over.  His guards are the problem, you need someone to get agro and kite them (get strong agro, so the shaman can debuff and slow them).  The main guy is weak, he'll I could almost tank him at 7khp.  If your tanks are BoT/LDoN/Bazaar gear, you can take the boss, the problem is with the guards.  You would need a kiter or two to handle them (snare works wonders).  Kill the guards 1 on a time in main camp while kiters continue to kite.  BTW, Zxul is permarooted to the stage he's on.  No mater what you do, if agroed, he'll run to edge of stage and warp back.  Use this to advantage to preslow or whatever you want to do.  Once on him, it's all out dps and he goes down in 20 seconds.  Good luck with him.  And I will recommend doing it with 3 groups first time just to be safe.  When comfortable, take out the extra healers (good idea to keep 2 clerics - yah, they are your competition for the sheild, but just do him 3 times and everyones happy).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sudancia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thx for the help all,  Now only if I can find a group.</div></div><hr />

He has 4 guards called &quot;A Conjured Automaton&quot;, which have a flaming sword graphic. They hit for ~1500, and hit fast. The usual tactic is to single pull, mez them on inc, then debuff and slow before the tank taunts them off and engages. If you dont do that, and the tank engages before they are slowed, there is a good chance that he will die in seconds. Xuzl himself is a pansy compared to them, he just takes longer to kill.</div></div><hr />
