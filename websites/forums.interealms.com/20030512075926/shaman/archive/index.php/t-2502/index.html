<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DonateloFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, my shaman and monk have just hit 51, and I am looking for a new/fun place to exp. What kind of stuff can I handle on my own? I have been thinking about seb, but not sure if I could handle any of the camps without some help. What about chardok, lgukk king, hole...etc..<br />
<br />
My gear isnt to great, shaman is in jarsath/scaled mystic/rygorr. Monk is in reinforced acrylia with SCHW and IFS.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help, one more day at seafurys was gonna drive me crazy :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Off hand though any of those places you listed would be fine, I especially like the Hole however with the 25% exp bonus. <br />
<br />
In the Hole you can do the entrance and if you feel you need more spawns you can pull the hall (another 3 spawns ) to the entrance as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>DonateloFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well I have looked all over the hunting guides and such, but most of them only have to do with soloing as a shaman.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your input, I may head down to the hole tonight.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Pretty much anything you see that is soloable could also be done with a partner, besides the highkeep thing, thats only suitable for 1. :)<br />
<br />
Also might want to try Katta guards if you dont care about faction.  Dont think you can do it solo yet but should be able to do with a partner.</div></div><hr />
