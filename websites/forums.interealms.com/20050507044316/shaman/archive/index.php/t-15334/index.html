<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Lack of KEI will probably prevent me from ever seriously levelling a mana-using alt.<br />
<br />
Taken from another board, but have seen several similiar comments here recently. I know KEI is good. My ranger likes to have it when he's farming wailing/shrieking substance so he can just kill non-stop without needing to rest (snaring every single greenie eventually does drain the mana). But I'll still do it if I dont have KEI. Is it really so bad that people dont even have the stomach to play a caster anymore?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yes, it is.<br />

why sit watching mana go up when you can press auto atk and do nothing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>sir0die</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">makes ya feel like a crack addict who's dealer has been busted</div></div><hr />

<br />
But why not pick it up to start with? The game's more fun with it than without it for me. Not having KEI and starting a new caster char doesn't sound much fun to me. Leanring mana efficiency etc etc doesn't alter the fact that it's freakin dull to sit for 5 minutes between pulls.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Contrary to that note...<br />
<br />
I just started EQ in December of 2002...and until I had reached lvl 29 back in March...I never knew what KEI was, or how to get it.  That was 29 lvls of meleeing and casting and medding without knowing that I could get &quot;unlimited mana.&quot;  When I found out about KEI, my initial reaction was, I don't need it, I have Canni.  But for those first few levels...Canni would eat up a half bubble of my life, and Canni Dancing I didn't have down.<br />
<br />
So I got KEI.<br />
<br />
Did I become a crack baby? No.  Did I stop meleeing and just cast? No.  But there was the difference of little down time.  As I gained levels...I found I could cast more and melee less...until finally around 37 or so, I was hooked.  Root rotting and medding with Canni...I thought I had it made.<br />
<br />
Then the patch came.  And KEI went away.<br />
<br />
I stopped playing for a bit to get out some, and when I came back, I tried to root rot.  It took too long...my pet died...the root broke...and I barely was able to gather mana.  Then I came here, and learned my class.  I started meleeing again, giving my pet weapons, getting them behind the mob while I tanked and canni'ed.  I gained from 37 to 43 now as fast as I did 29 to 34 with KEI.  But I saved myself 50pp a session, and felt better about playing on my own.<br />
<br />
I've toying with starting a necro or a wizard...another small alt to take my time...and I'm not worried about KEI.  Both of these classes have their own mana regeneration techniques, like ourselves.<br />
<br />
It's time people learned KEI isn't a buff.  It's a crutch.</div></div><hr />

i dont want to think about that time period again.  I hated looking at that damn book lol :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well I've never denied that you 'can't' play without KEI. Of course you can, and often do.<br />
<br />
Wanting to play with KEI doesn't mean I don't know how to play my class. Learning how to play my class doesn't suddenly make KEI redundant. KEI just makes the game more fun for me. Canni dancing is NOT FUN after 35+ levels of doing it. I no longer get exited waiting for a tick and hitting my macro. I do it because I have to. Any tool that helps alleviate that makes me enjoy my time in game more.<br />
<br />
Enjoying and using KEI doesn't make me a poor shaman. Not knowing how to canni, slow, buff etc etc makes or breaks a shaman. I still canni with KEI up - just not as much.<br />
<br />
They're entirely separate issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Unfortunately a lot of the damage has been done -- a guildie of mine who has a 50+ shaman alt was relating the story of playing with a 40-something shaman who was crying oom at full health.<br />
<br />
I think we were both ready for a good cry on that one.<br />
<br />
Another fun one was last week I was playing one of my alts, a 37 Warrior.  The enchanter in the group was saying oom on almost every pull.<br />
<br />
This went on for about oh half an hour before I saw it... since the warrior's an ogre, I'd missed the enchanter STANDING NEXT TO ME MELEEING.<br />
<br />
After informing my guild of this amusing anecdote, I finally said, &quot;Err, say, I might just be a dumb warrior, but wouldn't you have more mana if you were meditating?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you mean?&quot; was his response.  That got a laugh out of me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you gain mana a lot faster when you're sitting down.&quot;<br />
<br />
(At this point the ranger, who was a twink too, chimes in with &quot;Really?  How about that!&quot; and the Shaman starts /telling me with LOLs.  Thanks for the support, guys.)<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.  Well, I'm not casting much.  Just slow, and DoT.  And sometimes a nuke.&quot;<br />
<br />
At that point I just tossed my hands in the air and said &quot;Ok, just thought I'd ask.&quot;<br />
<br />
If that exchange wasn't brought to you by KEI at level 12, I don't know what was.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
People who know how to play their class aren't the problem, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I guess I've just been lucky then. I've not really met a player who got to my level (or near it) without having an idea of how to play the game just because they'd had KEI.<br />
<br />
I've met poor players, players who couldn't assist, didn't understand many issues about the game, when to cast, heal etc. None of those meetings so far has made me want to change the game for everybody else. It's made me find another group or if they're approachable try to give them some advice.<br />
<br />
If I meet a level 12 who doesn't know that sitting is faster mana/health regen, I tell them it is. End of problem.<br />
<br />
I know, we don't want to get into the whole KEI debate again as it's over, but it never bothered me.<br />
<br />
As it stands, give me KEI. I love it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Sitting on your ass for 8 minutes after every quad makes you a much better wizard, no doubt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">My alt is a level 40 wizard.  He was level 39 when the KEI changes went through.  In the entire span of time between then and now hes gotten about 60% exp; that was enough to get him out of 39 and 25ish % into 40.<br />
<br />
One quad takes me between 60 and 70% of my mana pool, depending on resists.  With no other form of mana regen besides Harvest (which is about 200 mana every 8 minutes...yay) it takes anywhere from 10 to 15 minutes to med back up to full.  A quad, including roundup, takes about 2 minutes tops, and thats only if things go horribly wrong.  <br />
<br />
So in an hour play session I  ACTUALLY play about 5 minutes.  The rest of the time is spent sitting on my duff staring ahead of me.<br />
<br />
When I was able to have KEI downtime between quads was usually 5 minutes, because a quad only took about 50 to 60% of my mana pool.<br />
<br />
Now, instead of quadding with my wizard, I could get a group, right?  Yeah, that would be nice.  But there is a problem with that.  KEI was about the only thing that put casters on par with melees at lower levels.  A melee can go on indefinitely as long as he has health, and 90% of groups will have one character that is able to heal.  Casters are only as usefull as thier mana bar.  If the mana bar is empty the casters effectiveness drops like a rock.  <br />
<br />
When I was able to get KEI I was able to get groups, because groups werent worried about me being an exp leech.  I was able to contribute noticible damage to every engagement.  And I was able to regenerate that mana quickly enough to be ready for every engagement.<br />
<br />
Without KEI I now have to pick and choose which mobs I will spend my precious mana on.  If its a low blue and my mana is at 50ish or so Im going to cast 1 spell on it that will do about 150 damage.  Thats it, because I cant afford to squander 165 mana on a spell that will do 300 damage because that will put a serious dent mana pool.  And to the others in the group it looks as if Im just sitting there quietly soaking exp up. <br />
<br />
Yeah, I can get Clarity, and frequently do.  But 4 mana/tic for 27 minutes, while wonderfull, is slow.  And it cant keep up with the pull rate of an even incompetant group in any of the zones that I can group exp in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I use KEI as a play-time timer.  I get KEI at the start of the evening, and play until it wears off.  When it does, its time for me to log and do something else.</div></div><hr />

Smartest post in this entire thread, by far.<br />
<br />
I think a lot of you have either forgotten, or never knew, what it is like to play a lowbie caster.  Hell, we had to look at the spellbook to med in my day.  No kei, no clarity, no flowing thought, no cannibalize, no mana regen self-buffs.  Nothing.  All you get is meditate.  If you're lucky you have a horse and don't have to sit down.  For those that have forgotten, let me remind you:  Being oom and haven't to meditate it back SUCKS.  It sucks REALLY REALLY BAD.  It is BORING and NOT FUN.  Having to SIT AND WAIT does not make you a better player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hmm all it means is you now have to wait till lvl 46 to get kei. About the downtime you could group. Although if there is lack of groups I can see your point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">What really, really kills me are the KEI-Baby Drumens.  You know the type, 248 Wis and 1300 HP at level 60.  The ones who scream when they're OOM, then decide to cann down to 25 percent after popping a mob with slow, cripple, and 2 dots - only to complain when the cleric didn't heal them in time to save their 40pp-a-pop crutch.  <br />
<br />
Now I'll admit, one of the reasons I started a Shaman was because of our ability to self-replenish mana at a faster pace.  I couldn't imagine what it would be like to be a high level caster and have to sit and med 9-10 minutes between solo kills.  So I really can't comment about that.  <br />
<br />
But those KEI-Baby Drumens are really, really starting to bug me.  Luckily, I don't have to deal with them often.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Clarity was there however little it contributed, but canni-dancing was the worst.  Talk about having to rough it.  Canni-dancing every tick of every gaming session, looking at the spellbook, squinting at my HP bar to watch for the tick, did not make me a better player.  It did, however, make me learn much more about my class and try different playstyles.  It did make me learn that a Shaman isn't in trouble until his HP and Mana bars are empty and if that's the case, the group is in trouble too :)<br />
<br />
A friend of mine once told me that his guild laughed when their Shaman's ran out of mana.  I told him that when I'm out of mana,  my group is about to die.<br />
<br />
I never had to deal with the downtime issues though as I didn't bother soloing because back then, while shaman *could*, it wasn't a very good way to go, until level 49.</div></div><hr />

Horses! There was no stinkin' horses in the begining! There was breese and clarity though. Damn newbs.<br />
<br />
Ok, enough of that. Your info is all screwed up and it's obvious that your not old school but your point is still valid. I believe EBay/Player Auctions and twinking has more to do with people not knowing how to play their class then kei does. <br />

<br />
IMHO even with VOQ at raids or in groups I canni v every 3-4 min and try to canni iv whenever I have the time.. the thing is no matter how big of a mana pool/mana regen, you can still abuse it to no end.. <br />
<br />
Sure sometimes I want to be lazy, get kei, sit on my horse, cast malos+slow maybe stick dog on the mob and wait 1 min then repeat, but it does mean that I am learning bad habits as I do that, and it does mean I am a &quot;bad player&quot; as I do this. I have to say though I never sit except when I am memming a spell.. my mana regen (in my experience) is too fast for me to spend sitting on me butt.. you might have different experiences, just remember 1 thing, this is all about fun, so do what you enjoy...</div></div><hr />

That is why wizards are not considered the best soloers and necros are considered the best soloers.. mana efficiency is key to this whole thing. My cleric friend soloed a monster in HOH2 spending his whole mana pool.. (using nuke/root!) is that fair for him using the same analogy? Wizards are meant to sit on their ass for 2 hours (exaguration) so they can send in a nuke when the god is at 10%.. IMO it's redicilous to think that you shoudl be killing 4 mobs in 5 minutes and being 90m while an overpowered monk at your level can kill that mob in an hour!<br />
<br />
Your complain is with two people, first people who don't respect the power of a class, (that is shaman who think bl suck, every class besides druids that think druids suck, etc).. and the 2nd problem is YOU! The reason people use boards like this is because the game as a whole is a social game. Someone wants to play their shaman with kei, not canni as much and posts it for the approval of his peers.. YOU need to make a good shaman friend, who when he's xping, you're xping with him etc.. you need to socialize your way into groups.. I have people in rival guilds who msg me daily asking if I'm available for xp! I know a wizzy, a paladin and a cleric.. I just need to do a /who all on one of em and I know where all 3 are.. <br />
<br />
That's my opinion btw.. probably only 1 other guy agrees with me, but belive me this, he's a smart guy ;)<br />

I was not talking about what it was like &quot;back in the day&quot;.  I was talking about what it is like to be a low level caster RIGHT NOW.  Before you start making things up about how I am &quot;not old school&quot; and my &quot;info is all screwed&quot;, try actually reading what I say.  You may now go back to &quot;pounding xp like a jackass&quot; again.</div></div><hr />

Edit: Sitting and waiting doesnt make you a better player Jinheim, but actually managing your mana so that you dont blow out everything at the first encounter does. Yes, thats inconveniences soloers, but sorry if I dont care a bit about soloers in a multiplayer environment.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>trolebus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">IMHO, the problem is that this game was suposed to be played in groups without uber-loot nor uber- buffs. <br />
You can see that in the newbie zones everything is killable solo. There you have that time to make some friends. <br />
Then you go out of the newbie zone, you need 1 or 2 friends to kill mobs (I mean with no Uper lvl buffing nor twinking) or do it really slow. Then you make friends of different races and classes... and you make a bigger group and try harder things... But how do you make friends if you are constantly killing? you cannot talk while healing,nuking, doting, bashing,taunting,slashing, etc... Thats what medding was for... chat time. <br />
<br />
The problem is that this can only work in an ideal Norrath, with no twinks, no kei, no Aego/Virtue... and no 'hurry' to get to 65 and 200AA. <br />

<br />
Let me get this straight. You are complaining, because you have to rest/med TWO lousy minutes per mob, you just soloed - meanwhile there are classes out there, that can't even solo effectively at all ??<br />
<br />
I got your point, oh wait i don't /boggle.<br />
<br />
If you are a new player, just freaking PLAY the game, visit some zones, do some quests (gasp), find some friends to play with. It is not meant to get 65 in 2 months /sigh. If you want to level some alt, just spend like 10K in bazaar and get equipment, a new player can only dream of. If Everrace err. quest is still too slow for you, get a friend to power level you and be 65 in what time? maybe 2 or 3 weeks.<br />

I grew up as a cleric right when breeze came out.  That was uber.  Low level mana regen buff? Bring it on baby!  <br />
<br />
KEI and buffs on a lowbie is simply a way to speed through levels learning nothing.  This is a good thing for us old and bitter players wanting a 2box alt to 60 asap.  But not good for little Billy who just bought the game cus his big brother plays.  <br />
<br />
The whole game revolves around time-sinks.  Lack of 65 level buffs on a level 1 is simply enforcing the time-sink attitude.  Find a way around it, sillies!</div></div><hr />

Look, I'm not trying to belittle you but I went back and reread what you wrote.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think a lot of you have either forgotten, or never knew, what it is like to play a lowbie caster. Hell, we had to look at the spellbook to med in my day. No kei, no clarity, no flowing thought, no cannibalize, no mana regen self-buffs. Nothing. All you get is meditate. If you're lucky you have a horse and don't have to sit down.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now what other conclusion am I supposed to come to other then you describing what it was like for you as a caster &quot;back in the day&quot;?<br />
<br />
It's no big deal. You were probably up late when you posted this and your thoughts ran together. We all do that sometimes. I just thought it was funny how on one hand you were describing how you had to look at the spell book back in your day and on the other you were talking about having a horse so you wouldn't have to sit down.<br />

No hard feelings.<br />

want more people to start alts?  make them an offer they can't refuse.<br />

need more casters?  give em all KEI.  have enough?  shut off the tap<br />

Gem...absolute gem.  Wizards are 'meant' to turn  raw mana into focused damage.  And if this is your interpretation of the effectiveness of wizards in a group I would seriously consider grouping with a wizard once in awhile and see what they can actually do.<br />

I didnt say that wizards should be at 90%mana when the quad is finished.  My argument is directed at mana regen.  2 minutes of playing followed by 10 minutes of sitting down is silly.  Thats my point.  Incidentally, if it takes an 'overpowered' level 40 monk to kill one ulthork warrior in EW I would look at your definition of overpowered.<br />

<br />
i've seen level 1 twinks in no gear with 1500k HP, thanks to group virtue, and focus. i cried/laughed. (and then did it myself).<br />
<br />
my warrior's train message went like this:<br />
/ooc TRAIN to zone!!<br />
/say if you can hear this and your staring at your book, your gonna die<br />
/say have a nice day</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Aemon Talishan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">My alt is a level 40 wizard.  He was level 39 when the KEI changes went through.  In the entire span of time between then and now hes gotten about 60% exp; that was enough to get him out of 39 and 25ish % into 40.<br />
<br />
One quad takes me between 60 and 70% of my mana pool, depending on resists.  With no other form of mana regen besides Harvest (which is about 200 mana every 8 minutes...yay) it takes anywhere from 10 to 15 minutes to med back up to full.  A quad, including roundup, takes about 2 minutes tops, and thats only if things go horribly wrong.  <br />
<br />
<br />
To start, I'm fantastically grateful to SOE for restricting KEI to level 46+.  It's a HUGE crutch for way too many people.  Mana management is a skill and if you can't do it, you're a liability to your group.<br />
<br />
I do empathize with your mana regen problems, though.  Yeah, killing 4 mobs at once is pretty mana efficient, but if you're medding that much, your playstyle isn't efficient.  Wizards aren't good soloers because their mana regen is bad, like warriors aren't good soloers because their hp regen is bad.<br />
<br />
Now, instead of quadding with my wizard, I could get a group, right?  Yeah, that would be nice.  But there is a problem with that.  KEI was about the only thing that put casters on par with melees at lower levels.  A melee can go on indefinitely as long as he has health, and 90% of groups will have one character that is able to heal.  Casters are only as usefull as thier mana bar.  If the mana bar is empty the casters effectiveness drops like a rock.  <br />
<br />
When I was able to get KEI I was able to get groups, because groups werent worried about me being an exp leech.  I was able to contribute noticible damage to every engagement.  And I was able to regenerate that mana quickly enough to be ready for every engagement.<br />
<br />
Without KEI I now have to pick and choose which mobs I will spend my precious mana on.  If its a low blue and my mana is at 50ish or so Im going to cast 1 spell on it that will do about 150 damage.  Thats it, because I cant afford to squander 165 mana on a spell that will do 300 damage because that will put a serious dent mana pool.  And to the others in the group it looks as if Im just sitting there quietly soaking exp up. <br />
<br />
Yeah, I can get Clarity, and frequently do.  But 4 mana/tic for 27 minutes, while wonderfull, is slow.  And it cant keep up with the pull rate of an even incompetant group in any of the zones that I can group exp in.<br />
As for wizards being xp leeches: there have been wizards in EQ since day 1, even before Breeze was introduced.  Wizards are not chain-casting damage dealers.  I've grouped with good wizards and crappy ones.  The good ones cast the spells that are appropriate, which generally AREN'T the biggest, flashiest DD they have in their book.  So drop a couple 2nd-tier nukes for less mana.  For groups at level 40, dark blue mobs only have about 1500-2000 hps.  In a full, well-balanced group, you're probably not going to do more than 300-500 damage per mob.  Even though the tanks can keep swinging, at that level, they're not putting out all that much damage.<br />
<br />
Incompetent pull rates?  to me, that's a full group of 6 in the dreadlands single pulling dark blues and waiting until one is dead before pulling the next.  there are plenty of those out there.  You should have NO trouble keeping yourself FM in that situation, even without clarity.<br />
<br />
Without KEI I now have to pick and choose which mobs I will spend my precious mana on.<br />
<br />
That almost sounds like mana management.  *gasp*  sorry for the sarcasm, but I get to pick and choose how I spend my mana too.  It's the problem with scarce resources... you know, like money.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If wizzies could quad kite w/o mana restrictions, they would be the best soloers.. killing 4 mobs with the same mana as it takes to kill 1 is mana efficient.. BUT compared to a MORE mana efficient caster like a necro, you kill 4 mobs while he kills 1 for instance, if he is more mana efficient, then by the time you are ready to kill 4 more, he should be killing his 5th or 6th mob.. mana efficient does not mean you spent 10 min killing 4 mobs while I spend 10 min killing 2, so you are more efficient.. (not mana anyways).. <br />

In your case, since it's an alt, I would get a chanter friend instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Trena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Actually, the quote Rathelon posted pretty much sums up the way I feel as well. I've played a wizard (currently lvl 57) before, during, and after the KEI craze and I completely agree with Uggok and Thorzion. And for Khozik, with all due respect, melee have had access to items that kill their downtime (fungi tunic, anyone?) for YEARS and still have these items......and get more every expansion. From fungal regrowth to aura of battle to aura of healing/health (the effect on the rust encrusted tunic), a melee so equipped can solo blues endlessly with little or no downtime. But the first time casters get the same benefit, it's unbalanced somehow? Why? Melee have had access to item based haste since release but casters only got the casting equivalent (along with spell haste via clerics) a year ago (and the results aren't quite as dramatic).<br />
<br />
When I soloed Amorae, a Regrowth of the Grove served me better than a clarity (and was easily more accessible at that time since it was FAR easier to find a 60 druid than a 60 chanter) but when I could grab a mana regen buff, I did. <br />
<br />
I submit that KEI has absolutely nothing to do with creating 'bad' players. The PLAYERS do. If a person wants to learn how to be the best shaman/druid/enchanter/wizard they can be, they will actively seek out ways to do that. If they just want to 'play', they'll do that. With or without KEI. KEI allowed people to do more in less time, and while the results may not have worked out for some, I would guess that it kept a whole lot of other people playing when they would've otherwise quit from frustration.<br />
<br />
And incidentally, I have access to a 60 chanter so Amorae always has KEI but that's mainly due to our style of duoing (I pull, she slows on pull to get aggro, she tanks, I poke  ;) ). In groups, the canni dance is in full effect, KEI or not. That's why I don't think it was the spell that made so many 'bad' shaman. It was the people playing those shaman and relying on a spell they themselves cannot cast (instead of using the mana regen abilities available to them).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Yah I left my chanter at 35 when KEI got nerfed.  I was already kinda bored of him tho, to be honest.  <br />
<br />
I started a newb ranger, who's now 31.  Turns out that fungi/haste/twinkage combo still works for melees, how bout that?  And he can kill 7-8 cougars before having to stop and med for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Krenk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">KEI is nonsense. I have rarely ever used it, don't pay for it, and don't care to have it if I am soloing. No one can ever learn how their class properly works without doing things the hard way, which is completely on one's own without any twinking. Get your levels yourself, build your own plat stash, buy your own gear, use your own buffs, and if grouped use only what they can offer. I am one of the people that sent in feedbacks that KEI needed to be level restricted, else all buffs should have the level restrictions removed.<br />
<br />
There's an &quot;already seen it, don't need to do it again&quot; attitude that makes for sloppy players. These are the guys who die when they go to a new zone. They're the guys who wipe out on raids several times before getting it right. If you'd know the limits of your own power, and everyone you are grouped with has that same kind of knowing of their own class, then dying would be very rare. I almost never die, I hate it, and I can't stand people who use dying as a valid tactic.<br />
<br />
I have accepted the honest fact that most people can never play this game well. As long as they stay away from me, have as much KEI as you want. I'm in no rush to level. I've been playing this game off and on since June 1999, and have 19 real characters, mostly casters. I learned the hard way that twinking and powerleveling makes for a poor knowledge of any class. I don't care to repeat that mistake. And in the process, I know a great deal about almost every class in the game, and how to best assist them. It makes me a better shaman to suffer through all of this. A much better shaman.<br />
<br />
The only two things KEI is good for are farming and skilling. Farming is outright boring with no thrills, so may as well make it go by as fast as possible. Skilling is crap. God I hate skilling, use based games suck. But leveling properly doesn't actually max skills, so there is no other way.<br />
<br />
That is my take on KEI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Heaven forbid that the lowbies actually have to make it without a lvl 65 pocket chanter/cleric/shaman/etc.  Those of us who remember mobbing the chanter that was foolish enough to shout &quot;Breeze for donations at the dock&quot; in Oasis know what it means to play a lowbie.  We didn't have 2K hps at lvl 15... we didn't have 20hp/tick regen... we didn't have 14mana/tick regen... we didn't have 1K AC at lvl 15.... we had lowbie characters with lowbie buffs with lowbie gear....<br />
<br />
<br />
AND IT WAS F'ING FUN!<br />
<br />
<br />
People need to realize that there is more to this game then being lvl 65 and burning up AAs in BoT.  <br />
<br />
Experiencing the zones appropriate for your level... how many of you exp'ed in Paw?  Awesome zone... good exp bonus... 4-5 people in the zone on average now... and normally it's a pair of 65s each PLing their lvl 15 twinks.<br />
<br />
Feel the danger... where's the risk when a MOB can't do enough damage to dent your regen?  Is that exciting?  Is there any rush?  Might as well just create a /set level = 65 command in the game.<br />
<br />
Remember going OOM and having to come up with some way to still kill your MOB?  Agro kiting.... Rooting with your last sliver of mana and then medding while waiting for root to break so you can dot one more time... It wasn't a matter of how much downtime before the next pull - it was a matter of not DIEING before the next pull.<br />
<br />
This game has been dumbed down... it has been made simplistic... People getting to 65 in days... not weeks (let alone months or years).  If that's how you judge &quot;fun&quot;, then maybe you have missed a major facet of the game called &quot;experience&quot;... defined by adventuring and learning - not measured by the number of points you get per kill.<br />
<br />
I'm glad the lowbies no longer get KEI, Fo7, and HoV... may they cry themselves to sleep every night till they actually learn to enjoy the low end game too.</div></div><hr />

Ya see, once upon a time, there was only clarity. And even then, only if you happened to be in a group with an enchanter - or you sought one out somewhere in the zone. There was no breeze for the lowbies, no clarity 2, KEI, Tranquility, Voice of Quellious.

<br />
And now think of the most fun situations in your EQ life... mine are when things go bad but we manage to solve them (almost oom but canni enough to land a Heal on a 2pcent hp melee and that kind of situations). <br />
So, KEI makes the game easier. I agree, but 'easier' doesnt mean 'more fun'. <br />
I play this game to have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Just so you know Steelbear, I've played the same character since I started EQ - over 4 years ago. I leveled up without even clarity, so in that respect you're younger than me, young bearling.<br />
<br />
When I came back to the game after a break, I started using KEI for about 2 months before the change. Then I lost it till I hit 45 again, and started using it again.<br />
<br />
I don't understand why the KEInazi's just have to assume someone who likes and uses the best mana regen spell available somehow have less status than those who flaggelate themselves. Why would I not use it? Why should I purposely make the game slower? We've moved beyond the level restriction question, now those above 45 who use it are also wimps?<br />
<br />
I suggest you stop taking HP buffs from the cerlic while you're at it. Also, stop giving your pet weapons. If a beastlord happens to offer you some Spiritual blessings, refuse it, or click off it. Instead, lie on a bed of nails and paper cut the soles of your feet to prove how much greater you play your character thanks to self inflicted pain and longer down time.<br />
<br />
Your attitude on this makes me glad I'm don't have to group with you. I'd rather play with someone who uses the best tools available than makes the group suffer because they like banging their head against a the mighty brick wall of self-righteousness.</div></div><hr />

Leanring mana efficiency etc etc doesn't alter the fact that it's freakin dull to sit for 5 minutes between pulls.&quot;<br />
<br />
Learning mana efficiency DOES alter the fact that it's dull to sit for 5 minutes between pulls.  That's the whole idea of EFFICIENCY!  Do you have a choice?  Why yes, yes you do... Get a group so you don't have to burn all of your mana at one time and can carry on fighting constantly.  <br />
<br />
As far as wizards/druids having a long bit of downtime between quads, well that's called balance.  You see, you get a LOT of xp for a quad in a very short period of time, thus the downtime between quads is somewhat of a balance against that rate of xp gain.  Even with the downtime between quads, Druids/Wizards quadding still generally rake in the xp at one helluva good rate overall, so I see 0 problem with that.<br />
<br />
KEI did do a lot of damage to the low end game.  Everyone got hooked on the idea that low levels were meant to be sped through soloing to 50 or 60+.  That quite simply is not the way EQ was designed.  The game is designed to be played in groups, soloing ability is a bonus certain classes have usually at the cost of group utility.  It's a pretty simple and sensible design concept really.  <br />
<br />
If you don't like the 'boring' downtime in between quads or whatever, then get a group and you can have constant action.  Will the xp be slower?  Quite possibly it will, so don't expect any sympathy because you have downtime while gaining xp faster than most groups.</div></div><hr />

Furthermore, where did I say or imply that you suck and cant play if you use KEI? I started this thread asking if it was really so bad that people cant stomach playing a mana-using class since there is no KEI for newbies anymore. <br />
<br />
Maybe you meant to reply to somebody ELSE who said you are lame if you need to have KEI to play. Or maybe you didnt get that I was making light of the 'walked both ways uphill in the snow' speech - hence the little  ;) But, since you singled me out:<br />
<br />
I'm curious, how do you figure I'm 'younger' than you, bigboy? I'm gonna laugh my ass off if you say my registration date. I'm not one of those guys who will say I started in beta just because the last guy said he started the day EQ went live. I'll tell you exactly when I started playing - July 99. Rathelon has always been my main character. I founded my guild at the end of 99, and it's one of the oldest on E'ci these days. I've been reading and posting here for 3.5 years. My two old posting names (Rathelon and Rathelon Steelbear) were lost when the Crucible went down a few months back. <br />
<br />
Am I the oldest shaman around? Of course not. But when I think back to the names of the high level shamans that were on my server when I was coming up, I can count on one hand how many are still around. If you're as old as you say you are, then you can remember the time when you could do a /who all shaman 40-50 and you would get back a list no longer than 10 names. It's not hard to know a good portion of the community then. Of course, nowadays you'd probably only get 10 names with that command also - but you'd get a request cut short with /who all shaman 65. Even at 3 o'clock in the morning. And a good number of those were created and leveled up during the past six months or year.<br />
<br />
And, ya know what? To be frank, a lot of those shamans arent that good. I hear about it from the people I group with. Sometimes it's tells the next day saying the shaman who they replaced me with sucked. Had to beg him for buffs. Didnt slow adds fast enough. Let the enchanter die. Let the cleric die. Went afk every five minutes. Sometimes it's things they say in group. Good job on slows. Nice crowd control. Dont even have to ask for buffs. Sometimes it's just from watching. Last night, in a pickup group in BoT we had a named that gated on us about 3 times and brought back friends. Cleric was barely able to make it, was medding up for each CH towards the end while I patch healed. But in the end, we survived with no deaths and killed the named and 4 of his buddies. Meanwhile, the group right next to us at south entrance wiped with only two normal giants - and they had a 65 shaman, who by the looks of things was afk the entire fight because after half of them were dead and the others ran to the zone, he was still just standing there and the giants came back and pummelled him to death. Our necro then used Wake the Dead on his corpse to help finish off our giants. I found that fitting - got some use out of him. And, you know what else - we had no enchanter and no KEI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Ya see, once upon a time, there was only clarity. And even then, only if you happened to be in a group with an enchanter - or you sought one out somewhere in the zone. There was no breeze for the lowbies, no clarity 2, KEI, Tranquility, Voice of Quellious. Some of us grew up and were level 50 back in those days, so clarity spells just arent that big of a crutch for us. I know..I know - nonsense, you say. But trust me, young grasshopper, it was so.  ;)<br />

Rathelon, can we agree that the 'bad shaman' you refer to may just be a result of bad PLAYERS and not because of the evil KEI? KEI doesn't make you go afk unannounced. KEI doesn't make you not cast buffs or slow when needed. In fact, when grouping with my Shaman, keeping buffs timed and refreshed before they drop enmasse is easier for me with KEI than without (for obvious reasons). Just like you can't blame gear for 'Drumans', I think blaming KEI for some people's lack of 'skill' at their vocation is kinda misguided.<br />
<br />
Yes, I played during the 'rough times'. When a good day of xping meant 2 blues. When enchanters 'sucked' because nobody knew what they could do. I think PoP xp (and later, the removal of the flag requirements) has more to do with 'bad players' being produced than any other single factor. Yep, people who RELY on KEI just to do even the littlest things are sad...but that can be attributed to the player behind the toon, more often than not IMO.</div></div><hr />

you have something to look forward too... get a few more levels and you can have your precious kei back, meanwhile other classes that don't have your advantages are still doing what they've always done, without complaint!<br />

I agree with ya and I disagree at the same time. In poe the other I had a paladin in my group with 9.5k hps, 2000+ ac.. now imagine the equivelant at lower levels, if I slowed a little late, it was ok he's got plenty of hps.. if I chained slow until it landed then I doted a few times resist or not, it's ok he's got aggro.. basically life was cake.. what kei does is if you miss slow or don't slow or don't maloxxx and get a bunch of resists or don't land a slow it's ok, why because the paladin will heal himself and the cleric who was meleeing the whole time at fm will still be able to heal pretty easy.. What teaches a person skills or how to be a good player is when the bad stuff happens, and with kei the bad stuff just go away.. while w/o kei if you pulled 3 to camped maybe you could kill 2 and someone will root and you'll high tail it out of there but with kei no one has mana troubles or anything, just kill and pull while the mob is at 20% cause our wizzys are at full blast.. <br />
<br />
It's the reason why warriors are not appreciated, cause that sk / paladin never meds he chain stuns or whatever it is they do and shrugs it off.. <br />
<br />
Even on these forums shaman complain about how much mana our spells cost and how our mana regen is nothing compared to other classes.. I get voq/kei whenever I can, but that's cause when I'm not raiding I want to chill and be LAZY (I admit it) but when I don't have kei I almost NEVER have mana problems full nuking/doting/slowing/topping off with heals.. so I blame kei :) because of lack of mana management or whatever it is, when some shaman don't have kei, they dont' know what to do so they just complain.. <br />
<br />
Just look, indoors there is no reason I see not to use form of the great bear (+10wis +2 hps/tic regen).. but how many shaman do it?..</div></div><hr />

i use it constantly, not just for the obvious benefits, but a big ass white bear is easy to see. i do most of the pulling unless there's not enough space or we need an FD puller. plus is comes in realy handy when i need to lead a new player to the camp site, a bear is just easier to follow. Plus i don't have those stupid stand/sit things going, and everyone loves the bear look. it's just cool looking. <br />

i find i can land slow faster if i chain malo till it sticks, or use the L60 malo, *then* slow. I guess there's no *right* way to do it. Shammy handbook isn't clear. &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />

I think general concensus (sp?) is to malos then slow.. with bard debuff + malos I would land slow about 50% of the time where we were, so for me that's a must anyway =x</div></div><hr />

Duder, get a group like I did back the day. I remember the night I got home from the Crimean War (with one leg and no fingers!!) I waited 39 hours on a list for a gator group in Upper Guk, when I got in we made a pixel of xp every week and I GOT ON MY KNEES AND THANKED JESUS in gratitude for how wonderful it was.  So go get a group you young whippersnapper<br />
<br />
The problem is that for low level people, a lot of times groups just do not exist  EQ is not a dying game but it is a very stagnant one. When I was levelling (Kunark era, so I am a mere noob here) there were literally a dozen places I could find a pickup group at 20, 30, 40.  Now they are all empty, at least on my server (which isn't that old).  When you do see people in those zones, it is some twinked-to-the-gills alt who (a) doesn't want to group with the newbie and (b) the experience would suck for the newbie anyway.<br />
<br />
I had a heartbreaking experience a few months back in Upper G when someone, mid 20's if I recall, was looking for a group. I talked with him a while, and it was just sad hearing about the experience of a new player today.  Yes, he had better gear than I did because of the bazaar.  But he just could not find anyone to play with past Paludal (and even then, he pointed out, it was almost all twinks).  I offered to PL him a bit, but that wasn't what he wanted.  He wanted to play the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
That excuse about having to sit and wait doesnt make you a better player? That's complete bull and a copout. Learning how to avoid that downtime is what makes all good casters stand above the rest. Using KEI to avoid it isnt learning - it's a crutch.<br />
<br />
Bull****.  I know that you think that &quot;omg if only you try hard enough I can will the rules of basic arithmetic to change for my l33t skillz&quot; but trust me, that ain't true.  Show me how an untwinked wizard can reasonably quad (or hell, even solo) xp mobs with zero downtime at lvl 35, and I would pretend for just a moment that you have a clue.<br />
<br />
Let me get this straight. You are complaining, because you have to rest/med TWO lousy minutes per mob, you just soloed - meanwhile there are classes out there, that can't even solo effectively at all ?  I got your point, oh wait I don't /boggle.<br />
<br />
Wait.  You think this thread is about balance between classes that can solo and classes that cannot?  I got your point, oh wait you are illiterate.<br />
<br />
As for med time, I have no doubt that for you, sitting and staring at your computer screen or the boob tube for eight minutes between every 2-3 minutes of action is very exciting.  Hell, I even hear that you are almost at the point where you catch almost all of your drool in that cup rather than letting it splash on the keyboard.  I am very proud of you for that, really I am. <br />
<br />
However, the fact that this activity presses all of your mental abilities to their absolute limit is irrelevant to my point, which is that for the majority of human beings whose mommies did not drink 3 quarts of gin every day that they were pregnant this activity is painfully dull.  Now EQ isn't - and shouldn't - be an action clickfest a la Diablo, but it simply is more fun with a little less downtime then the amount imposed on an untwinked newb in their 30's.     <br />
<br />
Sorry, if that sounds kind of flaming here, but i really get tired with that 'faster, better, higher, give me now' - attitude. Isn't there enough of that in RL already?[<br />
<br />
It does, but really, what the hell are you talking about?  I think you got lost on your way to the 700 Club message board or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">Think thats the problem with this debate. Some situations having kei and learing the game doesnt go hand in hand. Sitting after a quad or soloing for that matter really doesnt matter about kei. I think its more in the group situation. Why learn to FD and split pull as an SK when the cleric had c3 and can just keep everyone alive through over pulls in earlier lvls. <br />
  Why as a wizard learn how much nuking per mob per pull is required? Screw that i'm nuking with the c3 hard. Again it doesnt matter if i draw aggro the cleric always has mana. That stuff does matter later on even with C3 but alot of people still play like they are lvl 30 with mana to spare. <br />
Its when i see a shaman and they ass me to help them split the mobs with my pally (pacify) and he has full health so i assume ready. I ask rdy to roll? Oh nope OOM but i have a c4 should be good to go in a minute. I started throwing Q on him and he finally starting canning after a minute or two. PLenty more examples i can go through. <br />
   I do understandmedding at lower lvls sucks needs to be raised to a quicker amount. 11 minutes of medding with my wizard used to drive me nuts. I have a mid 50's wizard that was ruined to cann and at the time didnt have c3 as an option. Medding didnt make me a better wizard no but not having C3 might of had alot to do with i think me being a good one. The double edged sword though is i stopped playing my wizard because of the long med times.</div></div><hr />

I don't think you can solely attribute that to the KEI generation. I've been around since march 2000 and play in spurts then take months off at a time. I'm your ultimate casual gamer, I'm not uber but have seen the inside of almost every xping zone from 1-60 and know what it's like to stare at a spellbook covering your entire screen and experience hell levels and level slowly.<br />
<br />
It's scary talking to some people lately because they've never seen the inside of a dungeon except Power Leveling er PL Caverns. I've been in groups lately with peeps who have never been to Dalnir, Paw, Guk, SolA/B, Chardok and Seb. They take the easy 5-25 PL route then --&gt; OT -&gt; DL -&gt; PoI/PoN/PoD and wammo they are now in tier2/3. They can shoot up that fast without KEI. <br />
<br />
Some amazing stuff I've seen lately:<br />
<br />
- Shaman who don't know how to canni dance. Well ****, if they get a horse and spend 100% time outdoors then they don't have to. Very sad.<br />
<br />
- Clueless twits who all stand with the MT in front of the mob while attacking. I don't even try telling them anymore to attack from the rear where the mob can't riposte, dodge/block/parry because they just don't listen. Seen plenty of soloing shaman, beastlords doing this also, they will attack with pet by their side instead of getting pet to hit from behind.<br />
<br />
- People who don't know what tag pulling means. Then I have to wait 20 minutes while the monk explains it to the MT.<br />
<br />
- MTs who don't have a clue that the mage and/or necro are using rogue pets and are too lazy to move a little bit to get them positioned in the rear.<br />
<br />
It's just too easy to level knowadays even without KEI. When it's too easy to level people don't spend the time learning some of the finer points of the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guess we'll have to agree to disagree here then. I believe it's not the downtime that makes a good caster, it's the PLAYER running that caster that makes them good or bad. Every class can cite examples of people who didn't know what their particular class could do. Hell, I can give you examples of rogues who couldn't CR a group from Crypt in Sebilis at level 65 with Shroud of Stealth.<br />
<br />
at least you have the option! try being one of those warrs sitting on their ass in pot, waiting for all the knights to get snatched up so they can have a shot at a little xp.<br />
<br />
I dunno about all that. I'm also a 'non-soloable' class and I can get AA xp fine in Velks. Solo. Is it optimal? Heck no. But neither is soloing pre-60 for wizards. It's something to do while you're LFG or short on playtime, especially now with group bonuses being what they are. Warriors can do the same, especially since they have better damage absorption/mitigation than pretty much any other class. It's a new day. Now, EVERY class has the option of soloing. Warriors, Rogues, Clerics, ALL of them. It may not be a very attractive option, but it IS an option.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think the biggest issue now is how Uggok put it. Folks level too fast now and don't take the time to 'smell the roses', so to speak.<br />
<br />
The problem is that for low level people, a lot of times groups just do not exist EQ is not a dying game but it is a very stagnant one.

Trena's levelling path<br />
1-5 Everfrost<br />
5-14 East/West Commons, North Ro<br />
14-17 Upper Guk<br />
17-30 Lake of Ill Omen, Crystal Caverns<br />
30-40 The Overthere, Lower Guk, Eastern Wastes (Ry`Gorr fort)<br />
40-50 Sol B, Lower Guk, The Hole<br />
50-60 Sebilis, Karnor's, Howling Stones, The Hole, Maiden's Eye, Akheva, Dragon Necropolis, Velks, dinged 60 in Fungus Grove<br />
60-65 Plane of Valor and Bastion of Thunder<br />
<br />
Now, go to OT during prime time. There's 12 people in zone (IF THAT). I remember when there would be like 50 people pulling everything that moved that didn't have 'Dragoon' or 'General' in its name. DL is full of low 30s. Sol B is EMPTY (pre-kunark people, did you EVER thing you'd hear those words?). Lower Guk is full of lvl 60+ people farming live frog faction. DN only has people in it when Zland or Kland is up. ME has tons of people farming for the VT shard. People are running to PoP at 46 fgs! Lake of Ill Omen is devoid of people except for the group headed to Veksar or the intrepid soul hoping the Bloodgill Marauder stays alive long enough for them to kill it. Where exactly are these groups you're referring to?<br />
<br />
Given the state of the game today, I don't think KEI for under 45s was a bad idea. At least not for the relatively short amount of time it was available (what, 16 months?). Like I said before, melee have had access to downtime killing items since release. From Rubicite Aura to Fungal Regrowth and Aura of Health/Battle.<br />
<br />
It's the reason why warriors are not appreciated, cause that sk / paladin never meds he chain stuns or whatever it is they do and shrugs it off<br />
<br />
No.<br />
<br />
Warriors are not appreciated now because taunt is BROKEN. Has little to do with Paladins or SKs having KEI. Even if that Paladin/SK takes time to med, he/she can still outaggro that Warrior at will. My damage in xp groups is much higher with a Paladin/SK/RANGER/SHAMAN as MT than a warrior because I don't have to evade every time the button ungreys or wait 15 seconds before engaging the mob when it gets to camp.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, the gist of my argument (if you wanna call it that) is that bad players make bad characters, not any external influence like KEI.</div></div><hr />

I ran into a 53 druid that was fighting in BW. I started to question her as to why she didn't quad. She replied that she didn't know how. What?!?! A druid that has never quaded before? Funny thing is she was in the prime zone for quading. All the mobs move at the same speed when snared, giants, skeles, moldering gorillas, everything. Then come to find out she didn't even know about her level 53 DoT, Winged Death. Winged Death is the turning point in a druid's life and she'd never heard of it! Kei wasn't the problem here, this person was just too lazy to do a little research on her class. pft<br />
<br />
I leveled a necro to 49 with Kei on me at all times. Once I hit 49 I switched to lich and said goodbye to Kei forever. The necro boards said that you should level without kei so that you'll be more prepared when you get lich. And do you know what? It took me all of 10 mins to learn how to fight nonstop and be full health/mana at the end of the fight.<br />
<br />
It's the person behind the character, not Kei that is the problem. Btw, I read somewhere that the overall average IQ of the general population is 110. If this is true then it would explain a lot.<br />

Not everyone reads the spoiler sites, and SOE doesn't keep nearly enough lore in game to educate people who don't. :)<br />
<br />
Buffs like KEI and Aego died together for the lower levels. However, regen items are much cheaper than FT items, and more are wearable at low levels. Melee's still have a big advantage over casters while &quot;growing up twinked&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Warriors are not appreciated now because taunt is BROKEN. Has little to do with Paladins or SKs having KEI. Even if that Paladin/SK takes time to med, he/she can still outaggro that Warrior at will. My damage in xp groups is much higher with a Paladin/SK/RANGER/SHAMAN as MT than a warrior because I don't have to evade every time the button ungreys or wait 15 seconds before engaging the mob when it gets to camp.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are 2 ways I can respond to this.. first kei babies who don't know how to control their aggro can't play with a warrior. I can't think of a class that can't outaggro anywarrior. (cleric included, just spam sr).<br />
<br />
Second is in sol ro we usually pull 2 at a time with 2 warriors in my group, I malos slow one, malos slow the other, bos one bos the other.. then I go in with melee, wait until 50ish when I redo bos on both, and start chain nuking.. How much more aggro do you want? taunt atm is too good.. <br />
<br />
in the plane of air I was scared ****less cause we were fighting a monster who at the slightest bit of aggro mismanagement would wipe the guild (3k directed ae).. anyway.. aggro was controlled too well by the warrior and we've been flawless on him countless number of times.. please don't blame the taunt, it's the keibabies..</div></div><hr />

I bet if kei was not around, at every level she would be looking to see what she could do to get better, and to kill better. Why should she get kei when she is sitting at fm using a less mana efficient dot.. she probably has to quest for it (don't know much about druids), and with kei she can avoid that and get to xxx level and buy the better spells.</div></div><hr />

If i already wasnt going to do any research and kei kept me running that much faster why bother ever learning the right way? Granted i understand kei isnt the devil and doesnt automatically make a player bad. <br />
<br />
   PLenty of people can get kei and still learn and still research and just helps them lvl quicker. But the bad ones or average players can be just that much worse when they kei'ed up. Its the same with melee who fungi up. Ive met some really crappy monks who were fungi tuniced. They didnt need to learn anything just killed killed killed killed. Kei isnt the only reason for bad players. Some people are fine with it but really whats the % of players who will learn their class as opposed who level quick as possible with little thought as possible? Kei isnt the devil but it isnt a saint either heh.</div></div><hr />

Actually this is my main. I deleted my druid and started over. <br />
<br />
As far as money goes, I took a 15 month break. When I came back a friend of mine set me up with aprox 40kpp. I turned that into well over 200kpp in a few months by playing in the bazaar. My friend has over 1,000,000 plat. It's not unusual to see players with tons of cash these days, especially if they have been playing the game from the begining.<br />

<br />
Taunt isnt broken. Warriors are not supposed to be able to lock aggro on themselves, because that would make fights too easy. 'Everyone blast away and do as much damage as you can, the warrior will take all the hits for you all.' <br />
<br />
If a warrior cant hold aggro, it's the other people in the group who are wrong. Paladins and shadowknights chain stunning or casting hate inducers just to prove how valuable they are. Rangers thinking they will 'save' the shaman by casting snare - when the shaman has just as much AC and more hps than him. Shamans, on the other hand, who dont know enough to stand next to/behind the warrior when they slow. Robes that nuke/dot to high hell until the mob chases their ass down - and then they run around. The caster who tries to save the fool running in a circle by rooting the mob and the mob then turns and beats the crap out of the rogue, ignoring the warrior because of proximity. And the bard...well, who the hell knows they're even there except for those annoying icons flashing in the song window. Play Shield of Songs, maestro, I'm cannibalizing over here. (Just kidding, I like bards - not kidding about the shield of songs part though)<br />
<br />
People have to realize, warrior's arent superman. They can hold aggro, if you LET them. When I was leveling my warrior with my shaman, it only took 1 taunt for him to take aggro back after a slow. That's how easy it is, if you stand next to him so he has that chance. Of course, you cant just go plop your butt down immediately after that either - it's amazing how many casters still havent learned about sit aggro as well.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the gist of my argument (if you wanna call it that) is that bad players make bad characters, not any external influence like KEI.<br />
<br />
Yes, Trena, I agree. Bad players do make bad characters. What I wonder is why are there so many more of them, and how did they all get to level 65 and end up in the places I'm hunting all of a sudden? Just because it's faster to level these days? We should completely ignore the fact that many of them leveled up when KEI could be used at any level - because that didnt have any effect whatsoever on their playing. Right? I think that's where we disagree.</div></div><hr />

The whole basis of your argument is that kei doesn't effect anything because you got to level 46 in 2 weeks and so did your friend. I think most parts of this issue is an opinion but you saying everyone can get to 46 in 2 weeks and everyone is doing it so it doesn't matter is IMO just wrong.. a lot of people can't get to 46 soon, some don't want to and in the end, if you got 46 in 2 weeks I think a lot is wrong with that.. like your abjuration =p and I have a friend with 3million plats just on his alt so there! my dad can beat up your dad to boot.</div></div><hr />

Hey look, you brought up the money. I merely demonstrated that with some up front cash and a little work, anyone can make money in this game. <br />
<br />
And what exactly is wrong with getting to 46 in 2 weeks? That's just the amount of time it took. Using my shaman is a poor example because shaman are a very equipment dependant class but I assumed you would see though that when I mentioned a mage that made 46 in less then 2 weeks. No amount of gear except for FT gear and a horse would have helped the mage level any quicker. <br />
<br />
So, what's the point of all this? My take is that it's so easy to get to 46 with or without kei that it almost doesn't matter. As far as why the new players suck at their class.../shrug...got me.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">kei really didnt make anyone a bad player...if someone didnt read about their class or ask questions or try new things..that made them bad.  There were plenty of bad players before kei was out.<br />
<br />
My opinion is KEI reduced the thing that makes the game boring..downtime.  Whats fun about killing something and then sitting around for a while doing nothing?  I originally made a shaman because i saw they could regen mana fast and reduce the downtime that my ranger had.  That said, i didnt get KEI until i was level 50ish.  At first i thought it wasnt really necessary, but after i got it i realized i could do more in less time.<br />
<br />
I guess if your opinion is you think people not having to sit around for 5+ minutes makes them a bad player..you better start petitioning that you have to look at the spell book while medding.  And dont stop there..you better insist the hell levels be put back in, because people getting visible exp movement per kill is only a bad thing and makes them bad players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Cirin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">I'd have to agree that KEI itself didnt make bad players...in many cases, that was decided before they even opened to box with the game cd's in it. For all the bad lazy, players we are complaining about, im sure there are many that took the time to learn thier chosen class, worked on skills, etc...we just never hear about them because they know what they are doing. The only thing the KEI/Aego buffs did in regards to the 'bad players' was sped the path to the high end game, where thier shortcomings became truly glaring.<br />
<br />
 I'm glad they fixed it..but I have to admit I think they waited far too long. With EQ2 on the horizon and a slew of other games on the way out, the last thing you should want to be doing is something that destabilizes (i.e. irritates) the player base.</div></div><hr />

Just my opinion that if you are killing monsters faster than you are regenning mana, then something is wrong.. most likely either nuking too hard or too much dps cause you got too many twinks.. that's all. so far I've gotten 2 aa reading these boards in poe that's how easy it is with kei and it's not right.. =]</div></div><hr />

First of all I don't recall saying that I spent 200kpp on him but I did spend a fair amount. Prices on Stormhammer are generally considerably higher then on most other servers but it's a small price to pay to play on a server with less children such as yourself. Oh, did you happen to look through my bags? Probably not...Lol<br />
<br />
I have 2 questions for you, how exactly did I &quot;bomb&quot; on my gear selection and what the hell is your malfunction? We are having a relatively calm debate on how kei has affected the game mechanics and YOU have to try and start a flame war over nothing. Are you that insecure in real life? Are you one of those guys that built their ego around a cartoon character? What was that old story about building your house on a bed of sand?<br />

One last thing, for some reason, leveling to 46 has become pretty easy, probably because I've done it so much. Paludal Caverns will take you to 26 in a few hours, then MS till 29, then Dawnshroud till 35-40. Then overthere, yeti caves, echo caverns, Gunthak, Dulak, etc. It was a lot easier this time around without kei then I thought it was going to be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
errrr, kinda OT but, where exactly did he bomb? I ask because many of the items he has are ones I either have on Amorae or had planned to get for her. Some things I would do differently (Belt of Dripping Bile instead of Mithaniel girdle, Grey flesh arms instead of the Zraxthil, Tae Ew shield or Tactician's Bulwark instead of the cartographer's ink thingy in the secondary slot, and I'd probably never get the eyepatch since from what I was told, 15wis isn't enough benefit to give up the ac/hp/pure mana that could go in that slot) but overall it seems like a pretty decent setup.<br />
<br />
And after Webber mentioned it, I looked in his bags. :p I'm guessing Malo, Torpor, and Avatar might have drained a lot of his plat flow.<br />
<br />
But I'm sincerely interested in how the more experienced folk would do it differently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>celebel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">to people saying 'I am not a better wizard for sitting and medding', I would say that they should ask sony to add a button on the creation screen to decide the level to start their new character...that s the next step after saying: I am not able to kill mobs all the time without breaks and alone. does this not sound wrong?<br />
<br />
why do we have to kill mobs and med to gain experience?...maybe it s about the meaning of being 65. I remember when I was leveling, sometimes I saw high level characters crossing the zone and I was respectful...I was dreaming about one day being powerfull and like them.<br />
<br />
I understand someone who spent one year or more to level one char would like to speed up a bit the leveling of his new char (twinking, PL, ...).<br />
<br />
 However the ability for a new player to go straight to the higher levels of the game is a non-sense. <br />
<br />
The game is fun at all levels, and people saying they want to play in raids with high level people must earn it...if that s not what you want, sorry it s the wrong game you are playing....you have to earn your levels, or at least that was the initial goal.<br />
<br />
and someone being oom all the time should maybe think about doing quests/tradeskills to improve their equipment/manapool. They also should work on game mechanics to understand how to better use their class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Two quick short stories.<br />
<br />
Pulling in CoD iwth my 61 Monk. Have standard group to include a 60 Enchanter. Now as you may remember, it's pretty easy to single pull there, with the occasional hiding MOB that comes too.<br />
<br />
Well suffice to say, that on the RARE occasion I brought two MOBs? This Enchanter did not even budge. No attempt to mez or slow or anything.<br />
<br />
SS # 2. In BoT with my 63 Enchanter. Lock down a Kriegel first and shoot group the usual message /g a X Kriegel is MEZZED.  Five seconds later - someone in group (Ranger from High End Guild) tells MA to SWITCH!<br />
<br />
Without missing a beat, Warrior breaks mez (no taunt) and we proceed to wipe.<br />
<br />
During CR I asked the Ranger why he told the MA to switch?  His answer?<br />
<br />
&quot;I heard Kriegels were hard to mez.&quot; <br />
<br />
Whether it's KEI, equipment, other buffs, PL'ing, I dunno. But to compare Warriors in that blue stuff with Yaks trying to break Fear to today's kids who LAUGH at a 21 / 23 Paladin hammer, I definitely think the quality of player has gone down.</div></div><hr />

fun stories, I don't know what you consider &quot;High end guild&quot; I consider it elemental enabled, (ie killed rztw w/o help).. anyway someone like that will not get into a high end guild and should fail the probation period.. do the guild a favor, send the ranger's guild officers a tell telling em exactly what happened.. I'm sure they will appreciate it.. last thing anyone needs is for mez to be broken in a bad situation.. <br />

The whole idea of anyone but the cc calling a change of targets is retarded to me.. this is probably the same ranger who called &quot;run&quot; in my group when I was level 55 when he found out hobgoblins are not snareable.. or is it that guy who said he didn't need a shaman cause he had kei and would rather solo.. hmm bad experiences with rangers..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u91"><b>Webber</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p91">&quot;Some things I would do differently (Belt of Dripping Bile instead of Mithaniel girdle, Grey flesh arms instead of the Zraxthil, Tae Ew shield or Tactician's Bulwark instead of the cartographer's ink thingy in the secondary slot, and I'd probably never get the eyepatch since from what I was told, 15wis isn't enough benefit to give up the ac/hp/pure mana that could go in that slot) but overall it seems like a pretty decent setup.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm not familier with the Belt of Dripping Bile, I'll have to check into that one. I'm going to be changing out my arms soon, I just havn't gotten around to it yet. As far as the cartographer's ink bottle, well, I'm just a sucker for particle effects :) As far as the eyepatch, I'm desperatly searching the bazaar for something else to wear but the only upgrade I can find without spending 30k are those spider eyes. I'm not sure 35 hp's is going to make that much difference.<br />
<br />
I started this character on Stormhammer. On SH, prices are generally higher then I'm used to. Fungi tunics 55k, tae ew bp's and legs 18k. On my old server, fungis sold for 40k and tae ew bps and legs sold for 4k each. I did the best I can with what I had.<br />

Edited: I just upgraded my face to a Mask of the Hailstorms and my arms to Hardened Grey Flesh Sleeves. I checked out the Belt of Dripping Bile but I found the Girdle of Mithaniel to have better stats. Oh, and your going to have to pry that ink bottle from my cold dead hands ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">The low level game is pretty screwed up right now.  Partially due to lack of low level players, partially due to stupidly over-the-top xp mods in luclin outdoor zones, partially due to mudflation, and at one time partially due to high level group buffs.<br />
<br />
I hate to call for nerfs, but IMO that's what it'd take to bring things back to some semblance of normalcy for the low level game.  There's no reason why outdoor luclin zones that any solo or group of monkey(s) could successfully hunt in should give better xp than a dungeon that requires a semi-skilled group.  They could up the xp mods in old dungeons like Kaesora, Dalnirs, Splitpaw, Mistmoore, etc... but then they'd just speed up the whole levelling process even more and that's not necessarily a good thing either IMO.  As many others have already pointed out, it's ridiculously easy to level already.<br />
<br />
Revamping some of the old low-mid level dungeons with one feature would make them a lot more appealing IMO.   GRAVEYARDS.  Why is it that the highest level zones where people are supposed to already know how to play the game have the no-brainer get out of CR free card and the learning dungeons can result in CRs that takes literally hours?  <br />
<br />
Kaesora was an awesome dungeon and uber xp in mid 30s if you had a group that could handle it.  The problem was that nobody wanted to go there because it was linear by design and once you committed by dropping in, there was no return other than to fight through at least a third of the whole place to get back to the zone out.  If you wiped out at the Library.... /cringe<br />
<br />
Level limited gear is a good change to curb the effects of mudflation on the lower level gameplay, as is restricting high level buffs.  Adjust the xp mods so that it's WORTHWHILE to xp in more dangerous zones and pop a few graveyards into some of those lower level dungeons and I think you'd see a marked shift in where people spend their time levelling up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>nornez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">I totally believe KEI at the lower levels for first time toons especially makes for terrible, terrible mana management skills. It makes me sick when in pick-up groups &amp; someone has to run to the nexus for a hit of KEI. Or if they hold off you gotta listen to them whine every 2 minutes about how they are outta F@$%ing mana... the worst by far I've found are droods.<br />
<br />
I almost avoid grp'ing with droods because I guarantee that 3 out 4 will need to run for a KEI refresh when it fades because they have done nothing other than solo / quad to get to POP. They don't don't know how to play the game not hopped up &amp; that is because they have always had KEI.<br />
<br />
Most other caster classes seem to be alright except the odd wizzie who I guess thinks it's kewl to chain nuke their biggest nukes on every mob &amp; without KEI this makes their life miserable.<br />
<br />
Glad to see these buffs restricted to lvl 46+.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Background here is I started as a monk (55), shifted to the wizard (before the monk nerf:  it wasn't a factor in my decision) and my shaman is now my main.  The Wizard is 63, shaman is 58.  (Um....  anyone have a copy of Pox on Brell they want to part with cheap?  ....  Didn't think so.  Anyway....)<br />
<br />
As a wizard in a grind group, my method was to drop my mana down to about 50 to 60% and keep it there.  Below that, I rarely nuke.  Above that, I added an extra.  This gave me consistent damage, was never wasting time with a full mana bar, and saved mana for that critical time when something had to die RIGHT NOW! If two nukes per mob lets you maintain that level of mana indefinitely, nuke twice per mob.  Might as well make those two nukes at the end of a fight to avoid stealing agro.<br />
<br />
Quad kiting:  It sounds backwards, but quad kiting is my relaxation time.  I go kill the quad, use my harvests, and kick back with a book or chat with friends.  KEI means I read less, it being gone doesn't mean I stop hunting.</div></div><hr />

And that's why you are not a crack baby.. you play the game the way it was meant to be played..</div></div><hr />

Personally, I'd relegate the Lodi shield to resist gear and replace it with a Hiero cloak or Cloak of Greater Pernicity (depending on your budget and server pricing). I stayed away from Night Terror chain due to level (making the stats less) and the fact that with the same level restrictions, Hurricane chain is generally better for most slots. The last thing I wanted to do was get something that I would have to upgrade almost immediately anyway.<br />
<br />
It also depends on what you prefer your focus to be. I know of several Shaman who are +mana freaks and will often make slight concessions elsewhere to add more pure mana (along with hp, of course. These aren't KEI babies :p). Personally, given the way I play Amorae usually (grouped with the rogue so the shaman tanks more often than not), I'm an AC/HP/resists freak. So I'd go with a Bloodmetal earring of engagement over the skull charm.<br />
<br />
Just my suggestions based on the advice of the many shaman friends I bugged for info and mined from these forums :)<br />
<br />
Oh, and btw, KEI is restricted to 45+ and C2 is restricted to 42+. Learned this one levelling my ranger. Spells seem to be level limited until 45. Like, you can't cast Spirit of Eagle on a level 40 but you can cast it on a level 42. But you can't cast Natureskin (level 57 druid buff) on that 42, you have to wait til 44. Once you get to 45 though, all bets are off and spells of any level will stick on a character.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i agree with you btw...<br />
<br />
anyways... i've preached about this on other boards. <br />
<br />
if you are runnin OOM there are 2 reasons for it...<br />
<br />
1.) You are over playing your class<br />
2.) You're fighting **** that's too high level for your group (i.e. powerlevelling yourself)<br />
<br />
i'm not gonna bother to elaborate other than to say those two things are necessarily *bad*, just recognize what your doing. KEI makes it a lot easier for you to over play your class or powerlevel yourself.<br />
<br />
i'm speaking mainly for the &lt;L60 crowd. KEI was introduced to L60 characters (i.e. it's a L60 spell), so imho it's as essential to the &gt;60 zone as focus, tugur, haste etc.<br />
<br />
before i passed the L60 mark, stuff i was fighting didn't drain mana, and you could get by with BST crack or clarity. If you didn't have a chanter in the group, you just did without and were fine. unless the healer's and casters were meleeing or something, they didn't really run out of mana much.</div></div><hr />
