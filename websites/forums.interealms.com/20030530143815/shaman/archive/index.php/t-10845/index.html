<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haimon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So last night I picked up Malo in the Bazaar for 29K. Hurt the wallet but hey, i'm half-way a shaman . My question is this, I have not yet memed it because I wanted to ask this board what their opinions might be about the following options:<br />
<br />
1. Scribe the damn spell already and use it to ease the killing in say PoG and work up the cash for Torpor, or for killing others that have it in their loot table.<br />
<br />
2. Trade it for Torpor (not too keen on this one)<br />
<br />
Someone in the shaman channel last night mentioned reselling it for a profit, however thats not going to happen. I guess what i'm really asking is since I'm about 14 AA's away from Cann5, maybe Malo is better off for me at this particular time. BTW, i'm in a small family type guild and we don't raid much, so Malo would just be for personal use most of the time. Thanks in advance for your patience on reading a topic resurrected more times than your local Ranger.<br />

Neither. Go play the lottery.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Trade for torpor. Torpor&gt;malo as far as soloing ability goes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rewts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">On my server you  would need 3 or 4 copies of Malo to trade for Torpor.  I would scribe it and consider yourself half way there.  It will make some camps much easier now, especially solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would be inclined to scribe it and start saving again.  Torpor &gt; Malo in a lot of situations but I would not trade a copy of Torpor for Malo even up.<br />
<br />
The other option would be to sell for a big boost in the bank and keep saving untill you get torp, but I would just scribe it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you don't raid much, you can get by without it just fine.  I use it a lot in in BoT (for safety) and some in PoV (depends on my mood), but I'd much rather have torpor than it if I had a choice between the 2.  You lose a good bit of mana regen without torpor.<br />
<br />
The other thing to consider is Quiscence.  If you are going for 65 and get a BoT key, you may get a chance at a rune drop, and get Q there.  No reason to buy torpor if you've got that.<br />
<br />
Pre-PoP I'd have definitely gone with torpor.  Post I'd probably still go with it, but a closer decision (especially since you already have Malo).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kaldia Gaurav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It really depends on what your focus is. Do you solo most of the time? Are you the main shaman for your guild, or most raids?<br />
<br />
I was lucky enough to get torpor on a trak raid, but took forever for me to finally find Malo. Malo was much more important to me as I am the main shaman on any of my guild's raids, and having malo makes the difference on whether or not you can start doing guild only raids in certian places. (ToV, VP, etc)<br />
<br />
IMO, if you solo alot, torpor is much more valuable, but if you're a big raider/grouper, then you want malo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">OMG..if i could buy Malo for 29k i'd own it already! scribe it and make sure raiding guilds know you have it.  Do highly MR mobs solo or duo, get into some raids, go do pog and buy topor with the proceeds.<br />
<br />
lucky bastage</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Scribe the spell.  I raid so much I slightly miss torpor I greatly miss malo.  Hoping to have these soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you're planning to go for 65, I'd scribe it now and hit the planes hard.  Get flagged for POV/POS and BoT.  Get flagged for anything else you can manage.  Get spectrals.  Sell the MQ rights to your spectrals, or just turn them in for druid spells and sell the druid spells.  SAVE MONEY!  When you hit 65, you should have the 100k or so to buy Quiescence, which is a much better bargain than paying 80k for Torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wolfdale01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You're much more valuable in raids and XP groups if you have Malo.  Malo/Tash are critical against high-end mobs.  Torpor is useful in raids if you have Canni 5.<br />
<br />
Also, in PvP, Malo = God :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Haimon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thanks for the replies guys. I think when I get home I'll just go ahead and scribe it. Land had a good idea and that is a path I may take, we'll see.<br />
<br />
By the way, does Malo and Malosini stack?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Sini overwrites Malo.  Basically, you land Malo in order to land sini on tough mobs.</div></div><hr />
