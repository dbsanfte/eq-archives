<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently duoed with a 41 magi, it was great! he used water pet and i used shamans dogdog. I quicked and regened pets, and slowed incoming mobs.  The mage pulled with malise, which helped a lot. Pets had DS on them, and i kept them healed with my spare mana.  We grouped for 3 hours and got KEI only in the 2nd half. all in all it was very nice exp!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Laproaigh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I also used to duo with a mage around those levels. After about 34 you can duo efficiently with pretty much anyone. All it takes is a bit of skill. This is a great perk of the shaman class because you can chose your partern-team members based on other things. Such as friendship or skill. Back then there was no such think as KEI though. And if you wanted to pets could actually out taunt you. At the moment pets only really generate proximity aggro which means you probably need to root the mob for it to turn on the pet. This has the side effect of healung pets generating no aggro at all. Depending on your mana supply and ability to channel you may want to chose to tank yourself. If you've played a druidic shaman as your other post states your defensive skill could probably use some training.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">And at 60 both classes work WONDERFULLY as a duo.  Mage sics pet which tanks and I pull with slow and torpor mage so he/she can modrod continuously making themselves a mana factory.  Out of this mana factory comes ASSLOADS of burnage making mobs die extremely fast, making exp fly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">One reason this synergy works is that you bring something to the table that the Mage doesn't have: root and CC. (Yes Earth pet can root).<br />
<br />
But to the original poster - WTG! :)= Two pets, your healing, his nukes, and slows.  Plus he can mod rod and you heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think a mage's burnout has higher haste than our haste spell (hmm is it alacrity at or quickness at that lvl?)<br />
<br />
<br />
Either way I thin BOII is &gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A Shaman should almost never be using his mana to Haste the pet of a Mage he is grouped with.<br />
<br />
Burnout (level 12) = AC 8, Str 12, Haste 15%<br />
Burnout 2 (level 29) = AC 9, Str (39-45), Haste (29-35)%<br />
Burnout 3 (level 49) = AC 14, Str 50, Haste 60%<br />
Burnout 4 (level 55) = AC 17, Str 60, Haste 65%<br />
<br />
Quickness (level 29) = 30%<br />
Alacrity (level 49) = 40%<br />
Celerity (level 56) = 50%<br />
<br />
It doesn't hurt anything to throw the haste spell on a Mage pet (but it will cause problems on Necro pets - their buffs have stacking problems with Haste spells), but it is rarely beneficial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My RL friend runs a 53 mage and we group in Maidens Eye and the exp is great. Better than the glorified monk/shaman combo. We can easily handle up to 4 Goranga followers/lookouts at once.<br />
<br />
I was with a 51/52 monk paladin combo and they could not compete with what the mage and I can do.. Although I believe there equipment was below average. I think the problem is that I spend more mana on heals with Monks. The mage can heal his own pet many times and i can cast more dots like Bane when needed as the pets require alot less healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yep, mages are pretty tasty duo partners, the mage epic pet with 24/7 avatar as well as focus is just plain sick =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Only problem, is that my dogdog always tank instead than the mage epic pet /shrug<br />
Even with taunt off ...<br />
I think it's because my pet is closer of the mob and green..<br />
So now, when groupped with mage, I don't make a pet, or I tank for both.</div></div><hr />
