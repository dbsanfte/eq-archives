<br />
Not nice for the general public. It is just another channel they can hide behind. <br />
<br />
Ahh well we are a surly, unruly bunch. Ill mannered and prone to violent temper tantrums.  (Gosht hat fits me to a T. I would be offended if I was not the one writing it.. (Grins)<br />
<br />
But lack of communication is not our fault in this. We are desperate for communication that is intellegent and viable to what concerns us. But behind the locked doors is all we hear about.<br />
<br />
Frankly I think it is Bs. But then again any club that would have me as a member I wouldnt want to join anyways...<br />
<br />
The signal to noise ratio must be pretty good thou. Shame they dont anything of the sort for non raiders. I would really like to sit down and beat up on the devs a little. I wish Absor would have lived up to that huge set of posts we talked about back before omens was delayed. And chatted with us some more. <br />
<br />
Glori. please do me a huge favor. Yell at them some for me. No Gm in thier right mind would have let this go on as long as it has in a Pen and paper game. <br />
<br />
Send them this for me. <br />
<br />
Where is class balance discussions.?<br />
<br />
Where are the Class definitions.? <br />
<br />
Where is the parity between The preist classes.<br />
<br />
Are they even aware that with Mitagation in on every single monster Our heals all need at least a 25% boost in Omens zones.? Why is that not thought about or addressed. A cleric gets the benifit of a shaman in the group. The benifit of slow. A shaman gets replaced if a cleric is in the group. <br />
<br />
Toss this at them. Make shaman HoT's and cleric HoT's stack guess what. You just increased the viability of a shaman and cleric duo. While not at all affecting the Shaman druid dynamic Or the cleric druid dynamic. <br />
<br />
Cleric / Druid heals and buffs stack well (And overlap) <br />
<br />
Shaman/ druid heals work well together but the lack of an xp res makes this only viable in certain cercumstances. Make it so that Call of the wild from a druid + call of wild from shaman together combines into a Xp res Equal to paladins.  (Only when used in conjuction, combining the Natural world with the spirit world) <br />
<br />
But Cleric / shaman heals don't work worth a damn. We can spam heal. Our HoT's bring zero to the table with the superiour cleric hots.<br />
<br />
Ahh well back to work..<br />

<br />
I don't understand the accusation of &quot;hiding&quot; at all. The summit forum would be about as useful as the eqlive forums if they let anybody post there.<br />
<br />
Although the guild summit forum isn't really intended for class balance, it's where I started the dialogue with Vahlar to get the Nadox spawn fixed. Very handy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I am comfortable with the concept of the developers speaking to a select subset of their clientele.  At least we have a top-notch rep there.<br />
<br />
Have you ever tried to read the EQ Live boards?  I can never stay on it for more than a few posts - there are WAAY too many posters there that make me uncomfortable admitting I also am a shaman.  The level of ignorance and vituperation is simply far too high there too often.  Picture that from all the classes.<br />
<br />
I am beginning to believe that the class reps there are more babysitters than spokespeople to the developers - the other channel is for information.  No wonder it is so hard to find anyone to represent the class.<br />
<br />
There are many intelligent, well written posts of issues here, nany that are a pleasure to read.  But there is even more horse manure.  And this is the best class site I am aware of.  <br />
<br />
If I were a developer, I would be thrilled to have a back door to folks able to wade through the manure and pass the gems on to me.  Looks like they have that.</div></div><hr />

Strangely enough it is nice for the general public<br />
<br />
By tweaking the static to noise ratio the developers listen to I've seen more good come out of this in the last few months than I'd seen in years.  <br />
<br />
I don't like knowing I'm not special either, but not going to complain about something that is working.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They're a fairly long respawn.. I'd assume you'd still have to kill them but anyone logging on late would be able to join raids faster. (Just need to organise 1 CoH in Txevu -&gt; raid rather than 2 CoH's (Qvic -&gt; Txevu, then Txevu -&gt; raid.))<br />
<br />
Good change imo!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nothing against you or your attending these meetings/forums.   But the concept of Dev's speaking with selected &quot;Guild&quot; rep's just brings back old memories/stories about Power Guilds with SoE Dev's ear's.  <br />
<br />
I understand the need and benefit of these forums but can understand why some would have mistrust as well.  Sad that SoE has such a uphill climb to overcome the Trust Faction with us.</div></div><hr />

I just think that all it is is more of the same. Just like the old times when the select few got to get things changed for all of us. But mainly for the select few because well they are selected. So are not capable of being for all of us. <br />

is that becoming a copy of that lame thread on the sony boards?<br />
<br />
i mean, its not so hard to realize, that read only access would do the exact same as if everyone would be able to read there: no one would write there any more. If anyone, dev, cs or those allowed to post there would write something, constructive or not, about 100 threads would pop in different sony- and classboards with some professional whiners shouting death and murder because they got sold, nerfed, bent over, etc .etc....<br />
<br />
cmon, get off your &quot;i pay for it, i have same rights&quot;. a CONSTRUCTIVE communication can only happen if you dont have to think 10 time as long as it takes you to write a posting how to formulate it that the fewest amount of whiners feel offended.<br />
<br />
god, really, it isnt that hard to understand trivial things like that (and no, its absolutely no elite or whatever **** thing there, and by far no &quot;only the ubah elite mega guilds have a voice&quot;..... get real ffs!)<br />
<br />
and a needed P.S. ... Glori does amazingly much for us as shaman community. either have a bit trust in her or just stop playing that game, if you don't realize that and see her as a valid target for superwhining/flaming/being rude, then honesly, its definitely time for you to think about yourself and your motives and how you take that game way to serious!<br />
<br />
p.p.s.: great news glori, i am not qvic enabled yet, but i am looking forward to use it soon :)<br />
<br />
p.p.s. i dont say you would do the flaming thing if the boards would be read only, but i think we all know that there will be more than enough, and that would destroy one of the last possibilities to talk to them, to change something imo :(<br />
<br />
<br />
[edit] for that guy that gave me an anon-neg-rep bump without even providing a text, feel free to explain me why opening these 2 boards would not result in a copy/paste/flamefest, just neg-bumping without even a friendly ,,|,, is a bit too easy ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">/sigh, everything has to turn into an ubers vs. casuals debate.<br />
<br />
Hate to say it, but EQ's survival hinges on this very thing, Griz...and you shouldn't be so quick to say that.<br />
<br />
OoW went a long way in providing some solid gear upgrades easily attainable for the casual player, because it absolutely positively had to happen.  As it stands now, the gulf in power between a hardcore raider and the average casual is so extreme that it's absolutely impossible for SoE to balance the game so both of these extremes can find fun and challenging content without it requiring SoE to stick in 50 new zones.<br />
<br />
Faced with a daunting dilemma, SoE did the only thing it could do, introduce Attuneable gear (GREAT idea, IMO) that would give casuals a chance at some excellent upgrades without destroying the EQ economy or introducing a whole new round of mudflation.  But more than that, it helps close that ever-widening gap in power and allows casuals the ability to utilize zones that would have been impossible for them to function in otherwise.  It was the only thing they could do to literally save EverQuest from itself.<br />
<br />
The main concern I've always had about the guild summit and the forums is a lack of representation for the casual gamer.  The progression concept may be built around the raider now, but the casual gamers still represent a majority of the players in EQ.  Kill the fun of the game for them, introduce yet another expansion where the casual gamer will only be able to see/xp in 10% of the zones (PoP/GoD, anyone?), and SoE loses so many subscribers that it cuts into SoE's profits.  That seriously hurts the raider's game as well, and we all suffer for it.<br />
<br />
Simply put, raiders NEED for the casuals to be happy, as the casuals NEED the raiders to have challenging new content.  It keeps the game moving forward.<br />
<br />
Raiders should be very concerned about the state of the casual player, and not just immediately think &quot;oh, it's another uber vs. casual thing&quot; when this kind of thing comes up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That would not help, people would just &quot;cut and paste&quot; stuff off that board to a general board and start the arguements there.  Thus making the &quot;read only&quot; access on those boards kind of meaningless and drag down the public boards even more.  <br />
<br />
Part of the idea behind that board is they can privately discuss possible changes.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>frynque</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">some valid points Binter, but i have to say this;<br />
<br />
if Xev is in any way comparative to other servers, i foresee server &quot;reverse splitting&quot; coming within 8 monthes.  i'd posit that we'll see the old &quot;/movelog&quot; command implemented so that people could move (with gear) to other servers, so that sony could consolodate.  on Xev, you had to literally fight for a trader slot when the limit was 500, and again at 550.  now, i've only once seen a night with more than 400 traders up in over a month.  the server population has definitely dwindled sharply, dont know if other servers have been similarly affected, since the last two expansions.<br />
<br />
my guess is, judging at how 3 of the last 4 expansions were heavily tilted towards the high end, sony is merely placating the raider/high end players until EQ2 can build steam.  they aren't marketing to new players by dumping out new content that requires monthes of serious concerted game play to reach, or years of casual play, if you're starting from scratch.<br />
<br />
my predictions:<br />
<br />
after EQ2 rolls out, EQ1 will enjoy one more expansion, figure it will roll out sometime in mid spring.  sometime in mid winter, after EQ2 starts wearing away at EQ1's subscription base and more people just leave the game, they'll start server consolodation by offering /movelog to people on older servers [Povar, CT, etc.] to join the younger (new hardware) servers with gear intact.  since sales of the &quot;last expansion&quot; will probably suck because there wont be enough players to field concerted raids to maintain the steam it will require, they'll nerf it heavily, and people will either stay and play in the nerfed content, leave the game altogether, or move to EQ2, hoping for less nerf-bat-aliciousness.<br />
<br />
this talk about &quot;select few talking to the devs&quot; is generally how all software development works.  you think the fixes/features to &quot;ms office&quot; or &quot;adobe photoshop&quot; come from the unwashed masses?  afraid not.  most of the enhancements for big name software come from big name customers, like ILM, HP, IBM, Smith Barney, and the like.  this is just another example of &quot;thats how its done&quot;.  not knocking it, just saying, &quot;thats how its done&quot;.  its just that devs dont really talk to the customers.  people who represent the developers (project managers, product managers, team leaders, etc.) are most likely the voices that are heard in the webboards.<br />
<br />
any company as big as sony would be heading straight for the can if they let developers &quot;freely&quot; discuss product development.  it would be insanity.  instead, product/project people would be doing it, well aware of &quot;what they can/cant' say/promise&quot; and basically absorbing feedback to relay inward to the sony development team.  dont knock it, its just how its done, and it prevents alot of the issues that would arise (legal, competitive, patents/copyrights, etc.) if unbridled info was allowed to flow out of sony.<br />
<br />
my point in all of this?  <br />
<br />
the uber/casual debate is moot.  its a done deal, and PoP was the nail in the coffin.  there will always be an unresolvable gulf between the casual gamer and the raider/hard core gamer in EQ1, for however much longer the game manages to hold on for dear life.  coming out with expansions where the majority of the content is locked away was a mistake i feel, and now they are backpedaling to fix it, but it cannot be fixed; the uber gamers have expectations to meet and they are far and away from what the casual gamers wants/needs.  they would have been well served to continue the velious/luclin model of 80% casual/ 20% locked content, i feel. eq1 is a dying beast for it, but i still find it fun at times and will stick it out for a bit longer.  will i move to eq2, probably not.  i'll probably try wow, once it becomes impossible to do anything in eq1 due to sheer lack of population.  sony has shown themselves all too eager to repeat mistakes, and for that, i cannot follow them into eq2.<br />
<br />
YMMV<br />

True people could do that.  However there is a vast majority of people that would like to read about the progress being made and the direction of the class.<br />
<br />
Not everyone is interested in having a pissing contest about what should be fixed, but I would like to see what's being talked about, regardless of what happened to that information afterwards.<br />

You ever run through KT? All those crappy see invis, fast running mobs. Every time my guild raids in that area, we're always slowed down by people dying along the way. It's also very annoying when you're a PST person and late to join the raid and you die on the way and have to have someone leave the zone and come out and rez you.<br />

Those other things are not as important as making it easier for the People with Qvic access.<br />
<br />
Getting stuff fixed for themselves is much more important. Hey I understand. If I had a SoE devs ear I would get things that are important to me fixed first too. <br />
<br />
And some of that stuff would certainly be conveinace oriented. <br />
<br />
With omens alot of class issues for shaman are addressed. but when it is a 10% increase. That all the others get a 10% increase on. And thier numbers are bigger to start with... well all that is balanced is the status quo. <br />
<br />
So even though they are addressed. Much like Rytan would say...<br />
<br />
I am not convinced. <br />

Look at the map here:  http://eq.mapfiend.net/compare.php?comp%5B%5D=2577&amp;compare=Compare<br />
There's a small squarish building there.<br />
To the east, there's some ruins of a building that has some mobs in it I think.<br />
To the west, there's the entrance to the caves that lead to Inktu.<br />
To your north, there's Cynosure's pit.<br />
If you could go straight through zone walls n stuff, you'd be directly south of Mnat.<br />

The absolute pain of getting deeper into god to get to begin the raid means your sarcasm is 100% spot on.  Shaman fixes affect 1 person in 20 on a raid, this affects everyone on the raid.</div></div><hr />
