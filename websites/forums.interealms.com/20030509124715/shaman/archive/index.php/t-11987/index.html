<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>rosco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi everyone,<br />
<br />
My friend and I are intending to create two new characters and play together.<br />
<br />
We are kinda...mmm... lazy in our playing style : we don't like to run too much. But we don't like to play melees either. So we decided to make a shaman (an Iksar, of course) and a necro (an Iksar as well).<br />
<br />
So I have some little questions :<br />
<br />
1) necros usually play with fear/darkness or lots of dots/darkness so the mobs is chasing them and pet hit them in the back. But we are lazy, and we'd rather have pet tanking, shaman slowing, and us doting.<br />
Do you think the necro's pet could hold enough aggro for us to play like that ?<br />
<br />
2) shamans are very group friendly, so they have group spells (sow, regen etc...). Do our group spells also work on pets ? Or will I have to cast a different buff on the pet each time ?<br />
<br />
3) Any advice to give us ? We'll be mainly playing casually, both indoor and outdoor, and are not really after XP at all cost.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot,<br />
Have a nice day<br />
<br />
Rosco.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Depends on your level really, necro pets hold agro fairly well, but till 49 tend to have really poor hps and defensive skills.  Not sure if a necro pet could hold agro off you though, again, it really depends on what dots you are using.<br />
<br />
Group spells don't work on pets unfortunately. =/<br />
<br />
If you have the hp/ac to do so, unless your both 60+, you'd probably make a better tank than the necro pet.  Of course just fear kitting would make things a ton more efficient in pretty much all respects, its very much worth the extra effort =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Necro pet could not hold aggro off of the shaman but then thats why you have root. <br />
<br />
It will work but like the above post it wont work the best until 49+ however 39 and 44 necro pets have some decent hp and will work well enough with slow. Until then your probably better fear kiting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There's always root-rotting, too.  Don't have to worry about healing the pets.  You can stack, what, 5 or 6 decent dots between the two of you?  I've always had a gas partnering with necros.  There's this obvious rush of pleasure from them when regen hits their buff bar.</div></div><hr />
