<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LARRY</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The EQ mindset of hps &gt; all is still very much in play.... u can buff agil/str/int/ etc with potions .... I personally go all stam int stuff.... eagle gear.<br />
<br />
Grab a quick MOW off my druid and drop 3 potions and i have over 130 str/agil and dont have to give up all my hps... at 46 Im right at 3900hps and 3847 ac with greater defense potion.... <br />
<br />
I find that int stam is best for a shaman cause the pallys try and make u burn your mana out but its very easy to outlast them and take the hits from them if you go int/stam gear.<br />
<br />
just my 2 cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A well played shaman can spell alot of trouble for the paladin, one of the few classs that can do anything. A well played shaman will make full use of lightning shield, purge, frost shock, and can melee surprisingly well.<br />
<br />
Shaman is also one of the few classes I think really needs to keep a big mana pool, possibly at the expense of pure stamina. Worst case, a smart shaman is almost impossible for most classes to kill, they can snare, wolf, and run.<br />
<br />
Remember too, any buff you can have, others can get too(except self buffs of course).<br />
<br />
What spec are you?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>LARRY</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Oh Im speced full enhancement atm.... I have no problems with mana or health.... The post was meant as a reply to the topic below about crits etc against pallys etc... Im tired and did a post instead of reply.<br />
<br />
Simply put if u go full int/stam gear u can beat any pally if u know anything about pvp because your mana can outlast theirs easy cause they go stam/str or stam/agil.... use potions to buf up you agil and str for harder hits and crits is the way I am going.<br />
<br />
Ive seen some really great fights where it was touch and go to the end....when the shaman wins its usually because he has enough mana for a few more spells and the pally is oom... everytime Ive seen a shaman run out of mana first that shaman has lost or had to run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">3900 hp at 46 unbuffed? No offense but thats all but impossible unless you every single piece is +sta gear and you have no other stats, even then I doubt it. 2900 maybe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">3900 hp at 46 unbuffed? No offense but thats all but impossible unless you every single piece is +sta gear and you have no other stats, even then I doubt it. 2900 maybe.<br />
<br />
He doesn't actually say 'unbuffed' there. Admittedly, where he states his hps/ac it doesn't specifically say 'fully buffed', but it certainly implies it given the context.<br />
<br />
That figure of 3.9k fully buffed hps looks pretty right when you factor in the +hp/ac from MoW, +sta from potions etc. Assuming his gear is roughly level equivalent, he'll be 200ish sta unbuffed, (ignoring possible enchants) so a MoW + potions (does sta potion stack with MoW?) wouldn't make those hps unreasonable when you consider the +5% hp bonus for taurens.  Throw on a shield with mail armour and potions, and 3.8k AC is reasonable as well.<br />
<br />
Additionally, I've never understood the rationale of paladins to go sta/agi etc.  My pally build was always sta-&gt;int-&gt;agi-&gt;spi-&gt;str, which meant a lot of Eagle gear with some monkey and other randoms thrown in.  Paladins who don't try and maintain a healthy mana pool (imo) are simply gimping their survivability.  So many paladins seem to build like they're warriors, it just amazes me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>LARRY</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Correct Kryscha... since I 2box a druid im never without MoW and druid has it spec to increase the stats and ac... always use potions.. 100 hp enchant on a 15 stam chest... eagle gear.. 7 stam enchants on all slots that can take it... elixir of fortitude. stam 3 scrolls... on and on... so I lied my hps are actually 3879...<br />
<br />
/sorry if I mislead you guys</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Regardless, I think it's a point well made about the huge difference potions can make.  I sacrifice a lot of bag space so that we can have a full set of my best potions for boss fights.  A far cry from EQ where potions were either utterly pointless or prohibitively expensive for daily use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I make my own limited invulnerability potions so I can be a paladin too!  I shudder at the thought that pally's can actually use them also though.  Haven't seen it yet but damn that would suck.</div></div><hr />
