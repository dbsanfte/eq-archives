<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shakasa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I know this is insane but with all the changes, new levels higher level zones etc...I feel its appropriate to bring up once again.<br />
<br />
I got my JBB at lvl 50, yes I was a lucky one....and it cost 25k.  The question is now this, their are much better stat item and ac item bracers available in game should I keep it or sell it off to another lower level shaman?<br />
<br />
I still use it .... occasionally, but generally I am too busy with my pet, and casting spells that actually do damage than using my jbb.  The 7 second recast time is a killer when stuff is going on, especially if your on a horse as to interupt it is a pain in the arse.  I have my spirit poker so I have  a mana free clicky DoT.....<br />
<br />
I am lvl 60 with 5aa and I only have the focus and group focus spells for lvl 60.  Thought was to sell JBB and try to purchase other lvl 60 spells?<br />
<br />
ideas?  PS Slap me if I am on crack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fethanin_ECI</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If I were you I would sell it and use the money for a more useful item.<br />
<br />
 I have never had a JBB, sure I've wanted one, but I never got one, I got a horse instead, much more useful :) I dont have epic either, but I can still solo well with just a horse.<br />
<br />
For me it goes Horse&gt;Epic&gt;JBB. As you said the recast time is way too long for it to be useful :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At 60 I still used the JBB a lot but when I got 61+ I used it less and less and at 65 I never used it. So I sold it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The DPS from a JBB isn't impressive at all in PoP.  I sold mine when I got my winterstorm.  I pull out the winterstorm every now and then when I am too lazy to use real dots and nukes and canni back mana, but it is definately not a necessity.  I would say sell it and try to buy spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Its a tough call. I still have mine, and the same thoughts go through my mind. I only every really use it when soloing or farming greenies, so its probably not worth 20-25k to me anymore, but I do find it very useful for those times. <br />
<br />
I love soloing in Sebilis for some cash loot, and use it a lot there rather than canni and nuke just coz its easier. With jbb + hasted pet you can do 60dps for absolutely no mana. Add in epic dot and BoN and your touching on 100dps for amazing mana efficiency.<br />
<br />
100dps isn't going to get you very far in PoP, but its great for sebilis ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Korsib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">well, since you guys were kinda talking about horses, I have a question.  I just started my shaman bout 2 weeks ago, am lvl 24 right now.  so, I was wondering what I horse can do that sow can't?  or is there something else about horses that I don't know?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Truthfully if you have torpor you may as well drop it since you can get a fair amount of pp from. With torpor/cann and soon cann 5 for you hopefully there really is no need to carry the jbb. Your higher level nukes/dots/rains are obviously much more mana efficent and with torpor/cann when is mana ever a problem? <br />
<br />
As far as the usefulness of a horse korsib. A horse lets you meditate without sitting basically anytime your not moving on the horse your gaining mana, even while casting. This is rediculously useful as you gain levels particularly say 50+ and your in pop where after slow you really can't sit down for most of the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Of course you should keep your JBB at 60.<br />
<br />
You'd be nuts to sell it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">/agree Gart<br />
<br />
of course you can sell it and see the mistake afterwards... :) I say keep JBB and use it to farm more AAs.  BigCan is your friend. At 60 there are great solo places you can go to farm AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">True but with torpor 99% of your time why would you even be using the jbb? If he has torpor I really don't see the need for him to keep it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tritan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I still use mine at 65....I just...cant...let...go</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">After L59 or so the JBB is a pretty situational tool and really should not be hogging a slot on your profile.  I still keep mine to aid in killing greenies for tradeskills, quests, and faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I still make liberal use of mine at 61. With a druid to cover heals, I'll drop on a DoT or 3, and fill the gaps with the JBB.  To me, it's effective use of the time between tossing out other spells.<br />
<br />
...now if I could only duck from horseback...<br />
<br />
Wastrel da Leezurd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">How it effective though when you can cast more damaging spells? If i'm on my horse for instant I found that I can basically chain cast my nukes, canni up after battle and then torpor. ON top of of this I don't even have cann 5. So I just don't see why anybody would still be using a jbb when you can basically chain cast nukes, provided you have torpor.<br />
<br />
Now if he doesn't have torpor I could understand but if you do why would you be using a jbb still?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you chain cast your nukes and canni up between battles, you need to get better, faster-pulling groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Now if he doesn't have torpor I could understand but if you do why would you be using a jbb still?<br />
<br />
Seen this mentioned a couple times...<br />
<br />
From his text...<br />
<br />
I am lvl 60 with 5aa and I only have the focus and group focus spells for lvl 60.<br />
<br />
Reading comprehension class dismissed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I honestly don't remember the last time I used mine, but I just can't bring myself to sell the dumb thing...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Just bag it, you'll want it when you go farm greens for something somewhere</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Kinda like my fungi, I don't think I'll ever sell the JBB. I will loan it out now though, it just isn't all that useful once you get canni5 and torpor. <br />
<br />
If they gave us an extra spell slot, I'd probably dump it in a heartbeat. My main use for it is if I have BoN loaded in the one slot I can usually spare for damage spells. JBB gives me a way to add some DPS when a DoT is still running or if the mob is so low that another DoT isn't worth it. I could easily live w/o it now though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Yah I understand the fungi however oddly enough I recently sold mine. I tried playing every melee class and I can't stand them just no versitility I found theo nly classes I can really stand to play are a shaman, necro, and somewhat enchanter. So after i got torpor and replenishment fungi just went out the window.</div></div><hr />
