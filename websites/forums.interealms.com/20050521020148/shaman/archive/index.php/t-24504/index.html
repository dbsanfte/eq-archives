<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Kinda a 2 part question.<br />
<br />
1) What augments interest you or have you made/gotten for yourself? More interested in which focus effects you added since which base augment if more just what you've gotten lucky on or managed to buy. Personally I've got 1 so far and added imp dmg 5 to it. Didn't have any imp dmg focus for nukes previously and just don't seem to end up with it on my gear. My logic was if it's a major focus I made sure I got it someplace and it's better than the generic versions you can add to an augment. It's the useful but not major focus's that I just don't seem to end up with that seemed most useful.<br />
<br />
2) What augments do other people seem to want? For melees the melee focus's seem alot more interesting. Dodge, ferocity and cleave all seem to be popular. Not to mention haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've seen one augment rock drop, and two Slugworms. This id he extent of the knowledge I have - The Slugworm went for 3k the minute I opened /trader.<br />
<br />
1/5 of the way to affording Malos, yippee-freakin'-ki-yay</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kanamori Hitatomi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Slugworms average for around 50k on my server (when you can find them).  I've made 3 augs up to the smithing step (since I have seen 1 'yes thats the numero uno' discordant scoriae for sale and have had no drops.  that one for sale went for 150k in less than 10 minutes).  So far, I have made a Radiant Cut 12 CHA augment with Extended Enhancement III (for a chanter friend that does my cutting for me), a Radiant Cut 3 Regen with Burning Affliction III (for me of course) and a Radiant Cut 12 AGI augment with ferocity (for a friend).  I currently have 4 other gems on me and 5 or 6 more for a friend at the Radiant Cut stage.<br />
<br />
SoE really thought it was funny to make the acid drop component for the common augs to be the rare drop (slugworms) and the acid drop component for the uncommon gem augs to be the common drop (trean flies).  WTG Sony!!!<br />
<br />
The drop rate of discordant scoriae is beyond stupid, I have seen, heard of, etc... only 1 drop on my server total.  *** is up with this?  I've spent so much time camping this stuff that I'm about to break down and buy the next one I see no mater the cost.  Is anyone else having these 'issues'?<br />
<br />
I would suggest this to the developers at the fan faire.  I can understand them wanting the 'good' drop of discordant scoriae to be rare so everyone doesn't have the focus effects, but come on.  I have 3 stacks of the other stuff (dust of discord, for the white gold inlay) sitting around.  No one buys it.  Everyone's awaiting the big influx of materials for people to start selling combines.  Well, it's not happening.  So, prices of the gemstone augments continues to hover around 150k, the flowstone augments at around 50-60k, slugworms (when available) around 50k, and trean flies at around 20k.  Ok, this is taking money outta the economy how?  I know that was part of the plan by making the inlay materials cost a lot to merchants, but the server economy here is not doing crap with SoE's toys.  BTW, for a point of reference, lvl 66-67 muramite runes run at around 90k on my server (I did see one for 20k the other day, it went down about as fast as it was put up).<br />
<br />
I really wish SoE would look at tradeskillers a lot now.  If we want to make any sort of tradeskill items from OoW, we have to A) spend 200000000000 hours camping 1 part and repeat or B) spend 200000000k on components.  Please up the drop rates somewhat, it doesn't have to be common, but this is more like camping a damn luclin shard, not tradeskilling.  BTW, with failure rates as high as they are, the drop rate becomes more stupid.  Look at the numbers.  I know you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>otakuryoga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">no...this is nothing like camping a luclin shard....luclin shards are 100x more common than slugworms which seem to be about 100X more common than the discordant scoriae<br />
<br />
i have seen a grand total of 2 slugworms since OoW went live.... both in bazaar, both for 80k</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Only seen one, went for 100K in bazaar. No luck on scor or slugs. Got pretty much a whole set of augs and have just taken to selling them now since I will never see the parts to upgrade. Working myself to 70 and the appropriate aas (need to level to finish salvage) to take a run at some good augs (was thinking ds6, cleave3 for my warrior) if anyone ever finds these.<br />

I had real high hopes for the new augs . But as stated in numerous posts all over the eq world , the drop rates on DS and slugworms is dire to say the least , that combined (excuse the pun) with the poor return rate on said items , the whole thing isnt worth bothering about until they increase the drop rate slightly. Oh , and just to add , i have alchemy 3 , blacksmithing 3 , and salvage 2 (am lvl 68) . And i still fail regularly on black gold inlays ......(max smith/max alchemy)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It is simple.<br />
<br />
If they want a money sink.<br />
<br />
Start adding in some of the tradeskill droppable components At a high price. <br />
<br />
Like Discordant scorae. From a Dragorn vendor.  20K a pop. Instant Moneysink to get rid of a ton of plat. Same thing for pelts and silks and everything else. Make it cost alot to purchase from a game vendor. 100 plat per High quality hide or something. People can still farm for the items to sell at a discount. But it would be an instant and extremly valuable moneysink.<br />
<br />
If the demand is great for items have an NPc vendor start selling them for a common (read) high price. Once some of the money is soaked out of the economy. Start looking seriously at the plat farmer bots and start nipping them one by one. <br />
<br />
There should be multiple ways of aquiring everything but the greatest of rewards. Including purchaseing with plat items of great demand. Especially with Attunable flags. And at the end of the day there should be a way to allow that never used no drop things to have a base value attached by way of tribute. <br />
<br />
We should have runes as a quest reward. Or even as a supplimentry reward runes purchaseable from a vendor who doesnt sell to you till the quest is completed. for say 40K for a minor Muramite rune. 50K Muramite runes for 65K  Greaters for 75K and Glowings for 100.<br />
<br />
You can still go hunt for them And get them for free. But if you have more money than sense. Then Boom. Instant gratification. (After doing the quest. Unless they got smart and set it up so there was a quest for each level of spell being purchased. And the quest giver was tied to a faction so people would need to hunt in the new zones to get the faction up beforehand.)<br />
<br />
They need to put more adventure into the game. And Multiple paths of reward. Sadly the Instanced zones feel to me of unfinished afterthoughts that were thrown in to pad the zone count of the expansion with no rhyme or reason behind them.</div></div><hr />

I have yet to fail on an inlay (black gold or white gold) and I've made 9 so far.  I've failed a minor augment combine, but salvaged the augment to succeed the next combine (but I did lose the Treanic Acid).<br />
<br />
Haste augments have been my number one sellers.  I have had requests for ID5, Cleave 3 and and Dodge 3 augments also.<br />
<br />
Edit: I heard a rumor that all classes will be getting the option to train Jewelcraft Mastery AAs, since it's silly to lock everyone else out of a general tradeskill because enchanters got it first.</div></div><hr />

<br />

JCM is one of the unqiue things about chanters. Unless they give alchemy, tinker, and poision to everyone I am ok with it staying with chanters. Course I have a Grimeled chanter and a Grimeled shaman :)<br />
<br />
Anyone have insight on DS and Slug drop spots? I have seen where they drop. Is it just a funciton of killing a bizzillion of them or is there a trick? I am on a low pop server so wont be buying from you anyways (have seen one slug and no DS since OoW went live).<br />

<br />
So far it just seems to be blind luck from what I've seen. <br />
<br />
The difference between tinker, alchemy, and poision is that they are specific skills, but anyone can do JC so everyone should have the mastery (my wife already has a JCM3 chanter, so it doesn't help me to have but I think everyone should anyways). <br />
<br />
They can replace the chanters specific ability with something else, but they shouldn't have a lock on an aa for a skill all characters can use.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I heard this rumor from an enchanter and she didn't care if everyone got it, just as long as the AA were refunded (which might be why the new code was put in so you can keep over 30 AA points banked).  Everyone has the ability to jewelcraft, why shouldn't everyone get the Mastery AA to go along with it just because someone stupid thought Enchanters deserved JM3 back in Luclin?  Alchemy, Tinkering and Poison Making are class/race related and don't fall under the same category as a general tradeskill, and I believe those skills are tied to level unlike normal tradeskills.<br />
<br />
It would be stupid for them to not give everyone JM3.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Exactly, give them Improved Jewelcrafting Mastery which reduces failures more.  Don't let them block everyone else from getting a general mastery AA.</div></div><hr />
