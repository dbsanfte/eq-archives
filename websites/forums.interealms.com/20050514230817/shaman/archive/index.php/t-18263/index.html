Good one from me:<br />
<br />
On a raid, getting the usual amount of buff requests every couple minutes as people die and whatnot, puller dies. Raid Leader: BUFF PULLER_01 ASAP! So I throw sta/focus on them as soon as they pop. 2 mins go by as they finish looting and get ready. Then they send a tell, &quot;Can you buff me with Focus and Stamina again? I had to click them off because they were not in the order I like.&quot; Meanwhile I had already dememmed them to buff someone else with something.<br />
<br />

<br />
His little character spins in circles for a bit and then he says &quot;those were shammy buffs?&quot; &lt;more spinning&gt; &quot;i have new icons, i clicked them off cuz I didn't know what they were.&quot;<br />

Ouch.  Thats harsh.  And unfortunately, theres no way to gracefully say, &quot;You freakin' idiot, no.  You're too stupid to have buffs.&quot; :)<br />
<br />
I'm not a part of the raid scene myself, yet, but I did have an Xp group experience.  I was in a tank heavy group, as the only healer, and I told them, i would only be buffing with some of my spells, but it would still take a lot of mana (Even just dex (for the ones with proccing weps), sta, etc.. you know the deal.  Everyone also gets Quickness (I'm that low, okay? Hehe)..  But then they pulled 5 mobs anyway right after buffing and i'm sitting at 20% or so..<br />
<br />
We won, with no casualties, but STILL.   Clerics get respect - EVERYONE waits on the cleric.  Canabalize, especially at my level, does not give back a ton of mana fast. :)  I ate myself down to 30% for that fight, and I HAD temperance from earlier!<br />
<br />
Well, least we won, and I got kudos for doing a good job, at least.  :)<br />

<br />
LOL, way I look at it, one less person to worry about in a FA loop. I don't even bother casting it on Rangers anymore.<br />
<br />
As for wanting SoE over Billy, every melee I know wants that. Granted SoE has a longer duration and the atk bonus from billy is so small that it's not really that useful I'm still reluctant to say we need an upgrade to Billy (meaning longer duration and higher attack bonus) only because so many people would still take SoE because they get to float. <br />
<br />
:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">One of my first raids which I don't remember where it was. Someone kept asking for the same buffs over and over. I kept telling them I just cast it and they would say that they didn't get it. I cast them a few times and then just gave up the the guy. The he starts yelling in Raid chat the he still doesn't have his shamy buffs. Shortly after that we had to invis and he cried that he wasn't invisible. After it being too insane earlier to watch my chat window to see if he had been buffed I certainly saw him go invisible. Then the guy says to me &quot;oh wait, I am invis. I just had my spell buff window shrunk down too small&quot;.<br />
<br />
I think we were around lvl 45 or 50 at that time. Some people...</div></div><hr />

<br />
/reply I buffed, you clicked off... too bad</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I will buff anyone with anything as long as they ask at an appropriate time.  When mobs are inc = not an appropriate time.<br />
<br />
My other pet peeve is when people must absolutely have every buff during a hectic situation.  We were doing rathe tonight and of course people were dying.  I was the only healer and RGCer in my group, so obviously I was pretty busy.  Someone died and wanted focus.  That is fine.  Then they wanted stamina, bih'li, acumen, and then another focus for their warder.  That is unacceptable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>krindaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I am beginning to detest buffing now and that's not a good thing. I love being a shammy, I just hate stupid people.  <br />
<br />
1 - Keep your sorry ass in range when I say &quot;group buffage incoming.&quot;<br />
<br />
2 - If you're going to beg for hos or focus in pok, let me know that you want sta too BEFORE I sit down and mem the spells, not after I cast focus/hos and go about my business. Be considerate.<br />
<br />
3 - Don't send me tells in pok begging for buffs. It's rude. My mother told me not to talk to strangers.<br />
<br />
4 - If you are going to beg over ooc, offer to donate. Most of us wouldn't accept a donation, but the offer is greatly appreciated. It shows that you consider our waiting on you &amp; buffing you worthy of OUR time. We are NOT playing this game for you, but for ourselves. Remember that.<br />
<br />
5 - Be polite and use English. Do - &quot;Could you buff me, please?&quot; Do NOT - &quot;bufz plz babe&quot; - I don't think it's funny. Humor is great when you know the person. From strangers, a comment like that is rude. Period. Politeness gets you everwhere with me. Rudeness gets you a hell no.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I do have a great sense of humor and I don't mind buffing people. Really. It's just that there are so many out there that take Chanters, Cleric, Druids &amp; Shaman for granted. They make my online time less enjoyable. <br />
<br />
6 - In regards to SoW...go to the bazaar and buy a 10dose. Keep one in your bank for CRs. Also, for those times you don't have a 10dose in your bank...see number 4 above.<br />
<br />
7 - Click my buffs off and then ask me to cast them again and you get nothing. I swear it :P <br />
<br />
8 - Focus/stam on the rezzed people during raid = no problem. Just send a quick tell if I haven't done it already and if I'm busy, I'll get to it as soon as I can.<br />
<br />
9 - THE BIGGY. I only use group buffs now that I'm 65. Talisman of Alacrity/Fo7/Stam/Diaku(although rarely on diaku)/Bih'li...Do they think we shammy are blind that we don't konw the haste is going or that the focus is going?? It's a GROUP BUFF. No shaman worth their salt is going to click it off, because of the very fact that the icon flashing tells us its going. We don't need you to tell us like we're 5 years old. Sure, sometimes we miss it in the midst of batttle when things are tense and multiple pulls are taking up our time, so then it's cool to remind us. But give us the damn benefit of the doubt! Haste plz this doooood! /rude :P<br />
<br />
(I'm on a roll with this rant this morning..woohooo)<br />
<br />
10 - My Bih'li complaint. Druids and Rangers overwriting my Bih'li without announcing or asking people in group if they want FoE/SoE. Stop it. Right now. It's annoying :) Almost every group that I've been in where the druid has done this, I've had to recast Bih'li for the melee who have clicked off FoE. Stop it. Use SoE and ASK first..and single target.  Do it again and I'm giving your PooH Bear poisoned berries. <br />
<br />
Thats it. I sound bitter but I'm not. This is a rant thread so I let go with all the little things that seem to bug me (I could probably think of more tho). I love being a shaman, if I didn't, I would have deleted long long ago. I just wish people had more consideration. I try and do the same for all other people and classes. (ie...&quot;Bot9 please, when you have time. Thanks.&quot;)<br />
<br />
PS - Jinheim, I totally agree. Ask me when we're setting up, not on incoming. And don't ask me to buff your pet. If You're a pet class..you can buff your own. (although I do make exceptions to mages since I always politely ask for pet weapons from them. I rarely get a request to buff their pet tho.)<br />
<br />
Also, from a previous post about cleric mana being more respected. I completely agree. I don't think they understand that when (for example) I join a BoT group &amp; cast fo7, stam, agi, bih'li, haste, regen, pet...that I have just used 4900 mana (my pool is about 4k right now with kei) &amp; with canni 5 &amp; a quiess my mana pool is still low right then. I've been in groups where I've buffed and they will pull without asking and I've been so very pissed about it. Why? No consideration. Only clerics casting single shot virtue on everyone do more than that (1k per shot w/ HoV being only 2500. And lets not forget that they have to virtue the melee &amp; symbol the casters when there's a druid in the group). (Also I always remember to IoS the poor clerics :) They love me when I do that.)<br />
<br />
I think I'll start leaving off haste until I'm ready for incoming from now on. :) How's THAT for an idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Wont accept donate? What, my time is less worth then some chanter or cleric time? Nah. And if someone donates 5-10pp and wants a &quot;full set&quot;, then I naturally cancel the trade. And move on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>krindaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">&quot;Most of us wouldn't accept a donation, but the offer is greatly appreciated.&quot; That's not an absolute. It just means that you're one of the ones that do. Cool. :) Since I only buff those that were polite when they ask, I rarely accept their pp. It just depends on my mood. Now, if I'm hawking my spells...that's another story. Donations please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've started playing again after quiting for about a year.  During the time that I was not playing I let a friend 2 box with my shaman.  Man that was a mistake.<br />
<br />
My friend got used to having his own personal shaman. (LOL) Now I catching him expecting me to still be that &quot;buff bithc&quot; shammy that my character was when he was 2 boxing him.<br />
<br />
The finest example of this happened last tiem I was on a LDON.  Our part did not have a cleric, I was the healer.  We had a Warrior tanking, and his rogue for DPS.  I noticed alac left my dog during a long fight where we had a mob healer that added.  During the fight the rogue keeps on reminding me that his speed is flashing and then finaly gone, while i'm healing the tank.  I manage to get a alac on the warrior to help him keep agro, but at that point fell behind in healing, and did not get the warrior back up until after the fight.  Then while i'm canni dancing after the end of the fight to get manna to buff, I get a request for alac, and a short lecture about how alac is vital for dps classes like my friend's rogue.<br />
<br />
My friend is the nicest guy in real life, but man he's getting on my nerves with this addiction to speed.  <br />
<br />
As a hint to all shaman's every where never let a rogue 2box with your shammy for an extended amount of time.  They will quickly get used to having their own &quot;buff bithc&quot;, and start to go through withdraws for speed the second they see theirs flashing, even if you're devoting your full attention to keeping the tank alive. (LOL).<br />
<br />
edit-And I totaly agree that shaman should not be expected to buff for free.  I'll buff and regen random people if they look like they need it, but it drives me nuts in pok when people i've never met expect me to sow or hos them just because I'm a nice guy.  If they have a hard luck story and need it for a cr, they can talk me into it, but i've quit responding to the constand &quot;anoying_sk says sow and hos plz&quot; while i'm banking, selling, or sitting in some corner trying to cordinate with my guild what we're doing next.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I remember this one time when I was raiding sleeper's, I was actually NOT being lazy for once(only shaman on raid), I didn't have Fo7 yet and wanted to give everyone max hp. So I MGB'd stamina, and I said in our raid channel to send me a tell and/or come stand in front of me for focus. After I buffed everyone that sent me a tell, I again said for them to send me a tell. No one sent me a tell, so I unmemmed my buffs and put up my debuffs. then a_warrior_01 sends me a tell, &quot;fos sta plz&quot;... /sigh<br />
<br />
I then made fun of him in raid chat for not paying attention, and he starts cussin me out in tells and asks for a TL. He hasn't spoken with me since.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Sometimes when I get a rez lets say for rztw portion, I get an immidiate symbol/voq or something like that.. well the first slot is for my clicky that means symbol on 2nd slot.. I click it off put cha or sta there (I'm max sta) and ask for another symbol.. so when the monk pulls 3+ mobs that each dispell 1 slot I don't get my symbol wiped.. it's better to ask now then once mobs are engaged etc.. that's my opinion.<br />
<br />
For the most part I agree with Jinheim, if they ask at the appropriate time I'll recast my buff as many times at it takes..<br />
<br />
My pet pieve is when I avatar and the stupid monk rogue etc is in wolf form, I avatar someone else but it just pisses me off :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">My biggest peeve when it comes to buffing goes sort of like this, &quot;AE Focus inc in 1 minute&quot;. After a minute or so, &quot;AE Focus Inc! Be near if you want it.&quot; I cast focus and not even 30 seconds later I get tells asking for focus. It's so annoying. I didn't spend those AA points so I could single target buff a dozen people AFTER blowing mgb.  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Snowfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">My pet peeves...<br />
<br />
<br />
1.  Do not beg me for buffs.  I am not your buff bot.  I am my SK's buff bot. My wife's buff bot.  Best friend's buff bot but I am not &quot;your&quot; buff bot.  Tip..buy 2nd account level your own damn shaman.<br />
<br />
2.  Raiding.  Send a frigging tell for buffs so I can /rtar you.  Whining in /GU or /RS gets you nada.<br />
<br />
3.  Regarding to whining about buffs.  That just encourages me to call you F**KTARD, move you to level 1 buff list and my general disdain.  I am on the raid working just as hard as everyone else. Buffs will come...<br />
<br />
4.  You click off a buff...well SOL to you then for buffs.  You get new ones next round...<br />
<br />
5.  Want to play the role of a beggar?  Go be one in real life then come back to game.  See how it sucks?  DON'T BE A BEGGAR!   <br />
<br />
6.  You want my respect in game?  Then a) treat me the same b) understand I am the person that makes you shine like a star in game play so don't be a dick to me  c)  learn the role of every class and their abilities so that way your ignorance will be minimal...tip..ignorance is not bliss in this game...it is your death..<br />
<br />
Beyond that I am happy. 8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Buffs aren't bad, you just have to let people know how it works. For me that's telling them they have x amount of time to send a tell for single target buffs after the group buffing is done or get my /r GFY hotkey.<br />
<br />
That usually gets a few lol's...but I don't get any buff requests after the time limit I gave them. <br />
<br />
As for rebuffing..if I just buffed a rezed person(as long as they don't need junks for dispell) and they clicked them off because they didn't like the order, I wouldn't buff them at all the rest of the raid. If they made a fuss I'd explain in /gu or /rs precisely why said dumbass is not getting buffs from me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I just tell rude PoK lowbies that I dropped the low-level buffs like HoS to clean up my spellbook before the new spell menus came along, sorry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">i hate it when the puller says &quot;xx mob inc&quot; (usually a raid setting) and i get tells for buffs, sure let me sit down, get slaguthered by random raid mob to try and give you stamina.<br />
<br />
I don't have pe, i get at least a dozen tells from people on raids asking for it, that can't remember<br />
<br />
when useing charmed mobs,  the chanter that asks .5 seconds after their mob is in camp for malos makes me want to reach through my screen and strangle them,  malos/sinia isn't insta cast, and there are usualy other mobs that need slowed more.  and i'm sure we've all had the mid cast charmings so your spell doesn't land.<br />
<br />
Clerics in raids piss me off when they have their complete heal chain hotkey with a group chat portion.  i ask them once, maybe twice if i think i didn't have their attention then they get put on the ignore list.<br />
<br />
i hate getting random tells for avatar, i have a hotkey set up for when it refreshs in /say for you to hail me, or what ever i make them do for it that evening,<br />
<br />
i have one ranger who constatnally asks for billy that i refuse to cast, unfortunaly i can't really put them on ignore as they are a officer<br />
<br />
after a particularlly messy engagne or like 1/2 wipe including my death (i die alot) getting lots and lots of tells for focus, depending on time we just might remgb it obviously we shaman know alot of people died and are getting to it, (about 4-6 on a raid usually)<br />
<br />
when you need tribunal and as soon as its announced 5 tells for it show up in my chat bar, obviously we know as it awas  just announced, and w/ our usually number of shaman it will be mgbed<br />
<br />
we have a shaman in our guild who loves to do rebuffs on people which is great, he says it in guildchat and i still get tells for buffs.  <br />
<br />
yeah so thats a start i'm sure after raiding tonight i'll have much much more</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Koro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">My favorite, is just joining a group then every one starts asking for buffs. You just give a full round of Group buffs and the puller is off and yelling is this thing slowed? &quot;I'm on that! shaman buffs cost so little mana and we got 20 spell slots&quot; Then they end up pulling a whole mess of mobs everyone getting whacked on and at the end everyone is saying oom and they start asking for rebuffs. Then when they don't immediately get it they keep asking. Specially when everyone is beat down to none existant health and they start telling me I can canni. &quot;With what? I have no health and no mana.&quot; I have apoligized to a few people in group then gate out of groups such as these. I'm here to play a game and have a bit of fun, not get pestered and told how to do my job. I know my job, wouldn't have made it to 65 in 3 monthes rl time with no pling if I didn't.</div></div><hr />

One of the reasons I loved a Monk is he could kick but (emphasis on COULD) without a slew of buffs. Throwing buffs on him was like hitting the Nitro in one of those little Fast and the Furious race cars.<br />
<br />
If I am on Dread in a group and someone is abusing the Shaman /Cleric / Enchanter? I will LIGHT THEIR ASS UP. <br />
<br />
/g (Dreadstone) &quot;Pulls are not the time to be asking for buffs.&quot;<br />
/g (Dreadstone) &quot;Shaman is only healer, he will buff when he can.&quot;<br />
<br />
There are others. Now personally, I ask for three buffs - hit points, regen and haste. Other than that I want you to slow, spot heal and have fun with dog dog. Or throw the DOTS and Nukes. <br />
<br />
As people have GENTLY tried to allude to - Shamans are not Buff_Bots. This ain't DAOC. Additionally, there IS a person behind the keyboard. <br />
<br />
When I am leading a raid? I give plenty of time for all to buff and re-med.<br />
Then we cross the LD. (Line of Departure).<br />
<br />
I will control the pull flow. I WILL give you time to replace buffs, but we need to move with a sense of purpose and there IS a goal here and it is NOT for you to be max buffed for some sense of &quot;personal safety.&quot;<br />
<br />
S.T.F.U. and do what you are told. You don't like it? Leave. We can still suceed without you and chances are if you are whining and or so focused on YOUR buffs then you aren't focused on the raids success. <br />
<br />
I have found that often the raid goes smoother and faster without the whining &quot;Buff me&quot; dumbass.</div></div><hr />

Finally I just go off on the guy about him already having it. Turns on he was clicking off FoSoul because it wasn't Fo7. Sad thing is things like this happen way way too often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>krindaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Ha...I know I posted on this thread already, but ooooo this is what happened to me last night.<br />
<br />
Guild was somewhat raiding KD (just doing faction, people came, not an official raid) and I make my way to arena. Well, after rooting and dotting the first two see-invis guards, I move further in and end up oom with three more giants rooted and asking the arena crew to come save me.<br />
<br />
They did easily enough, but when I got to arena I was still oom &amp; somewhat low on health and canni5 hadn't come back up yet (I was still slowing and maloing a couple, so used up what mana I did regain). Well, as soon as we stepped into the arena to the pull spot I was getting tells right and left for buffs, even after I had stated in /rs that I was oom.<br />
<br />
I'll admit I was probably pretty rude in /rs after that. I was pissed off. And I really don't like being pissed off. I like having fun.<br />

1 - I was the only shaman...do you think I'm so stupid that I don't realize you all need fo7 &amp; stam? (they had a chanter for slow and haste thankfully)<br />
<br />
2 - Give me time to regen that mana. If I was a cleric you would have given me time. Pulling as soon as we got to camp (camp mobs were clear still) and expecting me to malos &amp; slow &amp; BUFF while I'm oom and trying to canni4 &amp; canni5 at the same time, does NOT win my appreciation.<br />
<br />
I have no problem buffing them...just PRETEND I know what I'm doing by lvl 65 ok??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Buffing totally depends on my mood, but I do tend to keep an 'Iron grip' on my buffing/FA cycles. <br />
<br />
The memmed spell sets are really useful for buffing, I have a set that switches my DPS set to single rebuffs, and another set for group rebuffs so its just a one click wonder to switch spell sets.<br />
<br />
I tend to be fast to rebuff the dead, mainly because I hate the raid slowing down and then getting rebuff requests at a bad time...<br />
<br />
Just remember you have the buffs, don't take crap from anyone ;)</div></div><hr />

In PoK one day, I was buffing for cash in my mid 50s.  A dark elf warrior runs up to me and says &quot;Can I have some buffs maam&quot;?  I say &quot;Sure, what do you need&quot;?  He says &quot;Sex please&quot;..... long pause.  &quot;OMG, im so embarrassed!&quot; he says.  <br />
<br />
I still laugh with him about that one.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>kenton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I'm with Faern on letting group memebers know when they are getting idiotic on buff requests. Its in pick up groups, LDoN adventures I feel sorry for the buffing classes in my group.<br />
<br />
This is a common scenario I see when playing my 50's alts in LDoN:<br />
 <br />
We are down to the wire, need to kill fast fast fast. The group will grind to a halt as the ranger demands every buff that will stack from every person in the group able to cast any sort of buff. It really usually is a ranger, why? <br />
<br />
My biggest buff request gripe is stupid times to ask for a buff. Picture, a runner got away and brought 6 at once into a room. Mage died, cleric died shortly from heal aggro. The rest of us are barely holding our own, all of us are at 30% health or so, a few root breaks from a wipe. The ranger speaks up mid battle his acumen faded, apparently he likes the look of UV over his normal vision I later found out after responding to his buff request at that time with a quick &quot;???????&quot;. <br />
<br />
We were in this mess because the ranger forgot to cast the one spell he was invited into the group for, then he asked for UV during a near wipe that he caused. I held my tongue in game, I'm glad the poor fellow couldn't see what I was really thinking about him at the time:) We won the mission and the mage summoned the ranger some item that seemed to make him happy. For the duration of that group the ranger seemed to know I wouldn't cast acumen on him, he didn't ask again for any buffs. I didn't say anything to him, but a group member must have told him buff requests from him probally weren't a good idea for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Started getting tons of buff requests again in PoK/PoT so have gone /role again and working out wonderfully.  Before that I just ignored the request or sometimes if they offered me cash I had no problem taking it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">2. Raiding. Send a frigging tell for buffs so I can /rtar you. Whining in /GU or /RS gets you nada. <br />
<br />
<br />
RIGHT ON!<br />
<br />
My pet peeve happen on Time raids.  <br />
<br />
The 1st phase of Time is set up similar to the PoJ trials, where you have your group(s) ready, then when everyone's set, we all zone in.<br />
<br />
Several times I say /gu /tell me for misc shammicals!.  I get a few tells for sta, cha whatever.  The usual tells for focus...um no dork it's gonna be MGB'd.<br />
<br />
Then we get to the area right outside the trials.  I do /say tell me NOW if you need shammicals! at least twice.  Usually a few tells for billy or sta.  Then we all zone in to the trial...<br />
<br />
a_guildie tells you, &quot;x buff plz&quot;<br />
<br />
RRRRRRRAAAAR!!!11 *head explodes*<br />
<br />
Edit to add:  That bst on that thread linked is so full of it. Having 10%  more haste is a HUGE deal because he wants it....but having a 10% lower slow is just as good as any other.  Mmmmmkay!<br />
<br />
50% haste vs 60% haste = WHINE!<br />
65% slow vs 75% slow = just as good!</div></div><hr />
