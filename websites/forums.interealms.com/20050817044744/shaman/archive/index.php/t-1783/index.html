<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In the Etiquette thread, Thorvan said: It's a long road to 60 and dang it, I wanna get there a.s.a.p.. <br />
<br />
For some reason, the above quote just struck a nerve with me...<br />
<br />
Ive seen many people with the same attitude towards the game (and I'm not knocking Thorvan for it)...the low levels of the game are simply a pain in the ass, and it isn't until level XX that I can enjoy the game.  For *some* people, this would include powerleveling, outrageous twinking, non-stop xping, etc.<br />
<br />
But...<br />
Ive seen quite a few quotes from people that are *bored* with the endgame, and complain about various problems - lack of mobs to kill, server politics, massive timesinks, crap loot, etc. <br />
<br />
So, my question:  At what level do you say: &quot;This is a good spot.  This is where EQ really starts for me.&quot;  ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, I can't vote at work, the proxy here always makes vbulletin polls not work for me.<br />
<br />
However, the fun starts about lvl 40, in my opinion, and while politics suck, it's all about killin new stuff.<br />
<br />
I am only lvl 54 so I can't speak for higher just yet ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gheff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Im saying level1 ... cuz since then I always want more XP, PP, and equpiment.... Hell even 60s run around looking for more XP for AA points ... hehe .. life was SO easy at Lvl1</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have enjoyed the game so much more since I hit 60.  While I enjoy the extra abilities that AA points give, I hate the fact that I have to exp again, I really liked feeling &quot;done&quot; with that.<br />
<br />
I love to raid, hate exping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hehe Glor...that's just it....<br />
<br />
Verant would never, ever, ever want you to feel &quot;done&quot; with anything : )<br />
<br />
That's bad business, after all : )<br />
<br />
If I had to pick, Id say 45.  At least, thats when you begin to get the feel of full functionality.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think it's in the late 20's or early 30s.  Once you get regen and cannibalize, you start to feel like a real shaman.  The first time you successfully juggle your pet, regen, cann, slows, and a series of buffs- that is when I really felt like a shaman!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gawgan Zolah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">When ya quit the game but keep trollin the boards, thats where the funs at</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Game starts at level 60 with 3 points into run speed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">level 1.  its more fun being scared silly and experimenting than knowing exactly what is going to happen in any given situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I really loved this game when it first came out and everyone was low level and didnt know what they were doing, and I really enjoyed the low levels then. Now though I cant stand playing twinks at low levels so I powerlevel them up to useful levels. Its just no fun exping with most of the low levels now a days. =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The game starts when you start having fun. If you're not having fun might as well quit :)<br />
<br />
But in General for me.. fun = 20's to - 45... haven't liked any of that raiding bullcrap :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I loved the game from Level 1, running around with a few bits of patchwork thinking I could take on anything. then being shown how poerful a gnoll pup is ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Level 1 , its just so much more fun being scared of whats round the corner and not knowing a thing about the world.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I kinda remember hitting a few lvls and going, &quot;O these spells are so going to kick ass...&quot;. I think those lvls were...<br />
<br />
24 - Cannibalize and Regen, those were two things that I remember loving the second I got them. I ran around Regening newbs in Everfrost Peaks just cuz I felt liked the feeling of casting it :rolleyes:.<br />
<br />
34 - First pet spell. In actuality, it feels better BEFORE you get it. The anticipation put towards it is much greater then our 1st, 2nd, and even 3rd pet. However, you still look damn kool wit a pet followin you around, :D.<br />
<br />
51 - OK, 49 got us two new DoTs, but they can;t compare to our newest and best(est) slow spell. Truly awesome.<br />
<br />
60 - I'm only 52 at the moment, but form all I hear, 60 is about 10 times more fun than soloing Dain...<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Weab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">60 wasn't an ending by any means. It was a new beginning.<br />
<br />
I'm not gonna say levels 1-59 aren't important, nor am I going to condone the 'skipping' of them. They're fun, valuable levels to go through.<br />
<br />
But for me, hitting 60 just opened up a huge number of possibilities and gave me a whole different look on the game. In that way, 60 is where it's at.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I really started to love my class around 51.  I finally came into real soloing power, and I started being effective on raids (I am in a small guild, I am only shaman so this is really important).  Also at 50+ you stop doing BS like dreadlands, and start doing big bad dungeons, both for raids and exp :o  That's what I love.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Also at 50+ you stop doing BS like dreadlands, and start doing big bad dungeons, both for raids and exp  That's what I love.<br />
<br />
Heh, some of us started doing dungeons a lot earlier than that! Kaesora, Dalnir, Nurga, Droga...all tons of fun when level appropriate, it's really a shame so many exclusively take the outdoor track to 50. <br />
<br />
/mourn old CT, my first dungeon fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I would have to say around the 20's is when the game gets better...<br />
<br />
I started up a couple of chars before i settled on my shammy...<br />
<br />
Couldnt get the necro past level 6 or so, too boring<br />
Couldnt get the ranger past 12...etc<br />
<br />
<br />
as a shammy i really felt the game got fun after lvl 24, when i can get mana back when i need it...<br />
<br />
its not so fun sometimes when i try to keep the tank alive, then realise ive cannid to about 50hp, and see all the mobs instantly turn on me, yikes!<br />
<br />
other then that its great so far =-).  And once i get my doggie i expect the game to get alot better again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Don't have any experience with a shaman at higher lvls, but I know for me, the game didn't really start until my necro hit lvl 49.<br />
<br />
Lvl 50+ got even better...in some respects.<br />
<br />
I hate the lower lvls and I try to get past them as quickly as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Level 50+ got better?<br />
<br />
hell, after 50 your crown as the best soloer has been usurped by shammys, and all you do on raids is mana bat ;(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Zabi Bbuzzin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Level 1 and inner fire baby is where its all at!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Yeah, but at lvl 50+ I didn't have to worry about going to EC to auction and slate running in the tunnel and pounding my arse into a bloody pulp ;)<br />
<br />
Now when I was lvl 20 to 30, that was another story. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>thorvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Hehe, actually I think the game really starts at level 20. The lower levels are fun and all because you're just exploring the world and getting to know everything. Very exciting! But.. ehh I have no urge to go through those lower levels anymore, I've done em once. <br />
<br />
Yup, I want to get to 60 a.s.a.p. the guild could really use another 60 shaman. It's the sense of accomplishment that drives me, hitting 60 would be the *sigh of relief, done with that part* <br />
<br />
Hehe, that and one of the level 60's in the guild told me his /played and it was about 30 days less than mine and his was high. That's when I realized that I'm about due to start xp'ing again hehe. <br />
<br />
Good discussion though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Riokhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">For a Shaman I think level 30 is where the game really starts. <br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Agree Mojokyn - <br />
most fun I have had was when I first got the edge on the froggies in da swamp - felt the power !<br />
<br />
But .. on new chars, the first 10 levels are not the same thrill, because they are the same, just without the excitement...  So I went with the next level up.  Actually, once I had sow and bind, I was roaming Antonica, amazed at what lay around the next corner ...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit:  spelling ...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Raikor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Level 1...I'll never forget the feeling of making my 1st character (shaman!) and just looking around Halas from the 2 foot square that was his birth spawn point...afraid to even move, that someone could kill me lol.<br />
<br />
Being in awe at the newness of it all, level 1 as a brand new player rules.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Level one as a BRAND new player is when it starts, but once youve been through it all it is late 20's+.  The game has only been getting more fun since i left oasis at 18.<br />
<br />
<br />
i remember on my first char i zoned in and it was night time, and i couldnt see a thing, so i camped and came later, lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Level one! I've had fun with all my characters, four if you count my first ever character.<br />
<br />
Some of my most memorable moments have been at lower levels, never forget questing the cleric armour, running into a kind paladin with my cleric at level 5 who was so amused at my reaction to a beggar that he offloaded a load of bronze on me, looking for that damn necro for the Tunare symbol with my druid, my first experiences in EQ with my Barb Rogue, getting lost in Blackburrow and Highpass, laying waste to Dalnir, Kaesora and City of Mist with Sere and being the only group in the zone, the excitement and frustration when quest armour for Iksar was bought out - damn you Froglock Repairer!<br />
<br />
All just as fun as the stuff I do now, if not, dare I say, a bit more fun. Perhaps I'm a serial newbie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">lvl 1 is where all classes start.  You need to learn how to play before you can play well.  Playing well is what allows me to enjoy the game.  I loved my early frustrating experiences, I enjoyed changing my kilt after running through a zone where I &quot;barely&quot; made it, I enjoyed shooting for a new spell level to get X spells.  I love being 57, but I HATE looking at inflated spell costs and I hate the idea that faction can be a barrier in what I want to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">lvl 9. NO questions asked. Never been without sow since.<br />
Next big step 46 - but noone again will experience the &quot;finally made it through 45 hell&quot; ever again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">/agree Shamu<br />
<br />
I miss da hell lvls and that great fealing when yoo hit 35 and no longer have to look at da book.<br />
<br />
Da game starts at lvl 1 and mez still enjoy wooping up on bats and such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Slithis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">The game starts at whatever level you're enjoying what you're doing.  For most people, that means experiencing new things and/or hanging with friends.  That can be level 1 when you start, raid level if you're making an alt, or any level in between.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">lvl 6.  you become pvp elligible then.<br />
<br />
there is no game till then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">This is a complex question for me, as it honestly depends on what class I am playing.  Some classes (such as melees) you can just jump right in and start enjoying the game from square one.<br />
Others, such as priests and casters, usually don't get going till later in their lives.<br />
<br />
That said, I went safe and voted 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Zoichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">The game started for me 145 &quot;played time&quot; days ago as nontwinked, non pwerlvl'd nOOb.<br />
<br />
145 played time days later- countless #'s of friends and a world of fun.  <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>fudorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">For me, the game started being really fun at 34, with the first pet spell.  1-33 just seemed to take forever to achieve, and it was a thrill a second to go to Iceclad, and have my arse handed to me at 33 by those blue cougars... 34, and the ballgame changed.  The speed of levelling, as well as the relative ease, and finally being able to solo something that felt like an accomplishment, that made it fun.  Sure, they aren't mage pets, but to me, the Dog is as class defining as any slow spell we can throw out there.<br />
<br />
So definately 34.<br />
<br />
And, now, with JBB (obtained at 3bb from 53), Dog, and massive AC, feeling a lot more confident, and having as much fun as ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Sivilon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">The game starts at level one. Maybe other parts of the game are more fun, and maybe as a shaman you don't become an unique class until you're higher level, but the game still has begun :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Kullann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Its always great to play from the begining when you are new to the game :) after that I would say 50+</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>RrumofXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Game starts at 51, when groups wonder how they ever got along without HoS and Turgurs.<br />
<br />
Game starts again when buffing the buffing tedium dissapears with group agl/stm/focus, and you have Can5, and Torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Mordrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Dont ever forget, Everquest is a game.  When it starts becoming a chore then the game is gone.  I lvl slower than other people, but I have fun and help others.  There are two kinds of people in the world.  Those who look at a journey and only see the prize, and those who see the adventure as fun to be had and not a route to some distant prize.  If you only want to be lvl 60 then work for a month at a mall and get a grand to buy yourself an e-bay char or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I have to agree with Filur...I love to tell this story...cause the game started on day one of release with me as well. Nothing will ever compare with the mass chaos of that first night....I started as a human paladin in Freeport(I thought there would actually be -roleplaying- in this game...shows how much I knew haha)...totaly blind....all I could see where torches everywhere....bats, bettles, orcs dieing all around me. Yeah, that first night was magical( when everyone was lvl1-5) and something I wish everyone that has come onto Norath over the years could have seen.<br />
<br />
Now, more on topic Id be more toward the 46 range....those were my favorite days in Everquest. The days when the planes were raiding and Inno, Cazic, Vox and Nag were -real- targets..shoot, the only targets...those were the days.<br />
<br />
In this age of EQ though Id have to say based on observation on message boards, in game and just a general feel....the game starts in the 54 range for most people. Theres quite a bit of content that can be had by 54 and most people at least strive to be in this range at some point...solo or in a small guild at least.</div></div><hr />
