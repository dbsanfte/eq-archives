<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>otakuryoga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">well...i am a new convert to the shaman class and im not regretting it at all.   went into dulak last night (i am 46) and got jumped by 2 guards..soon as both were slowed a 3rd jumped in..soon as i killed one a 4th joined the party... end result i killed all 4 and still had 80% mana (gotta love mount/kei/cann2/stoic/jbb)<br />
<br />
My old main (62 monk, good gear) couldnt have handled 3 at once nor 4 consecutively (i know cause i used him in 2-box to help me get stoic and most of epic done) he woulda had to FD, which in that situation would invariably have failed, then blow his stonestance disc to either zone or re-fd.<br />
<br />
so i am now shaman main and loving it.</div></div><hr />
