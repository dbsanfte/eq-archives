<br />
Pending Backflag Solution is in the Works<br />
<br />
I had the opportunity to speak with Lyndro, the developer in charge of creating the backflagging solution for the locked access zones, such as the Elemental Planes, Plane of Time, Qvic and Txevu. These zones will have an alternate method added that allows a different path for players to gain permanent access to the zone. In addition, there will be alternate paths to achieve access to pre-elemental zones.  This solution is slated to be introduced to the game in mid December. It is important to understand that the actual methods of exactly how these backflagging paths will be implemented has not yet achieved full resolution. These details are subject to change; however, the concepts mentioned below are pretty much set in stone.<br />
<br />
I. Elemental Planes<br />
<br />
Currently, the method to gain permanent access to these zones requires the task of meeting a series of goals, in the form of a linear path of killing specific raid targets that ultimately grants the player permanent access to an otherwise inaccessible zone. In it’s day, the linear flagging for access flowed pretty well; however, as the content became less and less ‘new’, it became a chore to go backwards to reflag newer members to the locked zones. The Backflag Solution addresses these concerns.<br />
<br />
After the Backflag Solution is set in place, a player will be able to be shuttled into an elemental plane via the 15%/85% raid rule, and hail for the Elemental Gods’ quest piece as before; however, now that hail grants the player permanent access to that particular Elemental Plane. Example: 15%/85% raid into Plane of Fire, be present at Fennin Ro killing, hail projection… you now have permanent access to Plane of Fire (only PoF – you must defeat Coirnav for PoW access, Xegony for PoA access and the Avatar of Earth for PoE access. **NOTE: the decision on EarthA and EarthB access has not been finalized. EarthB access may or may not require the Mystical Arbiter key from EarthA. ).<br />
<br />
It should be noted, that this alternate access will have no affect on the PoP charm; meaning – using the alternate access path to the Elemental Planes and beyond will not enhance the stats on your charm.<br />
<br />
II. Plane of Time<br />
<br />
Currently, one could only gain access to the Plane of Time by being present at all 4 Elemental God defeats and gaining each of the 4 essences to combine into the Plane of time Key (quintessence of elements).<br />
<br />
The Backflag Solution for Time will allow for players to be shuttled into the Plane of time via 15%/85% raid rule, and now certain mobs in the Plane of Time will actually drop the quintessence of elements itself, for permanent access. It’s undetermined exactly which mobs and how many flagging opportunities will be available per trip. I got the impression that Phase 4,5 and Quarm kills will likely grant 2-3 flags per tier, for approximately 9 backflags per visit. Example: defeating Tallon Zek, Vallon Zek, Saryrn and Terris Thule will trigger a mob/chest to spawn, which will drop 3 quintessence of elements; the situation would repeat in phase 5 (defeating the 4 gods), and then repeat again after Quarrm himself was killed. <br />
<br />
III. Qvic/Txevu<br />
<br />
Currently Qvic access requires Uqua and Ikkinz 4 raids (Ikkinz4 raid access is dependant on a series of raid encounters).<br />
<br />
The Backflag Solution will also allow for the 15%/85% rule to shuttle in players, and will have raid mobs (Zoo/Cynosure) who will drop 1-2 flag tokens to grant permanent access to the zone. There will be a quest associated with gaining permanent access to the zone, meaning that you will not simply be given access by 15%/85% zoning in, and looting just the item from here. There will be additional steps that can be completed with a group, outside Qvic or Txevu. The solution has an analogous scenario located inside Txevu that will allow the player to bypass the need for for reflagging through the Noqufiel event.<br />
<br />
All in all, I’m excited with the upcoming changes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Looks like a decent solution.  Those of us that did it the hard way will at least have the charm benefit to show for it.<br />
<br />
Pretty much requires a guild to have the ability to beat a zone to get more flagged for it, so really not a huge issue like the whole opening of BoT/HoH was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jalelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmm.. I wonder if this will be retroactive.  I have the quarters from Fire and Earth on my Monk from a very abortive attempt at returning to the raiding game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Looks like about the best solution to the problem.  Its a tough thing to get into raiding guilds now adays, as 90% of them require elemtental access or better in order to join, but you have to be in a raiding guild to get flagged for those zones.  (at least on my server; there is NO open raiding on Rodcet that Ive found).<br />
<br />
Im excited about these changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This helps the hard core raiders,but what about those of us that are casual players? SoE really needs to make it possible to gain access by one group or less. For example scale it so that its hard enough to require everyone in the group to have all there spells and at least be full LDoN equiped to pass the trial, and If they're above 65 to make it harder like it is when 65's get an adventure as oppossed to lvl 60's get an adventure. Or by quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's for help with backflagging, not flagging. It's intended to help guilds/raids who have already put in the pain/time to flag all their members but who get caught in an endless loop of reflagging and backflagging due to attrition. It's not intended to open up the elementals/Time to single groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This helps the hard core raiders,but what about those of us that are casual players? <br />
Well it does help casual players who are trying to make the transition to raiding.  I myself started this transition last May.  I would have liked these changes going from no flags all the way through pop flagging and into Qvic just recently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haxot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">hmm,, I dislike this as it gives out too many &quot;freebies&quot;,, It will greatly cheapen the accomplishment of gaining PoTime access if you can merely raid in somebody.<br />
Really, I don't mind too terribly the permanent flag being gotten by killing an Elder god. It makes sense.<br />
<br />
But the components for Quint of elements dropping in PoTime? &gt;.&lt; Does not make sense.<br />
<br />
I shall be quite unhappy, methinks, to see some people run around with time gear who never put the work in.<br />
On the other hand, I shall be happy to see some of my friends, who have tried quite hard, finaly able to join me in the clouds.<br />
<br />
It cuts both ways /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm in a Time guild. It's true, we did work really hard to get everyone flagged for Time - all those Carprin raids, Saryrn raids, getting the key to Saryrn, Hedge raids Hedge Raids Hedge raids...<br />
<br />
With the new games coming out and just regular attrition, I will be MORE than happy to easily bring new guild members where we are fighting. It's not fun for them to sit outside POT hoping that eventually we'll do a POEB access raid sometime in the next 2-3 months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bartmeista</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'll drink to that!<br />
<br />
ps: I'll drink to about anything else too!  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Personally I am just sorta sad to see OS, ST, VP and VT left out....<br />
<br />
If they insist on doing it then all keyed zones should have the same rules apply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">We have a ranger in our guild who has been missing Coir flag for 2-3 months now for Time access.  The problem is Cor is still being PL'd by a guild on our server whose current record about 3 for 25.  Due to time zone differences, there nothing we can do for him until the changes come.<br />
<br />
One thing I didnt see were any alternative Kod'Taz/Yxxta backflagging changes.  Lets face it, Tipt is still a pain in the ass....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Personally I am just sorta sad to see OS, ST, VP and VT left out....<br />
<br />
If they insist on doing it then all keyed zones should have the same rules apply.<br />
<br />
Thats a really good point!<br />
<br />
This outlined backflagging procedure sounds a lot like SOE being scared that not even the high-end guilds will have enough people to do any of their insane encounters after they are getting some real competition very soon.<br />
<br />
And these major changes are taking preference to the highly publicized class-balancing that has been &quot;just around the corner&quot; for years. Im just not impressed.<br />
<br />
They made us make a top-10 list of class issues yet many months later our (2nd) class representative has to come here begging to let us give up the last 2 items on the list so that we might &quot;force&quot; SOE to focus more on the remaining 8. Heeeelllloooo, something there isnt working.<br />
<br />
PS. Just the european signup for closed beta testing of WoW gained 330.000 people so fast that they had shut it off. Apparently this is more than the current entire european market for MMORPG. Someone at SOE is bound to be worried by this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Backflagging just leads to burnout, which makes the experienced players want to hit the road, which makes the friends of those players want to follow them.  None of this helps Sony retain it's playerbase.<br />
<br />
If they would have had this grand idea implemented a year+ ago, they would be in a much better spot to deal with WoW and other new games.  After repeatedly dealing with the same piss-poor backflagging schemes and GoD, I think EQ's core playerbase has evaporated and this little &quot;gift&quot; is too little way to late.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Too little, far too late.<br />
<br />
Flagging is the single worst contribution SOE made to MMOG. Encouraging players to Follow a quest or storyline is great. Forcing 50+ players to attend months of hard raiding and to continually redo old content is BS pure and simple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">What about tier3 and lower zones?  For example, a player that gets 85'd into a RZtW raid - will he get a permanent tactics flag once he hails the PP?  HoHb and SolRo's chamber also come to mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">No, they don't appear to &quot;tree&quot; downward. If you're piggybacked into Fire and hail FR, you get flagged for Fire, not everything that came before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I love the idea of this.  Too many people think this is a free ride for people to get into a lot of top end zones.  It's not.  In order for Player00 to get flagged for the plane of time, they will have to find a guild that is willing to raid them into the zone, and is capable of clearing the entirety of phase 4+, and even then there's limited numbers of flags being given out.  You aren't going to have a flood of new people people being flagged for a zone they shouldn't be flagged for.  Anyone capable of clearing phase 4 is not going to have any problems killing what you need to in order to backflag a recruit or new guildmember.  It's an incredibly tedious job though.<br />
<br />
Say you get 3 recruits that become guildmembers who still need their time flags, you have to go back and kill Fennin, Coirnav, Xegony, and Rathe so they get their flags.  But what happens the following month when you get another 2 new guildmembers.  Back you go to kill some trashy mobs (relative to your current raiding level) just to get 2 more people some flags.  Repeat for about 9 - 12 months of raiding Time.  Then you go on to Qvic raiding, where you have to go back to do Rondo/sewers, Vxed, Tipt, Ikk4, and Uqua for every new person that comes along that wants to raid with you.  It's horrible.<br />
<br />
Coming from a history of about 10-15+ kills of Grummus, Hedge Trial, PoJ Trials, Sol Ro, Rallos Zek, Mith Marr, HoH trials, etc etc etc, this is beautiful to hear.  There's still loot and benefits of going through the initial flagging progress (including charm stat boost, free AAs, etc), but now, once you have your main core raiding group flagged for what you need, you don't have to spend 25-50% of your time doing old content that's beneath you.  You can push towards harder encounters with more rewards.  You don't have to go on backflagging recruiting drives when things your numbers are starting to drop for whatever reasons; the good people can app any time they want without fear of not being able to contribute or be evaluated due to lack of flags.<br />
<br />
And now, with L2, WoW, EQ2, etc all coming out, this backflagging thing is sorely needed.  It's time consuming, boring, low reward work to go through a backflagging process.  Once you've gone through it your 5-15 times already, the novelty of doing it wears thin.  When you have 40-70 people all raiding something and 1 person not there, I really like the idea that those poeple already flagged can &quot;vouch&quot; for the non flagged person to show they deserve to also be there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">One thing i would like to see some clarification on is that when they mean 85% into Qvic does that mean you would require KT flag for it first, or would you be able to get straight into Qvic and get perm flag without getting KT?<br />
<br />
I like the idea someone being able to raid with Guild via 85% into all zones and get a permanent flag, this really will help out many many guilds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I would guess you need the KT flag unless they work it so that Madrona (sp) can send you into Qvic while in raid.<br />
<br />
In any event, it makes getting unflagged into Inktu'ta a heck of alot easier than having to drag peeps all over Qvic. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kilgaroz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I tend to agree with Juujuu, I think it's a good idea.  Only problem I forsee is guild hoppers using mid-tiered guilds to trade up towards the uber game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I don't like the proposed PoTime solution.  I mean, it would kick ass if I were the recepient of it, I guess, but I think the player should be required to do a quest of some type to finalize the Quin. of Elements.  Oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">At least once the Time solution is implemented, Tier1/2 loot wont be rotting anymore.  Go, Go twinks with Time Gear....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Just read this sorry as its an old thread.<br />
This does seem the ideal way to get around backflagging.<br />
But it also does leave it open for people to buy their way into Time etc.<br />
Plus like someone said Time geared twinks :)<br />

<br />
this thread is already weeks old<br />
sz needs this so bad its a chrisis</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I heard mid-December for an ETA.</div></div><hr />

Still need level 65 to zone in. no time items for baby twinks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I dunno if this was mentioned in the thread, but they are extending the 85% rule so that one group of players can have one non flagged person. For anyone wishing to exp in the elementals still, it means that you can gimp random LFG people into a plane and exp with them if the other 5 people are flagged.<br />
<br />
It also means that every twink in an EP guild is gonna have that 85hp/mana FT2 ring from plane of earth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Looks like too little, too late for my guild :(<br />
<br />
We've gone from a a 55-60 raiding force and just about to take down Xegony and Coirnav to a maximum of 45 (often high 30's) on raid nights.<br />
<br />
So, now we can backflag people into zones - but we don't have the force to kill the mobs that will provide the backflag kills.<br />

I tend to agree with Juujuu, I think it's a good idea.  Only problem I forsee is guild hoppers using mid-tiered guilds to trade up towards the uber game.<br />
<br />
Bah, thats been happening forever anyway - I've lost count of the amount of unscrupulous tossers who came to our guild saying &quot;All I want is to raid 3 days a week with you guys, its ideal for me&quot; to a few weeks/months later &quot;I lub you all but I want to raid more (unwritten So long suckers, and thanks for the flags)&quot;<br />
<br />
Personally, from a casual guild that has struggled to break through the EP's I would have preferred to see a method to strip flags gained with the guild from these twats - let the ubers have to work backflagging all their own people instead of us feeding them people all the time. <br />
<br />
It would mean that our targets would be up less, but a) we're in no real hurry to progress to Time and b) the people we get in would be people who would be a LOT more likely to stay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">The difference is, your guild won't be doing the flagging before people bail. It saves you hassle and people stealing loot. If someone wants to raid time, they'll hop into a time guild, rather than waiting for you to flag them before jumping ship.</div></div><hr />
