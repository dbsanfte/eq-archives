<br />
I've done the entire epic quest and just finished with Neh Ashiir last night, a Shaman friend of mine has a tear already and is wanting to MQ it with me for the Rah Ashiir fight.  My question is thus:<br />
<br />
If I loot the item from Rah to turn in for spear, how will I know if I have enough faction since I did not do the actual Tear turn-in for that last little boost of faction?  Is it even possible?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You might not, as I believe you get the final needed faction hit by turning in the Tear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You won't have the faction. Do a couple extra sets of Ghiosk books to max it. Or any other step of the quest... I suggest Ghiosk because you are going to be killing him anyway to get to Rak. Just get the 'can't get any better' message before you do the final turn in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>GrindleBashmeister</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the info's.. I was still worried about getting &quot;too much&quot; faction as that apparently used to be a problem in the quest.</div></div><hr />
