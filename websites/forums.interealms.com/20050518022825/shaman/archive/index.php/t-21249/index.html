<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been working on a new guides section, but in all honesty, I just don't see the point right now. There is little to no content outside of the expansions and this information is presented on the boards much quicker and is updated continually.<br />
<br />
That said, I'll be concentrating my efforts on WoW and EQ 2 when developing future applications/pages.<br />
<br />
I hope this isn't too big of a disappointment to anyone.</div></div><hr />

WTH is the The Medicine Cabinet?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Learning things yourself is actually quite fun.<br />
<br />
And the Medicine Cabinet is overflowing with information for you.<br />
<br />
Scan the boards and use search from time to time, you'll never need a guide.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Still time to re-roll if Graffe is going to walk you through the game....... Their dedication to your needs is admirable.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ugh, this is only THE best shaman site on the Internet. Don't start whining about how it's not dedicated. Hush and go roll a beastlord.<br />
<br />
I don't mind not seeing any new guides, really. We've got a ton of information here already in the forum. Some of those threads might could be added to the Medicine Cabinet, there've been a coupla good ones lately (lol when I get home perhaps I'll dig up a few good ones as examples). <br />
<br />
The one thing I'd really like to see? The slowability chart updated with GOD information -- and that includes GOD mobs and BON slowability. Whether or not it has been, I don't know, since my home computer has decided it hates me and not only refuses to download the chart, but refuses to display the last half of page 2 and all of page 3 of that thread.<br />

For the win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Joromitar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Oh God, I am not even going to start something or look back in this thread, so screw a select few of u all. My post was my opinion. Graffe is the most dedicated class site there is</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Don't come here and step up on your high and mighty soapbox and take pot shots at our community and expect to not be retaliated against. No one here has gone to Graffe and pointed their finger, stuck their tounge out and said &quot;Neener, neener...we're better than you&quot;, but that's exactly what you're doing. If you have a problem with this site, the door's not hard to find. If you don't like how it's run, start your own. If you don't like Dave's decisions, you have three options: you can deal with it, you can try to persuade him otherwise (he's a very reasonable guy), or you can leave. Make your choice and be done with it. Stop baiting other people to try to start a grudge match. Find something better to do with your time and leave us alone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Minitiki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Sunmoon - With the Medicine Cabinet and all the input you can get from the forums I feel that content presented by so many voices in the way that it is on the forums actually outdoes any static content. To be honest if a person wants a vague description they can stop by allakhazam then come by here to get the real guts of the issue.<br />
<br />
I have no problem with your decision.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">What the hell just happened?</div></div><hr />

Punk_ass_bitch_036 was just owned off the boards.<br />
<br />
Nothing to see, move along now folks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">...screw a select few of u all...<br />

Charmed, I'm sure.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">whats funny is.. hes a &quot;new shaman&quot; and is worried about GoD+ content guides being posted?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">*raises hand* I am a new shaman. This sucks... the only shammy site out there isn't going to have guides, etc. If only this site was as dedicated as Graffe =(<br />
<br />
Graffe's site is only as good as the guides submitted by the members of the board. Rather than take the screw you attitude that you appear to have taken. Why don't you write some guides, from your perspective as a low level Shaman.<br />
<br />
As others have said there is a lot of general information in the Medicine Cabinet, and there are very specific level guides in the Hunting forums.</div></div><hr />
