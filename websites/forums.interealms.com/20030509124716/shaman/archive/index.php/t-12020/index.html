<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Farenheit_Eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I was a lover of icey blue. I admit it. <br />
<br />
However, like all custom ui's I got tired of every single patch messing it up. Then feeling lost with the default UI and that HUGE spell gem bar that took up all my precious screen realestate. <br />
<br />
So, I went to eqinterface found a few things I liked, took the spell gem bar from icey blue and and put it all together. <br />
<br />
No more broken UI every patch, no more hassles, just a simple clean UI that is shaman friendly. <br />
<br />
Screen shot here: http://www.eqrelavare.addr.com/ui2.bmp    <br />
Sorry it's not in .jpeg :(<br />
<br />
And you can get the UI from here: http://www.eqrelavare.addr.com/farenUI.zip<br />
<br />
Let me know what you all think. <br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Farenheit_Eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">OH, I run EQ in 1280x1024, but i'm sure it works fine in 1024x768</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tobeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">First of all, I love the way your UI looks.  Im more of the simple kind of guy so it looks perfect for me.<br />
<br />
But one quick question, Anyway you could post a quick step by step way to install it?  I installed the files into my programfiles/everquest/uifiles/faren directory.  Then I entered the game and typed loadskin faren and it just reloaded the default setting.  Am I doing something wrong?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any information!:)</div></div><hr />

No problem and thanks for writing!<br />
<br />
Ok go to your UI directory and you will see a &quot;default&quot; folder.  Right click on that and chose copy. The pick a blank spot in that same UI directory and chose paste.  that will give you a new folder called &quot;copy of default&quot; right click on that folder and chose rename...  change the name to Faren or whatever you would like it called.  <br />
<br />
Now take the files you downloaded from my guilds server and open that zip file. go to edit and &quot;chose all&quot; then edit again and &quot;copy&quot;...  Then navigate back to your ui directory / faren folder and &quot;paste&quot; the stuff from the .zip file into it . It will ask you if you would like to over write the files, just say &quot;yes to all&quot;....<br />
<br />
When that is all finished the Faren UI should work just fine now :)<br />
<br />
Let me know if you got it to work, or if any of this did not make sense.. And thanks again!</div></div><hr />
