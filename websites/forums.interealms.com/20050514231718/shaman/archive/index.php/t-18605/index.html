Pay attention to it now, instead of 6 months down the road when it goes live...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I can say this much, i would be on board anything that stops this. Im sorry, i know pallies are part cleric, but they are a melee class first. There is no way in hel-l that a tank class should heal better or even close to as good as us. If they get a upgrade we certainly better also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Their &quot;champion&quot;, Galidin, is a clueless moron: 350 DPS isn't same as a mob now doing 195 DPS because you slowed it 70% and then healing. Not to mention he failed his math class, horribly.<br />
<br />
But yeah, let's give paladins shamanistic healing, then give our Focus line to beastlords, give mages Malos and let's delete the shaman class. All balance issues are solved then.</div></div><hr />

I agree that we had better unite a little bit here and make a little bit of a stink before this goes too far .

I know that this is just them asking but VI has a track record of caveing too hybrid demands so im going too go on record right now .<br />
<br />
Any change that makes a Hybrid class even CLOSE too a pure priest class in healing ability in ANY situation is just plain wrong .</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I dunno read through some of it i wouldnt get to upset about it. I Play a 65 shaman/palidan and ranger. Its natural for people to want some upgrader or slight changes. Just becuase they are brought up doesnt mean they are always reasonable. <br />
<br />
  Just like i cant cann to make mana when i'm casting or having to move a palidan casting a 5 second heal isnt meleeing or getting slays or undead nuking blah blah. <br />
<br />
    PLenty of shaman have complaints about our healing especially prior to any aa's. Kinda the same thing with pally healing. Soe seem to give long cast heals that dont &quot;seem&quot; to do enough in the 5 seconds it takes to cast or the quick cast one that just doesnt do much healing. See can look at it as some pallies want shaman type healing and the shaman want druid type healing and the druids want cleric healing and the clerics want more melee and the warriors want more snap aggro and the sk's want .....etc. etc. etc. Anywhoo not making any claims who is wrong or right just take it all with a grain of salt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yea, that's total crap. Paladins don't heal as well as they used to, but they've had their tanking abilities increased through better gear choices. If they want to heal as well as they did during the Kunark era, they should tank as well as they did back then too. ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You guys must have missed the 30 page-Druid thread on the Grove obviously. <br />
It's definitely amusing seeing how often Devs post on other class boards compared to this one though. Keep the good work up, because we are BALANCED, we can solo DRAGONS, we get all the GROUPS and CHICKS, Shamans are GODS!<br />
<br />
We are hurting our class, because the majority is clueless and keeps the ones with more insight, who really try to get the issues fixed, down. WTG!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Paladins should get their heal spell ... when shaman get a divine aura spell that allows us to take no damage from agro'd mob but, unlike the cleric version, still allows us to cast (at half the normal cast time) so we can land malo/slows on mob pulls without fear of actually getting hit.<br />
<br />
uh, do I need to say it .... /sarcasm off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">As you progress in levels and zones, the mobs hit<br />
harder but the healing spells haven't kept pace. <br />
<br />
I say give them better healing power, and us too. I<br />
HATE being healer. As someone else mentioned, our<br />
heals are either too slow, or don't heal enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">They already have a 1k FAST direct heal that's pretty nice, and some really decent group heals that . . well . . . completely own the shaman class when it comes to healing AE damage.  So we have a heal that's 2 seconds slower cast and does 300 more hps, woopeee.  Obviously something is out of balance.  <br />
<br />
When they raise the level cap to 70 it will be interesting to see how this all plays out, and who gets what upgrades.  I'm thinking shaman heals will advance to 1900 fast, 3k ICH, pally heals advance to 1500 fast direct and 1k group heals.  Still beats us realistically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The high level paladins I group with are already friggin awesome healers.  All their group heals are freaking sweet.  I don't know the exact stats but I'm guessing that they're best group heal does well over 2k healing to the whole group a lot faster than our pitiful ICH - and since paladins are rarely the main healer for a group their group heals usually end up being a sweet compliment to the main healer.  They're not lacking for other heals either and certainly not lacking for other spells or melee ability.  I sure hope no dev with a clue would seriously consider boosting an already very nice class.<br />
<br />
/em shudders with fear</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I don't keep up much with the paladin boards but it seems like they've always been whining about better heals. Dunno why now should be any different. :D <br />
<br />
There's a certain segment of the pally population that isn't gonna be happy until they have a heal good and fast enough to play Main Healer while they're playing main tank in a group. It hasn't happened yet and I doubt it ever will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I haven't grouped with uber paladins so I don't know what they can and can't do, but from an overall utility standpoint, the paladins I've grouped with have been great additions.  (btw, I play a warrior usually...I know knights can tank effectively, but in the pu groups I create I almost always MA so I usually think of them as additions rather than primary tanks - the advantage of creating the group  :D )<br />
<br />
Paladins have better agro than warriors (even with the recent changes), heal reasonably well, pull (via paci), are reasonably good at taking a beating, have useful hp buffs, etc.  I'm not seeing them being out of balance at the moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">To me, Paladins are the single class that has most expanded beyond what it should - and is the most unbalanced.  Even more than bards and beastlords.  <br />
<br />
This is not a class that should get any enhancement whatsoever.  <br />
<br />
If they do, they will really be unbalanced as to other classes.  If those classes are brought up, it's mudflation at its worst and the game becomes increasingly silly.<br />
<br />
I'm really not sure SOE cares too much.  The new enhancements make one of those serious problems in the game worse.  Snap aggro trivializes everything.  Why is more of that a good thing?  It balances warriors as to Paladins, because that relationship was totally whacked, but it's not really good for the game as a whole.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yeah, we need to put our collective big / webbed / furry feet down for once about this kind of crap. Not that I like healing a lot, or that I think Paladins are overpowered (Well, okay... I do think they are overpowered, NOT THE POINT!)... i'm just sick of having Shaman overshadowed and pimped out because we kicked ass in Velious. hell, Avatar was pimped out back then, too.<br />
<br />
Here's the twist - I don't care if Paladins get a heal spell to match ours. Let 'em have it... and give Shaman something better than we have. Might I suggest stuns? How about the full Paladin group heal series, I would love that! Maybe, oh maybe, Paladin melee abilities... GASP! We can only use one hand for weapons, too, and none of our weapons are really all that great, why the heck not?<br />
<br />
Edit: Okay, I really like Gilfalas' &quot;Aura&quot; spell idea on that thread. That's, hands-down, one of the coolest ideas I've ever heard.<br />
<br />
Gart,<br />
<br />
I'm a little biased... My current main is a beastlord. I got sick of the dull Shaman life, honestly, and converted to a hybrid class. I have yet to see the &quot;overpowered&quot; part of the class. i mean, it's easy enough to see with Bards, Dire Charm, et cetera, but the Beastlord? The only really &quot;powerful&quot; thing they get is the pet... Their melee skills are about as dangerous as a bard's (No double attack, relatively piddly weapons until godly levels, some dumb caps on skills) and most of their spells are goofy shaman hand-me-downs. The exception is the Sha's line and their pet lines.<br />
<br />
Are Beastlords powerful? No doubt. Who would have fun playing a weak class? They're, however, powerful &quot;enough&quot;. IMO, they're the standard for which other classes' power levels should be based, since they're fun as hell to play, but certainally not game-breaking.<br />
<br />
Right now, their biggest whine isn't being underpowered or not needed on raids, or begging for more upgrades, or saying &quot;Wow, I solo'd the Emp!&quot;, it's the fact that pet sizes are bugged. Woooo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Guys, we can ****in SLOW TIME ITSELF and tank stuff IN TEH FACE, let them have their petty healing upgrades.<br />
<br />
Whiny little snots :rolleyes:.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have grouped with several high end paladins, with Elemental-Time loot with 200ish AA blah blah blah. Did a Miraguls adventure with one as main tank and me as main healer. No joke here, I never landed more than a odd Q on him from time to time.<br />
He was wielding some 2hb that proc'd a 100 point heal with crit heal and improved heal AAs, Wave of Marr for 900 point regular healing to the group (for 850 mana mind ya, and you do the crit/improved heal AAs math, I am to lazy), Wave of Prexus for 660 heal to the group(at a trivial cost of 650 mana) and him spot healing With Touch of Nife (1150 heal for 450 mana) and you can see why I didnt have to heal much at all. Combine that with the necro we had group tapping for mana/hit points and feeding him mana and his FT15 in gear/KEI and you can see where this is going.<br />
Paladins are a great class. They dont need anything. They havent needed anything since Luclin, now they have been given access to their own version of Aegolisim (Guidance 1100 hit points and 54 Ac for 750 mana and a Peridot) and they really do heal better than we do already, if not as mana efficient (not that ours are that efficient).<br />
I remember doing a raid on ToV back in early Luclin days (so this is before raid and shared raid exp) me, a druid, 3 paladins and a warrior were sorta left over after people had formed their own KS group (you remember those if your older) and we ended up pulling 80% of the exp in for that raid, all based on HWoP from the paladins, the druid and I nuked and dotted like hell and the warrior was a higher DPS type and the 3 paladins tanked like good little girls (yes they were all gals, Taramisou, hmm cant remember the other 2 off hand, sorry gals) and kept us all alive through the AE damage.<br />
Paladins as a class are fine.<br />
Beastlords as a class are fine.<br />
Bards as a class are fine.<br />
Necros/mages as a class are fine (and canni-pet wasnt that huge, I saw it in action several times and yes its nice mana production, but you really cant do anything else at all).<br />
Clerics warriors monk and rogues are in a better spot than they have been in years.<br />
Chanters are fine.<br />
Wizards need a bone thrown to them. BOOM and grabbing an ass full of earth aint my idea of fun, and apparently it isnt for them either.<br />
Sk kick major ass, I know a few high end ones that push 130ish DPS with our crappy haste, and can go to 150ish on certain encounters, so they are fine too.<br />
Rangers need a touch too, they sacrifice a lot to have the best DPS of the hybrids, and these days they dont always have that, their nukes reload too slow, have a out of whack cast time in  comparison to other hybrid nukes, and are generally less damage per cast.<br />
Shaman.....not meaning to sound like a *****, but we do need a little tweaking, even if it is just by some new AAs or a new heal or what have you.<br />
Just my 2 copper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">ROFL... Shaman Big Heal?<br />
<br />
What did I miss? Is he playing on some special server that has an alternate ability/spell set?<br />
<br />
Biggest heal I have managed is a 3624 Tnarg's, and that was a crit heal. Typical Tnarg's is between 1625-1800ish.<br />
<br />
If he is talking about Kragg's Mending he has no clue about what kind of heals a Shaman has.<br />
<br />
Why do people whine for improvements they don't need? Paladin's are just fine the way they are, if not moreso due to the changes in the melee system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Look at beastlords as they are now...  People will get used to damn near anything and even go so far as to defend it, as many people here and in-game talk about how beastlords aren't overpowered.  Talk about being SOE's b___h...  If paladins are given better healing, people will get used to it, and within six months anyone who still doesn't like it will be in the much-derided minority.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Total and complete BS .

<br />
I think this is a fine idea.  Give pallies all the extra healing they want...and then maybe we'll get some much-needed DoT and nuke upgrades, such as critical affliction or something.  Or maybe even something cool like Actually Useful Rabid Bear.<br />
<br />
Functionally, it wouldn't matter all that much anyway.  In any situation that had both a shammie and a pally, the shammie would likely be healing regardless, because pallies can generally out-DPS us by a decent margin; thus, their time would be better spend in melee.<br />
<br />
Anyway, don't stress it; its not gonna happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The only reason I would ever ask for a better heal, is for all the times I'm expected to be main healer for the group. Its only natural that we would want to be better at our job. A paladin is not asked to be main healer for the group, they are asked to be tanks. A tank does not need a heal to do his job. Thats the only reason I would think an improvement to their line would be unneccessary. As to that whole, lets just give them this, and lets just give them that bs: why be jealous about what other classes can do? Its just a game. Have fun playing it.<br />
By the way, paladins heal pretty well already. I've done a few LDoN with the paladin healing himself the whole way. I was grouped with that same paladin in BoT today. The druid left and I was asked to heal and slow while we got a replacement, well, after a few pulls he told me not to worry about healing anymore, he'd take care of it himself. And so he did. I debuffed, slowed and nuked. No problems whatsoever. Not sure what they would need when this is already possible.</div></div><hr />
