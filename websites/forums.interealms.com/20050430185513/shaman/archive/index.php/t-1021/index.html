<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We have been blessed with an &quot;active&quot; mana regeneration skill, which means that we have to make decisions when using it. Do we cast between ticks? Do we chain cast? Do we do a mixture of both? Most importantly, what's the fastest way to build the blue bar? Below are the three options for canni-dancing ... which one is more efficient? Here are the unknowns... <br />
<br />
x = mana regen medding<br />
y = mana regen standing<br />
c = mana from canni<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;(OPTION 1) FULL CANNI DANCE&lt;/b&gt;<br />
(You stand, cast, and sit in time to catch the med tick all the time. So in 60 seconds you'll catch 10 med ticks and cast canni 10 times.)<br />
<br />
Mana Regen Rate Per Minute = 10x + 10c<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;(OPTION 2) PARTIAL CANNI DANCE&lt;/b&gt;<br />
(Whenever you're not casting you're sitting, but you don't pay atttention to med ticks. You just dance when your icons have ungreyed. In 60 seconds, you'll cast canni 15 times and catch about 6 med ticks.)<br />
<br />
Since canni III casts in 1.25 seconds, we'll add a little bit of buffer for lag and whatnot so that the total time that you are NOT sitting is 1.5 seconds. The recovery time is 2.5 seconds. You'll be casting canni 15 times during this period<br />
<br />
Mana Regen Rate Per Minute = 15c + 6x + 4y<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;(OPTION 3) CHAIN CASTING CANNI&lt;/b&gt;<br />
(Standing the whole time and casting constantly. In 60 seconds you'll catch no med ticks and cast canni 15 times.) <br />
<br />
Mana Regen Rate Per Minute = 10y + 15c<br />
<br />
So the big question is, what are x and y at various levels? Anybody have any information? Then we can figure out which will yield more mana. My hunch is that option 3 is the least effective, yet it's what most higher-level shaman do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krytog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At 60 I just stand and chain can 4, get down to a couple bubbles of life anc cast torpor. Perhaps not the most effective but I can't see doing any other way at this point. I will just press my ALT 2 key command for casting and don't have to worry with keeping the mouse targeted and can easily hydra off another system if needed.  The difference to me would be minimal at best and no longer even worth the effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I dont have time to write up a formal reply with numbers, etc, but...<br />
<br />
Option 1 is by far the most effecient in terms of HP used / mana gained.<br />
Option 2 is iffy as it would be fairly random and you might as well be doing option 1 anyway<br />
Option 3 is the least effecient in terms of HP used / mana gained, but allows for the most rapid accumulation of mana.<br />
<br />
The higher level you get the more it makes sense to use option 3 for various reasons, such as:<br />
<br />
-canni3 &amp; *especially* canni4 return more mana per use than canni1 and canni2<br />
-at higher levels you wont be able to canni dance because if you sit you are summoned/attacked immediately<br />
-higher level gear allows for more hp, hp regen, and mana regen.  Effeciency falls victim to volume.<br />
-similar to the last point, except rather than gear its spells (regrowth &gt; chloro &gt; regen).  At level 60, if a shaman acquires Torpor he will almost never have to worry about running out of mana again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hotkeys are your friends.<br />
I usually did option number two while in battle, since I would sit when and where I could, and never for long.  <br />
<br />
Nowadays I never med except to swap spells.  I lose too much potential mana by medding.  <br />
Then again I don't use canni4 as much as i used to.  Canni5 takes care of my mana needs for at least half of the 3 minute refresh time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">We can't really make any conclusions on this until we know mana/tick sitting and standing.<br />
<br />
Jsmaze writes that, &quot;Option 3 is the least effecient in terms of HP used / mana gained, but allows for the most rapid accumulation of mana.&quot;<br />
<br />
However, perhaps option one actually allows the most rapid accumulation of mana? Or maybe the answer is different for Canni I, Canni II, Canni III, and Canni IV.<br />
<br />
We really need to know those regen rates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">According to the Horse threads, the answer is hidden option 4 :).<br />
<br />
OPTION 4:<br />
Chain Canni on Horseback - supposedly catches ALL mana ticks with no sitting.  <br />
<br />
<br />
I have not yet tested this theory, but if true it makes the others obsolete, sans nerfage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If I ever get the free moment, and have C2+bardsong going,  you bet I sit down and med like everyone else.  Less pressing Can4 button=less hand strain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Shaman without torpor spends time cannidancing, screwing around with every last scrap of mana regen.<br />
<br />
Shaman with torpor doesn't give a damn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hmm ;)<br />
<br />
From personal experience:<br />
<br />
levels 24-26 I did'nt know about cannidance so I used to chain cast can1 a bunch to 50-60% health then sit for a while (Troll regen+regen)<br />
<br />
I learnt about cannidance at 26, I would use Inventory Icon or Hp to 'find' the tick and have a cannidance hotkey (/sit off /pause 2 /cast3 /pause 20ish /sit on. Catching every tick like this is more efficient (option 1), also some people beleive that sitting mana regen is expontial, the longer you sit uninterrupted, the faster you med up to a maximum of 25 mana a tik at 60(?)<br />
<br />
I did this to 50-51 ish (got can2 at 50), then I got a JBB and more aggro from tugurs. So I would cast tugurs, take a few hits, can a bit and go back into cannidance mode when aggro let me.<br />
<br />
I would also bracer dance, slow, JBB, canni, JBB, canni etc<br />
<br />
I did the macro cannidance when i could until I got fungi and can4 at 58. From 58-60 I just cast can4 pretty much all the time between doing other things, and only sit to regen hp or change spells. <br />
<br />
Due to the 'recast' delay on can4 I find it next to impossible to cannibalise every tick and catch the sitting regen, so i just tend to stand and chain cast<br />
<br />
Working on can5 now, only 16 points to go...sigh ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Here is something that I posted a few days ago on the official Newbie Boards, trying to demonstrate why cannidancing is so effective. It uses my Level 55 Troll Shaman as the test case, and I'm not sure how accurate my math is. I believe it tries to compare your first and third options. (I don't understand why anybody would consider using the second method).<br />
<br />
Cannidancing<br />
-75 HP Cannibalize III<br />
+15 HP Regrowth<br />
+12 HP Sitting<br />
-48 HP Total per tick (6 seconds)<br />
<br />
+36 Mana Cannibalize III<br />
+22 Mana Sitting<br />
+58 Mana Total per tick<br />
<br />
48 HP / 58 Mana = 0.83 Ratio of HP / Mana conversion<br />
<br />
Cannibalizing<br />
-75 HP Cannibalize III<br />
+15 HP Regrowth<br />
+6 HP Standing<br />
-54 HP Total per tick<br />
<br />
+36 Mana Cannibalize III<br />
+1 Mana Standing (does this go up with level?)<br />
+37 Mana Total per tick<br />
<br />
54 HP / 37 Mana = 1.46 Ratio of HP / Mana<br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
1.46 / 0.83 = 1.76<br />
<br />
Cannidancing is 76% more efficient than only Cannibalizing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">hmm, option 5<br />
/target mob<br />
/autoattack on<br />
/can(2 in my case)<br />
you hit a mob for 25 - 40 dmg<br />
you hit a mob for 25-40 dmg<br />
/can2<br />
......<br />
With haste I get 2 hits of my reif into one recast delay, makes about 12x2x25=600 dmg to mob per minute, plus a couple of procs.<br />
Sit full time while pulling, saves wrist and sanity.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously, I am interested in knowing if the method Juventus  mentioned (&quot;Chain Canni on Horseback - supposedly catches ALL mana ticks with no sitting&quot;) is valid.  Might actually make a horse worthwhile to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am busy, I am always grouped and we pull stuff fast.  I don't have time to sit down, stare at the hp number waiting for a tick.   Not to mention if I sit I am gonna get summoned or the mob will come over and bash me over the head for full dmg.   I am busy applying dots, slowing mobs, nuking, healing, hasting, buffing, pulling, rooting, etc.  No time for canni dance!<br />
<br />
I've also been with a bard with cantana from like 53 to 60.  You just can't beat the regen and mana regen on that song.<br />
<br />
The only time I med is when I am afk/swapping spells.  I like being busy.<br />

AA Canni in 3 more points.  /cheer<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">So the big question is, what are x and y at various levels? Anybody have any information?

<br />
mana regen sitting(at 252 med skill) = 22 per tick<br />
mana regen standing = 1 per tick<br />
<br />
Wdit: Sorry, didn't see House had posted the correct values already. Take this as confirmation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I usually do Option 2, as using Cann4 doesn't allow you to continually do a true Cannidance (esp on 56k dial-up).  I spent so many levels staring at that little blue bar to know when to begin dancing...now I just hope to catch a tick here or there.  Getting 82 mana per cast of Cann4 just makes it all the easier to not usually care about max efficieny.  Sometimes I work at doing a full Cannidance, but only when I'm bored with nothing to do or really need mana and can sit.<br />
<br />
Really looking forward to Cann5 aa skill!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Okay -- so you regen 1 mana per tick standing and 22 mana per tick sitting.<br />
<br />
&lt;h2&gt;Best Use of Canni III&lt;/h2&gt;<br />
<br />
Let's look at the formulas now:<br />
<br />
x = mana per tick sitting<br />
y = mana per tick standing<br />
c = mana from canni III<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;(OPTION 1) FULL CANNI DANCE&lt;/b&gt;<br />
(You stand, cast, and sit in time to catch the med tick all the time. So in 60 seconds you'll catch 10 out of 10 med ticks and cast canni 10 times.) <br />
<br />
Mana Regen Rate Per Minute =  10x + 10c = 10*22 + 10*40 = &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;622 mana in one minute&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;(OPTION 2) PARTIAL CANNI DANCE&lt;/b&gt;<br />
(Whenever you're not casting you're sitting, but you don't pay atttention to med ticks. You just dance when your icons have ungreyed. In 60 seconds, you'll cast canni 15 times and catch about 6 out of 10 med ticks.) <br />
<br />
Since canni III casts in 1.25 seconds, we'll add a little bit of buffer for lag and whatnot so that the total time that the server thinks you are standing is 1.5 seconds. The recovery time is 2.5 seconds. So every four seconds you will be up and casting for about 1.5 seconds and sitting for 2.5 seconds. There would be 15 such periods in a 60-second block, so you'll be casting canni 15 times during this period.<br />
<br />
Mana Regen Rate Per Minute = 15c + 6x + 4y = 15*40 + 6*22 + 4*1 = &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;736 mana in one minute&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;(OPTION 3) CHAIN CASTING CANNI&lt;/b&gt;<br />
(Standing the whole time and casting constantly. In 60 seconds you'll catch no med ticks and cast canni 15 times.) <br />
<br />
Mana Regen Rate Per Minute = 10y +15c = 10*1 + 15*40 = &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;610 mana in one minute&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/b&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;B&gt;Fast Mana&lt;/b&gt;: If your goal is to get mana back as quickly as possible (for example, you are in an intense group situation in which mana is the limiting factor or you have very high hp regen), then you should go for option two for pure speed. 126 extra mana per minute is a pretty huge difference between partial-canni dance and chain-casting. That's 12.6 mana per tick extra. <br />
<br />
Compare that to Clarity I which gives 7 mana per tick, or clarity III which gives 14 mana per tick. (Admittedly, those are passive mana regeneration mechanisms, so they're in a league of their own.)<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Max Mana per HP&lt;/b&gt;: If your goal is the maximize the amount of mana you get for each hitpoint you cannnibalize, then you should choose option one.<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Slower Mana, High HP cost&lt;/b&gt;: Option three will neither net you the most mana overall nor the most mana per HP spent. It is a poorer choice in all situations. <br />
<br />
For either method one or method two, all you really need is a HOTKEY and you are golden. (It's not very convenient without a hotkey.) Here's a hotkey that would work well for it:<br />
<br />
<br />
/sit off<br />
/pause 1, /cast 3<br />
/pause 1, /cast 3<br />
/pause 13, /cast 3<br />
/sit on<br />
<br />
<br />
This hotkey will attempt to cast canni III three times for each time you hit it, thereby eliminating the issue with Canni III's notorious fizzle rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yes.. canning while on horseback catches ALL med tics. Hell I can jbb mobs from horseback and still get  the med tics over the 8 seconds. Horse= so worth it.. even the cheepies. Cant use it anywhere you cant cast sow.. but it is so worth it for everywhere else. Disable the horse models and you can run at full sow speed(with sow on of course even on cheapy horse), be levved etc. Downside is that you always regen at standing rate and boy oh boy does that horsey eat alotta food/water.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Can you lose 1110hp per minute using option 2 though?<br />
<br />
Option 1 you only lose 740hp...370hp less, but only 114mana less too.<br />
<br />
Taking from your other thread, with your hp regen rates:<br />
<br />
65hp standing, 69 sitting.<br />
<br />
Option 1 you would regen 690hp...you'd only be down 50hp from the start.<br />
<br />
Option 2 you would regen 666hp.  You'd be down 444hp from start.<br />
<br />
<br />
Option 1: -50hp, +622mana<br />
Option 2: -444hp, +736mana.<br />
<br />
Is the extra 100mana worth negative 450hp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">soupypoopy, while method 2 might allow you to regain mana faster, it is not more health/mana efficient. You're chewing through way more health to get back the same amount of mana as method 1. I suppose if you had someone to manaless heal (i.e., that Paladin helm) or bind wound you, or just had some really sick regen, method 2 might make sense. But if you're just talking about standard gear and regen, method 1 is better for efficiency.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The issue is that my regen rate is so &lt;b&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;font color=red&gt;insane&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/b&gt; that I really don't care about what is happening to my HP bar now. I want the fastest possible MANA regen during my downtime.<br />

<br />
<br />
Very true, House.<br />
<br />
And yes, Jilariz, option two is less hp-to-mana efficient, but by the Turgurs finishes casting and the mobs gets to me, I've regenned a considerable amount.<br />
<br />
I'll add the HP-to-mana calculations in there too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Okay, soupypoopy, here are the numbers I think you're looking for, using Troll regen:<br />
<br />
method 1: 480 hps -&gt; 620 mana (.77 ratio)<br />
method 2: 879 hps -&gt; 736 mana (1.19 ratio)<br />
<br />
method 1 is 64.7% more efficient than method 2.<br />
<br />
The ratios are different than what I had earlier in the thread because you used different numbers for Cannibalize III than I did.<br />
<br />
Hey, if you've got the kind of regen that it doesn't matter to you, then more power to you :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Turgur's takes 3 seconds to cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I should have said... <br />
<br />
By the time I get to max casting range (to single pull), cast turgurs, wait for the mob to path to me, land bane, and ebolt, I'm at FH again.<br />
<br />
Sorry...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I just chain cast canni..always have, with all cannis.<br />
<br />
I get what needs to be done, without being anal about getting every last ounce of mana possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">126 extra mana per minute is a pretty huge difference between partial-canni dance and chain-casting. That's 12.6 mana per tick extra.<br />
<br />
Let's compare: <br />
<br />
Partial-Canni: 12.6/tick extra mana<br />
<br />
Clarity I: 7/tick extra mana<br />
<br />
Clarity III: 14/tick extra mana</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Hehe, that's interesting to see that method 2 is better than chain-casting. Here's another option for those who don't quite have insane regeneration, but want to regain mana faster than pure cannidancing:<br />
<br />
Cannidance during first tick<br />
After tick, chain cast three times<br />
Sit down to catch tick<br />
Cannidance during next tick<br />
After tick, chain cast three times<br />
repeat<br />
<br />
It yields less mana than method 2, but more than method 1, and has a mana/health ratio somewhere between the two methods. Quite a headache, though, to keep track of.</div></div><hr />
