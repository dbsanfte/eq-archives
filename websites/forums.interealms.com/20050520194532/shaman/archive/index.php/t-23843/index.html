<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So at the moment, I'm trying to decide between installing from www.cyberpowersystem.com:<br />
<br />
-(DDR400-800MHz FSB)MSI 848P NEO-V, Intel® i848 Mainboard PRESCOTT SUPPORT w/ LAN &amp; 5.1 SOUND W/SATA        <br />
-(DDR400-800MHz FSB)MSI 865PE NEO2-PS AGP8X Platform W/SATA, AUDIO, &amp; LAN   [+18]  <br />
-(DDR400-800MHz FSB)ABIT IS7-E I865PE 800MHz FSB MB W/ SATA,LAN &amp; SOUND   [+18]  <br />
-(DDR400-800MHz FSB)Gigabyte GA-8IPE/1000 I865PE 800MHz FSB AGP 8X AGP   [+32]  <br />
-(DDR400-800MHz FSB)ASUS P4P800 SE I865PE AGP8X DUAL DDR w/AUDIO,USB2,LAN   [+50]  <br />
-(DDR400-800MHz FSB)ASUS P4P800-E DELUXE I865PE AGP8X DUAL DDR w/AUD,USB2,LAN   [+72]<br />
<br />
<br />
If the first model is the base price, and you're on a limited budget, are the other models worth the extra cost you see in brackets at the end?  I already have a sound and ethernet card.  Debating on whether to go with the base priced motherboard and using the extra cash to upgrade from 3.0ghz to 3.2ghz, but I don't know which is money better spent.<br />
<br />
The computer I'm building will also have:<br />
-(800Mhz FSB) Intel® Pentium® 4 CPU @ 3.0GHZ 1MB w/ Hyper Threading CPU<br />
-Seagate 80GB 7200RPM Serial ATA 150 8MB Cache hard drive.<br />
-1gb of Corsair memory (newegg has great daily specials).<br />
-9800 pro video card.<br />
<br />
Could any of you computer gurus help explain it to one who isn't so technically inclined?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you are mostly a gamer How, the AMD is a better bang for your buck game-wise.  Intel is the best for having more than one program going at one time.  Of course you have to be comfortable with the label so if Intel is your brand go for it.<br />
<br />
I just put together an AMD64 3000+ which is overclocked to a 2.2Ghz with the same memory and HD but with a FX5700LE (waiting till EQII comes out to upgrade).  It runs the EQII CC at default at about 32 for the tower and 20 for a Male Barbarian.  I can play EQLive with all the bells and whistles on even in a group but the effects are blinding.  <br />
<br />
According to my AquaMark benchmark my video card is the big bottle neck.  CPU is rated 9100 or so but the video is only 2000.<br />
<br />
I can only guess that since the AMD64 3000 is supposed to be equal a P4 3Ghz that your set-up would be going about a AquaMark 50,000 to 60,000 with your video rated at around the 7000 mark.  I assume your CPU rating would be around 9000.  I am not familiar with the other benchmark programs so I can't say what your score may be there.<br />
<br />
Oh and if you have the sound and netcard, I think it would be safe to save the money as long as it supports possible CPU and Memory upgrades to faster CPU and RAM.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Before I buy a motherboard I research it at www.tomshardware.com . Then I order what I want from www.pricewatch.com .I'm a big fan of bang for the buck, luckily I haven't had a bad experiance yet(knock on wood) except from Fry's electronics... but who hasn't had a bad experiance from them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Is there a better site out there for comparing motherboards?  <br />
<br />
Because everytime I look for valid information on one of these using tom's, they're usually trying to sell me the product.  I think maybe I'm just using it wrong, because the site itself seems awkward and ungainly to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The best hardware sight out there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Personal experience... Go for whatever board is reputed as the most stable and standard. You won't notice 5% faster but you sure as hell will notice a crashes, reboots and incompatibility problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dementhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have used both the ASUS P4P800 deluxe and the SE.  I love them both.  I haven't had any hardware/software issues and they are a breeze to overclock.  I would highly recommend them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I picked up the Neo-2 after a lot of shopping around. Solid board, no problems with it so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Biggest thing I noticed is that with the first couple boards, there are only a few slots for ram.  I'm going to be using two slots of 512mb RAM intitially.  I figure 1gb RAM will be enough, even for playing games like WoW and EQ2.  But if I need to add more, and don't want to scrap my old ram, how important is having 4 slots v. only 2 slots for ram?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yea, expansion is what I like to look for in a motherboard. I figure pay more money for a better motherboard that way in a year you can fork out 50 bucks for a processor that's going for 200 now. I like to have at least 3 ram slots as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I put together an AMD 64 3200+, 1 gig of Mushkin lvl 2 RAM, 120 gig SATA drive 7200 RPM 8MB Cache and 7ms Seek time, and a 9800 XT this is all on an MSI board.  One reason I choose MSI over ASUS was stability.  ASUS was rated slightly faster but MSI was rate more stable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ended up going with the MSI NEO2.  Just one more question though.  Basically, I'm buying the geil 512mb ram from cyberpower inc, but I also have a gig of corsair ram incoming (because I got it really cheap).  What are the pros and cons of mixing different the types of RAM?</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are no &quot;pros&quot; of mixing different brands of ram. And the only &quot;cons&quot; to consider is the quality of what you buy.<br />
<br />
Generally, you get what you pay for...</div></div><hr />
