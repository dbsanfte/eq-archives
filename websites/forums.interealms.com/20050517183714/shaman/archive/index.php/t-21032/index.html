<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>horaxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I've retired from the original. And am no longer playing DAoC. Am playing an Orc Caster in Lineage 2 atm though. And EQII is on the horizon. So, what does that mean? 2 new Shaman types. Essentially the good and the bad versions. Below is a description of the subclasses as it pertains to Shamans. I've been following the info for months. So, if you have any questions lemme know and if I don't know, I can point you in the right direction young Heyoka.<br />
<br />
Priest Archetype - Priests augment and replenish the health of their comrades to help them survive longer in combat. Though not particularly known for their battle prowess, priests fill a vital role in dangerous world by sustaining the physical and spiritual needs of their party.<br />
<br />
Shaman Class - Shamans call upon the ancient spirits of the land, using protective wards and healing to invigorate their comrades. They remove afflictions from their companions and turn the vile magics back upon the enemy. <br />
<br />
Defiler Sub-class - Defilers enslave the spirits of their ancestors, harvesting and corrupting their power, to use against enemies. This stolen energy can also be used to heal and boost the capabilities of the defiler’s allies. <br />
<br />
Mystic Sub-class - Mystics seek a symbiotic connection with the spirits of their ancestors, petitioning them to bestow the power to heal the injured, invigorate the weak, and enhance the capabilities of their allies when on the field of battle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Who cares?<br />
<br />
Let them fix this game first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>horaxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well obviously you don't, but do you speak for the rest of the Shaman community? Ah no ... I thought not. ^_^<br />
<br />
 Believe me bro, I feel your pain. I wasn't a Shaman in EQ for a couple months ... it was 4 years. So I know where you're coming from. If I posted this in the wrong section. That's one thing. Tell me ... and have a admin move it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yea seriously, let him have his fun thinking about EQ2. Honestly i think EQ2 will be pretty good cause they will have MUCH testing in EQ1 for all the things that will be in it.<br />
<br />
EQ is like a patchwork quilt, there was a design atfirst, but now things are just patched together pretty randomly, they dont really follow a real progression and there are gaps in attention to many areas. When EQ2 comes out i honestly expect a much more smooth and polished product. All you have to do is look around EQ and see the stuff they are ****ing up to get a idea how good it will be. I have always believed EQ's biggest current problem is its a bunch of ideas duct taped together instead of 1 pre-concieved path.<br />
<br />
Anyway, ill be checking it out, but im not sure ill play it, maybe just for a old times sake kinda thing, i dont know yet. EQ is just too deep, it takes up too much if your life, so if they can ease up that notion, which i dont see them doing, then i might play. But im sure SoE shares the &quot; F the casuals&quot; mentality that is shared by many hardcore players, i mean lets face it, when you have a addicted playerbase, its much better money then a casual player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the info, horaxe, but when I finaly walk away from EQ, I will walk away from online games for at least a year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hey Horaxe, can you shrink your sig to match the requirements of the Crucible (posted in the Test section).<br />
<br />
I don't understand what they're doing in EQ 2, why would I want to be a shaman in EQ 2 and have half my current ability?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So, uhh, whats the point of this discussion again?<br />
<br />
a)  Talk about class balance in a game none of us has played.<br />
<br />
b)  Discuss aspects of a class in a game no one has ever played.<br />
<br />
c)  To point out that people are talking about games other than EQ implying a mass exodus to scare SoE into making changes.<br />
<br />
I may be missing a possible point, but I can't figure it out.<br />
<br />
How can there possibly be an intelligent discussion about the new shaman class in EQ2 when people haven't played it, don't know how interractions between entities work.<br />
<br />
Besides that, there is no way I will make the same error of reading and believing class descriptions as written, as I did for EQ1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Think about this, the Original game was created by 989 studios and Verant, The new game is being created by SOE, the original game while patched to hell and held to gether with bailing wire is still for the most part untill last 2 expansion true o most of the original games style. What are most o fhte complaints shaman have about, last 2 expansions, what do you expect from SOE and EQ2??????? No Way in hell do i expect anything good from EQ2 not if SOE is the author of it, there will be nothing of the way a shaman was left from the original EQ, its gonna be a frag fest might as well include blasters and sniper rifles to EQ2 action is fast paced like a FPS and content will suffer as a result of no customer service interaction like the guide program of old. Hell if they cant get on and do GM event content on Legends what makes you think they gonna support a lot of it in EQ2? Im sorry the game I loved seems to have been gone for a while now and nothing Sony has done lately gives me the impression its ever gonna return in any form.<br />
HERES and IDEA for you Sony how about stop making expansions and add content for the whole freaking game? like finish initiate symbols, dont have to be low level quests, how about fixing half the broken quests, how about actually giving real exp for real level chances of completing those quests. In fact how about real exp for all the quests, problems with quest leveling? put flags on them so they can only be done x number of time(s).<br />
But I guess wwith SOE being part of a big money making business its all about SELLING content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Eluj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Myself, I'm really looking forward to EQ2. I've been thinking lately about what I'm going to play, and I'm not entirely sure. I'm sure I'll be trying out the shaman, probably as my first character, but I can see myself starting multiple guys to see what hooks me first.<br />
<br />
The thing that most interests me, I think, is the quests. I don't quest much in EQ1, but I think I could see myself doing it if they were laid out better, which I think they are in EQ2.<br />
<br />
But until EQ2 I'll enjoy playing my shaman and hope they fix some of the problems</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I wouldn't so much walk away from EQ as rather flee from SOE like you do a rabid dog.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>horaxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Actually, some of us HAVE had a chance to play. Fanfaire Vegas ...<br />
 I'll shrink my sig. Actually, I'll change to the mini sig I use on the official boards. Sorry, missed the sig requirements which is my fault.<br />
<br />
 As for the rest, there's a lot of games out there I'm sure the haters think of as &quot;inferior&quot; but that doesn't stop thousands from playing them.<br />
<br />
 Myself, I'm interested in the Shaman class. Always have been, why else would I play one in as many games as I have ... I'm not just an EQLive Shaman. I'm a Shaman in general. I actually am kinda curious how it's going to work out having the new race/class restrictions lifted via quests. Yeah, you can be an Erudite Shaman or Dwarf or Human now if you want. It's just hard ... and you're limited by the city you're affiliated with on things such as what classes you can train.<br />
 And for those of you that just want to complain about it I ask this, why? If you're not interested in EQII, why did you click the thread named EQII and Shamans ... ? Just thought I'd throw that question out there. Cause it's one of those things that's always had me curious, why people do that?<br />
<br />
 At any rate, if you are interested in EQII, you should check out the official boards here: EQII</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jaeydee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I will not be supporting another Sony game.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">&quot;Ah no ... I thought not.&quot;<br />

<br />
Because everyone has their opinion and most aren't shy to tell it to you.  However I do not see where people have complained, only given you their opinion about the topic you have posted.  <br />
<br />
Heres what I don't get, why do people post a topic and then complain about the opinions of others.  If you weren't interested in others opinions why did you make a thread named EQII and Shamans ... ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">he was just defending his thread, the first reply states his &quot;opinion&quot; that no one cares about this topic, and obviously horaxe cares about the topic.. or else he wouldnt have posted it in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Despite the flaming heap O' trash EQ has become I'll prolly check out EQ2.  There are a number of features and mechanics that do appeal to me as a casual gamer.  <br />
While EQ is now developed / managed by SoE it wasn't originally so I still have my hopes that a game they designed from the ground up will fair considerably better than this one has.  Of course it could be wishfull thinking but we'll see.  <br />
Like anything I'll try it out but if it doesn't pan out I won't continue playing /shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I pity the people that are going to waste their money on EQ2.  You can feel free to check out SWG and Planetside to see how much SOE has learned from their many, many, many mistakes in EQ.  I'll give you a money-saving hint though... the answer is: Pretty much nothing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Comparing SWG to EQ2 is silly.  Its 100% different teams and 100% different ideas.  <br />
<br />
I think sony actually KNOWS how much money they made with EQ.. and I suspect they dont want to mess up the sequal.<br />
<br />
I will try it... if it sucks, I wont play.. if its GREAT I will.<br />
<br />
I don't give them any special treatment or abuse.<br />
<br />
If anyone does not even try it and its great, its only them that miss out.<br />
<br />
Hell, if I paid for DAOC just to try it I can pay for about anything lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I don't have much faith in Sony anymore. WoW is going to get my money first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Lumor2000</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">No good reason not to give it a whirl.  I was pretty amazed that SWG was a uninspiring as it was though.  <br />
<br />
EQ2 can't just be EQ with better graphics.  Folks won't give up their guilds and multi-65 toons and knowledge of the game just for eye candy.  Nor will those who have quit EQ be drawn in by the promise of more of what they have abandoned.  They will really need to tie in a progression, quests that make sense, a way to become heroic in the game world (not where you go check on some guilds board to see if they have killed quarm yet).  <br />
<br />
They are starting with a pretty much completely blank slate, the world being mostly destroyed, a good and evil starting position, the gods having left.  There should obviously be woldwide efforts to reclaim the lands, and lost cities, and to reconnect with the gods.  It all could be done well, or it might all just flat suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I've been following EQ2 for a long time now.  I've seen all the changes that they have been making to the mechanics of the game in the last few months and the game just keeps getting more and more appealing to me.  However, I also still very much enjoy EQ and dont sit their and bitch about it like some people tend to.  Some things that turned people off to the game has been changed.  The death system and the Tradeskill Class are two big changes that come to mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">You ever spend much time in the serverwide tradeskill channel in this game?  They are famously obnoxious and insular, and there's probably even more creepy fascism to them than there is in the worst uberguild type of jerk.  I think you'd have to like tradeskills as a completely solo game in EQ2 to make it a community you'd want to spend any time in.  Tradeskills themselves look like they will be made a lot more interesting, but they'd better not attract such a limited crowd, or they will stay something that most people only care to dabble in.<br />
<br />
I'm saying this as someone who has his aid gimel earring and the other earring that goes with it, and got those skills the hard way, with no tradeskill mods and no new tradeskill UI, so I'm not just one of those guys who jumped in their channel and asked dumb questions -- mostly I was answering them.  But yeesh...overall, it's the least friendly channel I've been in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 I have to agree with you, I was big on Tradeskills in EQ. I'm kinda torn on the decision to allow anyone to level as a tradesman. On the one hand, it does allow me to continue my pursuit of one of the most frustrating tradeskills ever, Alchemy. And yay Rangers can make their own bows and arrows again. And of course, it adds some room for those that &quot;beat&quot; the game as it were. As they now have something else to focus their energy on for a while.<br />
 But it also means, that now. People who are dedicated tradeskillers, may eventually have some problems. Time will tell. But I wish those who do focus on tradeskills luck. As for the rest of the game. There are plenty of bells and whistles. And I'm sure there are plenty who won't want to upgrade their comps &quot;just to play EQ&quot;, I remember similar issues when SoL was released.<br />
 But I got more RAM. And upgraded my vid card anyways. But the game isn't all about shiny new graphics, and voice acted NPCs, and all those little bits of polish and gimicks. The game has changed, the mechanics are different. There's more room for uniqueness in your character. Some elements of the game are now made more dynamic.<br />
 I for one, being a PVPer was concerned slightly about such things as the instanced encounters. And a few other things with the combat system, but after the knee jerk. I decided that actually these things will quite likely help my experience of the game. Not to mention some of the neat features. Like, group special attacks. Special combot options for say, having x2 Dark Elf Rogues in a group. Or similar. *reminds me of Suikoden*<br />
 I could go on, but in all. I was skeptical until Vegas. Now, I'm finding myself more and more interested as time goes by. I'll be playing, and I'm actually getting anxious for the release. Hopefully, I'll see some of you there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Original game was created by 989 studios and Verant, The new game is being created by SOE<br />
<br />
<br />
why is this distinction significant?  the only difference between 989 and verant is corporate semantics.<br />
<br />
the guy who came up with the idea (smed) has been there since 96.  the guy who opened the pocketbooks (kelly flock) is still there.  what happened was 989 was sony's US game development studio.  in 98 or 99 they DISCONTINUED making PC games as they weren't profitable (except for EQ which they touch-and-go decided to release as a lark since was about finished and got good reactions at conventions).  989 makes console games to this day.  verant was spun off just to release EQ and considered basically worthless.  once flock realized what a cash cow online games were he rebranded verant to sony online.  obviously when EQ was being dreamt up a thing such as online games... let alone material for Sony ONLINE entertainment seemed an irrellevancy at best.<br />
<br />
granted brad mcquaid and the rest of his boys left in 01 but that was AFTER the original game documents were done and in any case he wasn't involved day to day from what sony says.  I guess the biggest thing is that EQ is a MUD and EQ2 isn't</div></div><hr />
