Basically, the fact that wards are pre-mitigated damage prevention is being discussed again.<br />
<br />
Throw your 2c in...<br />
<br />
Players aren't high enough level to really show a difference yet, but actually I like the diversity of the heals already.  Ok, so Wards get used up quickly when your tank is facing a high level mob.  However, soon I think Shaman will start realizing the benefits of having a monk or bruiser tank instead of the guardian.  Also, I don't see it possible to do a real comprehensive comparison since there's no hard data on the debuffs yet, which *do* and *should* factor into how well the heals work for each class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I mentioned the fact that debuffs needed to be accounted for in the thread at Station.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not sure i follow the logic and i think you are stuck in EQ1 mindsets. To me, seems like wards, regens and reactives should be considered sperate from other priests spells/abilities. <br />
<br />
If not, and balance of priests prime damage prevention skill is tied in with other abilities like debuffs, then you become dependent on that ability always functioning in optimal circumstances.<br />
<br />
We saw how this reasoning ended up with the malo/turgurs farce of GoD in EQ1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Darjeeling is absolutely right.<br />
<br />
I see it like this: all priests have direct heals. Then we have specialty healing (Wards / Regens/ Reactives), *then* we have additional specialties on top of that that help us reduce how much someone needs to be healed (Clerics - HP/AC buffs, Shaman Stat buffs/Debuffs, Druids - Extra DPS). Balance our Wards against other specialty heals. Leave buffing/debuffing out of it.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree in principle, but Slow is such a potentially godly debuff it almost falls into a catagory by itself.<br />
<br />
There isn't any other debuff in the game with such a direct impact on mob DPS.<br />
<br />
I most certainly think that while our Wards should be balanced against Slow, the other Priests specialty heals should in turn be balanced against their specialty debuffs.  Power useage is also part of this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I agree in principle, but Slow is such a potentially godly debuff it almost falls into a catagory by itself.<br />
<br />

<br />
Sorry, this seems to me like EQ1 thinking again. At lvl 22 i'm not even convinced wailing haze is worth casting over delusion. I suspect other debuffs may turn out to be even more valuable, if they affect mobs special attacks. Just an inclination at this point though as i have no data.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If it seems like EQLive thinking, it's probably because that truth holds up, despite the fact that EQ2 is not EQLive.  Whether you want to admit it or not, slow is probably one of the most powerful spells you can cast, hands down, in any game you play.  Balance has to take this in to account, regardless of who casts the slow.<br />
<br />
Though your low level slow doesn't seem worth casting, at higher levels, it surely will be.  Even in EQLive, early versions of slow were near worthless.  But as the shaman/enchanter/beastlord leveled, that slow became more powerful and greatly affected the environment around him/her.<br />
<br />
I don't see a problem balancing slows against heals in EQ2.  It just needs to be done more intelligently than it was done in EQLive.<br />
<br />
As far as the post on wards goes, his logic seemed on spot and it was further reinforced by the example he gave.  He definitely has a valid point.  HoTs and reactive heals account for tank mitigation, wards do not.  It seems to me, and I'm echoing a few of the posters, if you just make the ward heal after mitigation has taken place, problem solved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You have no data, and so no argument.<br />
<br />
Priests all get a whole bunch of other debuffs as well as mystic/defiler slows: AC, strength, stamina, agility, defense. Plus other impairments and buffs like reverse retro heals, cures, buffs, etc. Also, as has been pointed out, slow has no impact on special attacks, which is where most melee damage comes from. So how do you know one or more of these spells won't turn out to be gamebreakers? <br />
<br />
Personally, i sincerely doubt SOE will make the same mistake by implementing an overpowering slow as in EQ1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I would love to see some data on where &quot;most&quot; melee damage comes from.  While I agree that players do a great proportion of their melee damage with combat abilities, mobs seem to have a much more limited scope of abilities available to them.<br />
<br />
I said I had no data up front (at Station) and that the data should probably be collected.  By the same token, you have no data to support your theory that most mob damage comes from combat abilities, and likewise, no arguement.<br />
<br />
You cannot dismiss my arguement as lacking proper foundation without dismissing your own as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok.. that table was taken from an EQ2 Companion parse on a Darkpaw Youth, one of the earliest mobs you encounter. (It also happens to be completely broken and formatted wrong.. arg!)<br />
<br />
Anyway, the data is relevant, and the main thing I'd like to point out is that this Darkpaw youth only used Wild Swing for his special attack, most mobs at level 20 use 3 or 4 in my experience.<br />
<br />
His DPS with &quot;Crushing&quot; attack.. the one that slow can land on. 0.92<br />
His DPS with &quot;Wild Swing&quot; special attack.. the one that slow doesn't affect. 1.13.<br />
<br />
And the difference is noticible with the human eye and gets worse as levels increase. I can't imagine that you actually believe otherwise if you PLAY the game.<br />
<br />
Maybe you just do tradeskills all day long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'd appreciate if we could keep the discussion focused.  The cheap personal crap needs to be left in the other room.<br />
<br />
What you did not include is whether this was a trivial mob or not to the person who parsed the data.  Parsing the damage from a L11 gnoll by a L20 Shaman is not relevant data.  SOE balances against even con mobs.  I don't know what you have there because you didn't include it.<br />
<br />
Look, you probably don't know me from a brick in the wall, so let me give you a little background.<br />
<br />
I was one of the people when, during the &quot;dark&quot; days for Shaman in EQLive, was working with community to get things &quot;fixed&quot;.  I was all about the numbers, their relevance and where they should be.  I served as the SOE Class Correspondent for the Shaman class.<br />
<br />
I know what it takes to make a case to the Devs.  Believe me, we don't have NEARLY enough relevant data yet to make the case.<br />
<br />
YES.  There is probably a significant problem with wards!  I can &quot;feel&quot; that problem, my instincts tell me it's there.  However, we cannot demonstrate that problem yet because we don't have the data.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'd appreciate if we could keep the discussion focused. The cheap personal crap needs to be left in the other room.<br />
<br />
My apologies. I didn’t mean that as a stab so much as a “How can you act like there’s NO problem at all, just because someone hasn’t parsed for 4 hours”… the problem is evident, to the naked eye. I agree. I also agree that to a Dev, there’s NO problem until hard numbers are brought to the discussion. I take it back though, let’s start over. :)<br />
<br />
What you did not include is whether this was a trivial mob or not to the person who parsed the data. Parsing the damage from a L11 gnoll by a L20 Shaman is not relevant data. SOE balances against even con mobs. I don't know what you have there because you didn't include it.<br />
<br />
That parse was taken by a Conjuror using Tellurian Soldier, Adept 3 (Level 24 Pet)<br />
<br />
The pet is a single DOWN arrow mob, and was probably level 24 at the time that parse was taken. Darkpaw Youths are somewhere in the neighborhood of level 13-14. So, while there’s quite a difference in level between the two mobs, there’s also some other things to take into consideration. The Darkpaw Youth is NOT a down ^ mob. When you /con the pet it will say “This thing looks like a wuss, and it’s probably weaker than it looks.”<br />
<br />
But I wasn’t posting that to show how hard or soft a level 13 Gnoll hits against a level 24 pet. I was showing that regardless of the level difference, the mobs put out more damage with their special attacks than they do with their regular attacks. (I noticed this at level 15 myself.)<br />
<br />
Look, you probably don't know me from a brick in the wall, so let me give you a little background.<br />
<br />

<br />
Kudos and thanks for the Shaman class. (I actually stopped playing my EQ1 Shaman when Kunark was released and sold my account, then came back as a Necromancer when Velious was released.)<br />
<br />
I know what it takes to make a case to the Devs. Believe me, we don't have NEARLY enough relevant data yet to make the case.<br />
<br />
I didn’t read anything in the thread here that indicated that you cared, or that you were advocating making a case for this problem. Do you still advocate change for the Shaman class? Or are you retired from that line of work?<br />
<br />
YES. There is probably a significant problem with wards! I can &quot;feel&quot; that problem, my instincts tell me it's there. However, we cannot demonstrate that problem yet because we don't have the data.<br />
<br />
Then we’re more on the same page than I had at first guessed.<br />
<br />
One of my guild mates wrote a crude parser (No pretty bar charts in his heheh) I’ll get some parses of Slowed mobs versus unslowed for you over the next week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Lolanon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">ballance wise I would say wards are a little underpowered for where they fit in, should scale up on damage absorbsion a little more. But as a whole I would say a defiler (evil shaman) is a fairly good healer. And honestly my favorite pairing is with an Inquisitor. Debuffs are the biggest key factor for defilers. A double slowed mob with wis/int/str debuff and curse of sheilding means that mob is going to be weak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">At level 26 my Conjuror will get an AE nuke that does damage, and more importantly prevents NPC's from using spells and special attacks.<br />
<br />
I'm starting to feel that my Conjuror will be the Shaman of EQ2. They will prevent FAR more damage if my hunch is right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Glad to see we're gonna work toward the same thing.<br />
<br />
Now, one of the reasons I asked about the level differences is that we need to find out about the &quot;to hit&quot; rolls on normal melee vs Combat Abilities.  In other words, is it possible that a Combat Ability is more likely to hit when level differences are great?  That could skew the data to make it look as if the Combat Abilities are producing a greater portion of the damage than they really are.  Again, I don't KNOW the answer, I'm merely asking the question and pointing out the possibility.  The game is awful new and the &quot;real&quot; information is pretty hard to find.<br />
<br />
If we want to start finding answers, the first thing we have to do is make sure we use the same &quot;measuring stick&quot; that SOE will be using.  Unless something has changed, SOE balances against even con mobs, so our data should stay as close to that as possible.  I realize it won't be possible in all cases, we can't sit there and spawn even con mobs over and over to test like SOE can.<br />
<br />
I am still very interested in seeing Shaman getting a fair shake in the world.  I don't want them to be second rate healers.  They are Priests.  They should be able to do a job that is, in the end, equal to any of the other Priests.  Moreover, they shouldn't have to work twice as hard as any other Priest to do so, nor should they have to work only half as hard.<br />
<br />
Hopefully Gloriana will get us some added forums here for EQ 2 so we can start to organize, collect and analyze data.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem I have with this statement is that it has already assumed two Priests in the group.  I really don't think that's a fair assumption.  I don't &quot;think&quot; that it was intended a group need two Priests to succeed.  I could be wrong.  I haven't been able to locate any direct, official response.<br />
<br />
However, I really, strongly feel that any single Priest should be more than capable of keeping his group alive without the assistance of another Priest and without having huge downtime after every fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Watch for the nerf bat on that one.  EQLive players (Paladins I think?) had a Silence spell that was VERY quickly removed as it grossly changed game balance and trivialized many encounters.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. I expect them to handle spells in EQ 2 similar to how they handle gear -- level ranges. This will enable them to give people cool abilities at a lowish level without unbalancing the high end game.</div></div><hr />
