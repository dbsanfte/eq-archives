<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Came back from lunch today &amp; got the annoying &quot;This web page has been blocked by (deleted's) corporate acceptable use web policy&quot;<br />
<br />
No more daytime browsing for me :(<br />
<br />
Taladaen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That happened to me a while back, but I called my boss out on it. I told him if he was going to block my access then the company would have to restrict access to ALL non business related sites on the internet for EVERYONE else in the company, otherwise they'd be discriminating against me and my &quot;one little site&quot;. Rather than basing my argument on the site itself, I based it on the site being &quot;business related&quot; or not, and the issue of fairness when preventing one person (me) from visiting a &quot;non business related site&quot; vs everyone else still being able to.<br />
<br />
HR agreed. They removed the site from the blocked list.<br />
<br />
Truth be told I didn't have a leg to stand on legally (my wife is in HR and knows this stuff backwards and forwards). Our HR department just doesn't have any &quot;low swingin' brass&quot; and doesn' t like conflict. Basically I called them on their bluff. My wife got a kick out of it actually. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Our corporate policy clearly mentions all game related sites, that's a no go.   I'll just accept the block &amp; be glad I wasn't given a &quot;councilling&quot;   :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rikkardo Montalban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, I consider my EQ-playing at work to be &quot;Network Monitoring&quot;  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">They havent blocked The Crucible yet, but they blocked all ezboard boards at my job... found a proxy server that allows me to get through.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heh, I can reach the Crucible fine, but safeproxy.org is blocked here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I can go anywhere I want since we have no internet policy excpet stay away from porn :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Laramil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I work for the government and have wondered sometimes why this site hasn't been blocked from our worksite computers.  Almost all other EQ sites have been blocked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Glencannon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">www.sony.everquest.com, or any variation thereof, is blocked at my place of employment (Fortune 100 company).<br />
<br />
So are:<br />
<br />
www.gamespot.com<br />
www.playboy.com (duh)<br />
www.ezboard.com<br />
and the fantasy football site at www.yahoo.com ($^*@$%@^&amp;!!!)<br />
<br />
They are debating about blocking:<br />
<br />
www.espn.com (though I shudder to think of the revolt that would cause)<br />
<br />
<br />
Most of the folks in my company use the 'Net for legitmate research, and for personal use.  Our Handbook says we can use it for personal use, as long as we do not abuse the privelage.  It does not define &quot;abuse&quot;.</div></div><hr />
