<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Icebreaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Lately I have been finding myself solo'ing early in the morning, and if I do find a group it takes 30 minutes to fill it out, worse if it is a LDON. What I was wondering is this: What would be the best 2 classes to level up if I wanted to (successfully) trio LDONs with my shaman? <br />
<br />
The only restrictions would be not more than one mele since I would be running 3 accounts on 2 systems. Gear would be bazaar gear, and later on LDON gear. I would probably try and grind out 20 or 30 aa for each additional character, and by the time I got them both leveled the shaman should be upgraded a bit and have over a hundred aa's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fallonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have a very similar setup, three accounts on two computers and just started doing trio LDoNs.<br />
<br />
I have a good survivable trio but not a good DPS trio and so am currently 50/50 on eight collection missions in EC so far.  I have a 65 shammy, 65 druid, and working on a 59 pally.<br />
<br />
As you can see, all priest classes (must say something about me :-)  Druid is nice for snare, nukes, and evac.  From my understanding, a SK would be somewhat more DPS and better in this situation.<br />
<br />
Interestingly enough, it was easier when my pally was level 58 as the group average was just under 63 and one level LDoN easier (but of course less points).  It was easier because my pally's pacify would work most of the time (lots of MOBs must have been level 55) but now MOBs are mainly level 58-60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Shaman <br />
SK - tank, snare, FD pulls, taps to self heal<br />
wizard/mage for dps and easy to box</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Mage over Wizard for pet toys in the above trio, SK and Shaman both get pets who would benefit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>malden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Shaman <br />

<br />
That sounds like a great trio to me. I would probably lean towards the mage for the free pet toys and summoned items and constant DPS of pet.<br />
<br />
My current trio, is shaman, monk, cleric. I've only tried a few EC runs and have come close (within a few minutes) to winning but I haven't really maxed out my DPS potentional. Neither shaman or Cleric had KEI which would have really helped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Furree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i've done a few trio ldon's with Rng / Shm / SK. It works but it's really not nearly the fun it seems it would be. 3 boxing keeps you busy enough when you aren't watching a timer.<br />
<br />
i suggest that you level up a trio that works together but focus on the classes that seem to hold up getting your ldon groups together. if you had shm / dru / sk for example, you'd simply need to find 3 dps classes and you'd have a full group. you also may want to consider a trio that can do things other than ldon since you will tire of that. i love my trio but admittedly there are situations where without a cleric i'm limited.<br />
<br />
that way you could trio it if you really wanted to and you could very easily get a group together as well. if you do decide to trio understand that you will fail missions somewhat regularly. the myth about mobs having fewer hp's with a 3-man group is a truly a myth as far as i can tell. your best bet will be collections but even there if you get bad distribution of drops you can get screwed. if you're one of those folks that watches their ldon ranking and really cares about it , i don't suggest doing this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
*nods* I definately don't have a true optimal group for trio'ing LDoNs but I can do alot of other things with my group. It's nice to go 3 box in Halls of Honor.<br />
<br />

<br />
This is most definitely a myth from my experiences. And I second the getting screwed by bad drops on a collect.<br />
<br />
One side note on trio'ing LDoNs. Healers can make it tough. Having a cleric mob complete heal itself 3 or so times really slows down the kill time. Being able to interrupt them is important. I usually load up at least 2 stuns and a nuke on my cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kanudil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I trio a war/shm/monk...Of course it's a bit easier for me as the war and I are both up to txevu atm, my pick would be war/shm and then a wiz/mage although ap ally would be nice as well in the war slot due to group heals + stuns. You can do a lot more things with a war than people realize though, unless of course soon pallies will cry some more and end up better tanks than wars are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">if your going for normals shaman healing via Regen, and HOT is usually sufficient.<br />
<br />
I'd probably recommend recommend sticking with mostly pet classes.<br />
Bst, Shm, Necro<br />
Bst, Shm, Chanter<br />
Mage, Shm, Necro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The thing to remember with trio is that you dont have the other 3 folks to contribute to damage... yes yes yes I know this is painfully obvious but think about this for a second.  Throw a Wiz into a normal group and they get to boom once per mob for 4k-6k damage.  This is their only source of damage so they are running even on mana with one boom per mob.  Now turn that to needing them to pull the weight of the other classes you should have there and they are going to be running OOM a lot.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest: Sham, Mage, SK.  <br />
<br />
For a lot of the same reasons folks already said.  The mage pet is constant sick damage.  They can give your puppy and the SK pet weapons and gear to increase their potential (you are looking to maximize the damage each person does).  <br />
<br />
Mages can also throw out a DS on the SK.  Go with an Ogre SK and you can get the Cultural in the Baz for a reasonable price and dont worry about the Stuns to lose agro.  We have clocked the druid DS at roughly 30-45dps on normals w/o slowing the mobs.  This is on a SK with 2k AC when we were about to swap to doing Hards though.  So with 2kAC the SK was damn near never getting hit... get hit more= more DS damage but also more healing on your part.  Work the numbers a few times and figure out what works for you.<br />
<br />
I think it's a pretty simple plan to go with the Mage and SK but that is just me.  I could certainly see the Necro working very well due to their ability to lay down some serious damage on long living mobs (long living due to missing half the group ;) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>AtommWarbird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I 4box normal LDoN's:  PAL/SHM/MAG/ENC.  I found the ENC crowd control is pretty much necessary in many of the themes, Tak and Guk specifically.<br />
<br />
SHM heals fine, and with the MAG for DPS I can finish just about any collect mission with 10-15 min to spare.</div></div><hr />

<br />
boxing with 4 and 3 are different things. there are several folks in my guild who have a 90% success rate boxing 4 but the question is about a trio. those of use that have trio'd them do not have a success rate nearly as high.<br />
<br />
as regards crowd control , an sk can pet pull singles in all of the themes. if you use a pal / war as a tank CC will be an issue in tak and guk, i agree. also since the group will have a shaman , taking two mobs at a time will be trivial.<br />
<br />
EDIT<br />
<br />
btw, if you plan to use an sk to get single pulls i highly recommend investing the 6 aa in pet disc. it will save you SO much time , and time is everything when multiboxing an ldon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Icebreaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Judging from the posts so far, it looks like I will definantly be waiting for a few guildies to log on until I get my crew into better than bazaar gear  :)  From what everyone is saying I am thinking necro or mage for the dps slot, and then rng/knight/bst for the tank slot perhaps. I will probably end up trying SolRo with the &quot;team&quot; as well later on, but LDONs will be my practice / equipping grounds unless someone has different advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Wudoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Run with Shaman/Mage/Ranger all the time.  Shaman for pulling, CC and heals.  Mage with pet tanking and dps (also CC/Charm in Tak).  Ranger for snares, dps and track.  Not sure how easy these classes would be to box together but it is a very effective trio.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>nojno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I 2-box mage/shammy and my friend has a cleric(all mid-50's), so we do trio ldon's with those classes.  It works reasonably well, but we only do low 20 collects and normals.  I'm not the most proficient 2 boxer so we try not to push it.<br />
<br />
Things I wish we had are evaccing and crowd control.  As far as mind buffs, we just grab kei ahead of time.<br />
<br />
It's more fun with a small dependable group, imo, so we may stay with this setup for awhile.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">On this same topic, how do you think RNG+DRU+SHM would work for an ldon trio?  I 2-box SHM+DRU and my friend plays a ranger.  I've been hinting that it might be entertaining to give it a shot.  It would probably be shaman pulls + heals + tanks.  Ranger CC and archery dps.  Druid dps + emergency healing + evacs.<br />
<br />
Ranger is geared comparably to me (magelo in sig), with the druid being an alt, thus undergeared.  Anyone want to rate our odds and suggest a theme?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">My friends and I are on a ldon kick these past few weeks.  We are working on getting the HP +40 augs.  Our base configuration is:<br />
<br />
RNG ( Time Geared ) ( Tank / Puller )<br />
SHM ( Time Geared ) ( Slower, MH, CC )[ Me ] <br />
ROG ( 64/Alt ) ( DPS )[ Me ] <br />
<br />
The other slots are open to whoever we get.  I usually have no issues with boxing, slowing, and healing in normal ldons.  The AE slow helps out alot, and I use it all the time now.<br />
<br />
We always try to get a full group, and I would say we average about 25 minutes overall since we started doing ldons again.  Either the RNG or myself look for groups, and we try to look for DPS if we can.<br />
<br />
There is no issues really with your configuration, but I would not settle with just the three of you.  Look for more.  You will kill faster, and you will end up doing more adventures over time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Serj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Attempted this for the first time last night.  Trio'd 3 Ruj adventures with a 61 mage, 65 shaman (me), and a 65 rogue (boxxed by me).<br />
<br />
Went very smooth and one was finished in about 30-40 minutes.<br />
<br />
Pull with slow, let rogue take aggro and pull another.<br />
<br />
There were times when 3-5 mobs were in camp, but they weren't hard to handle.  HoT, regen and the very rare Tnarg's was enough to keep everyone alive.</div></div><hr />

Monk (some ele rot gear), <br />
Enchanter (some ele rot gear)<br />
<br />
Monk pulls and tanks uses FD/Pacify to get singles or doubles.  <br />
Chanter uses shiney bob pet and nukes- can't charm when 3 boxing.  <br />
Shaman does all the usual shaman things, dot, hot, pet, nuke etc.  <br />
<br />
66% success rate, and when I do fail, it's by 1 mob or item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Zann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Is 3 the minimum on a LDon? or could this be done with 2?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Budana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Is 3 the minimum on a LDon? or could this be done with 2?<br />
<br />
The minimum is 3 for a Ldon.  I believe the mage is great for a Ldon trio.  Stick to North Ro a mage there can do CC and has a cheap mana to damage spell destroy summoned.  Really worth checking into I did have a problem there with my earth pet up though.  It was disappearing on me with no warning on the first 3 mobs we fought.  Was really weird so I just summoned air pet and away we went.  I think the xp to effort is crap though and gave up on it.  You will spend 30 mins longer doing a 3-person group, which is about the time you need to fill 3 spots.  If you get an elemental or better group you finish most normal Ldons in 30 mins or so.  But like you said its sometimes nice just to go.  Best of luck with whichever you pick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">3 person minimum.<br />
<br />
On the &quot;low collects&quot; comment above - keep in mind that those can burn you.  The lower number of pieces you have to collect, the fewer mobs in the dungeon actually have it.  So you could potentially need to kill more mobs to complete a low collect than a high collect.<br />
<br />
Most of the times I've lost on collect has been on 23 or less to get.  25 - 26 seems optimal in my experience of 200+ adventures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>nojno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I was not aware of that, sudedor...hmm...I'm not a math/statistics expert so I'm not gonna bother crunching the numbers or do the probability crap, but I'll definitely mention that to my partner next time and we may go ahead and try a high 20's collect to see how that goes.  It will definitely cut down on the waiting time if we don't have to worry about getting a low collect.  Thanks!<br />
<br />
Nojno</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Furree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">i would second what sudedor is saying. low collects , 20 - 23 are a nightmare. i've also found that mobs situated most closely to the zone in (as the crow flies , not in terms of patching) seems to have a higher probability of having drops so use your map and clear all areas around the zone in even if they are dead ends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Sudedor is correct on the collect missions.  Being a statistics person myself, it is explained by a couple of factors.  If you want safety (ie: more even distribution of collect items) the higher # is better.  If you want a chance that you can get lucky on the distribution the lower # is better.  And I agree 100% that somewhere in the middle is the best of both worlds.  But, I wouldn't sweat it too much since the collects were fixed a while ago.  Before that you were taking a huge risk with a low collect.<br />
<br />
Purdy<br />
<br />
PS: Furree is not correct above about the distribution of collect items.  The developers have actually (for once) stated that the distribution is randomly generated as is mob placement under any LDON scenario (which means different levels or differing # of people).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>nojno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">wow wow wow..lol...I was gonna just take sudedor's word(200+!!) on it...but since a statistics person echoed his comments...I'm definitely going for a higher collect next time just for kicks!  <br />
<br />
but I definitely don't think the low collects are a nightmare...so far we've done pretty well with them(finish most with 20-30 mins spare)..but it's possible that, as purdy stated, we might have gotten lucky or got an &quot;even&quot; distribution...<br />
