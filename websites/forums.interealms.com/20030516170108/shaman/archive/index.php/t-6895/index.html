thats my gear, any suggestions of which slots need to be replaced would be helpful, i have a jbb waiting too, and the ac is a little screwy on my profile as is the hp, not sure why i have something like 702ac and 840ish hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The reason why your ac/hp isnt showing correctly is that you have the version of the wedding rings with no stats in your profile, go back and put them in again and make use of the little eye icon next to the drop down menu to make sure you get the ones with stats selected.<br />
<br />
Your gear is fine until you get to the level where you can aquire Velious quest armours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If your 32, then you are close to having your REIF start processing at 35. If you want to do some melee, I'd suggest grabbing a cheap haste item.<br />
<br />
The 19 delay on the REIF, a Haste item (FBSS,SCHW), your best Haste spell, and a DEX buff will really make that 81dd fire on the REIF.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Face - Crystal Spider Eyes, Enshrouded Veil, Death Mask of the Elysians (from worst to best, imo)<br />
Ears - Black Sapphire Electrum Earrings, Earring of Solstice, and there are a few others similar to the BS elec, but have effects, can't remember names...Twisted Leaves?<br />
Shoulders - Imbued Granite Spaulders, Obulous Death Shroud<br />
Neck - Shrouded Medallion (I think that's the name, Clattering Bone Necklace, Crystal Chitin Torque (the mana pres 3 thing, if you can't find an ODS for shoulders)<br />
Wrist - Barbed Rubicite<br />
Hands - Swapping CC out for Coldain Skin or Shissar would give a good bit of hp (esp. the coldain), but at an AC loss, so you gotta weigh it<br />
Fingers - Replace one with a Shadel Bandit Ring<br />
Back - Lodi shell, Heirophant's<br />
Head - 3 ac makes baby jesus cry, but I'm not sure what to replace it with<br />
<br />
Hehe....that's a lot of plat right there.  Thurg quest armor if you can swing it.  I'm assuming some good resources.  :p<br />
<br />
Actually, a problem with my advice is that I said what I would wear (or do wear in most cases)...and almost all my wis gear is from velious quests (kael/thurg armor, talis of benevolence), so you would probably have like 120 wis or something if you put this crap on and didn't upgrade the other slots. :D</div></div><hr />
