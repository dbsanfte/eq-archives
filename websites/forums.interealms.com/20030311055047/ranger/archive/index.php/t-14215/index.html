<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Akelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sometimes down a winding path<br />
you'll notice a familiar footprint where<br />
 in your travels other signs may augur;<br />
other scents upon the smoky air...<br />
And you may wonder if he's close beside you<br />
then turn, <br />
   and find the branches swaying <br />
as some traveler or other <br />
marks his path through deeper cover<br />
see a flash of one you once knew<br />
or think it was, <br />
 at least,<br />
  was someone there?...<br />
<br />
Other boon companions hunting with you<br />
may chortle at the mention of a name.<br />
that once shared laughter in this very dungeon<br />
and bring back memories you shared the same.<br />
And from a deep place you'd forgotten<br />
there comes a smile for something past<br />
a silliness with little meaning<br />
save to warm a heart at last.<br />
<br />
True distance is the hearts forgotten,<br />
no road as long as reverie.<br />
A true friend is not far no matter<br />
where his feet may find him now to be.<br />
for caring sets the stars above to shining;<br />
shows us best we are where we belong.<br />
Laughter warms us when we remember<br />
the best times<br />
  full of skill and daring<br />
adventures wild, and dangers<br />
sharing,<br />
all of this and more <br />
our hearts know how to store<br />
and bring it back to us when nights are long.<br />
<br />
So we go, and the places we remember<br />
are filled with those we love <br />
     and something more<br />
We travel them again and smile to see there<br />
the shining grin of those who've gone before.<br />
Sometimes, as you sit beside your campfire, <br />
talking out with others the day's end.<br />
You'll hear a voice ask, did he just pass by here?<br />
I thought I heard him,<br />
 Never mind.<br />
  I was only looking for a friend.<br />
<br />
<br />
/mourn a brother ranger...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>LatemYvaeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">May everyone who knew him take comfort in the kindness and character he showed.<br />
May his family's grief be comforted by the thought of him.<br />
May his spirit blaze a path to heaven through the darkness that others may follow.<br />
<br />
Mourn the passing of a ranger.</div></div><hr />
