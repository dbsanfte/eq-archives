<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shamphibian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been trying a shaman char again. I got my original barbarian shaman to 52 then got kind of involved into my ranger and sacrificed my shaman to twink the ranger. <br />
<br />
I decided to make a frog with LoY and being I am not hot on war, pally, cleric, or wiz I decided to make a shaman. I am at 30 and so far I am way loving it again. Don't know why but I have the fire to play my shaman now. <br />
<br />
So, I will be around to ask questions and such to get to know the shaman class again.<br />

Now THAT'S funny.  How much did your &quot;groupability&quot; go up with that ranger vs the shaman? :eek:<br />
<br />
Seriously though - stick with it - you're gonna really like it a lot as you pass by level 52 (wasn't that as far as Faern made it? ;) ) again.<br />
