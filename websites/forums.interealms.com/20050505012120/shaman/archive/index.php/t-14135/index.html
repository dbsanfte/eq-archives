<br />
What is the softcap in AC for a shaman, meaning when should I stop searching if ever stop searching for AC gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">10,000.  Or maybe a bit less.<br />
<br />
Seriously, the prevailing opinion that I've read is that the softcap is different for every mob, perhaps based on the mob's ATK value.  An AC of 1200 or so is probably near the cap for most old world mobs, but POP mobs are tougher and who knows what the cap would be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gabus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There is alot of discussion about this on the warrior boards, and the general consencus is that 1200 for old world and kunark is the softcap. Meaning that you get diminishing returns on your AC investment after breaking 1200.<br />
<br />
PoP no one really has come up with a difinitive softcap yet. I do know that when my pally is getting his butt handed to him at 1200 AC and I slap a couple AC buffs on him, and break out the shield and cross the 1300 mark, I really do see a difference in the damage. Both the number of hits, and the dmg taken on those hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Softcap is a misnomer.<br />
<br />
There is no point at which AC stops having a function, but there is a point of diminishing returns.  That point seems to be where your AC meets the mobs ATK value.  This varies from mob to mob, but is relatively consistant within regions.  The average ATK value for NPCs has increased with each expansion, so (for example) an 800 ac may get you to the point on most mobs in kunark, vs 1000 in velious, or 1200 in luclin, etc.<br />

/boggle Monks and Warriors getting math intensive?  You mean like COUNTING?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Warriors actually go to more depth trying to calculate the importance of ac, yes. BUT...we are not warriors, our point of diminishing returns is much lower. <br />
<br />
After 13 bil-yun threads on this topic here, the majority agree that after 1000ac unbuffed you work more towards hp&gt;wis/mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Shamen are a melee class.<br />
<br />
We don't need mana or wisdom, we tank in teh face!<br />
<br />
We need good AC/HP and a good weapon.<br />
<br />
Any shaman with more than 150 Wisdom is a dr00d and needs to be shot, I'm afraid...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have a raid buffed AC of 1710 and was worried about hitting the softcap if one exists in PoP.<br />
<br />
I spoke with a warrior in my guild at length about the idea of a pop softcap - with an ac of around 2k he *still* sees a difference when he groups with a bard playing AC song - so estimates going around are that it might be in the 2200-2300 range (or who knows might be higher).<br />
<br />
His opinion is backed up by tests run, here's just 1 example:<br />
Last round of AC tests for me are in (http://steelwarrior.xwarzone.com/showthread.php?threadid=145) <br />
Same mob - Level 65 A Sentry of Ro, Sol Ro zone in.<br />
<br />
1694 AC (Unbuffed) = 329.4 Average &quot;hit&quot;<br />
1815 AC (Unbuffed) = 311.7 Average &quot;hit&quot;<br />
1917 AC (Unbuffed) = 295.0 Average &quot;hit&quot;<br />
2112 AC ( Buffed ) = 288.6 Average &quot;hit&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Just for reference:<br />
1694 AC = 666 hits, 219374 total damage from hits<br />
1815 AC = 813 hits, 253380 total damage from hits<br />
1917 AC = 507 hits, 149544 total damage from hits<br />
2112 AC = 752 hits, 217004 total damage from hits<br />
 <br />
<br />
Alot of the argument for AC &quot;caps&quot; really depends on the mobs that you're fighting (within a given expansion).  If you're tanking mobs in Plane of Disease, then you might not see much of a difference between 1500 and 1700 AC - whereas if you're tanking Plane of Fire castle mobs, you will.<br />
<br />
Shaman soft-cap is probably lower than pure melee but I dont think its anything that we need to worry about hitting anytime soon - speculation for sure but I've yet to see much evidence to the contrary.<br />
<br />
Anyways to summarize in basic speakage - it all depends what you're fighting.  Generally for the hardest mobs that you can xp on in groups or solo, or for raid trash that we as shamans can actually tank (with healers/without) - we are nowhere close to the point where AC will cease to make a difference.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/agree<br />
<br />
I play a warrior on one of my other boxes, so, I also tend to browse the warrior boards on a fairly regular basis.  Everything that I have read on there (and experienced in-game) points to the AC &quot;cap&quot; being relative to a mob's ATK.  In theory, once your AC goes above a mob's ATK, you start seeing reduced value for any additional AC.  (ie: If the mob's ATK is only 1500, the difference between you having an AC of 1500 vs 1700 is minimal).<br />

<br />
Especially about this:<br />
<br />

<br />
I realise many more samples are needed before a more definative answer can be made.<br />
<br />
From looking at this information I would say that sure average hit seems to follow a pattern that can be predicted, making more AC more promising to the individual investing in it.<br />
<br />
But the &quot;Just for Reference&quot; part shows that a warrior with 1694 AC took virtually the same damage as a warrior with 2112 AC.<br />
<br />
Is there TRUELY a Random factor that no matter how much AC you have it still does not determine how many times in a fight you get hit.  Sure positioning plays a factor in many respects.<br />
<br />
But at this point I am going to go off on a limb and say that more HP at higher levels or even hp regen equipment.  Is more valuable and more of a noticable pay back when being slapped around by various exp mobs.***  Perhaps problably not so much when considering boss mobs thou...  But lets face it in a boss mob encounter if you really don't want to worry whether your AC will help against the boss mob's large amount of hit damage it can generate then just watch what you cast and when.<br />
<br />
***Hell, lets face it even developers ment after the highest AC in PoP could be achieved the next step was hp or attack increase hence many of the Plane of Time gear having Aura or Vengence something or other.<br />
<br />
Your thoughts?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Look closer.  The warrior with 2112 AC gets hit 752 times for that damage, as opposed to 666 hits doing roughly the same at 1694 AC.<br />
<br />
1694 AC = 666 hits, 219374 total damage from hits<br />
1815 AC = 813 hits, 253380 total damage from hits<br />
1917 AC = 507 hits, 149544 total damage from hits<br />
2112 AC = 752 hits, 217004 total damage from hits<br />
<br />
Average hit at 2112AC = 289.<br />
Average hit at 1694AC = 329.<br />
<br />
But lets face it in a boss mob encounter if you really don't want to worry whether your AC will help against the boss mob's large amount of hit damage it can generate then just watch what you cast and when.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh hell yes I couldn't agree more.  We shouldn't be running around trying to tank Fennin.  <br />
<br />
But the lack of a noticeable AC softcap means for some of us, that on a day-to-day basis, more AC = less damage that we're taking on raids and xp groups, and there is no *realistically attainable* cap with the equipment that exists atm.</div></div><hr />
