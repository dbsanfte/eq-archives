<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">and they have an awesome way of presenting the different AAs at <br />
http://www.graffe.com/?body=aaguide  <br />
<br />
Wonder if we can get something like this for our site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Peroxide</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I wonder who rated those?  Was it based off of 1 persons opinion on each ability or was it discussed amongst all the wizards on that webpage?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The way Graffe's does it is fine as a reference, but it's not so good as a tutorial or textbook on wizard AA's.  Basically, if you already know the AA's and just need to look up the details on how, say, Harvest of Druzzil works, then Graffe's way works fine.  But it's no substitute for a different list, say sorted by their little five-star rating, to tell you which one is considered more important to go for NEXT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dogpoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hehe,thats because there isnt much deciding needed for wizzy AA`s.<br />
I picked up shaman after being a wizard for the first 3-4 years of my eq career and I gotta say theyre nearly completely 1-dimensional.<br />
<br />
Even though shammies are getting crapped upon now,they should be happy they have hard choices to make about AA and stuff-could be worse lol,you could be 1-D and not even need to choose</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wizard may be 1-D but they are still strong and needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, they may be 1D, but I was trying to select AA's for my new 65 wizard alt (friend left the game) and I didn't know about Harvest of Druzzill at all, much less whether SCM or SCF was better.  I did find the info I needed eventually, though.</div></div><hr />
