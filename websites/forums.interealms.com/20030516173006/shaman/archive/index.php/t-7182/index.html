<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild does arena a decent amount, and I attend a lot.  I've seen one piece of chain drop, boots or something.<br />
<br />
Is there a place with a higher frequency of chain drops than the arena or something?  Seen 3 plate legs, other assorted plate, a good amount of silk (no legs or robe though) and a good bit of leather.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fonzerelli SZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You must sacrifice a ranger to the chain gods. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hail,<br />
<br />
I've been on over 30 large-scale raids in Kael.  My sole goal for all of them was to get the chain legs.  I think you'd have a much better chance with a single SOLID group taking half the Arena to farm armor during off-peak times on your server.  Expect to get only a few drops of any class per multiple hour session.<br />
<br />
The Arena is the best area in my experience for Chain drops.<br />
<br />
Eventually I won the Gladiator Chain Leggings, which I'm happy enough with for now.  Finally replaced my Kromriff Military Leggings!  I don't plan on going back to Kael unless called upon to do so by my guild, or we finally become Vindi capable (which we aren't).<br />
<br />
Oh, I also won the chain gloves, which are sitting in the bank STILL, since I bought Coldain Skin gloves soon afterwards.<br />
<br />
Good luck,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aye, I have chain sleeves which I don't use - I have giant sleeves instead, more hp, more ac.<br />
<br />
I got mine by having a small group soloing the giants in front of Tormax's castle. We also had a plate bp drop, and plate boots, cloth wrist item...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kaneras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would just forget the Arena, too many troopers and guards and low-level junk.  Head to the Tormax bridge and kill Dlammaz Stormslayer, you'll need 2 strong groups for this with a good chanter for tash and a good slower.  At least one monk is mandatory, 2 is better or use a SK if you can get one.  Dlammaz hits for 500 and has 100k hit points, he's a bad ass and if you don't slow him it's over.<br />
<br />
Behind the spot where Dlammaz spawns, you will find &quot;Sentinels&quot;, which con red or yellow to level 60 and aren't as hard as their con indicates.   They drop armor in droves, sometimes 2 peices at a time, just keep pulling these and you will be amazed at how much armor drops, including tunics and leggings.  The trick is to get the spawns broken and pull giants constantly.  The less giants your monks have to split the faster you will kill.  This spot is a riot to hunt by the way, one of my favorite places in EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Last time we tried tormax area, our monks had A LOT of trouble pulling.  One of which is the best puller I've ever seen (though he's on a 54 monk now instead of a 60, was 52 at the time of tormax pulling though, so that may've contributed to it), and the other is pretty good too (though also non-60, he's 56).<br />
<br />
And they're the two highest monkies in the guild, except the one who started a shaman to be his main.  &gt;_&lt;  So we'll probably have to wait a while for them to level up before we can do that area.<br />
<br />
Christ, I just used one of those three character faces.  Wth is wrong with me?  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We did the tormax bridge area with just six people - a 60 monk, two 60 shamans, 58 ranger, 56 druid, 58 wizard.<br />
<br />
We also had a cleric and a 60 enchanter who were farming faction and did drive by kei's and ageo in exchange for tagging all our kills. So it wasn't a true single group, but with all the faction tagging going on, at least we weren't being ks'd :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kaneras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The trick is...have your warrior pull with an arrow when he feels he can single a giant as they're walking back to their spawn spot after the monks feign death.<br />
<br />
If he gets a single pull, great.<br />
<br />
If he gets more than what your groups can handle, he dies and gets a rezz.  He will get much better at timing his arrow this way :).  And you won't have wipeouts.</div></div><hr />
