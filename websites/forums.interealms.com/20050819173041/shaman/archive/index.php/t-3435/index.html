<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bimaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is there any specific way to tell how much an item degrades if the wearer/user is not of the recommended level?<br />
<br />
I have a high level tailor alt and was wondering what penalty a player would take if they equipped the cultural armor (lvl 45) if they were not 45 yet.<br />
<br />
Anyone know? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Lesser AC only usually...the other stats stay full on most items.<br />
Only way to find out for sure is to try...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">All stats do degrade. I have one of the new cultral pieces on my 31 cleric and all the stats are lower then max (even though they all are still damn sweet). Decay is a direct factor of the difference between your level and required level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Verata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">at level 42, the 12 ac bracer degraded to 10 ac, no stat or hp loss.<br />
<br />
another person, using the 51 ac BP at level 38, the AC was 38, the sta 8 str 8 and hps 66.<br />
<br />
at level 24, it would probably be ... close to worthless</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Glaaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have zero knowledge from experiance, but over at eqtraders I saw figured like this...<br />
<br />
Gained AC = Rated AC( current level / recommended level)<br />
<br />
This worked out for the AC Verata posted for the bracer, but not the BP. BP ac should have been 46 accourding to this formula.<br />
<br />
12(38/45)=~10 Bracer<br />
51(38/45)=~46 BP<br />
<br />
Here is a link to the post I read.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tienen Crazywolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Not all items degrade if users do not meet level requirements, fungus patch vest for example, will return a your race/class/deity cannot use this item if you try to equip before 51, worked after i hit level though. So recommended can mean required in some cases.</div></div><hr />
