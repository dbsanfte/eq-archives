EverQuest Chat on November 24th at 6:00pm - 7:00pm pacific time. Melee System Enhancements!<br />
<br />
You've been asking for them and now we're ready to discuss them. We're taking a big departure from what many of you are used to when it comes to combat. With that in mind, here is a brief summary of these exciting enhancements to better help you target your questions to us during the live chat. Don't worry if you miss the chat, we'll post the logs on EverQuestLive.com <br />
<br />
Increase the contributions melee classes provide in a group setting <br />
<br />
Address the current deficit between the pure melee classes and other classes <br />
<br />
Add more depth and potential for skilled play to melee combat <br />
<br />
Provide a system that encourages attentiveness and decision-making skills, without focusing heavily on twitch gameplay<br />
<br />
Take advantage of an opponent's weakness. See an opening, strike home for the kill! <br />
<br />
Monks, Rogues and Warriors will gain the ability to recognize certain weaknesses in an opponent's defense. These &quot;Openings&quot; will be a variety of types and can occur based on several different situations during combat. Be quick though, an opening will not present itself for long. Strike quick with a new combat skill once your character recognizes an opening. These new combat skills are being designed just for this combat system revision. Using and maintaining these skills expends the character's Endurance (a new statistic, calculated from the character's basic stats). <br />
<br />
Here's a combat example:<br />
<br />
A warrior is serving as the tank for his group, standing in front of a goblin. While battling the goblin, the warrior makes an exceptional parry and is presented with an opening. An indicator appears with the &quot;opening icon&quot; and the word &quot;Parry&quot; next to it (this information also appears in the chat window). <br />
<br />
Now is his opportunity to strike back after the exceptional parry! Only certain combat skills can be used to react to a parry opening. Other types of openings will allow the use of other skills. Some skills may be usable in response to more than one type of opening. Also, your position in relation to the target can change the effectiveness of certain skills. <br />
<br />
In this case, our warrior knows that he can use one of three combat skills, each having some merit. One might stun the target, one might increase the hate generated by the warrior for a few rounds, and one might make it easier for everyone to hit the NPC. <br />
<br />
In this case, our warrior elects to try to stun the goblin. He presses the appropriate button and luck smiles upon him as he successfully executes the strike, leaving the goblin standing dumbly for a combat round. <br />
<br />
Increasing Your Endurance and Learning New Skills <br />
Increase Endurance by increasing attributes or by acquiring special items that directly increase your Endurance pool <br />
Find tomes or instructions manuals and take them to specific trainers to learn new skills <br />
Choose your skills from skill categories (such as Tactical) containing skills focused to a purpose <br />
Most openings are available only to a single character, but some are available to all nearby characters <br />
Disciplines will be transferred to this new system <br />
Existing Discipline timers will be reviewed, and several will probably be set to their own timer <br />
Disciplines will require an Endurance cost <br />
Hybrids will receive a limited Endurance pool for their disciplines<br />
<br />
There will be other changes as well. Keep your eyes on the Test server and our update messages for more details as we move forward. <br />
<br />
This new system is much more flexible than the existing disciplines. It will be relatively easy to add new combat skills, as well as new skills that are not limited to openings. This system creates the possibility for tremendous enhancement in the future, allowing groups a large number of options when it comes to melee combat. <br />
<br />
Talk to you in the Live Chat! <br />

<br />
Reading between the lines, Boar may be as much use as Acumen is hoped to be if they go down the latter route and base it off the stamina stat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just randomly wandered over here to read about quitting my day job as a warrior and becoming a shaman, and i see this, i had to smoke a cigarette  after reading it, it was that damn good.<br />
<br />
My only problem is, if its using that yellow bar thingy i got now, well i havent bought food in 50 lvls so its a bit empty, <br />
<br />
<br />
wahhhhh i dont wanna buy food</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">guess The endurance stat will be the sum of str and stam maybe? I can see it now /ooc looking for troll or ogre tank pst</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Skeeter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Unless they let the melee use spell gems (or a new window just like them), I see another big complaint fest coming.  My warrior has two pages filled with hotkeys used in regular grouping, it's tough enough to swap back and forth let alone adding more hotkeys for special attacks.<br />
Main bank:<br />
Attack (yes, you could map it, but it's more reliable for me to hotkey so if I'm blind I know exactly what to hit to turn off attack)<br />
Ranged attack<br />
Disarm<br />
Bash or Kick<br />
Shield slot*<br />
Taunt<br />
Inventory slot*<br />
/assist<br />
Defensive or Incoming message<br />
Raid attack or attack message<br />
*To swap out shield with enraging blow and second aggro weapon when dual wielding<br />
<br />
Then on a second page I have:<br />
AE Taunt<br />
AE Rampage<br />
MT Switch hotkey<br />
3 instaclick slots (when equipped, for dispelling mobs) plus 2 self buffs<br />
Bind wound (just in case)<br />
Beg (for mezd mobs)<br />
<br />
Add a third page and the poor warrior will spend more time swapping between hotkey banks and twitch reacting than worrying about things like taunt.<br />
<br />
And like others have said, I don't understand how this gives any better aggro -- when playing the warrior, I don't expect snap aggro.  But I would like a way to get reasonably solid aggro in 5-10 seconds of combat, rather than hoping for one of my 3 rage procs to go off.  Especially in LDON, where taunt and rage procs don't seem to do jack, so I'd much rather play the shaman in LDON -- on regular adventures he tanks nearly as well. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yeesh.  One more time for those that missed this part:<br />
<br />
Using and maintaining these skills expends the character's Endurance (a new statistic, calculated from the character's basic stats). <br />
<br />
<br />
I wouldn't go assuming anything about Acumen, zings, lack of food, etc. just yet.  It is not the stamina bar, according to that quote.</div></div><hr />

If its a limited time offer type thing, then if anyone is lagged their will be all sorts of issues with missing the &quot;window of opertunity&quot;.<br />
I wouldn't have minded seeing the WoW type skills where they have a rage bar, aka you only have rage while fighting and the longer your fighting the higher your rage and more stuff you can preform from it, type of system.<br />
But this?<br />
They wanted to keep it non twitch, but waiting for an ICON to pop up that says HIT ME NOW! just seems silly.../sigh</div></div><hr />

Not taht it really bothers me, but Im just wondering what type of impact this is going to have on my already pathetic melee.  <br />

Amen Fumeden.  I see a lot of pessimism and general bitching here, and I can't understand why.  Go take a look over at TSW.  The warrior community appears to be ecstatic about these potential changes, as they should be.  Bravo warriors!  Nothing but good can come out of changes to the melee classes due to the fact that they are broken right now.  How in the hell can anybody complain about petty little stuff like hotkeys?

<br />
How exactly is this good for shaman? From the original post, I read that ENDURANCE will be a new pool based on undefined stats. That does not look like the stamina bar to me. <br />
<br />
I could be wrong, but I've never seen the &quot;yellow bar&quot; refered to as endurance before. <br />
<br />
But, if its based off of physical stats, we are the physical stat buff kings. So we got that going for us. If its stamina/endurance and zing spells affect it, all the better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well what i am worries about is that they are concentration on the pure melee but by their own words are effecting hybrids as well <br />
Disciplines will require an Endurance cost <br />
Hybrids will receive a limited Endurance pool for their disciplines<br />
<br />

this scares me as I have a feeling they are not gonna balance things they are gonna flip flop them</div></div><hr />

Precisely... I am only speculating of course, but unless they base endurance off WIS OR INT I think we have it covered...  :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Will be interesting to see how this pans out...  I don't think it'll really do much in the way of making one race more desirable over another for a tank.  With today's equipment and buffs, if you're not hitting max in all melee stats, you're just not trying.  ;)  As always, low levels are the only place where your race will matter much, if at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Would be interesting to see defensive work off the endurance pool.  When your endurance wears out, no more defensive.  Downside is, the ubers, would end up with longer defensive, thus more uber.  The lower levels, would  end up with shorter defensive, thus further increasing the separation between the top and bottom.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the most part warriors I know haven't asked to be agro gods or invincible tanks, they just wanted something fun for their class that makes them more then a one dimensional character. <br />
<br />
I hope that this will be what they are looking for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Remove defensive and change warriors so as the max number of damage intervals they can be hit up to is 18 (rather than 20).<br />
<br />
It still makes no sense that the same mob has a chance of doing max damage in 1 round to any character, regardless of class.<br />
<br />
For agro, Warriors need an &quot;On Demand&quot; ability that works off whatever this endurance bar is, which causes them to less or no damage for a period of a few seconds but generate mass agro, to simulate the effect of a knight stopping meleeing to cast a taunting spell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some of the ideas are sound, but the implementation remains to be seen.  I spend a great deal of effort watching mobs, group mates, switching spells, etc...there's no reason melee shouldn't have a little more of an active role in helping a group out than hitting F8, a (target/attack).</div></div><hr />

They have only hinted at changes.<br />
The TSW forums are NOT that estatic, Mixed into the pot of people with the attention span of gnats are the ones that have a god dose of reality, and know the track record of the people making the suggestions.<br />
And the pessimism that you see is based on a 5 year track record from Sony. Do you need more of a reason to be pessimistic about? I should hope not.<br />
Possibly you don't connect that the people planning these changes are the same people that have put this game in its current state.</div></div><hr />

Sorry but no you didnt. You can not deleat any &quot;mob droped&quot; spell you have scribed. I was cleaning out my clr's spell book just 2 days ago and was unable to deleat any spell that was a droped spell. While annoying I can see why they did it that way.

<br />
I think this is a bit of a misconception about melee.<br />
As a 2-boxer who was originally shaman/monk who switched to shaman/mage and shaman/SK (plus others) I find the melees to involve at least as much work as the casters, particularly when the mob is being pushed around. The monk for example, is always moving around trying to stay in melee range and moving to the rear of the mob if possible (and trying to work out when time is best to hit mend and FD and use disciplines like stone stance). <br />
<br />
Since they are talking about complicating melee further I can see myself playing the mage even more, which is a shame as I was hoping the fix would be good for all melee, not just those with single accounts. The major complaint from the melee classes is that they wanted some form of utility, not more button-mashing. It appears they will get both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Depending on the implimentation this could be a great boon for meeles. And even the support classes. <br />
<br />
What if the window of opening is variable upon the stats of the charecter? As in greater dex increases the windows duration.  Win for shaman.<br />
<br />
What if Acumen effects the Pool these effects are drawn from Or the stamina regen spells Like Zings and such do so as well. More spells to mem (Bleh) But again a perk for shaman. <br />
<br />
Since mutts are warriors. We might see a Little Furry Paw of hamstringing Doom Message now and again. Will it change the game? Nah.. But would be fun to see now and again.<br />
<br />
Of course if it is a 1% change or the Warrior goes HA I just Finally pulled off a Mightystrike hand clapper of extreme Bashyness!... And the rest of the group goes what did it do? And the warrior goes. I don't know. Then well. Big deal when 2 seconds later the paladin gets a slay undead for 5K+<br />
<br />
Or if the Chanter gets a tash off and the monster is Gnawing on her face and the warrior is waiting for the opening.... and waiting. And waiting. (Taunting like mad and being ignored) While the chanter goes down. TAunting like mad. Then 2 seconds after the chanter dies and the opening occurs and the warrior spams teh aggro button right as the monster has already turned back to him... and gets the You must be at the monsters back for this Ca ca ca combo! to work... Well then warriors will storm SoE headquarters for once again being left to the mercy of the RNG. Especially when the same situation happens. And the Paladin drops a stun spell and Boom aggro is maintained and the chanter just gets a nail broken.<br />
<br />
It will all be in how well it is handled. And I sure hope it is the folks that did the Planer charm rather than the folks that did the Ykesha charms heading up the meele changes.<br />
<br />
And one more thing. The window best not be a half second duration. Cause then it is just a stupid attention grab and not at all tactical.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">What if the window of opening is variable upon the stats of the charecter? As in greater dex increases the windows duration.  Win for shaman.<br />
<br />
What if Acumen effects the Pool these effects are drawn from Or the stamina regen spells Like Zings and such do so as well. More spells to mem (Bleh) But again a perk for shaman.<br />
<br />
If only shamans would be able to refresh endurance or buff it we would gain power. And SOE will do /&quot;$&amp;/&quot;$ to make us more powerfull. I'm affraid everyone and his dog will have (or get) a endurance buff / &quot;heal&quot; spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Bandicoot - I wasn't 100% serious, I know (hope) no one really does that.  I also 2 box a monk, and f8 - autoattack only lands the first few rounds before the mob is out of range.  I was stretching reality to make a point, which is that melee don't really have to pay as much attention to a battle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Fibonacci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Good or bad, the changes will have the side effect of all those melee's having to re-learn their class.  I know this point has my wife a bit edgy.  She's afraid of the bad pulls and group wipes that may come because how she does her job may become completely diferent.<br />
<br />
Just be prepaired and patient with the tanks after the changes are made.<br />
<br />

<br />
And on another point ...<br />
I would guess that all the priest classes would get a line of Endurance boosting or regening spells with clerics getting a slighlty better version.</div></div><hr />

The following items are scheduled for the upcoming patch on <br />
24 November <br />
------------------------------ <br />
<br />
** Class Issues ** <br />
<br />
- Two new warrior quests have been added. Similar in difficulty to the warrior epic, completion of these quests will grant the warrior the ability to change class to Paladin (&quot;Good&quot; quest) or Shadowknight (&quot;Evil&quot; quest). We hope this addresses the recent balance issue with warriors. Talk to a warrior guildmaster in any city for the start of this quest. <br />
<br />
- A quest for monks has been added, similar to the warrior quest. A monk may now choose to undertake this quest and become a ranger. We hope this addresses monk balance issues. Talk to a monk guildmaster in any city for the start of this quest. <br />
<br />
- The Norrathian Police Force &quot;Home Security Education&quot; project has been a major success. All doors in Norrath, Luclin and on the planes are now locked and require a key or &quot;Pick Lock&quot; skill to open. This should address some of the rogue and bard issues. <br />
<br />
- Necromancers and Magicians are out of balance with other Intelligence-based casters. Therefore Wizards and Enchanters will be given magician-style pets. To make up for this, the Pegasus Feather Cloak will be added to Quarm's and Lord Inquisitor Seru's loot tables in order to make it more available. Additionally, Necromancer pets will become mindless dead (uncontrollable like old enchanter pets). <br />
<br />
- Shadowknights and Paladins who lose key factions will automatically change class to Warrior. If you're evil, you should work on maintaining that evil faction, and if you're good, you should work on staying good. Unfortunately, a side effect of this implementation is that we cannot grandfather anyone, so if your factions are already ruined you may log on to find you are a warrior. <br />
<br />
- Added a Class Alternate Advancement for Bards. Spending 9 points on the &quot;Milli Vanilli&quot; ability gives you the ability to make your songs appear as though they are being sung by someone else. That person gets any associated agression or benefit. <br />
<br />
- Random level 1-3 mobs in zones with Wayfarer camps have been given the ability to Death Touch anyone who attacks them who is more than 20 levels higher than the mob. This ability can function even if the mob is killed in a single blow. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Spells ** <br />
<br />
- The Camouflage spell now renders the target flash orange instead of invisible. Hunters have to be safe, and safe hunters wear flash orange. If you want to traipse around without being seen, use invisibility. <br />
<br />
- Call of the Hero no longer works on people who aren't heroes (have not completed their epic). <br />
<br />
- All resurrection spells upped to 100% experience returned, but randomly delete an item off the corpse being raised or off the live character if the corpse has less than 10 items on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Ban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">I'm trying not to be pessimistic..I eagerly await more details.  However, given SOE's track record, most often the give and take is extreme, and often skewed toward the &quot;take&quot;.<br />
<br />
Some of the ideas are sound, but the implementation remains to be seen.  I spend a great deal of effort watching mobs, group mates, switching spells, etc...there's no reason melee shouldn't have a little more of an active role in helping a group out than hitting F8, a (target/attack).<br />
<br />
<br />
When I'm playing my 64 monk, I usually have to pay attention to there the mob is moving in an attempt to control push.  I also keep an eye out on other damage bars because I might have to offtank adds or try to get aggro if the healer is running behind on heals.  I wouldn't say that melee's just hit attack and then surf the net, that would be like saying that all shaman's do is stand up, cast slow, then surf the net.  If I said that, what would you think?<br />
<br />
I am paying attention when I'm playing and if I can do more to add DPS or stun a mob, then as a melee class, I'm for it.  Whatever changes they make, I hope they're significant because I have almost a year invested in my monk.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Shamad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">I can only hope that the &quot;endurance&quot; bar replenishes at a decent speed. Who in the hell wants to hear the warrior, monk, or rogue say &quot;Wait, OOE, gota med, gimi 10 mins.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
I bet you that's exactly what's going to happen...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">I just hope they will let us buff and regen the endurance bar.<br />
<br />
I hope they don't. I have enough to do, and too few spell gems to do it with already.<br />
<br />
 if its using that yellow bar thingy i got now, well i havent bought food in 50 lvls so its a bit empty, <br />
<br />
/boggle...how can you stand the Hungry/Thirsty spam for all that time? Not to mention the nice stat benefits of food/drink available now. I don't understand this decision at all. Don't you ever need to jump?<br />
<br />
anyone remember the days when melee stats meant something?<br />
<br />
How do you remember something that never happened?<br />
<br />
and i hear knights are already bitching<br />
<br />
Poor knights...really. No, not really. Warriors have been taking it in the ass for a long time now.</div></div><hr />
