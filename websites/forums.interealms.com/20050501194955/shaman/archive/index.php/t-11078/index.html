<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Icebreaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a 56 shaman planning on hitting 65 eventually, and I am wondering what the best  class to 2 box / partner with would be for overall exp / AA's, and making some cash.<br />
<br />
I'm not rich, but I can decently equip and level up most any class, I am just having trouble picking one :confused:  Any help would be greatly appreciated :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if you intend to play a duo that is 2-boxable to 65<br />
<br />
ie: tanking tier2-3 mobs 'in the face' for aaxp etc<br />
<br />
Then I would chose either a plate class tank or Mage<br />
<br />
Warriors are tough, fairly low maintenance and proably easiest to play, don't use mana.<br />
<br />
SK's are also tough, have massive taunt, FD, snare, taps etc, bit more effort to play than warrior. <br />
<br />
Paladins, tough, have good buffs, stun self healing , DA etc.<br />
<br />
Mages, solid pets, massive damage at high end plus pet can tank etc<br />
<br />
I can duo with any of these classes at 65 np, especially when they have more aa than me ;)<br />
<br />
Best results I have had duoing in tier3 have been with a bard though, using the patented 'root dot kite' thingy is pretty fast aaxp (about 70mins a point I'd guess, both 65). Shaman/bard is too high maintenance to 2 box effectively though ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ultrazach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I two box a 60 Shaman and a 57 Ranger. The Ranger HP is an issue sometimes but his damage output is certainly not. It almost doesnt matter though for the places I hunt because most of the mobs take a slow pretty easily. One great thing about my Ranger now is that he can heal my Shaman after he Cannis and there is little downtime.<br />
<br />
In my experience the Ranger/Shammy duo with combined buffs are a pretty powerful pair as I can go toe to toe with some 56-58 level mobs without too much stress (and thats WITHOUT epics or Torp...yet)<br />
<br />
I'm waiting on getting my level 61 pet so he can tank and my Ranger can stand in the background and pelt the mob with arrows. =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">in any zones besides pop zones any melee can tank normal exp mobs shoot my pet was tanking for me pre pop in UP ,but in Pop zones its just alot of extra healing to keep a none tank type alive. Go with a Tank or Mage. SK hands down is best for all around imo just cause he can FD single while the pally can pacify it doesnt work on all mobs. There all realy good though just depends on situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would go with a necro.  They can generate more agro or less depending on their need ... have huge dps, can split mobs using fd, can gate (this is the reasone I would avoid a melee)   Their snare dots are a good complement to you.  They are low maintenience.<br />
<br />
Hell they can even rez if needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">dotn foprget , warriors are very expendable , bind them close and they can run back after a death and loot up and tank almost without missing a beat. Thats kinda handy , plus they are simple.<br />
<br />
but my personal choice for duo ? Hmm , im thinking paly or Mage . Mage is obvious. High DPS , tough pets , once somehtign is slwoed , we pretty much have it under control , especialy at 65 on bolth sides , dont get me drooling over a charmer mage and me duoing<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But the pally is a supisingly good duo partner , at higher levels there isnt alot they cant stun , that stun can be a wonderful  thing. Just randomly stunning will let you EASILY keep up on healing with Quiescence. Their DPS isnt bad and if your fighting something undead , there isnt many better partners.<br />
<br />
Thats my angle anyway</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">With a Shaman? It doesn't really matter... we can duo with just about any class.<br />
<br />
If I had to choose, it'd be a CoD-enabled Chanter though ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Charm enabled enc, necro, or mage is best.<br />
<br />
If not, necro--as long as it can be root/snared and doesn't summon, you can kill it extremely fast, no downtime.<br />
<br />
If you need a tank, go with SK. Decent DPS, and makes up for all the quirks you are missing--FD pull, snare, invis vs undead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Necro is the best class to partner with in PoP, bar none.  (Well, an enchanter is better for anyone to &quot;duo&quot; with, but all you will do to an enchanter partner is steal half their xp).<br />
<br />
I think it would be hard to effectively manage a necro-shaman 2-box combo, but my DEX score in RL is about 40 =)  Shaman/SK would be an excellent duo and easier to manage, I would think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I spent a lot of time with a warior partner and would have loved to have the aditional skills sk bring.<br />
<br />
Some of the current combinations may not be as great down the road.  What is best is a moving target at SOE makes changes.  NOTE, no one is recomending monk for the second box and at that time that was by far the most common recomendation.<br />
<br />
I think I would pick an SK for the plate tanking and big taunt.  I also like the SK pulling abilities and safty.  When things are going very bad the shaman gates and the SK hits the FD macro and no one dies.  This is clearly not the case with any of the other plate class options.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm still a huge fan of the Ranger partner (then again, it's my only two-box option since my shaman shares an account with my necro).  I agree he probably won't work too well in PoP zones, but then again I haven't even tried yet.<br />
<br />
Currently, my 54 shaman has no problems keeping up with heals while my ranger beats down slowed mobs.  I don't really notice his low AC (1109 currently), his hp is over 3k without any outside buffs, and I've been able to take up to level 57 mobs (haven't tried anything higher) without any trouble (well, clerics can be trouble).<br />
<br />
I don't know if extra ac/hp would make up for a 10-minute snare, 25-pt self DS, hp/ac buffs, utility buffs, and all of the other attack buffs that up my DPS beyond that of any tank class.  If the mob dies faster, then I have fewer hits to heal anyways.  41% haste from epic + 40% haste from alacrity = one fast ranger.<br />
<br />
A warrior would be effective, but would be almost useless in add situations, and relies on the shaman for everything.  The kills would definitely go slower if I had a warrior, and since I have no downtime with KEI anyways, why would I want one?  I heal rarely enough thanks to regen3 and regrowth that my exp grinding is in no way affected by his lower ac/hp.<br />
<br />
I know, PoP will be different, but really not until I get to tier 2 or higher.  The only thing I would trade my ranger for would be an equally-equipped SK, they have nice spell loadouts and work very well with shaman.</div></div><hr />

 At 65 though that will be a HUGE limitation. Atleast in PoP tons of things summon , even out of pop things that are aorund the 60 level mark will summon.<br />
<br />
Thats why i choose mage , their pet has the HP to take it while you slow and heal.<br />
<br />
Actualy a lil trick i do is , pull with malo and as the mob comes at me i sick MY pet on it. Dogdog isnt going to solo  it for too long , but it gives me a shot to get off slow before he dies . laying Q on him helps too if you feel like it , but i never have needed it yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hehe, the monks are already getting restless because they are no longer the &quot;uber partner&quot; that they were pre-PoP.  They've already crosslinked to this from Monkly Business.<br />

Those crazy monks, they always gotta be the best at everything.  Oh wait, that's rogues.  Oh wait, that's druids.  Bah, that's everyone, really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">endgame?  as in level 65 in tier2+ I would have to say there is no better partner than a CoD-enabled enchanter.   You can get more exp than any full grp and you can solo yellow-con+ nameds on your way to millions of pp, your 65 spells, ornate armor, etc.  There is nothing overpowered about 650dps charm pets sir.  NOTHING I say.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">HoH, PoTactics, PoV are all good places to duo with a necro.<br />
<br />
I recommend finding a necro with charm though, together you can duo in CoD or PoTactics amazingly well for great exp.<br />
<br />
In most tier2+ zones, a mage pet doesn't do enough dps to warrant the mana you spend to heal it. You are betting off soloing with root/dot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shere Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hasn't been mentioned so I will.<br />
<br />
Don't forget Beastlords make great partners. They complement each other very well. They are my standard 2 box.<br />
<br />
Beastlord is a leather class but has good avoidance skills and can tank perfectly ok in PoV. <br />
<br />
DPS is very good when combined with pet. Throw in spells and procs and you will beat any other melee duo (of the same level/gear).<br />
<br />
Beastlord slow is not redundant. BL pre-slows and shaman never gets agro, very efficient as mobs is usually fully slowed by the time it gets to camp.<br />
<br />
Don't forget Spiritual line... mana regen AND hp regen make for very good regen combined with canni.<br />
<br />
Get an add? pet can off tank very well. Beastlords contrary to popular belief have excellent agro control. Their dots are very good at maintaining agro.<br />

I used to duo with a monk but gave that up in preference for my Beastlord.<br />

personally i don't know many high lvl beastlords (bar some low 60s), but their spell line up seems a bit redundent to me.  i should also add the fact that i find their slow to be most usefull when used properly in conjunction with mine.<br />
<br />
i started a pally on a second account.<br />
i have a 65 shaman and my brother plays a 63 druid. i wanted a class capable of rezing the stupid druid, while being able to increase my hp/hold agro/tank slowed, slow midigated and unslowed mobs/and FD or pacify.  pally seemed like the choice for me.  plus i can pritty much auto pilot the pally as long as i keep him stuning the mob to keep agro off the shaman and druid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">My vote is Shaman/SK.<br />
<br />
Duoing, you arent going to be facing many mobs where a wars special abilities shine.  The reverse is true of SKs.  Plus at 65 they can summon corpses with those stackable coffins if things go really bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Hadd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">i'd go for a mage , high end they are very nice , be it mod rod or spell haste ring , add in the nice pets , and the ability to heal their own pets decently ( and you can add the shaman healing on the pet ) .... now as well they can summon 200 hp belt for pets , and two proccing weps (2 for shm pet and 2 for mage pet ok .. ) .. and you can buff the pets .... and even stack haste on em ... and add muzzle of mardu !<br />
now imagine both the mage and shm at high end , you get a guy who can summon mana conservation items , spell haste items , you get two pets , and two char able to heal the mage pet ( hell , mini ch rotation easy to do ;) .... if any trouble , both can gate .....using the mage as a nuker would be a lil hard as of agro control and the mages low hps , but mage can finish mobs off , and throw a rain here and there while keeping pet healed .....<br />
<br />
as for necro/enc , yes they are amazing charm classes , lets be honest , i smell a nerf .<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Well at high end game (means you got tons of aas as well, and descend gear):<br />
<br />
For dual box: Grab a damage dealer with you. You cannot dual box a charm class easely, the risk is simply too high imo; You cant concentrate enough on one toon.<br />
Simple: you slow cripple dot and tank the mob while your partner do most of the damage. Marauders, Hunters or Mage are the best combo. With a hunter you have the possibility to pull easely outdoor. This way i make easy exp 1h40 per aas. Careful though you need to have maxed all defenses skill to be efficient. (CS3 CA 3 ND 3 LR 5 ID5 and channeling focus recommanded). Well long way but you said high end game... My favorite spot are bees in BoT, easy exp and chance to see a spectral from time to time.<br />
<br />
<br />
For partner: charm class, but remember it is always dangerous. And a death may bring a crap &quot;rez run&quot; since you dont have clerics in your group. Otherwise see above.</div></div><hr />

I'd go for SK/Paladin. Necro is appealing but summoning mobs will mess that combo up badly when you start fighting mobs above level 55. SK is great for snare and FD, Paladin is nice for HP buffs, 90% Rezz and stuns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Krytog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">SK hands down. The aggro control will let you do poison dots without getting beat. they take a hard beating, good dps,variety of spells, split mobs, summon corpses if u like nasty area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">CoD Chanter is the best exp hands down.  The problem with a chanter is they need 2 things from their partner.  Snare and heal.  What class does that sound like to you.<br />
<br />
Havent doen this yet but a charm enabled necro in cod should truely rock the house.  I am going to have to convice a couple of my necro friends to try it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Another vote for SK.  I started one this week to replace my mothballed monk.<br />
<br />
Snare, feign death, monster aggro, good hitpoints, solid tanking, and decent melee damage with a good two hander.  I gave mine a reaver (40/40).  No level requirement and a recent patch made them able to hit magic.  Only cost 5K.<br />
<br />
-Barm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Umgrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">My vote is for Paladin.<br />
Having a plate armor tank that can insta-aggro prettymuch anything off you (stuns) is a huge plus.<br />
What puts it over the top, however is the stacking of the buffs.<br />
You get Focus, Regeneration, Brells, Haste, SoW, Symbol, and the Pally rez is acceptable if things go bad.<br />
<br />
The only problem with this duo that I've found (my roommate is a 65 pally), is that there is no way to FD split mobs, so you are more limited on where to exp than with other classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope. Slow mitigation is a no go when you have a non plate class tanking unless you have a cleric. Yes I can stay alive and kill them but it is inefficient and risky. As it stands I can duo quite happily in PoV and desert areas of PoS. Haven't tried duo in tactics yet but going to try it when I have a few more avoidance aa's.<br />
<br />
Yes the stat buffs are redundant. I will also point out that they are redundant on a shaman too. Nukes are very efficient for a hybrid. 9 mana/hp a tick is by no means redundant, nor is SV (hp and ATK buff). The dots naturally all stack and the pet buffs are obviously not redundant giving them proc damage and 85% haste.<br />
<br />
Get to know some high level Beastlords, you'll love grouping with them.<br />
<br />
Shere Khaan and Baaloo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">from 1-65 i would take an SK.  They are just the most well rounded of all the potential duo partner's IMO.  <br />
<br />
at 65 you want the enchanter :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Best class to duo with from 1-65 if you're only concerned with exp gain is still a necro. Fear kiting should work well 2-boxing since the characters are medding at different times. Shaman pulls with mal-x (mainly so the necro spells will stick), throws in an poison dot to grab agro in camp while you send in the pets. Necro takes over with snare and fear, kills the mobs along with the pets while you med up for the next pull. Even before KEI, this worked with 0 downtime. The duo still works well at high lvls, Shaman torpor-tanks the tough summoning mobs while the necro does the damage. Dunno how well that would work 2-boxing though, both of you need to be on your toes in that situation. Also, you can feign pull (badly compared to monk or SK) and rez (for around 300p if you buy the emeralds). <br />
<br />
I'll jump on the bandwagon and say that my favorite duo partner at the high end is an SK (I felt that way before monk nerf). Not particularly efficient at the low end, the duo really starts to get good at 50+ and peaks at 65. Sks (with an insta-click circlet of shadows) are amazing puller at the high end. With a bit of room to maneuver, I've seen a buddy of mine pull things with his SK that I could never do with my monk. He'll invis down to a named spawn, agro then insta-invis, bring back a few mobs, snare the one he wants to park, feign, and I'll peel while the others wander back. No way I can pick a particular mob to pull like that with my monk. Combine that with a plate tank, snare, FD, fear and summon corpse and it's a winning combo imo. The only downside is relatively low DPS but I love the sheer flexibility of the duo. <br />
<br />
2nd on my list would be necro. <br />
<br />
3rd would be, in no particular order:<br />
- Paladin (rez, plate tank, good agro control, decent downtime heals), missing snare. <br />
- mage (screw finess you have massive firepower instead) <br />
- monk (FD puller, great DPS), hope they tune the nerf, a monk should tank better than a rogue or ranger imo. These days, I torpor tank when I duo with a monk. <br />
- ranger (tracking, snare, good DPS, good outdoor puller with harmony).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Podunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Rangers with Endless Quiver + Shaman dots own mobs, instead of decreasing damage output and having to worry about pulling you have a ranger who can track your mobs pull with snare, your shaman roots and dots and your ranger just fires arrows all day long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Qatrixaro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I'd go for one of those classes that can charm in the high levels. Druid or Enchanter maybe?  Bard if you don't mind the carpal tunnel?<br />
<br />
Almost sickening how powerful these guys are soloing with charm.  I just can't imagine how much more efficient they would be with a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I went for a warrior as a two box partner. We're not talking best partner overall (I'd go with an SK there) but specifically someone you can &quot;run on the side&quot; while you do your shaman thingy. And the nice thing with the warrior is that you can quite often maneuver the mob into a corner, the warrior keeps it there and you can forget about it.<br />
I run a 52 ogre, he makes 3000+ HP unbuffed by now, 5500 in full raid buffs.  With 1200 AC that takes a long time till most mobs tear throug that.<br />
I tried to 2 box 2 casters, but found that I'm not using one to its full potential most of the time.</div></div><hr />
