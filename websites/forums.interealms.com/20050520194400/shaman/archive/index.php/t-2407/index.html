<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wth is the deal with this mob? 3 or 4 guilds tried him this weekend encluding ours, and he wiped the floor with all of us. I cant speak for the others obviously, but here is what I know of him from several encounters I have had.<br />
<br />
Unslowable<br />
Rampages (flurry? dont remember)<br />
Hits for 600ish max. (can dual weild, this one wasnt)<br />
Casts a blind (shadow fog, managed to resist it once)(dont think its a proc) that seems to be removeable with RGC or RC, I cast RC (only one I got) on someone twice and it told me target had been cured, but tried 4+ casts on someone another time and no luck....<br />
Also seems to have some sort of unresistable? 500 pt proc..once most were dead I tanked it for 3/4 of a second before getting kersplatted. <br />
<br />
What lands - malo/tash (duh) malosini, cripple, epic<br />
pox/bane bounced everytime. (didnt get to disease debuff)<br />
<br />
My best guess here is that you need 3-4 people chain casting RGC on the tank to keep him/her able to see. Keeping a MT up seemed to be the main problem here, and consequently keeping healers/nukers off the rampage list. <br />
<br />
This guy and greig have been kicking mah arse for months now. Neeeed revenge. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>RrumofXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As one of the people that personally got splatted this weekend, he is duel wielding.  He's got the mace and the ranger sword.  It's just that his graphic bugged during our first attempt. Should still be true, unless someone disarmed him, which seems highly unlikely =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Mmmm strange, all I saw was the mace.<br />
<br />
Heh, IV probably got upwards of 500 kills this weekend lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Maboun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Without totally giving away  my strat I'll give you a few pointers.<br />
<br />
<br />
1) Make sure people know if they get blinded to NOT MOVE. It seems every other time we kill him someone doesn't listen and trains the centis/shadows from sides and back on us after being blinded/knocked back.<br />
<br />
2) You can debuff him before fight since he's rooted but this will leave debuffers on rampage list, his range is pretty big and extends to slightly behind the broken wall behind him.<br />
<br />
3) Which brings us to managing knockback/blind. Hmm what's that behind him? Use the zone geometry / landscape to your advantage. You can figure out the rest. You cna do whole fight with no adds whatsoever.<br />
<br />
4) Debuffs are hella important. He has high ac and malo/malosini/occlusion/tash should be popped on and druid and necro ac debuffs (disjucntion and whatever the necro spell is) as well as CRIPPLE. Cripple seems to stop his rampaging somewhat and helps ower the ac enogh that tanks/melee are getting more hits. If you debuff before fight have debuffers camp out and keep all bard songs off while debuffing. When you come back you can /assist IV to see who hes aggro on. Mem blur used to work , has seemed wierd last few times though.<br />
<br />
5) If you fail on him you can have a cleric camp out on far edge of carpet or at back of pillar and not be aggro. You DO have to let him regen to FULL before pulling any corpses or he will instagib you. This takes about 40 mins usually after a failed attempt. Obviously having someone FD in room to watch him would be helpful.<br />
<br />
6) His blind spell is annoying, have tanks make a hotkey to mash when they are blinded then cast RC (need 2 casts usually) or GRC on em to clear blind.<br />
<br />
7) last thing make sure people do not wander too far left or right from back wall. If you pass the small pillar/collapsed walls to left and right of big wall behind IV you will get adds and likley wipe. Side respawns are pretty fast maybe less then 10 mins?<br />
<br />
Given that you should be able to whack him, he has been buffed once since release but once you get the strat down its just another CH / MT fight with a few twists. <br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />

Mmmm strange, all I saw was the mace.<br />
<br />
Heh, IV probably got upwards of 500 kills this weekend lol. <br />
<br />
Still a body or two in there.  I think the killin is still goin on.  <br />
<br />
It was Ody's first attempt at this guy, and we know what we did wrong.  We will get him the next time we find him spawned.  But yeah, it was nasty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Maboun, thanks for taking the time to respond. Strangely enough we do ALL of what you mention, sans debuffing before starting and camping out. Got me on rampage early and killed nonetheless.<br />
<br />
Hmmm.. so no real trick to it I guess. Thanks for the input!<br />
<br />
and /wave to another austinite</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You actually don't need to camp out after debuffing. Just mem blur. IV has extremely low MR, so low that Cripple is very rarelyh resisted, even when standing far outside melee range. Place warriors nearest to IV when you blur (and have them sit down), and he will immediately aggro on the warriors, placing them on rampage hopefully. We have 4 or 5 warriors all engage at start, with 1 taunting. This gets only warriors on rampage list. If you get adds, someone screwed up. You should never get adds on IV. <br />
<br />
He's a lot like Tormax but has more hp and an annoying proc.<br />
<br />
As for curing the blind, I think he has 2 blinds. One is normal blind, and one is a curse blind. Cure blindness cures one, and remove curse cures the other one. That would explain why sometimes you could cure, but sometimes you couldn't.<br />
<br />
*Edit: We don't bother curing blindness anyway. Just have people stand still when they are blinded. When they move around while blind, they get adds usually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Qualm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Dual wielding boss mobs are significantly tougher.  We failed twice on a dual wielding Doomshade with forces that should have been able to kill him routinely, as we have several times before.  Got him to 30% and then 50%.  Not even close.<br />
<br />
Qualm, Barbarian Shaman, E'ci</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well at least your post did not turn into a flame thread like mine did when I only asked the simple question of how long the spawn time was on his guards. ROFL!<br />
<br />
Well anyway I will give ya some tips<br />
<br />
/rude to the flamers in that other thread<br />
<br />
<br />
You seem to be on the right track...From what you posted. Not sure why you were having a problem with resists since he is easy to land stuff on.<br />
<br />
Going from Maboun's post...<br />
<br />
 1) Make sure people know if they get blinded to NOT MOVE.  <br />
<br />
This is usefull yes but there are ways to over come it. The problem here is if you get him out of position and a tank gets blinded and knocked back then immediatly summoned you are going to get adds regardless.<br />
<br />
2) You can debuff him before fight since he's rooted but this will leave debuffers on rampage list <br />
<br />
Again, just have the debuffers camp out and back in.. takes all of 40 seconds.<br />
<br />
You actually don't need to camp out after debuffing. Just mem blur. <br />
<br />
Jing I play a 60 chanter now and I still got hammered after bluring... it does not clear, best bet is to just camp and come back.<br />
<br />
The strat will come to you in time. Take the pointers to heart and learn and analyze. This is not a zerg mob.. if you try and do that you will loose every time.<br />
<br />
I will give you another little tip... IV is an UNDEAD mob. There are big undead nukes/weapons out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">/shrug mem blur works for us. Don't have me turn this into a flame thread Targar! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gorslam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">To explain the negative feelings toward people who want spoiled strategies:<br />
<br />
Just about every high-end mob revolves around a sound strategy. Ever notice that you can kill some mobs with half the numbers you had at your first successful run, just a few spawns later? It's because you've perfected (or greatly fine-tuned) your strategy. If you can kill IV, I could spend 5 minutes explaining strategies to you and you could probably kill Cursed next time he spawns.<br />
<br />
What it boils down to is you didn't &quot;earn&quot; the kill when you have someone telling you which button to press and when. You didn't solve the puzzle. The person who gave you the strat put the entire thing together and then you walked by and put in the last piece, collected your loot, and put a corpseshot on your website. If you kill something with a handmedown strat off the safehouse, you don't feel the same sense of accomplishment you would have if you'd spent the time to figure it out yourself. Wouldn't you feel pride for yourself and your guildmates if after those other three guilds had failed him, you guys had wiped to him a few times learning how he works, only to end up killing him, with stuff you figured out yourself?<br />
<br />
Alot of it also deals with the fact that when strats are spoiled, high-end guilds immediately lose a figurative share of the mobs they had to work for to figure out. That said, the flaming is mostly lighthearted joking, no matter how many swears are used. Take it as such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Gorslam,<br />
<br />
Yes that is one view and is shared by many, however I think you will find that the game has changed a lot since then. There was an excellent post the other day on safehouse talking about just what you were.<br />
<br />
I do share your thoughts about &quot;handmedown&quot; strats, but blatently asking for a strat is not the same as doing research on a mob. The info is out there you just have to track it down. Granted you can find out for youself by going in and hitting auto attack hehe.<br />
<br />
(summerized idea from safehouse post inc)<br />
<br />
But moving back to what I just said, you will find that in todays high end game you do not have the opportunity to work those strats out the same way that the people who first killed ubber_mob_0X did b/c you now have 5-6 guilds racing each other to spawns. Or if you get there first they are sitting right behind you waiting for you to either win, or kill after you loose.<br />
<br />
Now days you have to make sure that you have your ducks in a row before you even start or you are gonna get ganked.<br />
<br />
We were messing around the other night and dain just happened to be up. We went over with about 18 people or so and decided to kill em. Had a bad run in with adds that happens from time to time and another guild tried to gank him over our dead bodies. <br />
<br />
It was funny b/c they wiped just on dain with no adds. Then we showed em how it was done with killing the 425 dain with 0 deaths. Anyway just an example. You can have your strat down, know you can kill the mob.. have some bad luck and another guild is waiting right there to pull the gank off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">fortunatly xev, for the most part, is not like that. If a guild wants to toss themselves endlessly at a mob, most other guilds seem to respect that and leave ya alone until you are done.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Krytog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">biggest problem to solve with IV is his stupid knockback. More isn't necessarily better for this mob. It is doable just requires some thought. Took our guild 3 or 4 runs to figure out and implement the strategy cleanly.

This is one of the fun luclin mobs you can cold nuke endlessly until he dies. Take the easy safe route and JBB him over and over, or if you want to get serious, Ice strike him nonstop for big damage. You can do a constant 35dps over the course of the fight with just ice nukes.<br />
Epic's land too, but I never bother.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah pallys love to get those big hits against him. Can't say for IV since we've done him numerous time before we got our first dual wielder. Barely noticed fight him now when he was dual wielding.<br />
<br />
I can say tho that our fight attempts at the creator where a dual wielding version and boy was he a tough nut. But once we got things worked out we sure walked over him easily next time. Second kill was easy as pie with one death on a ld player.<br />
<br />
If a mob doesn't naturally quad, figure him out on a non dual wielding version it's alot easier.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">IV's only annoying when he's DWing, since your secondary healers would have to be awake instead of dozing off like on so many other mobs.<br />
<br />
Honestly, after you get the positioning and after you figure out how to handle rampages, there's no difference if you bring 35 or 80 people other than lag and how long the battle would take.</div></div><hr />

<br />
JBB bracer the other night for the kill shot hehe.  Our first few times we did IV as a guild we lost or almost lost, but once you figure out how to position your melee you can do IV with under 36 with ease.  Basically just have your main warrior that is going to be getting agro attack for 20 seconds before anyone else even tries to attack.  With the back against the wall even if he gets knocked back, IV will still summon him instantly.  Have a couple clerics that do nothing but heal the rampage damage.  I think our last 10 runs not one person has died, or just an unlucky wizzie died trying to go for a kill shot.  Since Legends patches so much and crashes, we have killed IV 19 times (yes, nineteen) in the last 7 weeks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Oaklanbash_Vaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">One more thing that makes it easier, after you clear the room out, have everyone go to the left wall.  Do not kill the young centi, just mezz them and have a shaman keep turgurs on them.  We used to mezz all 6 aliens in the room, but now we don't even fight the right wall mobs since they dont agro.  The robes are very very hard to slow, and sometimes need tash/malo/oos to slow them, it's best just to have the tanks peel off IV and kill any robes that respawn on your groups (other than the main warrior in the CH chain and the tanks currently on rampage damage)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">&lt;i&gt;Sorry if I'm giving away someone's strategy, but couldn't you just dot/snare them and maintain the &quot;runaway&quot; mode and just leave them there all beat up w/o any intention of engaging with a mid-level dot comparable to their hp regen?&lt;/i&gt;<br />
<br />
That's a &lt;b&gt;lot&lt;/b&gt; of work to do that. The Xi Xaui and Xi Vius have very high MR and a decent amount of HP. It's a whole lot easier to just not aggro the adds in the first place.</div></div><hr />
