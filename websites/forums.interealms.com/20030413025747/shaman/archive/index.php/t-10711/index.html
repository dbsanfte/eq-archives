<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bozarkia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Everyone just sit back for a second and take a deep breath.  <br />
<br />
Everquest is a dynamic game.  That's why most all of us are still playing, we haven't beaten it, we never will.  Things are constantly changing, some for the good, some for the bad.  If you think the bad outways the good, that's your personal decision, I don't even care if you rally others who agree with you to take action, but flaming others, evel in particular, who hold differeing opinions is pretty silly.<br />
<br />
I too have affliction enhancing gear, and while I chose them for their properties, they're still kinda useful, and overall, its not really a big deal.  I can still function as a shaman, and function well.<br />
<br />
<br />
I can't tell you how often lately I've heard this board referred to as the Shaman's Grove.  While I've never posted terribly much, I've been a part of this community for a long time, and it embarrasses me to see us referred to as  a bunch of whining babies.<br />
<br />
The only people who think shamans suck are the shamans themselves.   And really only those shamans who can't seem to think outside the box.  <br />
<br />
While I'll concede that there are many people still judge us by the fact that we were once the only ones able to solo a lvl 52 dragon in Western Wastes, which pretty much anyone can do now, there are just as many with a good idea as to what the class can offer today, that don't think we suck.<br />
<br />
I for one am not ready to throw in the towell and say that I'm a broken class.  I KNOW my abilities and what I bring to the table, and so do my friends and my guild, and that's all that matters.  I'm not crippled by the fact that my malo casts 0.5 seconds slower comparing affliction haste to spell haste and blessing of reverence.  I'm not crippled by the fact that my slow lasts 6 minutes instead of 8.  I still like that blood of saryn lasts 20% longer. On longer lasting fights that's still more damage for less aggro and less mana.  More than I had before these items were ever put in game.<br />
<br />
I don't xp in pov much anymore since being flagged for other zones, unless I'm going there to solo.  I fight harder things, and my dots are still viable damage).  Lots of times I get chosen for groups for my dots, instead of a chanter for mez, because they know that the mobs will  be rooted and rotting away while the melees chisel one down.  But, even if in fast pulling fast killing areas, I can bring alot to the table in efficency, while my personal dps may be lacking in these circumstances, I can provide for a group with litterally no down time while staying practically full on mana in case the **** hits and fan, and then I'm there to play hero and save the group from a wipe.  I can still fill in as tank, chanter, cleric or damage whatever the situation calls for, for the short term, until we get back on our feet.<br />
<br />
In the last 2 years I've too made gear decisions that were  based on the status quo, that later have been changed.  Fungi stuff and Skyshrine Quest BP fall into this category.   For example, Skyshrine BP was awarded to me before 1) our group stamina buff was as good as RH, and 2) before mgb and /tgb.  Once luclin came out and these two things were put into practice, my mana savings on a free cast RH weren't consistant with the time it took to just tgb my group stamina on others.  So I had a bp that was not only better awarded to rangers and rouges in my guild, since vindi bp was easier and better for me, but that also affected my consideration for other loot that would have in the long run been more suited for me.<br />
<br />
But on the same hand, in the last two years, I've woken up to see items that I had all of a sudden given new power.  My Shroud of Veeshan fell into this category.  What was once a nice back item, all of sudden was godly when it was granted improved healing 3. (not so godly now that I dont use any under 60 heals,  but for the months I had it before pop it was). I had even thought of that item as one of my never improve slots, until pop that is.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see some changes to make my class better, who wouldn't?  But faster malo and turgurs, I don't see as the make or break issues.  I do see, getting a heal that can keep one rampaged person alive as an issue.  I do see spectural's being wasted on a spell I'll NEVER cast an issue.  I do see alchemy being completely gimp compared to other tradeskills an issue.  I do see downscaled spells because of slow, when slow is mostly mitigated as an issue.  I'd like to see curses implemented, or plus ability buffs.  And I hope that while the dev team is reviewing the priest classes that they will keep all this in mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was extremely pissed over the change to the focus items after investing significant time and plat into aquiring them. I'm not stompping on the ground going to cancel my account pissed yet.<br />
<br />
Its just one more thing on top of all the very important issues you mentioned that have people that pissed off. <br />
<br />
If I had already been playing for 2-3 years I might just have been ready to call it quits now too, but I'm not quite there yet.<br />
<br />
I just wish SOE would acutally listen to us a little though, especially on things like the spells. I will not turn in a single parchment. I'll buy all my spells because my wife isn't going to get complete crap from her turn ins.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Shamans used to be the strong, quiet leaders among the classes. Many shamans I knew were guild leaders and/or raid leaders. Most were respected among the other classes, and our community was smaller, so it was easy to be familiar with most of the shamans on your server. Most are gone now, though. They moved on to other classes, quit the game, or just plod along quietly in the background.<br />
<br />
I think most of the crying that has gone on here lately comes from second and third generation shamans, or people who created shaman twinks because they saw the value of the class.<br />
<br />
Perhaps some of these people are adequate shamans. Perhaps a few are outstanding shamans. But, I fear many began their existence clad in jaundiced bone armor, flayed turmoilskin belts, and howling harpoons purchased in the Bazaar for chump change by their main. Their shaman is just another 'toon' to them, that they leveled up in 'The Circuit', with little more understanding of the class' versatility other than slow, buff, and cannibalize. I'm sure we'll see our first froglok Prophets before summer...maybe even complaining and starting petitions here on the Crucible.<br />
<br />
Or maybe these 'nerfs' will drive away those that arent truly shamans, because we all know a true shaman can take a hit and stay standing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">But, I fear many began their existence clad in jaundiced bone armor, flayed turmoilskin belts, and howling harpoons <br />
<br />
I sir, did not begin my existence with these items.  They weren't available then!  No, I had to work very hard to get those items, and I wore them for a long time.  <br />
<br />
The focus nerf hurts high level shaman mains a lot more than it hurts lower level shamans or shaman alts/twinks.  I spent a lot of time and raid points acquiring my focus items, and it is really painful to lose the effect from them in one nasty little patch.  <br />
<br />
As for the &quot;we told you it was a bug&quot; business, the patch announcement 9 months ago that told us this also nerfed the items.  People were not happy then either, and the next patch returned the items to their previous functionality.  After that, there was NOTHING from VI as to if this was the correct way these focus items were supposed to work.  We assumed the dragon had relented.  And before some wiseass starts talking about assumptions, recognize that assumptions rule this game since Sony provides little to no information about how the game actually works.</div></div><hr />

How's that for a long time ago :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even now, 40-some levels on, that nerf hurt! To lose 3 bits of gear that I used every single time I played is a pain in the arse. I am not rich at all, and will have to work hard to replace those pieces of gear...<br />
<br />
Anyway, my points have all been made, by myself in other threads, and by Landaragon in this one. To sum up, a major nerf of equipment used almost exclusively by one or two classes is just that, a major nerf. Why are we not allowed to moan about that?</div></div><hr />

Walked both ways in the snow uphill to school ... type comment ... hmmm.  Add this to the everyone is whining or you’re a twink because you didn't start the game beta 1 ... come on ... do not let this turn into elitism on top of sweeping generalizations.   It is dangerous ground to paint all Shamans into compartmentalized groups.  Some old time Shaman’s were “Crying” just as much as new ones are today.  <br />
<br />
However, the “community was smaller, so it was easy to be familiar with most of the shamans on your server” does explain why one of that era would have problems relating to the game of today.  As the game has evolved, the smaller server community has grown … much like a small city that grows into a metropolis.   It is easy to sensor or control small groups of players but much harder as the populations increase. <br />
<br />
If some of the “strong, quiet leaders” have left the class … then become one in replacement.  Take on the hard issues and lead by example in game and on this board.  Anyone that believes things get better by leaving them alone is just praying that minor annoyances don’t explode into major problems.   Sadly, just the process of posting on some subjects on this board earns instant labeling as a whiner … thus continuing the cycle of the “whining complaining about whining”.  Resist the negativisms and take a positive status on our class, which will truly show that Shaman’s can take a hit and stay standing.</div></div><hr />

I started out with woven stuff gotten off dead Frogloks.  Then I got banded by buying large-size molds in the Feerott and finding a smith at EC tunnel to go make me the armor, and so on.<br />
<br />
I didn't have any Affliction focus items, so Im not going boohoo because I was on the receiving end of a nerf.  I just don't like the way Sony can make major changes to items that people - not necessarily myself -  have struggled to get - without considering the impact of the change and the NEED for that change.<br />
<br />
Next time I buy something at the bazaar, or decide to camp something, or choose to expend guild raid points (if I was a raider which Im not), I can't ring up Sony and ask whether they are going to massively change the value of items.  And I shouldn't have to.<br />
<br />
I wonder why some people on this board can't understand this simple concept.  Is it really that hard?</div></div><hr />

Regardless of how much this upsets me - I won't leave EQ or my guild over it. <br />
<br />
It's just another in a long string of verant lies, was surprised the first few times years ago but have long since become jaded and pretty much expect to have fecal matter dumped on my head from Verant every so often. <br />
<br />
Lord knows their CS is a pile of steaming you know what. <br />
<br />
So change the attitude - play the game realizing Sony or Verant or whomever bought the cash cow this week won't give the time of day to the players. <br />

My motto is that People matter - not pixels in a server. <br />

I ended up a lot happier in the long run ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been the leader of Clan Steelbear since we formed it back at the end of 1999. I helped keep the E'ci shaman board's Hate armor list for a period of time, until lack of interest in RE and decline of public raids on our server killed it. I've been reading/posting on these boards since I found them back in 2000...when I have something to say.<br />
<br />
When they added focus items, they were a nice bonus. Nothing more. We lived and prospered for 60 levels without them entirely. I 'inherited' 2 focus items when they implemented it; my Necklace of Superiority and a Shadel Bandit Ring (and, actually, I think I was wearing an Enshrouded Veil still at the time, but I have since replaced that). I didnt go out and seek to change my gear to acquire focus items, simply just to have them. I maintained my previous goals of acquiring the gear that I thought was the best choice for my class. If it so happens something I find makes a good piece of shaman equipment and has a focus effect; bonus...goodie for me. If not, I'll survive.<br />
<br />
As far as the affliction focus items, specifically; they were mildly interesting to me when I learned they would affect spells other than dots. But when Verant stated they were not intended to affect spell other than dots, I was no longer interested. I'd rather get spell haste or mana preservation.<br />
<br />
As for those of you who made gear choices based on these focus effects; if you've been around as long as I have you should know by now how the never-ending gear quest works. That Lodi shield that you buy in the Bazaar today for 25K plats wont be worth 8K six months from now when you go to sell it because you found something better to replace it. You will never get back in time or money what you paid for that item.<br />
<br />
We had an expression in the army, 'F*ck it and drive on.' You need to toss those affliction items in the trash, quit crying like a bunch of robes or druids, and move on.</div></div><hr />

We just happen to have a little problem with getting killed when we use our dots or doing the tanks job with the mob. No FD or no agro reduction what so ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Deaddragoxo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">ya i would agree a lot of ur spells cause a lot of rediculous aggro imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">My guild was doing Cursed last night.  We have a couple tanks in the AE range, clerics just outside it doing heals on them, and the rest of the raid out of AE range shooting bows or casting spells.  As usual I was loading up the DoTs on Cursed, making my shammy count for some real DPS.  I got summoned at about 75%, got a heal from a groupie and managed to work my way out of the melee again, gave the DoTs a rest, then went back to work.  I got summoned again at 25% and had to tank for about 30 seconds before I could lose aggro.  Meantime the cleric in my group was on the ball and I got a couple of heals that kept me up.  I gave up on DoTs after that and just used Tears of Saryn.  I can do so much more damage for far less aggro with nukes.  It's just silly.  And with a 4k mana pool, I can nuke for quite a while before running OOM.  Steadily nuking with Velium Strike and only stopping when Canni5 refreshes to cast that and then cast a Torpor on myself, I can nuke for 6.5 minutes straight before hitting 20m.  If I alternate Torrent and Tears, I can do mad dmg fast, but I run out of the mana pretty fast, takes about 3 or 4 minutes that way.  Also run into aggro problems eventually.  Still, on one blob in VT I did over 40k dmg in nukes in one fight using alternating rains.  Fun stuff.  <br />
<br />
Point is, DoTs are not a good way of dealing damage.  Their super high aggro/damage ratio makes nuking a lot more efficient even on long fights.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In general, I agree with your statements BUT I don't agree with not commenting or taking SOE to task for the reasons why you say &quot;F*ck it and drive on&quot;.   It's been clearly stated that SOE caused this whole issue by ommision of information, poor communications, and general &quot;piss poor&quot; additude towards Shaman class.   More importantly, SOE is doing the same towards other classes (Monks, Mages, etc) so it's not just a case of singling out just our class but a trend of poor service.   <br />
<br />
If anyone think's SOE is going to &quot;Get it&quot; without some feedback from each community ... well they are living in a pipe dream.   We don't have to moan and groan over it for pages and pages ... nor create petitions everytime something gets nerfed or impacted.  <br />
<br />
But Shamans do need to vent ... publicly ... in mass ... when some n00b programer at SOE flips focus code back and forth during  270+ day period in the game without taking &quot;ownership&quot;.   If anything, just a statement saying ... &quot;Folks - we don't know what the H#LL we are doing with Affliction Focus items ... hang on and in a year or so we will get them worked out&quot;.    Have the balls to admit that you really don't know what you are doing ... would go a long way.    Instead, we get ... &quot;I'm really really sorry&quot; for the X'd time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I think Rathe has an interesting point going on, despite the subjectivity of what he's trying to discuss. Nice conclusion too.<br />
<br />
I've always loved my class to death from the first 5pp I got for a sow at EC tunnel to finally obtaining my PoM boots a monthish ago.<br />
<br />
I don't believe this nerf at face value means the end of the world, but more likely the drop that tipped the bucket over.<br />
<br />
I remember last summer I paid 50k for a gem encrusted ring, and yeah, quite surprisingly, I bought it for the dots alone since I spent a lot of my time soloing in Mischief burning 20k hp mobs down as fast as I could.<br />
<br />
Then I realized it worked on like slows and malo. Went gaga from there because it helped me out tons, along with coldain bracer which I obtained in like not even 2 hours.<br />
<br />
But somewhere along the line, a lil before PoP came out, I got bored of the game in general. Played quite intensively during Xmas break but once classes picked back up, downward spiral again.<br />
<br />
And faced with this nerf (or &quot;bug fix&quot;), I'm not tremendously pissed off. However, it gives me even less incentive to log on anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">No, Walknot, I'm not too lazy to stand up for something that I think is wrong. But I'm also not going to lose perspective and abandon rationale over something that is a bonus to our class, not an entitlement. Last time I checked, you didnt spawn with a newbie note and a fist full of focus items.<br />
<br />
The fact that I (a level 61 shaman) get random tells from strangers to join tier 2 groups, when I'm not even LFG (or even in the same zone) tells me that my class probably isnt on the short end of the balance stick either. How many classes do you think enjoy that privilege, that people actually seek them out to complete a group?<br />
<br />
You cant handle Planes of Power mobs without your bugged affliction items? Well, damn, maybe you should have gotten spell haste or mana preservation or extended range items instead. Those are harder to get? Of course they are, they're more powerful than the affliction focus items were intended to be.<br />
<br />
There may be a couple of you 60+ shamans out there that created your character after focus items were implemented, but the vast majority of us started long before then. Think back and put it in perspective; a level 60 shaman was a powerful character before focus items ever came into existence. This change has no bearing at all upon that fact. None.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Most of those &quot;powerful&quot; Shaman at lvl 60 had Focus items going into an expansion where you can get killed in one round for bouncing a slow...once.  I dont know about you but  the Shaman Class as a whole took a huge cut in power in PoP just on soloing ability alone.  Our style of Solo was one of Tanking while using Torpor to keep health up.  <br />
<br />
Well, no other solo class did this so with PoP, and the yard mobs hitting for more then the average Mini Boss pre PoP, make it almost impossible for Shaman to effectively solo PoP mobs.  Sure it can be done but it not the same.  Of the other solo classes, well not much has changed.  Wizards still quad in PoP.  Druids and Necros still Snare pull and Root/Rot, Bards still swarm kite, and Enchanters still Charm.<br />
<br />
Of course we wont talk about the troubles some Shaman had in PoP without critical lvl 60 spells.<br />
<br />
Oh and Random tells? All kinds Classes have gotten random tells when I am starting a group, as would any other Shaman starting a group might do, so thats nothing to hang your argument on IMO.<br />
<br />
Will the Shaman class survive? Sure it will, but at what point will you start to question the value of the class?</div></div><hr />

We've had to change styles before - we can handle the adjustments again.  It's one of the strengths of a class with broad abilities.<br />

When you tire of the game.  If you like the game, you learn to live with adjustment - it's part of the challenge.  If you tire of the game, improvements will piss you off if they're not seen as significant enough.<br />
