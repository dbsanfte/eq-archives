<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kakkaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all,<br />
<br />
I am havin a few problems with nwn getting to work and im experiencing real slow down, and im sure its because I am using the factory video card...so should I pay 100 dollars for a geforce3 or just take the game back it seems like it would be fun. <br />
<br />
Problem 2. The card won't fit in my computer because I have one of those thin ones and the only way to fit the card in is to cut a piece out of the back of the computer and most likely keep the top off that section of the computer...help pls....<br />

Their drivers are probably coded by the 37331 coding crew of VI ... aka bugged POS. 2 hours into NWN and my PC freezes, reboots, blue screens. My friend's PC has same behaviour. After I switch to GFroce 2, all is good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wobbs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have an ATI 99/xpert and if I set all the graphical settings to their lowest, the slowdown isn't too bad.<br />
<br />
If you get the no cd-patch slow down is reduced considerably though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kakkaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What do you mean by no-cd patch wobblies.<br />
<br />
any other info is gud</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wobbs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">theres a patch that allows you to play the game without the CD, I can't remember where its available though, try gamecopyworld.com</div></div><hr />

Normally I'm not a huge &quot;No CD patch&quot; fan, but the last couple NWN patches have implemented a new version of their anti-piracy protection (SecureRom, I think) that has rendered the game unplayable for a bunch of legit buyers- specifically those with older CD-ROM drives or certain brands of DVD-ROM drives.<br />
<br />
The No CD patch also seems to speed the game up a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Straif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Shell out the cash for a cheap geforce2, I bought a cheapo 64MB, PCI (i know lol) video card for my other PC (it is the same as yours, with the stupid compaq case/motherboard).  I know that the PCI isnt as fast as an AGP card, but it works perfectly for nwn, not much slowdown and I can play EQ/CS fine on it.  Another trick if you dont want to get the no-cd key, once the nwn screen hits ATARI, pop out your cd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kakkaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">ok i downloaded the no-cd patch but it doesn't seem too specific on what to do can anyone provide step by step instructions i really don't want to mess anythin up. thx=)</div></div><hr />

Personally I love my Radeon 8500.  My wife got my G Force 3 Ti200 after I ran the new card through a few paces (EQ, NWN, America's Army, 3dMark).  System has been flawless since I chucked the G4 MX440 (course, that was probably my fault since I had the core and memory clocks way, way up).  If it helps I usually toss the OEM drivers and use the betas from Guru3d.  <br />
<br />
As for NWN, the real magic is in the level creator.</div></div><hr />

What OS you are running the ATI on? XP/2K or W98/ME?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">For the frist few weeks, 2KPro, but 2000 had a little fit when I swapped board/cpu/ram, so I moved back to XP Pro for a while.  I am using the drivers from ATI's web site right now, not the Windows Update set.</div></div><hr />
