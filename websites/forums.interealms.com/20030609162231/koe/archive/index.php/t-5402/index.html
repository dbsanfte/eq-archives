<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jlove Fizzboom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have decided after a long time to resume Coldain Shawl questing, in between exp hunting and all the other stuff I've been up to.<br />
<br />
One of the skills necesarry for the final shawl is brewing, and some of the more interesting drinks to build skill use foraged fruits and veggies.<br />
<br />
I would like to place one or multiple orders with our guild foragers for these tasties - I'm thinking on the order of 10-20 stacks.  Would be happy to compensate with either purchased food, money, or even the finished drinks.<br />
<br />
Please post here or let me know if you can help.  Thank you.</div></div><hr />
