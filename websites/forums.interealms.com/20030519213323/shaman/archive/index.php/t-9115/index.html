<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">anyone 62+ (nonuber geared) found any teir 2 solo spots where we can make anykind of ok xp?<br />
<br />
i have about 2k unbuffed hp/1k ac/full spell book to 62/epic/jbb/canni V,  and even with virtue i can't really tank in teir 2 to well.  mobs tend to have to much hp for me to root rot for any kind of decent xp.<br />
<br />
this hasn't really been addressed in the posts i have read so far.<br />
anyone have any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Previously I could solo ok on Planarium Larvae in PoV, but I believe they (like tons of other things) are flagged unrootable now.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I suggest grouping in Tier 2+ zones. It might be technically possible to solo, but I can't think why you'd want to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">some times i hop on for a half hour play sessions and i can't find a group in that short of time, or dont want to only group for a half hour.  soloing  a few mobs a few times a day adds up...now if i can find something as easy as FG shrooms :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Crypt of Decay entrance is solo-able.  I've done it 4-5 times when I only had one computer (normally I 2-box).<br />
<br />
Foul Puslings are the easy zone mob, Corrupted Puslings are harder but still doable.  Greater Blah Puslings are not soloable (I think there are two different Greater puslings).<br />
<br />
You can do the Cazic Thule zone splitting approach there if you don't get a solo pull.  Try to pull solo, if you get multiple, root one and zone (go fast, these guys are MEAN).  Heal up, invis, zone in and you should have a single to kill.<br />
<br />
Spear of Fate and poison DoTs land well.  Be sure to have him slowed (I also cripple, did I mention these guys are mean?).  Malo* a good idea as well.  Root/rot them.  Don't bother with dogdog, he gets chewed up too fast.  Not really worth tanking if you don't need to, you'll run out of mana most likely (especially if your gear is not great).<br />
<br />
Manage your mana, time your debuffs, and root/rot.  I get 6 percent AA (at 100% allocated to AA) at level 62.  Even considering the time required to kill one mob, it is the fastest solo experience I've found.  And generally, I'd rather poke myself in the eye than do this very often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Anyone found a way to split the High Guardians in PoJ?  I always solo the single one because he gives like 7% AA per kill at 62.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Jeez, sounds like a bunch of trouble to me for a couple % per kill.<br />
<br />
At 62, I'm still doing the same thing I did at 60/61. Gargs in PoN. Get consistant 5% AA per kill and non-stop killing when solo. Rot/Root is still more efficient than dog dog, but you can use him if you want.<br />
<br />
This camp is way easier than CoD or PoV and only 1-2% per kill less. I would be willing to bet that you actually make more XP on gargs because they are so easy to kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Torelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">How many HP on the Gargs?  Are these the ones on the way to doing the Mujaki encounter?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">HPs? I dunno. takes 1 curse 1wolf pack 1 bane 1Ebolt to get to 60%<br />
<br />
They are along the edges of the town lookinh place in PoN over by the hedge area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ArminiusXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have found DR at 62 to be quicker than FG, I get about 20% in 30-40 minutes and alot of cash items and eth partchments. I just go in teh face, takes 1pox 2banes and epic, weapons are a musth, they die at least one bubble quicker. I come out of there 500-1k in cash per hour it seems.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">actually after a little bit of testing things out, i have fount the golems in pov to be pritty easy solo (top portion of pov).  they hit to hard to tank but root rott works.  they seem to have a large amount of HP which is the problem.  once malo is on them root is np though.  canni V is a big plus and i wouldn't try this without virtue/aego on. i also keep dogdog up in the rare case i actually need /sheild and sometimes when i am getting smacked up he grabs attention just long enough for me to get things under control.<br />
<br />
i tried this 2 boxing a druid and managed to get myself killed, while i was able to do it solo np.  mages are a great companion for this snice their pets can tank with our heals.<br />
<br />
on a side note, the spiders are really hard to see so if i can i always get a mage partner for CoH...spiders can't be rooted or snared and rage for a long time.  any time you get one of them as an ad you will most likely have to gate :/  some of the crawlers are also immune to speed changes as well.  some pathing buggs on the upper floor really increase solo/parnter safty here (you can figure that out on your own=p)<br />
<br />
any time i solo there i stick to the golems or the razor fiends if the camps are open.  between the golems droping rare metalic liquid and the razor fiends droping tallons one cna make some good cash if luck holds out.<br />
<br />
keep posting ideas please, i love new places to try out =)  Been lazy about flags and just got my bot flag, will let u know what i find :)</div></div><hr />

I'm rapidly approaching 62 (faster than I want to really, set at 80% AA - 20% regular exp) and wondering what I'm going to do when I want to solo once I'm there.  I have a spot or two that works at 61, but I'm pretty sure it will go tourquoise as soon as I ding.<br />
<br />
Grouping isn't a problem for me.  But I feel pressured to stay until there is a quality replacement, and sometimes I only want to grind for an hour, take a break in town for an hour chatting, and then go hit the exp for another hour or two.<br />
<br />
So I'd be very interested in hearing about more solo spots for a 62 Shaman.<br />
<br />
(I'm 61 now, with all my 61 &amp; 62 spells, all useful 60 &amp; below spells scribed, w/ Epic, JBB, Canni5, flagged PoI factory &amp; Valor/Storms.  Working on BoT &amp; HoH keys on my own. :) )<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Where are you hunting at 61 frekkels? sounds like an ideal spot for me as I am on and off sometimes too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Rakji</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ok, I guess I'll go ahead and possibly sound stupid, but I'd like to know more options, so I'll ask. If I feel like soloing at 61, I can find plenty of stuff to solo thats dark blue in PoD, PoN. Heck, ever diseased rats in PoD are dark blue, and seem fine for solo exp.<br />
<br />
What is wrong with these places, is it just that some of you won't settle for &quot;max&quot; exp at a given level? I have a Druid friend that soloed her way to 65 in PoD within weeks of PoP release without a problem, maybe I'm missing the boat....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">rakji, the problem with these spots is they go light blue after you lvl up.  killing light blue mobs for xp = a waist of time in most people's opinions.<br />
maybe this will help a bit to find a place to go, i will leave the tactics of each zone up to you to figure out:<br />
<br />
ponb - unsoloable for xp, crappy xp anyway<br />
<br />
torment - haven't tried it, but i can guess there are some <br />
posabilities if you are carefull.  i know druids can charm here...<br />
<br />
BoT- beez can be ok xp, but i found it a high risk zone to solo in.<br />
<br />
HoH - easy to solo, just need to take note of the unrootable <br />
mobs and find a place to solo where you can single pull.  very boring...<br />
<br />
tactics - soloable but again you need to be carefull where you camp<br />
<br />
poifactory- i found it a waist of time for various reasons<br />
<br />
CoD- doable if your carefull<br />
<br />
pov/pos - easy to do, but way overcrowded<br />
<br />
pon,poi,pod, poj - waist of time due to low lvl mobs<br />
<br />
beyond that most people are not keyed.  personally i find HoH the best spot to solo or partner, but i typically never see more than 8 people in the zone on my server.  this zone gets croweded really fast with out haveing that many people in the zone (so stay out of my zone!)...btw, HoH is more boring than FG for XP...it is worse than grinding, it is brain mashing...<br />
<br />
worst--------best for spectral drops<br />
Bot----HoH----tactics<br />
solo these are the only places your going to C specs and they can be very rare off trash mobs...</div></div><hr />

PoN: birds, spiders and trees..some starghilugs<br />
PoD: Pestilient rats or Arachnae Defilers (3%aa on these)  if doing spiders: theres a nasty bug if youre on horse back and turn into the wall or get feared into it, you will fall through the world.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im 61 and kil lthe goos/rats in PoD. No epic/jbb. I have a horse. Its actually pretty safe because you can pull to the wall where you wont get an add. If you are careful, its actually hard to pull more than 1.<br />
<br />
I alpha up dog dog and let him tank. Fully buf him like a tank. Pull with malosini, run. When you get to wall turn around and root mob. Slow and cripple it. Send in the dog. I plague and Pon it then. At 50% they wil ltake another BoN. Dog will need a CH at this point. All goos and rats except pests. die at this point. Pest rats wmight need another BoN and/or another CH to dog dog. I dont take int eh face cause im on a horse. I simply keep the mob rooted away from me. He will run to you cause of agro on teh dots. Dog cant keep him off ya.<br />
<br />
Its mind numbingly easy. The exp is far worse than a group though cause it takes a while to kill them.<br />
<br />
Questions: I havent done PoN at all except in a group:<br />
<br />
1) How are birds/spiders/trees exp wise compared to rats/goos in PoD? Are they any harder to kill?<br />
<br />
2) I hear the Gargs are soloable. I've grouped there and have had more than 1 come per pull. Whats the method to get singles out of them?</div></div><hr />

also i can solo a very little in CT at the boots of flowing slime camp.</div></div><hr />

Re: My solo spot at 61<br />
Sorry, this probably won't help you.  At 60-61 I was soloing the 2 door spawns coupled with the 5 Tin Soldier spawns inside the PoI factory.  If you don't have that flag (or a friend that does who can let you in), this spot isn't available.  It wasn't amazing solo exp, but before getting your PoV/PoS flag, it was the easiest &amp; steadiest exp I found that also garnered decent loot.  (I'd sell Polished Tin Mail boots for 700-1kpp, and Boiled Leather Cuirass' for 2-3kpp.  Usually get one of each in a few hours.)<br />
<br />
Soloing at 62<br />
If you are PoV/PoS flagged, I've found you can solo the planarian larvae if you are careful in Valor.  Make sure you have KEI and Aego (Virtue preferred of course) to help out.  Fully self-buffed on horse w/ dogdog buffed w/ Focus, PE, and haste.  Canni5 really helps ensure victory.<br />
<br />
Spells memmed:  Malosini(or Malo), Turgur's, Pox, Bane, Ebolt, Tnarg's Mending, Torpor, Canni4.<br />
<br />
Self-torpor before the pull.  Pull with epic dot.  Two or three seconds  before it lands, sic dogdog on the larvae.  Malosini (seems to land okay, but you can use Malo to ensure some form of debuff sticks if you want) and then slow.  Next unload Pox/Bane/Ebolt.  Reapply dots &amp; Torpor as required, casting JBB or nukes (mana is a problem on these fights, so pulling the JBB out of the bag helps) in between.  <br />
<br />
The larvae do run at low health, and they enrage as well, so position dogdog accordingly.  Time your Canni5 for when you are near full health, because a bad round of larvae hits could end up killing you otherwise.  That's why I use a gem for Tnarg's, even though I may not end up casting it at all. :D<br />
<br />
Just to the right of the GY exit to PoT there is usually a single larvae squirming around.  He makes a great test case to see if you can handle it.  If things start to go bad, dismount from horse and zone.  Since you are near the larvae's spawn point in the first place, and they are non-aggro, you aren't training anyone. :)<br />
<br />
Watch for adds when they run, because the larvae are social. ;)<br />
<br />
The rare spawn is &quot;a festering worm&quot;.  I saw him at the zone-out spot for the first time today and killed him.  He seemed a bit harder than a normal larvae, but I was able to solo him w/o problems.  I was 63 at the time, but did nothing different from when I was 62 except use SLTW for dogdog.  He dropped Trinket of the Enlightened (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=19395).  Nice little PR/DR resist earring for me, and not a bad general day-day wear for some people.<br />
<br />
The exp isn't outstanding (as there is downtime between each pull, as this method is very mana intensive) but it was better than doing nothing while /lfg.  I think I got 8-10% aaxp per kill at 62.  I didn't check today, since I'm on a full regular exp burn to get to 65 right now. :p <br />
<br />
Hope this helps,</div></div><hr />
