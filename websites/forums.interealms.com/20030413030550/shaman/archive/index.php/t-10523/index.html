<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SkegBlackwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm working on getting my iksar cudgels..<br />
<br />
Stuck at Overseer Dublish in Nurga :( <br />
<br />
Camped him for 6 hours yesterday at his traditional spawn point and laying waste to most of the goblins in the surrounding areas.<br />
<br />
Got 6 shrouds of nature drop in that time (shame they are lore), plus the chant rock and mushroom needed for next cudgel!<br />
<br />
Question is has anyone seen the Overseer recently?? I know his spawn was broken a while back and then he was supposed to have returned?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">By traditional spawn point.. do you mean Nurga in the middle of that small camp?  If so I haven't ever seen him spawn there.. a while back he would spawn there... but now he spawns in Droga now.  As soon as I zoned in.. I ooc'd if someone knew where he was and someone had just killed him.. ran in.. looted the quest item and was back out again :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">He's never spawned in Droga. When did they move him there??<br />
I'll bet when they made the change that took out Sarnak slaves they screwed up the Overseer again. The time I killed him was right after they fixed him the 1st time. At that time he could spawn anywhere there was a goblin. I have seen him anywhere from zone in to spiders(when they used to be there).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They moved him a few months back.  They had screwed up the slaves spawn.. but when I got the overseer he was in Droga.. around some buildings, and had spawned there several times for the group that was AE factioning there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>throxis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Killed him twice this weekend on TZ. He spawned both times in the area where the Warder spawns. The two times I saw him were two days apart so not sure what his timer is. Dropped skull canopic both times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ya I had heard he was spawning in both places.. but when I was in Nurga.. and had a few lowbies working for me clearing anything and everything.. we never saw him spawn.  Immediately after I zone in Droga.. I ooc as to where he spawned.. someone responded that he was just killed and come loot the canopic ;)  Who knows. maybe verant changed his spawn again.. =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Caill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Both the overseer and the warder now seem to be random spawns in any place a gobby can spawn in Nurga.  I leveled up my young shaman there for a few levels just a couple weeks ago and the overseer spawned several times in the area just after you drop down at the end of the railroad tracks, and around and to the left where there are several new slaves digging in a dead end area.  Just slaughter all the gobbys there and he will eventually spawn.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Way back when I first did my 6th cudgel (before they added 7/8 and fleshies ability to do the quest), he spawned in the one room in Nurga.  Around when they added the new 2 quests, they took him out of there, but forgot to put him back anywhere else.  He was gone for a month or 2 before finally being put in as a random spawn in Droga.  I've seen him really often in the Warder area while factioning down there.</div></div><hr />
