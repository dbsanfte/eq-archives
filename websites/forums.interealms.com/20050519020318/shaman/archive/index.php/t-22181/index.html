Also liked the guy whose argument used statements such as &quot;child of shaman /cring /apologize&quot; while yet still justifying the case for a &quot;shaman based - level adjusted&quot; HoT ... without the snare/slow effect, of course.<br />
<br />
Next time we get frustrated because SOE is so clueless about the obviousness of shaman healing/buffing/slowing concerns let's keep in mind they have to wade through crap like this too. Not that it excuses them. They should know the classes without being hand-held and walked through the deficiencies. But that is another story.</div></div><hr />

Im really sorry but I cannot take this seriously.<br />
Yes Beastlords may have problems but lack of healing power is not 1 of them.<br />
What is it with Beasts that they think because a mob hits them for 2500 or whatever that they think they should get a bigger heal.<br />
What happens when a Warrior gets hit for 2500 should SoE give them a heal for it too ?.<br />
Never really noticed the fact they get the same healing power as Rangers up till now.<br />
Why do they get the same power for gods sake.Beasts get a slow rangers dont.<br />
Shaman pay massive penalties for slow yet doesnt seem that Beastlords do in comparison to other hybrids.<br />
There is a post on the Beast forums how a beast was main healer in BoT.Now he doesnt say if there was someone else there slowing but if a Ranger was main healer there then there damn well better be someone else slowing or the groups dead.<br />

       Where do you see they ask for a better heal than we have ?<br />
Where ?! I found pretty normal they ask a upgrade . The dps of critter raise so much , ALL heal should be adequatly increased . Our and Their if they want . A 200 hp per tick hot as their ancient spell ? Yeah really ,it would be overpowered for them . We know HoT are so usefull (tip bst don't have canni) in god (i recall they want to change their ancient spell in GoD).<br />
<br />

<br />
They have already steped on toes with it and any improvement is just more to that, unless we get something that is atleast as good or better. Frankly i think it should be better too cause we are a healing class. I cant see how a hybrid of our class, even though hybrids dont exist anymore, has this particular spell line in their AA when we have not even a trace of it in our spells or AA. Its something we should have gotten in the first place over them. Am i crazy here?</div></div><hr />

<br />
So where does their PARAGON ability come from if they are hybrids?!?<br />
<br />
Where does their SD mana regen ability come from if they are hybrids?!?<br />
<br />
Personally, I think they should have been forced to Cannabalise for mana just like their parent class .... not sure why a hybrid of a Shaman can give mana to an entire group, where Shaman can only give to self at the cost of HPs ....<br />
<br />
Just not clear here as to why one class (shaman) are penalised (low DPS, low Healing) for having slow, where clearly other classes are not penalised (BST = RNG healing and close DPS, ENC = insane charm DPS) ... If you are going to make a rule, apply it to all classes equally ...<br />
<br />
Tek</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">well try not and flame me but i think im saying this right.. Beastlords are the hybrid version of Shaman.. therefore &quot;supposed&quot; to get slow.. even tho not needing it<br />
<br />
When a hybrid of a class becomes more desirable than the parent class in a role the parent class was designed around, there is something very, very wrong.<br />
<br />
And that is what SoE must fix.<br />
<br />
Shamans were designed around slow and cannibalize, and very little else.  Our heals are weakened because of slow, our mana costs for spells are increased because of canni.<br />
<br />
If Beastlords were supposed to get slow, well, then Beastlords should have been penalized for it just like shamans.  Weakening BL heals so they're behind rangers seems suitable, given you can SLOW.  You don't NEED stronger heals.  You can SLOW.<br />
<br />
Now you know what it's like to be a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Are you trying to apply logic?   :)<br />
<br />
Not trying to apply logic. Just taking note that Beastlords have been designed to have some cool abilities without paying the hard price for it. <br />
It worked, and now Beastlords start to be a common class.<br />
<br />
It is just too bad for us, but it is the way we are.<br />
SOE had to give some cool advantages to beastlord to make players buy Luclin and start beastlords. The only prob is that they did it without considering the consequences on the parent class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">well try not and flame me but i think im saying this right.. Beastlords are the hybrid version of Shaman.. therefore &quot;supposed&quot; to get slow.. even tho not needing it<br />
<br />
I dont think anyone really cares they can slow, more power to them. im glad BST have a unique and powerful role to fufill. My gripe is that we arent unique anymore because of that, we do not have a role where people go &quot; i really want a shaman&quot;. Obviously some people like shaman in their groups, mostly cause of old school habits, but when you get down to the reality, we offer not 1 thing that would make you go &quot; i want a shaman over a enchanter or BST in most group CFG's. A druid/cleric/BST or druid/cleric/enchanter  combo is the way to go in any situation. You got back up healing, you can grab a focus if you really want to on the way to where ever and if you got the BST you dont even need us for that.<br />
<br />
We have offered so many excellant options for the dev's, the people here have put in their own personal freetime to do the dev's work and its a lil frustrating to see all of our valuable time wasted cause they still see us as kunark shaman.<br />
<br />
A cleric once said that us shaman are so upset cause we want to be the gods of the priest class again. I dont think anyone here wants that, we just want to be powerful. And im sorry, but in the age of BST's with 65% slows, chanters with charm and wizzies nuking for almost 5k with no AA, NOT making us as powerful as we can be cause it would be  &quot; overpowering&quot; is asinine. Some classes just have the natural ability to be a powerful class. Im sorry if a warrior can only tank and melee, but thats how it is. Your the best at what you do atleast. For us we have all this potential and power, but SoE is yanking back on those reigns and not letting us gallop.<br />
<br />
Very frustrating to fight against that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and you can use it every 13 minutes!  <br />
<br />
While I don't agree that an increase in healing up to the level of a Paladin is needed, I do agree that there needs to be a slight increase.  From a soloing perspective it makes sense.  From a raiding perspective it doesn't.  From a grouping perspective its a nice bonus but certainly nothing to write home about.</div></div><hr />

Paragon is a buff- SCR makes it last longer thereby making it more powerful.<br />
<br />
Cannibalization is a self-only instant mana regen ability- MC simply makes us receive more mana over time.<br />

I think when the developers were determining the path for the aa's they went with making the pre-requisites enhance the final aa ability.<br />

As a shaman, who uses aggro as a way/form of CC- I would have rather worked up LR/ID first before quite a few other &quot;necessary&quot; AA's.  Likes/Wants aside- I was pointing out that the pre-requisite AA's needed for Paragon/Cannibalization make them more powerful.  I am sure there are quite a few beastlords out there that think the same as you and felt there were other more beneficial AA's out there that could have been completed beforehand.</div></div><hr />

Hes right but when a Shaman is in a group with a BL (Talking normal BoT type exp groups here) then nearly everything but his buffs are pretty useless.<br />
10% difference in slow nowadays is not enough to make up for the extra DPS a beast is bringing to group and in fact 2 beastlords would probably be better for the group overall than a Shaman and a Beastlord.<br />
Yes maybe because of no malos his slow will take more attempts to land but the mobs going to die a damn site quicker anyway.Once the mob is slowed his Chloroblast is unfortunately going to be good enough for back up heals especially if the beastlord has his healing AA's.<br />

I can see them needing a better heal for their warder...<br />
<br />
I laughed a little at that one BST who said they had a role as a healer in groups...<br />
<br />
They do get pet specific heals that are quite powerful.<br />
<br />
This is just ludicrous though... I like the last post, &quot;we want a upgrade to chloroblast, maybe an HoT, but don't give it a negative effect like snare or slow, or maybe I want a instant heal that rocks instead of a 'piddly' 4 tick HoT.&quot;<br />
<br />
Quiescence is not piddly.  All Hybrid Heals except for possibly Paladins, ARE piddly.<br />
<br />
Why would a beast lord WANT to heal?  What purpose could it serve?  What CONTENT does this guy play in?  I like how he pointed out that chloroblast was from low end PoP, that spell goes way back to kunark era, one of the few spells that was added into the game via a free patch (those were the days) and the creation of an EC tunnel spell vendor.<br />
<br />
Also, about saying buffs are useless when shaman is in group, BeastLords have a buff that alone is worth, to most casters, more than all of ours combined.  I'm talkin about the Spiritual line, and let's not even mention MGB Paragon.  Not only do you have hybrid level copies of our buffs, since, let's not forget, you are a HYBRID.  If Beastlord's had shammy buffs and comparable heals (comparable to a Shaman, that is... not saying much there hehe), then what the heck would be the benefit of BEING a shaman?  A few percent more slow on 10 seconds on an mitigated mob?  <br />
<br />
Beastlords are a DPS class and a fantastic one at that.  They already have sharable mana regen (something their parent class does not have mind you), an awesome pet with bells and whistles, the aforementioned DPS, a very potent slow... heck, what more do you want? FoS, Healing, maybe Res, or perhaps the ability to morph into any monster you have slain, taking their class and abilities, to make your class more versatile, and more desired for group, or whatever.  <br />
<br />
I don't know, I'm pulling stuff outta my booty here cuz I assume that is what some Beastlords who complain about being bored with their efficiency when other classes have real issues (not saying BL's don't have any issues, but trust me, when classes ask for crap like this, it sends a clear message to the devs, if those devs are intelligent, that the class in question is not in any dire need of positive balancing).<br />
<br />
EDIT: Wow, that must have been the kingdaddy of all run-on sentences in that last paragraph...<br />
<br />
P.S. Another thing, I read back over the replies, and if the Shaman is balanced against the Druid due to allegedly only having to heal against mob DPS that is assumed to always be slowed, then WHY would a Beastlord with his best slow be given the same healing as a Ranger? Sheesh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>longfanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Not sure why this is such an issue simply because a handful of Bsts out of the whole playerbase make requests that may not seem acceptable.  I can't say as I have ever even attempted to play healer to any group as a Bst, nor do I want to try.  I also play a shaman, and I know the issues involving the class setbacks and the feeling of uselessness that many high end shaman are feeling when it comes to GoD.<br />
<br />
Yes, as a Bst I have been the main slower for a group in a select few trials, but the reality is however, that we have similar difficulties getting groups for the same reasons, that fact that neither of us are part of the 'Holy Trinity' of classes that make these trials easily completed.<br />
<br />
However, I'm not sure it deems worthy a post to argue a few comments made concerning Bst healing ability.  We are a hybrid, as well as our healing abilities, and 99.9% of the playerbase recognizes this and has no problems with this fact.  Yes, I realize many people feel that as a hybrid, some of our abilities have stepped on some toes along the way, but this falls more along the direction of the shaman class not changing with the content as it should, a fault of the devs and their narrow-minded concepts of class design.  Lets not turn this into a class envy rant.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Beastlords simply do too much in my opinion.<br />
<br />
massive pet<br />
dps<br />
SD<br />
Paragon<br />
Stonestance<br />
65% slows<br />
<br />
Pick 4 out of the 6.  All six plus ferocity and lower grade buffs, heals, haste, etc. is too much.  The range of these abilities hems in the capacity for other classes to evolve.  <br />
<br />
Healing is a touchy subject because just a wee bit too much healing, and then beastlords are the tank/mages of EQ.  They'll certainly obliterate shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>longfanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">You're still missing the point that the problem with the shaman class is currently a problem with the class itself, not an issue of class comparision.  This is the biggest arguement that has been posted here time and again is that the principles of the shaman class are based on those ideas of power from the Kunark/Velious expansions.  <br />
<br />
The biggest problem with the shaman class is simply how the devs view  the class strengths.  Poor DD's, decent DoTs (though can't be used it most fight simply due to mob uptime or overall aggro), slow(though % of slow mitigation/unlsowables makes this trivial), low output pet (yes, I h8 dragging around bags of crap weapons simply to make my shaman pet almost worth casting) awesome stat buffs (that is for people who somhow have ignored their gear stats and have difficulty maxing stats) and debuffs.  This isn't my class design, this is a concept I hope will be looked at closely with the new class representatives to help change the class for the better.<br />
<br />
Btw, when it comes to being group slower, sure I can slow just as easly as a shaman chain casting turgurs without bothering to debuff.  However, especially in GoD, depending how far along in progression you are shows how desired a Bst is as a slower as the resist rates increase significantly.<br />
<br />
Stonestance, well, almost.  Protective disc is a cut-and-paste disc given from the monk line of discs.  Yes, it is helpful at time when I get aggro trying to slow something to keep me from dying quite as quickly, especially as I am a hybrid so I am limited to hybrid healing in concerns with self-preservation.  This means I also am more of a drain on the group cleric if we are killing especially resistant mobs.  Possible max 60% damage mitigation for 2 tics, somehow not exactly game breaking.<br />
<br />
SD, this was the bone they threw us when the class was being developed, nearly a year after the class came out of course, to help Bst be somewhat desired for groups, very similar to the enchanter class when the origional EQ was released (they didn't have clarity way back when).  I'm still waiting for a similar bone to be thrown at the berzerker class, as they are facing the same useless abilities/discs that Bst had when the class was new, and they still have no decent discs/AA's to speak of yet.<br />
<br />
Buffs, well, this was another cut-and-paste that held little origionality for the class.  They simply followed the level seperation of buffs btween rangers/druids and paladin/clerics.  We got the buffs of the levels they got theirs, not really a purposeful cut against the shaman class.<br />
<br />
SV, this was the 'in-between' hybrid buff they gave us, again to be similarly compared to the hybrid contributions of the ranger and paladin.  However, the only time anyone wants this buff is simply if either a ranger(for the attack) or paladin(for the max hitpoints) is missing, we can somewhat fill in the in-between gap.<br />
<br />
Pet, well, this is one of our strong points, however it was designed to be this way to make up for our lack of double attack skill.  Especially due to advancement and gearing through the planes and GoD, the pet is simply a slightly stronger shaman pet.  He averages 40DPS on high AC mobs and around 60DPS on easy exp mobs.  However, I still do twice that in melee damage alone, so he is in all comparision, another moving dot that can take more hits than the shaman dogdog, but serves the same purpose for the most part.<br />
<br />
Do I want better heals?  Well, I think everyone wants more than they currently have, but I don't think it's essential that we get better heals than the hybrid comparitive ones we have atm.  Will I ever play the role as main slower on a teir4+ raid?  Not a chance.  Will I ever be the main healer for any group?  Again, this is a definate no, regardless of healing AAs.  Can I help to fill in the blanks for certain buffs when XX class is not available? Yes, however aside from casual exp zones, I know for any serious grind/raid I will not ever be picked over another class that specializes in doing what they were picked for.<br />
<br />
If you want to point out the class abilities, so be it.  But remember, it's been a very long time since any hybrid class was limited to and controlled by what abilities the 'parent' class had to simply be a gimped version of those parent classes.  Lets try and focus on what the shaman class needs to catch up the current content to be considered useful once again.  I've always enjoyed seeing how clearly the class request posts here on the Crucible were thought out and posted.  Now that we have a representative, hopefully some of those can be addressed, or at least noticed and replied to.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Classes have to be considered in relation to other classes or you have no reference point. Balance would be meaningless. So yes, comparisons to Beastlords are valid. By your own admittance you can do 80-120dps plus 40-60 pet dps on any given mob totaling 120-180 dps plus slows plus adding FT9 to the group plus whatever mana regen Paragon adds plus whatever dps ferocity adds plus whatever dps your version of haste adds plus whatever the stat/hps buffs contribute. That is a very nice contribution, if Shamans get pissed that Beastlords want a better heal, don't be amazed. I mean hand over the malxxx line and better heals and just switch all Shamans to Beastlords at that point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>longfanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">And as I stated (again) there are very few Bst making any issues of wanting a better heal.  Most (myself included) are satisfied with their hybrid healing abilities.  I fail to see how a couple random people asking for an upgrade turns into a class war.<br />
<br />
Also, 180~ish DPS from a well equipped Bst is not exactly hard for a shaman to meet also.  It may be harder on short term fights using the craptacular DDs given, but this isn't some magic number that a shaman can't easily break.  I'm commonly outdamaged by guild shaman on any fight lasting more than a couple minutes by a good margin.<br />

Ummmmm....<br />
<br />
1:  When it comes to the content you're talking about, any fight that lasts that long is considered &quot;raid encounter.&quot;  The average fight in GoD lasts, what, 45 seconds?<br />
<br />
2:  And your shaman lived through it?  If he's outdamaging a Beastlord, I'll bet he got aggro, got summoned, and was squished.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I can stack dots for good damage, but I won't be there to see the mob die.  It will aggro on me on the first tick of my second DoT landed and make me glad I have LR5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>longfanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Which (again) comes down to the shaman class needing rebalanced dealing with short encounters.  However, due top ositioning, push, etc, rarely will any melee be putting out their average DPS vs trash or exp mobs as you are referring to.  I don't know that many people who parse 30 second fights however, but I doubt I do that great of dps on each and every trash mob that gets pulled, especially if I am acting as slower.  Yes, I already referred to the dot aggro issue that needs to be addressed, don't try and misquote me on issues that I have already said need to be adressed concerning shaman rebalancing.  Heck, even with the crappy DD shaman are given, with at the very minimum of ID4 and spell haste4, shaman + buffed alpha dogdog can do around 150~dps simply chaining velium stike(this is of course not concerning any further AAs even with this craptacular nuke).  This is what I was referring to in concerns with comparing shaman to bst dps.<br />
<br />
Yes, on short encounters shaman suffer.  On longer encounters I get easily thrashed by shaman DPS(as well as many other classes of course).  However, this has absolutely nothing to do with the post topic which I commented to.  A couple people commented on bst healing upgrades, someone posted the crosslink, blah blah, and here we are.  It still comes down to always having a few people who will never be satisfied no matter how much you give them, regardless fo their current status, and does not reflect on the class as a whole.<br />

Break 200? Break 180? Are you HIGH man? What exactly do you think we Shamans are packin in here? Our uber 7.8 second casting &gt;1000 damage nuke? Wait, you mean we hit 120 for that 7.8 second! Right? Not DPS over the whole fight, but just over the casting of the spell? How about our pet, that does MAYBE 30 dps vs low AC mobs, and far far less vs &quot;real&quot; mobs. <br />
<br />
People here arent blaming BLs for our deficiencies, but when we see threads of BLs wanting more, its more than a little annoying, its down-right insulting. Now, perhaps YOU, as an individual, do not agree with the thread, but give it a day or two and then come back and tell us how there arent a lot of BLs looking for more upgrades. <br />
<br />
As I posted on that thread on the SOE boards, I truly feel that BLs are one of THE most balanced classes in this game. They have a nice package of abilities and utility to offer groups or raids. While BLs may not be able to solo some of the content that Shamans and Necros can, they are still no slouch when it comes to soloability. They do as well as any melee class or melee hybrid. On top of that, they out buff and out DPS Shamans in every single other situation you can name. <br />
<br />
Shamans dont want to see BLs nerfed man, but we WOULD like to see  &quot;your&quot; community showing a little more support for the &quot;parent&quot; class, rather than bitching about the couple trivial things we have that you don't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not about bsts not supporting the shaman class, it's about shaman directing all negative remarks concerning the class time and again back it it somehow being the fault of the bst class.  A random Bst didn't come and cross-post this link on the page to piss anyone off, a shaman posted it to make a point that he felt a couple bst's request was a slam against the shaman class, even though it was on the bst boards where it belonged.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">I should load up a parsing program some time, I doubt I hit much more than 100 dps in exp groups and on raids vs. boss mobs not a hell of a lot more.

When I had time to get them all stacked on one mob I ended up tanking it the rest of it's life after a couple ticks. Which I lived through because they only hit for 800 or so. Of course then I malosiniad TZ in Time and dropped 2 Banes on him and right after the second one landed I started tanking him too....for about 1 second.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just keep in mind that Shamans must regain mana via Cannibalize, which is an active mana regen. They are losing a lot of time this way, which is contribuating to lower their DPS.<br />
<br />
Malos is 400 mana, Slow is 250 mana. As you can see, the first part of our fight begins with canni 4 and doesn't really let us the time for other things.<br />
<br />
Shamans are really good on paper, but in reality, it's different. It may seems dumb, but canni is the point of our problems. We must give too much time with it that we can't go at full power.</div></div><hr />

It's blatantly obvious that you know very little about Shaman DPS. That in itself isn't a bad thing, just stop throwing those ridculous numbers around.<br />
<br />
You agree that Shamans need upgrades, but at the same time you say that Shamans outdamage Beastlords as long as we can utilize our DoTs. Let me tell you that if Shamans actually outdamaged Beastlords half the problem would be solved already.<br />
<br />
Once again, this for me has nothing to do with Beaslords and from what I have been reading we can agree on that. It just irked me when you started the pet argument, when in reality in every damn exp group in GoD your warder will outdamage myself(again this doesn't mean your pet is too good, even though it's certainly not as bad as you made it look)</div></div><hr />

Seriously man, where are you getting these numbers? I suppose, in a 30 second fight, if we started casting VS the instant the mob got to camp, and chain-casted it the whole fight, we MIGHT be at 100 dps, because I guarentee that last one wont go off 75% of the time. Is that what you mean? <br />
<br />
And its not &quot;fear of aggro&quot; that keeps us from DOTing. Its very very very  real aggro that comes very very fast after very little damage to the mob, especially in comparison to some of the holes Wizards are blowing in them. <br />
<br />
Lets face it man, even in optimum situations (Nihil lands first cast, we land Bane and 1 VS) in a 30 second fight we MIGHT break 100 dps. 100 just isnt anything close to a &quot;regular&quot; thing with Shaman, though, so please stop tossing that number out there like its our &quot;average&quot; or something.</div></div><hr />

Hmm someones been speaking to Thott by the sounds of it :)<br />
<br />
Its another one of those ideal situations where we can just cast and cast and it will avg out to 100dps or there abouts.<br />
Thats a bit like calculating melee dps by saying they hit every time and always dual wield and always double atk always for the maximum dmg.<br />
Lets be generous id say AVERAGE dps with VS is probably around the 70 mark.<br />
While i will agree with him the Beast class as a whole seems pretty happy with what theyve got.<br />
But when someone does make a silly suggestion unlike here on the crucible they dont get shouted down and hardly anyone from their own community seems to post saying the idea is bad etc.<br />
This is the same class that a while back wanted their 2hb cap raised to that of monks because monks were out dpsing them in that department.<br />
Yes i do read the Beast forums a lot as the wife has a 65 beast.<br />
When one of their own post that they main heal in BoT groups plus what else they bring to that group then that says to me how much work the Shaman class needs.<br />
I wont say nerf beasts as to me they are probably the best balanced class in the whole game just that their parent classes lag behind in what they bring to a group.<br />

Beast had slows every level before god and oow and rangers did not yet they had the same heals...<br />

Rangers have DBl atk. Beast get a weak aa that adds very small amount of Dbl atk to them.. Rangers get equal aa that makes the dbl atk more so dont even count the beast aa.. rangers cancel it out..<br />

Beast didnt ask for shamans to be nerfed more.. Beast didnt ask anything about shamans heals.. Yes 95 cent of beast think shamans needs some massive upgrades.... <br />

And Beast Stright up melee is not great,  they have same melee set up as a bard.. get dbl atk though aa,  a beast has to work very hard and very very very very well equiped to break 200dps.<br />

They are a leather class.. get junk for ac..Out of every hybried they tank by far the worst, They class has its own problems.. STop trying to add more to them.. or have them get skipped on upgrades that has keeped them equal to rangers in healing..<br />

Blah blah blah. A lot of bull****, but it doesn't really matter. I am all for giving Beastlords the same heals as Rangers and I doubt anyone here would actually cry foul, if that happened. <br />
People over here started to moan when some Beastlords asked for Torpor, without the negative side effects.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Any whine for enhancement gets zero sympathy, but particularly when the shaman spell list is regarded as an apple tree to simply pick the right parts and disregard the rest, while retaining unique abilities like paragon, SD, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>longfanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">Yes, i think that is a bit odd that rangers recieved a better heal wheras we recieved a craptacular group version of a buff nobody wants/needs at 65, heh heh.  Do I complain about it?  No, however I would like it to be looked into.  Do I think we deserve a HoT compareable to Torpor with no drawbacks?  No, however I wouldn't mind seeing a HoT around the healing ability of Stoicism or slightly better with no drawbacks, and the only reason behind this is simply as a bst, a melee class, it would serve no purpose to give us a HoT with a slow componant as nobody would use it other than non-combat heal/med time.  Heck, if they gave us Torpor with the slow/snare componant I doubt you would see many bst use it.  That's a whole different story however.<br />
<br />
Also, I am well aware that shaman canni is voluntary and takes up spell casting time, recast, etc.  However, when I am speaking about compareable DPS, I am not speaking of the common bazaar geared shaman.  If I was going to compare to a bazaar/ornate shaman, I would have to do the same with the bst DPS numbers, which would be considerably lower than the numbers I have stated from personal experience.  I think the common bazaar/ornate Bst at 65 is probably using epic offhand/WLK/GWoC and does maybe 50-70 DPS melee depending on AAs (and I am being generous here).<br />
<br />
Lets compare the same to a shaman with similar ornate/bazaar gear, 61-65 spells bought in the bazaar or lucky drops of specs/runes off BoT named.  As I calculated it:<br />
VS: 925 CR<br />
7.8 second cast time<br />
6.63 second cast time with the very least of Spell Haste 4(not even including cleric BoR) easily bought in the bazaar<br />
Very minimum of ID4 focus(again, very cheap in the bazaar) +20% max to DD.  Lets average this to 10% increase on VS simply because we all know the focus doesn't fire for full every time.<br />
6.63 second cast time, 2 second recast, 1017.5 damage = 117.9 DPS<br />
This also isn't including crits, full DD focus, or resists of course.<br />
Heck, lets do it with Spear of Torment:<br />
4.2 second cast time, 3.6 with SH4<br />
675 base damage, 742.5 DD with 10% DD increase average from ID4<br />
2 second recast= 132.6 DPS<br />
Again, this doesn't even take into consideration AA crits, full focus or resists.<br />
<br />
This is simply from chain casting one single spell as a bazaar/ornate shaman vs. Bst, so as you can see, this is not a low end issue.  This also shows that breaking 100 DPS is not exactly a difficult thing to do.  Considering the fact that even at the high end many shaman are saying they don't even bother to slow the trash mobs in GoD, it means that most likely they aren't taking the time many mention to malo(s)/slow or BotN(if you happen to be lucky enough to have gotten this spell) meaning that all that's left to do is DPS or spot heal.  In a raid situation, unless you happen to be the only shaman on the raid (which is rare from my experiences) then most of the shaman are left to do DPS.  <br />
<br />
Yes, DoT aggro is simply stupid and needs to be either fixed or possibly even some sort of jolt/concussion type spell needs to be given to shaman so they can fully utilize their DoTs on longer high end encounters.  You don't even have to tell me how many times you've been summoned trying to stack DoTs on a particular mob.  This, as well as the minimal healing upgrades shaman have been  given do not take into account aggro, slow mitigation/unslowables, etc.<br />
<br />
SO when I speak of shaman DPS numbers, I am speaking of the high end shaman that you might notice have practically a clicky/focus affect on every peice of gear they own.  After all, this is where the problem lies with the shaman class, at the high end, not the everyday level 62-65 shaman from guilds raiding BoT towers as high end content.  The high end shaman has better focus affects than the numbers I spit out would reflect, as well as AA's, and would require less cannibalization due to greater mana pool/FT/regen, etc.  It's not to say that the class is fine as it is, so don't claim to be putting words in my mouth.  I'm simply saying that in many of the comparisions made here, they are more generalizations made against a class rather than specifics, and it gets tiring being the target of blame for all the existing class problems simply because SOE can't get their heads out of their butts and realize that shaman aren't simply allowed to be competant in Kunark/Velious content and on the brink of uselessness in current GoD content (though we all know the content is screwed anyhow as it wasn't supposed to be released as it was).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Murkk Dakruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">So many grumps in this thread. :D <br />
<br />
Please, ignore the random people that don't know what they're talking about, who take ideas and turn them into something ridiculous like Torpor with no drawbacks. There are silly people like that in every class. Everyone loves a good reason to bitch, congratulations he can be yours.<br />
<br />
Beastlords and rangers have always healed the same up until GoD. Then rangers got an upgrade to their heal and we got group IoS as our Kod`Taz Spell(i.e. the &quot;hardest&quot; to get). Shaman of all people should realize how useless stat buffs are at that level of the game.<br />
<br />
Many suggested changes have been made for Tureptan Spirit. One of those suggestions was just replacing it with the ranger GoD heal. Some beastlords argued that SoE was trying to increase the gap between ranger and beastlords healing, much like they did with druid and shaman healing. In response to this argument(which makes sense) some beastlords suggested that if rangers were going to get better direct heals, like druids, bsts should get better heal over time spells, like shaman.<br />
<br />
We're(well besides random joe bob in that thread) not talking about better HoTs than shaman get. We're talking about a HoT equiviliant to the GoD ranger heal.<br />
<br />
I know you're angry. I know you're bitter. But other classes do have issues. Including  beastlords. How do I know? because i've  played a beastlord longer than you've played a beastlord. It's almost as if some shaman expect us to be discussing shaman upgrades on the beastlord boards.<br />
<br />
Now, can anyone offer a valid reason for our KT rune spell to remain completly useless to 95% of the beastlords that can get it other than &quot;MGB paragon!!!&quot; and &quot;I'm bitter about my own class so nobody else can have issues!&quot;?.</div></div><hr />

Looked into means what again? Ah, that you think the developers made some kind of mistake perhaps, and you were REALLY supposed to get the Ranger heal. Thats not complaining though, asking them to &quot;look into&quot; it. Nice spin.<br />
Do I think we deserve a HoT compareable to Torpor with no drawbacks?  No, however I wouldn't mind seeing a HoT around the healing ability of Stoicism or slightly better with no drawbacks, and the only reason behind this is simply as a bst, a melee class, it would serve no purpose to give us a HoT with a slow componant as nobody would use it other than non-combat heal/med time.  Heck, if they gave us Torpor with the slow/snare componant I doubt you would see many bst use it.<br />
Another fine spin, I must say. First of all, ANY HoT they give to BLs, even Stoicism, would cause me and probably 1000 other shaman to immidiatly quit this game. Wake up. You are really sounding ignorant wiht this line of thought. Nobody would use it, serve no purpose, LOL. You are smoking something, arent you. <br />

Wow. All I have to say is &quot;WOW&quot;. I don't even know how to respond to this line of garbage, honeslty. First of all, at lvl 65, 100 dps is NOTHING!! THATS OUR POINT!! That IF we chain-cast our best nukes and IF we get no resists and IF we have nothing else to do WE SUCK EVER WORSE!! Stop talking about this issue, seriously, you are totally clueless. <br />

<br />
      ... your kidding right? as i understand it, and as i have read it on the beast forums is that a HoT would be a DOWN TIME HEAL, why the f*ck would you use it in combat?<br />
<br />
Also, I am well aware that shaman canni is voluntary and takes up spell casting time, recast, etc.  However, when I am speaking about compareable DPS, I am not speaking of the common bazaar geared shaman.  If I was going to compare to a bazaar/ornate shaman, I would have to do the same with the bst DPS numbers, which would be considerably lower than the numbers I have stated from personal experience.  <br />
<br />
        beast dps in bazaar gear, is considerably higher than shaman dps in ornate, i have parsed my own dps, with 6 dots rotating, i clock just about 220 dps (this is high because im not going to post a huge thing about recasts on bane, ana, odium, yadda yadda.<br />
<br />
I think the common bazaar/ornate Bst at 65 is probably using epic offhand/WLK/GWoC and does maybe 50-70 DPS melee depending on AAs (and I am being generous here).<br />
<br />
      being generous? 50-70 dps is crap, is this just the BST without his pet? without casting a single ice nuke? landing a single dot? is this beastlord slowed? 50 dps is gimp for a 65 beast in bazaar gear, you can break 70 dps just with the bst and his pet, without CASTING.<br />
<br />
Lets compare the same to a shaman with similar ornate/bazaar gear, 61-65 spells bought in the bazaar or lucky drops of specs/runes off BoT named.  As I calculated it:<br />
VS: 925 CR<br />
7.8 second cast time<br />
6.63 second cast time with the very least of Spell Haste 4(not even including cleric BoR) easily bought in the bazaar<br />
Very minimum of ID4 focus(again, very cheap in the bazaar) +20% max to DD.  Lets average this to 10% increase on VS simply because we all know the focus doesn't fire for full every time.<br />
6.63 second cast time, 2 second recast, 1017.5 damage = 117.9 DPS<br />
This also isn't including crits, full DD focus, or resists of course.<br />
Heck, lets do it with Spear of Torment:<br />
4.2 second cast time, 3.6 with SH4<br />
675 base damage, 742.5 DD with 10% DD increase average from ID4<br />
2 second recast= 132.6 DPS<br />
Again, this doesn't even take into consideration AA crits, full focus or resists.<br />
<br />
          ok these numbers are all wrong, with spell haste 4, VS is still 6.63 seconds, wich means ... you would have to cast befor combat ensued, wich means, you can't slow, you can't malos, just cast VS, and casting pre-combat is almost impossible.<br />
the rest of your numbers are crap, and inflated to look like shaman rock, im sorry, but after playing a shaman for 2 years elemental + we are the 4th best healers and dead last on damage.<br />
 <br />
<br />
This is simply from chain casting one single spell as a bazaar/ornate shaman vs. Bst, so as you can see, this is not a low end issue.  This also shows that breaking 100 DPS is not exactly a difficult thing to do.  <br />
<br />
       .... yeah, its not hard to break 100 dps as a shaman, but surviving it is.<br />
<br />
<br />
Considering the fact that even at the high end many shaman are saying they don't even bother to slow the trash mobs in GoD, it means that most likely they aren't taking the time many mention to malo(s)/slow or BotN(if you happen to be lucky enough to have gotten this spell) meaning that all that's left to do is DPS or spot heal.  In a raid situation, unless you happen to be the only shaman on the raid (which is rare from my experiences) then most of the shaman are left to do DPS.  <br />
<br />
        im sorry, this is just too funny, we do dps? hahaha, most shaman i know, sit in the channel and chat it up about comedy shows (chapelle) or something else NON-EQ, or bitch about who gets what loot.<br />
mobs die too fast, BotN recast time is too large to slow multiple mobs, using tirgirs is just looking for a rez, and TA is a rare drop, and usually that only goes to the &quot;officer/highest dkp/most favored&quot; shaman.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, DoT aggro is simply stupid and needs to be either fixed or possibly even some sort of jolt/concussion type spell needs to be given to shaman so they can fully utilize their DoTs on longer high end encounters.  You don't even have to tell me how many times you've been summoned trying to stack DoTs on a particular mob.  This, as well as the minimal healing upgrades shaman have been  given do not take into account aggro, slow mitigation/unslowables, etc.<br />
<br />
     please don't sympathize after you have already tried to plug your classes need for &quot;down-time HoT, that doesn't slow in combat&quot;<br />
 <br />
<br />

<br />
     high end shaman do almost the exact dps as a shaman raiding BoT, AA's are accessible to all, not JUST high end shaman, even with FT 15+ outside clicky mana regens, shaman still use 650+ mana to slow each mob, not counting resists.<br />
right now my mana pool is hitting 5200+ and i can go oom just trying to DPS for 1 minute. even faster if i have to slow/spot-heal<br />
<br />
It's not to say that the class is fine as it is, so don't claim to be putting words in my mouth.<br />
<br />
        im just quoting you, your saying them.<br />
<br />
I'm simply saying that in many of the comparisions made here, they are more generalizations made against a class rather than specifics,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>longfanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">Evidently it's too difficult for some of you to read the details in my reply.  I've already stated that I didn't feel we needed greater healing or self heal, but I would be an idiot to argue if any were given.  &quot;Hey thanx SOE, this new heal HoT is great but because I feel we are fine as we are, I won't try to get this spell&quot; umm, yeah.  Take another look and you will see I plainly stated I didn't feel we needed those upgrades.  There's a difference in between 'need' vs 'wouldn't mind'.  When I mentioned 'looking into it' regarding the ranger heal vs. our group stat buff, it was in regards to the same questions shaman have vs. druid/cleric healing abilities/percentages.  Is it so difficult to ask a question as to why things are as they are?  After all, I do recal a certain GoD shaman spell that was totally changed from a disease DoT to a heal, but of course they couldn't obviously make the same mistake elsewhere right?<br />
<br />
Also, if you take a half a second to check the calculations, the DPS numbers for those craptastics nukes unclude cast time and recast, so don't be an idiot and claim I stated casting as the mob was incoming.  By those values you could start casting at the same time all of the melee engaged the mob and you would make those values.  If chain casting those nukes gets you aggro btw, you need a new tank.  I could understand if it was running mutiple dots by todays aggro issues, but nukes?<br />
<br />
Btw, if you only have gripes about punctuation, don't bother to reply, as it holds no value in this thread simply trying to be an idiot.<br />
<br />
Yes, to put it plainly a bazaar geared bst with the weapons I mentioned will do on average 50-70 DPS melee + 50-60 DPS pet(depending on base or DPoC pet).  This is of course parsing from common teir2-3 exp mobs also.  So for you number crunchers, this means a level 65 bazaar geared bst averages 100-140DPS with melee, spells, and pet.  Obviously as your flagging and gear progresses, so does your DPS. <br />
<br />
Griping because your DPS is low because you are slowing multiple incoming mobs is rather interesting, as if that's your role in the group/raid, you are not expected to be doing considerable DPS at the same time.  Heck, when I am slowing multiple mobs at once, the pet is probably the only DPS seeing as I will be casting slow muliple times per mob without debuff.  This isn't a gripe that we don't get any of the shaman malo line, it's simply a reality that a shaman will utilize debuffs in order to get slow to stick, wheras a bst uses multiple attempts to stick slow.  The resist checks for both Sha's Revenge and Turgers are the same, so they will obviously be resisted just as often given no debuffing.  This has already been proven in a past info search done on these boards in conjunction with the Bst boards, along with basic knowledge of spell data.<br />
<br />
Btw Pinky, if you are using 650 mana to debuff/slow each mob, I suggest you put some points into specialization and some sort of mana preservation item.  My shaman is far from uber, and he doesn't seem to have half your problems.<br />

No one is saying you didnt get the shaft with that spell. WELCOME TO OUR WORLD MAN!!<br />
<br />
Maybe, JUST MAYBE, SOE is looking at it from the same perspective they viewed shamans since Kunark, maybe SOE (and a TON of players, BTW) feel the BL class is pretty darn good now, and doesnt need any new fancy spells or tricks. In fact, maybe SOE even feels (like a TON of players, BTW) that BLs are actually a bit TOO good. <br />
<br />
You have a fantastic class man. Extremely powerful and versitile. A big addition to ANY group or raid. Stop whining because your zipper is stuck. Lord knows a class doesnt exactly HAVE to be upgraded every single chance. Thats PART of the balancing process. Powerful classes get less. Like Shamans for the past 3+ years since Kunark. <br />

More spinning eh? Whats the cast time on Sha's again? Oh yeah, thought so.<br />
<br />
We arent complaining about not being able to do uber DPS, we are complaining that a Time Geared shaman cannot even come within 50 dps of a BAZAAR geared BL who JUST hits attack and sic pet, then stands there. Better? <br />
<br />
If you read ANY of the other threads on this board, all Shamans are asking for is a BIT more utility to bring to a group. A slightly better heal, a slightly better fast nuke, and maybe an MGBable mana/hp regen AA similar to the one our &quot;hybrid&quot; has. <br />
<br />
Lets face it man. Your arguements are falling on deaf ears, because you are sitting here trying to justify the shamans usefullness by QUOTING OUR DPS! Go make those jokes on the Cleric board, ok? We dont think they are funny. <br />
<br />
BLs are SOEs baby class. They are WAY overpowered. THATS why you got hosed on your upgrades, WAKE UP. This is how SOE does it. It avoids nerfing, and instead nerfs by &quot;ignoring&quot; classes. They bring others up while keeping some relatively the same. Do I need to quote links where Shaman have proved that this is EXACTLY what was done to us since Kunark? <br />
<br />
No one wants to see any other class nerfed. But you seem to be complaining about your class, and honestly, ITS HUGE! Even with the lame group IoS its STILL HUGE. You just don't seem to grasp the concept. The LAST thing I want ANYONE at SOE who is working on &quot;class balance&quot; to do is &quot;look into&quot; BLs even the TINIEST bit.

            no, your ARE an idiot, your spouting garbage on someone else's class board about stuff YOU do not know.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Take another look and you will see I plainly stated I didn't feel we needed those upgrades.  There's a difference in between 'need' vs 'wouldn't mind'. <br />
<br />
             im sorry, i was stuck in the mindset that upgrades are NEEDED and not just &quot;wouldn't mind&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
When I mentioned 'looking into it' regarding the ranger heal vs. our group stat buff, it was in regards to the same questions shaman have vs. druid/cleric healing abilities/percentages.<br />
<br />
             what does a HYBRID DPS  class, getting a useless heal have to do with a HYBRID DPS  class getting a buff thats an UPGRADE.<br />
<br />
Is it so difficult to ask a question as to why things are as they are? <br />
<br />
            thats more philosophical than EQ class balance, get back on track.<br />
<br />
<br />
After all, I do recal a certain GoD shaman spell that was totally changed from a disease DoT to a heal, but of course they couldn't obviously make the same mistake elsewhere right?<br />
<br />
            im sorry thats just laughable, the DoT did its damage over two minutes, most things in GoD don't even last 29 seconds, and thats with me doing the DPS on just riwwi mobs.<br />
             we were lacking in healing severly, so your saying you want to Main Heal trials too?<br />
             <br />
<br />
Also, if you take a half a second to check the calculations, the DPS numbers for those craptastics nukes unclude cast time and recast, so don't be an idiot and claim I stated casting as the mob was incoming.  <br />
<br />
     Whoa sparky, im a idiot? your the one with no logical cohessive thought and apparrent knowledge of the wrokings of mathematics, if you include the recast time on those shaman nukes, the DPS drops even more, thanks for bringing that to my attention.<br />
      did i say, you stated the mob was incoming? besides bad logic, mathematical skills, you also lack reading comprehension.<br />
<br />
By those values you could start casting at the same time all of the melee engaged the mob and you would make those values.  If chain casting those nukes gets you aggro btw, you need a new tank.  I could understand if it was running mutiple dots by todays aggro issues, but nukes?<br />
<br />
            doing the DPS i state, was with dots, once again, bad reading comprehension, and running multiple DoTs has never been TODAYS aggro issue, it has been around since Pre-Kunark.<br />
<br />
Btw, if you only have gripes about punctuation, don't bother to reply, as it holds no value in this thread simply trying to be an idiot.<br />
<br />
           what ???!! your simply trying to be an idiot, HAH ! could have fooled me.<br />
<br />
Yes, to put it plainly a bazaar geared bst with the weapons I mentioned will do on average 50-70 DPS melee + 50-60 DPS pet(depending on base or DPoC pet).  This is of course parsing from common teir2-3 exp mobs also.  So for you number crunchers, this means a level 65 bazaar geared bst averages 100-140DPS with melee, spells, and pet.  Obviously as your flagging and gear progresses, so does your DPS. <br />
<br />
                ... now you include the pet ! amazing ! please your last sentence was a sweeping generalization, i will ignore that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Griping because your DPS is low because you are slowing multiple incoming mobs is rather interesting, as if that's your role in the group/raid, you are not expected to be doing considerable DPS at the same time. <br />
<br />
            well as you stated befor, after the first shaman, there is nothing left for the others to do but DPS, so, are you trying to shoot yourself in the foot? also, slowing is an ability, not a role, or a class.<br />
<br />
  Heck, when I am slowing multiple mobs at once, the pet is probably the only DPS seeing as I will be casting slow muliple times per mob without debuff.  This isn't a gripe that we don't get any of the shaman malo line, it's simply a reality that a shaman will utilize debuffs in order to get slow to stick, wheras a bst uses multiple attempts to stick slow. <br />
<br />
           you make it sound as if malos immediately makes it possible to slow a mob. reality check, it doesn't, it just increases the chance too. note how i said &quot;CHANCE&quot;.<br />
<br />
The resist checks for both Sha's Revenge and Turgers are the same, so they will obviously be resisted just as often given no debuffing.  This has already been proven in a past info search done on these boards in conjunction with the Bst boards, along with basic knowledge of spell data.<br />
<br />
                  you have basic knowledge in spell data now too? is that also flawed like your other apparent knowledgeable areas? you forgot one thing, Sha's is a higher level slow, infact was the highest, wich gave it a better level check, wich made it seem easier to land. so much for your basic spell knowledge<br />
<br />
Btw Pinky, if you are using 650 mana to debuff/slow each mob, I suggest you put some points into specialization and some sort of mana preservation item.  My shaman is far from uber, and he doesn't seem to have half your problems.<br />
<br />
                this is just laughable, your shaman is far from uber, of course he wouldn't have half my problems, your probably living it up in Plane OF Valor, getting all your LEET exp's at the Outer Cave camp, and if you had any intelligence you would have clicked my magelo, and wich of course you don't, well, we all know that now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>longfanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">We arent complaining about not being able to do uber DPS, we are complaining that a Time Geared shaman cannot even come within 50 dps of a BAZAAR geared BL who JUST hits attack and sic pet, then stands there. Better?  <br />
So basically you are doing nothing at all then?  You underestimate the class, as broken as it is, if you truthfully feel this way.<br />
<br />
I didn't bring the DPS issue to the boards, the shaman replying to my initial thread did.  I simply took half a second to state the figures.  Btw, regarding slow cast times, yes, our are slightly faster.  This is assuming the shaman is debuffing it before slow of course, seeing as the cast times are nearly the same with focus.Sha's has a 5 second recast, so if it is resisted(and commonly is) we of course need to be prepared to take some hits while we wait for it to repop.  Turger's has a 6 second recast, however I am fairly certain if I were to take the time and parse the two, I could land malos/turgers on a blue mob faster and more often than Sha's.  This isn't an issue of simple number crunching, it's the fact that malos/turgers or BotN will land more reliably and more often than Sha's without debuff.  This isn't even considering the resist rate jumps vs highly resistant or yellow/red raid level mobs.<br />
<br />
I also love the way you keep punching in 'hybrid'.  You do realize that the 'hybrid' limitations started to disappear with the beginning of Kunark right?  You do realize that hybrid classes are their own class, and don't follow the limitations of the parent class concerning abilities and class design?  true, in the lower levels most hybrids are cut and past gimp versions of the 'parent' classes (of course this is origional level 1-50 EQ design) but 51+ they become their own class and the limitations are slowly /shifted/removed.<br />
<br />
At this point it really doesn't matter what gets posted here, because siimply a select few are going to cry and complain that it's all the Bst class fault, and that regardless of the info provided and staring you in the face, regardless of the agreement between the classes concerning shaman improvements, many will still be satisfied with pointing the finger of blame and refusing to admit that WE ARE IN AGREEMENT WITH WHAT SHAMAN NEED.  <br />

              almost ALL our class DPS is done in DoT's, our nukes are too slow, too little, and by doing nothing? what do you mean ? trying to curb my aggro after malos + slow + spot heals + trying to do dps?<br />

           yes, but you decided to bring it here, and your figures are faudulent, and you should have taken more than half a second, maybe a week would do your simple mind.<br />

            Am i reading this crap right? your spouting again, you make it sound like your the only class with slow that gets hit for trying to land it... one second let me get this ...<br />

ATTENTION ALL SHAMAN, BEASTLORDS TAKE HITS WHEN TRYING TO LAND A SLOW ! BUT THEY NEED TO BE PREPARED, SEE'ING AS HOW THEY HAVE A DEF. DISC, HIGHER DEFENSE CAPS, BLOCK, AND OTHER DEFESIVE SKILL ABOVE AND BEYOND US, THEY MUST BE READY !!!  <br />
<br />
<br />
Turger's has a 6 second recast, however I am fairly certain if I were to take the time and parse the two, I could land malos/turgers on a blue mob faster and more often than Sha's.<br />
<br />
              you could land it more often, but not faster, unless you count pre-combat, but, we already had that discussion.<br />

<br />
              why are you bringing up our slow on our board? for what reason? i thought this was about you wanting a HoT, it sounds more like you want a Malos (beast version)<br />

<br />
holy crap, you could see it was a raw mana calc, you must also then know specialization has a CHANCE to lower the mana cost, even maxed out it has a random interval to fire upon.<br />
                 And its not Shammy, its Shaman, a shammy (chamois) is something white trash use to clean thier cars.....Besides BoT isn't that far along.</div></div><hr />

Yes, the obviousness of the issues involving specialization and mana preservation are based on calculations we can't see, simply because they are based on the RNG.  However again, you're the one stating you spend 650 mana to slow a mob not taking into consideration any of this.  <br />
why are you bringing up our slow on our board? for what reason? i thought this was about you wanting a HoT, it sounds more like you want a Malos (beast version)<br />
I was also referring to the speed of getting a mob slowed more often is faster with malos/turgers or BotN than Sha's/wait for recast/Sha's/wait for recast, etc.  How often do you lead with Turgers and chain cast that without attempting to debuff?  I bet very rarely.  Why is that?  Aggro of course, as casting malos/turgers is less aggro than chain casting turgers over and over right?  Btw unless you missed the point, Paragon is a 15 minute reuse AA, not a spell that can be cast at any given time, so comparing the two is something only an idiot would do.<br />
<br />
Omg, you mean I'm a melee class and I have a mini defensive disc and higher defensive caps? /gasp, no way!!  Hey, you're a quick one eh?<br />
then why the F*CK do you want one of OUR heal over times. you already have your own, its called Paragon OF Spirit.<br />
I also very plainly stated I was in no way making a comment that I felt we need a debuff line.  I guess in your superiority you missed that I plainly pointed that out so you couldn't make an issue of it, but you did anyway, lol.  I stated again we didn't need a HoT, but again, it fell on your deaf ears.<br />

I've been looking for a statement regarding this point for a long while now.  I was always curious as to whether it was constant or RNG determined to fire, as well as what % mana preservation it gives for max specialization, as well as now secondary forte and the lesser specialized savings.  <br />
<br />
Btw, my shaman was born long before my Bst, especially since Bst weren't even on the developing table when I created my shaman.  He's not my main now, but don't act as if I am clueless, heh heh.  <br />
<br />
Yes, I agree that by class design, shaman are made to put out DPS via DoTs, however since they haven't given any means of aggro reduction in order to do this, it becomes very limiting as far as use from aggro or mob uptime.  This is why many shaman end up spending points on DD crits and DoT crits for short lived DoTs like Bane.  It's not that this is the answer, it's just that these are the routes that we have to take with the conditions given.  <br />
<br />
Of course a shaman is not going to be invited as a nuker, I would feel pretty bad for the group if I was invited as such.  I just wish SOE would realize that if the unslowable/mitigation, high DPS/Low hp route is the direction the game is heading, that Shaman need to be adjusted as such.  I just get tired though of contantly having random class XX pointing fingers at Bst for all their problems having chose it as my main character.  I made this decision long before PoP and the changes made to make shaman class what it is today.<br />

<br />
I particularly like how you assume I was talking about average equipped Shamans and their DPS. I am talking about the high-high end GoD and until you provide evidence I am gonna tell you, that a Shaman at this stage of the game will not break 180 DPS, and that's if all he does is DPS. For the majority of the fights the Shaman will peak out at about 150 to 160 *without* resists.</div></div><hr />

And do you believe how you are putting these questions out there? Hey, tell you what, show me a BLs best case scenario for DPS, then compare it to that &quot;Chain SoTing&quot; shaman, ok? Give your pet toys, and buff it. You cast your spells, and melee, BEST case. Since your so intent on taking some COMPLETELY fictional scenerio where a SHaman's only responsibility in the group is the &quot;Chain cast SoT&quot;, lets see a BLs. <br />
<br />
See, your putting up an average BL DPS per fight with the BEST a shaman can do. That is so totally unreasonable it makes me puke. Even so, a CLERIC can do BETTER than that. Put up those fictional Cleric numbers where they &quot;Chain cast from the instant the mob gets to the camp&quot; and you will begin to see how ridiculous you sound.</div></div><hr />

The real ideas and changes take place on the individual boards.

There is a new board, but it's a younger crowd there and I don't visit it often as most of it relates to the lower levels I've been through too many times already.

Guys are asking for Fo7, a malo version, a Quiesence, and versions of our *OOW* spells!  <br />
<br />
And then there's the healing whine....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u112"><b>Tastian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p112">Guys are asking for Fo7, a malo version, a Quiesence, and versions of our *OOW* spells!<br />
<br />
And then there's the healing whine....<br />
<br />
The healing &quot;whine&quot; is simply an expansion related question.  Beastlords and rangers have had identical heals since beastlords came into being.  Same heals, same levels, same mana costs, same healing AAs, etc.  With GoD for some reason this was changed and in place of the new heal beastlords recieved a group version of a stat buff most never use.  Nothing else had changed, beastlords didn't get a new HoT with the expansion, a new regen, a better slow, etc.  Nothing changed except rangers simply moved ahead of beastlords with no explaination given.  <br />
<br />
This wasn't an issue of beastlords asking for more healing for no reason, it isn't an issue of beastlords wanting to be main healers or further taking over a shaman position in groups.  It is a change to how things have been since the class was born with no explaination and a spell that doesn't make sense.  Even back during GoD beta most pointed out that group infusion was an almost worthless spell and once it was found the spell dropped in Kod it became an even more obvious issue.  The healing &quot;whine&quot; is very simililar to the change to shaman PoP spells.  <br />
<br />
Yes some beastlords want a heal over time, some want malo, I'm sure some want rapid fire bugged improved harm touch.  However, you have that with every class.  Do you know the main thing most beastlords want?  They want to know why their weapons cap differently and in turn limit weapon selection, they want to know why with GoD rangers are no longer tied with them for dead last place in healing.  Most don't want huge sweeping changes, most know they are in good shape, but they also know there are issues that atleast deserve a response.<br />
<br />
Shaman have issues now and I'm absolutely not denying that and I honestly want them fixed.  I've brought up the issues of DoT aggro, I think shaman need better direct healing and several other changes.  However, you can't just ignore honest and logical questions one class asks because your's is in worse shape.  Berserkers are a dps class with no class AA's, semi-reasonable itemization and a very low class population atm because they still remain unfinished.  Should every other class not bring up reasonable issues until they get attention?<br />
<br />
Some of the issues beastlords have though are issues other classes have had or are currently having.  Just because others are in worse shape doesn't take away from legitimate questions and complaints.  In fact, most other classes at one time or another have wanted similiar changes.  I don't want an arguement or anything and I actually agree with a lot of the issues shaman express and feel they need attention.  Several other classes also need attention and some others just don't need as much.  However, some people are clearly letting their anger at being ignored or gimped or left behind, etc get the better of them.  I'm honestly hopeful that shaman will get some more changes soon that will help them, but we'll have to wait and see.</div></div><hr />

Perfectly valid issue.<br />
<br />
As soon as Shaman healing is brought inline with the healing of the parent class of Rangers, I would feel it absolutely appropriate to get BST healing brought back up to be on par with Rangers.</div></div><hr />

I dont think the biggest problem is the legitimacy of your issues, but rather the priority of them. If there is a &quot;list&quot; of things SOE is going to &quot;look into&quot;, the BL vs Ranger KT drop spell should be pretty darn low, IMHO. When they get there, great. I hope you get that heal, its not something the will make or break or anything. It will give you moderatly better soloability and I am actually in favor of that. I think every class in the game should have some soloability at every level, even if its massibly slower than grouping. However, this particular issue, IMHO, should have a VERY low priority in the overall scheme of &quot;Things that need Fixing&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u123"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p123">The Beastlord class is one of the &quot;darling&quot; classes of the SoE devs:  i.e., the class every class wants to be in regards to power, versatility, and functionality, and also happen to seem to be the classes that the Devs personally like the most.<br />
<br />
They can solo, they can group, they can raid.  They have exceptional power in all three roles.  They bring things to the table that every group or raid wants, in nearly any situation.<br />
<br />
Druids and Necromancers are the other two &quot;darling&quot; classes.<br />
<br />
Beastlords are encountering the infamous &quot;Kunark Wall&quot; now, the wall that the shaman class slammed into after RoK was released.  Back then, the Devs looked and saw that well, heck, the shamans were pretty darn perfect just they way they were.  They didn't really need anything new...so they got nothing new.<br />
<br />
And kept getting nothing new, and kept getting nothing new, and kept getting nothing new...until there came a time that shamans weren't so perfect anymore.<br />
<br />
(pssst...that's now, in case you didn't notice.)<br />
<br />
Most people look around and see the Beastlord class and say well, heck, that class is pretty darn perfect just the way it is.  It doesn't really need anything new...and it should not get anything new.<br />
<br />
You also have to keep in mind that giving anything to a class must be taken into account with the overall view of class balance.  And class balance must take into account ALL of a class' abilities, not just one area.<br />
<br />
For example, let's say that Beastlords are given Malo.  Fine, that doesn't seem too overwhelming...until you look at class balance as a whole.  Without the need to rely on the resist debuffs of other classes, and with the ability to provide resist debuffs to a group or raid, Beastlords effectively just invaded into an area where two classes that don't have a very large number of useful group abilities compete with one another. Mages cannot provide SD/Paragon, nor can they heal.  Shamans cannot match Beastlord DPS, nor can they summon useful items for group use.<br />
<br />
Alright, say Beastlords are given a HoT.  Fine, that doesn't seem too overwhelming...until you look at class balance as a whole.  With the ability to provide stronger healing, Beastlords begin to look attractive to groups who want just a bit more healing power on top of slows...the ONLY realm of extra utility that a shaman provides among the slowing classes.  This might also lure Beastlords into groups that might have chosen and Enchanter, for this is another useful group ability a Beastlord can provide on top of slows, mana regen, and exceptional DPS.  It might even make the Paladins stand up and take notice that a DPS class is encroaching into an area where Paladins currently maintain a toehold...patch healing.<br />
<br />
Giving Beastlords new kinds of spells increases competition in areas where competition is fierce enough, because no matter how Beastlords might think that they want or need a new spell line, they are going to step on the toes of another class if they get it.  This upsets class balance.<br />
<br />
And darn it, don't you know, Beastlords look pretty darn perfect right about now.<br />
<br />
What Beastlords WANT does not coincide with what Beastlords NEED.<br />
<br />
And what scares many Shamans is that, because Beastlords are currently one of the &quot;darling&quot; classes among the Devs, they might get what they WANT instead of what the game NEEDS them to have in order to preserve class balance and give every class a chance to contribute.<br />
<br />
If Beastlords were given Malo and an HoT that was significant enough to matter, and Shamans were not upgraded to function in the new game's philosophy of &quot;kill it fast,&quot; then Shamans as a class would be rendered utterly obsolete.<br />
<br />
And before you talk about &quot;upgrade us now, they can come back and fix Shamans later,&quot; I suggest you go have a chat with the Clerics.  SoE has been feeding them that line for YEARS.  They've been continually shafted by the promise of &quot;change is coming.&quot;<br />
<br />
BTW, this is one of the stumbling blocks besieging the attempts to balance healing among the Priest classes.  No class will discuss changing healing until the problems of their own class are addressed FIRST.  It seems Clerics and Shaman don't TRUST SoE to balance healing without royally screwing things up for their class and rendering them completely undesirable for groups...and I do not blame Clerics in the slightest for this attitude, given SoE's horrible track record of keeping promises they make.<br />
<br />
This may sound silly to you, but remember what I said up there?  That you can't balance an ability of a class without looking at the overall abilities of the class as well?  Well, that applies here too.<br />
<br />
So, to make a long story short....<br />
<br />
Beastlords might WANT malo and a heal upgrade, but they don't NEED them.<br />
<br />
Why?  Because in the grand scheme of overall class balance, Beastlords look pretty darn perfect right now....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u124"><b>Murkk Dakruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p124">Well, you're right on alot of points, But here's the deal:<br />
<br />
GoD came out. Mobs hit harder. Players have more HP's. The new ranger heal is not giving them a new role. All it does is bring them back in line with current content.<br />
<br />
We are not asking for CH here. We are not going to be main healing your groups. We are asking for a new heal or HoT equivilant in power to chloroblast in the content is was used in.<br />

So when a new expansion comes out and mob power increases, everyone should get upgrades to their spells to compinsate....except beastlords?.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u125"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p125">Our bst friends tend to forget 1 thing: YOU GOT SLOW!<br />
<br />
Rangers are a druid hybrid and BSTs are a shaman hybrid. Shaman healing fell behind druid healing because we got slow. And you wonder why ranger get better heals then you?<br />
<br />
Well, BSTs should wait 2 1/2-3 years without getting upgrades to their main spells warder ( = shaman slow), pet buffs ( = shaman canni), SD ( = shaman cripple). Your other spells get upgrades of 10-15% while everyone gets 20-25% upgrades. THEN come back and ask for now stuff.<br />

Why?. Because it happened to shaman and now you're bitter and want everyone else to go through the same garbage?. Maybe I shouldn't be debating balance with a bunch of self-loathing, bitter, jaded people?.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u128"><b>longfanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p128">First off Kurth (sorry to the other shaman here who are talking about this subject rationally) if it's too difficult to pick up a calculator, don't come whining to me because you can't figure out DPS values.  I gave average and best case scenarios of situations that will probably never happen in regards to chaining a single DD, why?  Because it showed possibility because you made such a stink of claiming a mid 50's bst can outdamage a PoTime equipped Shaman(which was stupid at best).  Reality shows that in any group/raid, the primary focus of the shaman class is debuffing, slowing, and backup healing while possibly (depending on the encounter or simply how many shaman are in the raid) doing damage via dots or DD's.  Yes, let me state, once again, that the primary focus of damage for the shaman class is obviously DoTs. However due to aggro, it makes it difficult to fully utilize this power.  If you really want me to write the math down for you however in my previous calculations, I would be more than happy to if it would simply keep your whine to a dull moan.<br />
<br />
Secondly, as stated before, hybrids are not depandant on their parent class in regards to abilities/spells.  Stating issues in regards to the bst vs ranger heal have anything to do with the shaman and druid class healing comparision is doubtful to say the least, as we have never, nor will be a class capable of taking over the role of healer.  Lets face it also, whether the heal is changed or left the same, it won't help much one way or the other.  Those of you who have issues with it 'providing greater soloability' are a little off track, as our heals are only beneficial for downtime(for the most part) and will aid little in allowing us to solo bigger/harder targets.  We really don't have to go into a soloability comparision of Bst and shaman do we?  <br />
<br />
Assuming the spells are left alone, we will continue on as we have with no change.  Assuming that they decide to change in regards to giving a compareable ranger heal or possibly HoT, it would in no way change the class balance or ability of the two classes.  Our abilities are not dependant on monk or shaman abilities, those are simply a starting template, just as paladins have several group heals that are considerably better in ratio than many of the similar hybrid comparisions to their cleric 'parent' at the appropriate level.  <br />
<br />
If Bst fell into this same comparison, we wouldn't have been given a whole different line of slows, we simply would have been given turgurs, as well as better than level 49 shaman DoTs.  However, since we weren't, but given different abilities alltogether, this should show you how the classes have seperated.  Also, the majority of these changes took place before PoP was even released, so I fail to see how we were designed to phase out a class for upcoming expansion ideas when the expansions we were currently in, shaman still had considerable power.<br />
<br />
Also as mentioned above, regarding class upgrade requests, it really doesn't matter whether the request is valid or not.  Regardless if you feel that one class is more deserving than the next for upgrades, it still falls to the devs to decide what they think is the most presisng issues.  Even with all the problems in the high end shaman community, if it came down to class balance issues and priority of class fixes, the shaman class would still be below Berzerkers in this regard as this is a totally broken and unfinished class.  So obviously we can't judge changes/upgrades simply on what your particular class wants/needs.  As said before, hopefully SOE desides to actually listen to their newly appointed class reps and take change/upgrade/ fix requests seriously rather than as previously done by having PR reps handle the class issues when the PR reps didn't even play the class or even the game in many cases.</div></div><hr />

            then why were you showing our NUKE DPS, and saying &quot;OMGZ SO EAZY TO BROKES 100 DPS !!&quot;<br />
<br />
However due to aggro, it makes it difficult to fully utilize this power.  If you really want me to write the math down for you however in my previous calculations, I would be more than happy to if it would simply keep your whine to a dull moan.<br />
<br />
          previous calculations? you mean, the numbers you picked out of your cavernous butt crack ? and the whine remark, well, that just me crying for all of the mathematics teachers in your life.<br />
<br />
<br />
Secondly, as stated before, hybrids are not depandant on their parent class in regards to abilities/spells. <br />
<br />
          then how do you get our spells ? spells unique to the SHAMAN class. i don't see many druids casting stamina buffs, or agility, hell i don't see enchanters casting chloroplast. then ... theres slow, but we will avoid that issue.<br />
<br />
Stating issues in regards to the bst vs ranger heal have anything to do with the shaman and druid class healing comparision is doubtful to say the least, as we have never, nor will be a class capable of taking over the role of healer. <br />
<br />
             as i stated befor, wich you can look up and quote if you will, why did one of the beastlords complain about not being able to spot heal? and several others backed him up on that, am i missing something?<br />
<br />
Lets face it also, whether the heal is changed or left the same, it won't help much one way or the other.  Those of you who have issues with it 'providing greater soloability' are a little off track, as our heals are only beneficial for downtime(for the most part) and will aid little in allowing us to solo bigger/harder targets.  We really don't have to go into a soloability comparision of Bst and shaman do we?  <br />
<br />
                  then why ask for the heal to have no side effects? once again no sense.  <br />
<br />
Assuming the spells are left alone, we will continue on as we have with no change.  Assuming that they decide to change in regards to giving a compareable ranger heal or possibly HoT, it would in no way change the class balance or ability of the two classes.<br />
<br />
       /sarcasm  riiiiiiiiiight, just like giving beastlords a slow within 10% of our best slow did nothing to balance either...<br />
<br />
Our abilities are not dependant on monk or shaman abilities, those are simply a starting template, just as paladins have several group heals that are considerably better in ratio than many of the similar hybrid comparisions to their cleric 'parent' at the appropriate level.<br />
<br />
           since they are a starting template, lets remove your slow, shaman buffs, just from us im saying, what are you? a mage that can't gate or bind, has only a few pet spells, no sow, no hastes, no groups HP buffs, but you do keep SD, SV, and Paragon. and stating a paladin to a cleric is kind of funny, seeing as how the best paladin group heal does 900 hps worth of healing and the best cleric group heal is 10k, and i must mention, for much better efficiency to the paladin heal at lvl 65.<br />
<br />
If Bst fell into this same comparison, we wouldn't have been given a whole different line of slows, we simply would have been given turgurs, as well as better than level 49 shaman DoTs.<br />
<br />
                  and how do you get this information? 75% slow disrupted too much, giving it to 2 classes would have been a developers death wish, and since your Sony's baby boy class, god forbid they have to drop the axe on you /gasp !<br />
              <br />
However, since we weren't, but given different abilities alltogether, this should show you how the classes have seperated.<br />
<br />
             what different abilites? just SD and paragon and some pet buffs? you got most if not ALL of our best abilities, and the best from monk (except FD) and the best pets (god knows where that came from /looks over at the mages)<br />
 <br />
<br />
Also, the majority of these changes took place before PoP was even released, so I fail to see how we were designed to phase out a class for upcoming expansion ideas when the expansions we were currently in, shaman still had considerable power.<br />
<br />
               what changes? you mean you got the 65% slow at lvl 60? in luclin ? was it called &quot;ancient im a f*cking idiot i don't know what im saying on this thread spell&quot;  <br />
<br />
Also as mentioned above, regarding class upgrade requests, it really doesn't matter whether the request is valid or not.  Regardless if you feel that one class is more deserving than the next for upgrades, it still falls to the devs to decide what they think is the most presisng issues.  <br />
           <br />
                 laughable at best.<br />
<br />
Even with all the problems in the high end shaman community, if it came down to class balance issues and priority of class fixes, the shaman class would still be below Berzerkers in this regard as this is a totally broken and unfinished class.  <br />
<br />
            oh i see now, so being a new class, and being unfinished and being that way for just roughly 3-4 months is much worse than being that way for 2-3 years, right ?<br />
<br />
So obviously we can't judge changes/upgrades simply on what your particular class wants/needs.  <br />
<br />
                you're right, we all want desease dots that last 2+ minutes to do thier total damage, don't forget group IoS either!<br />
<br />
As said before, hopefully SOE desides to actually listen to their newly appointed class reps and take change/upgrade/ fix requests seriously rather than as previously done by having PR reps handle the class issues when the PR reps didn't even play the class or even the game in many cases.<br />
<br />
i wish glorianna would put this in the grey, i really would enjoy linking several photo's comparing you to the various chimps and monkeys in the wilds of Africa, well, we can all hope can't we?<br />

       i don't think repeatidly calling me an idiot, or implying i am one, when you present flawed information as *Gospel* to a veteran of the shaman class, is keeping anything civil, you infact struck the first blow, <br />
and on the whole, stirring up trouble part, your the one who came here ( a beastlord ) to the crucible ( a shaman board) and started spouting nonsense, and as to replying to me, i doubt you have the mental prowess to do so.<br />

<br />
<br />
You realise over time Shaman are more efficient healers than any other class out there ?<br />
<br />
Nope neither did we but someone called Thott did and drew lots and lots of pretty but totally ****ing meaningless graphs to prove it.<br />
Now the shaman community knew these graphs were totally ****ing meaningless but dear old SoE decided that because Thott was the leader of 1 of the biggest EQ guilds and could colour in graphs rather nicely that he must be right and Shaman were then hit with the nerf hammer rather hard.<br />
<br />
So when you come on here and post best case scenarios about how &quot;uber&quot; our dps  is that is why i tend to then totally ignore a lot of your other reasonable statements.<br />
<br />
I have nothing against Beastlords getting upgrades PROVIDING their upgrades dont sideways nerf another class be it us or monks.<br />
<br />
Now please answer me this as im kind of curious as to what Beastlords think on this subject.<br />
It has been stated time and time again that Shaman are balanced around their slow and we suffer many penalties because of it (too numerous to mention here but if you really would like to know im sure we could fill you in).<br />
Now Beastlords get a 65% slow (yes i know till 65 beastlord slow isnt really a factor but all these arguments are aimed at the top end game so we'll call it 65%).<br />
What i and probably a lot of other shaman would like to know is what penalties do beastlords suffer for this slow ?.<br />

It makes complete sense therefore that BL healing drops away from Rangers after this one point. Maybe you got a useless spell. Oh well. Maybe you should have had a heal there, but it shouldn't be the Ranger heal. If it is they just took the shaman class over the knee again. They should make a nice new heal for ya, obeying the percentages.<br />
<br />
I'm mean I could add a lot of things to be nice to have but I don't need. For monks Death touch. I mean it'd be nice but I don't need it. Would other classes complain? Definately. (And THEY SHOULD) *<br />

Please point out where I claimed this was considered 'uber' DPS.  This was simply a reply for a few previous posters claiming that they had a difficult time even breaking 100DPS.  This was in no way a claim that shaman have incredibly great burst DPS, and previously stated my thoughts concerning shaman DPS via DoTs and the issues involving this in the current broken content that SOE doesn't seem to be able to figure out in regards to adjusting aggro.</div></div><hr />

You claimed it wouldn't be too hard to break 200 DPS for a Shaman before, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u140"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p140">Also concerning the issue of velium strike, yes, it does suck, I'm not even remotely argueing that.  However, as I showed with the lowest focus affects it will still average 100 DPS without any other dots, pet, AAs, etc.  <br />
<br />
Elder Longfanz Feral Lord<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry my uber dps was sarcasm.<br />
But see in the above quote youre talking crap.<br />
Yes Velium Strike will maybe avg 100 dps but its in an ideal world.<br />
Now which group is going to invite a shaman just so he can chain cast Velium strike ?<br />
None i think is the answer to that.<br />
This is the sort of quote i mean about twisting things to fit your arguments.<br />
Please if youre going to say how easy it is for shaman to break 100 or 200dps then do it in a real world setting.<br />
If we applied the logic in your argument to Beastlords id hate to see how high youre dps would be<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u142"><b>Specter Aldonova</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p142">Had a whole long post to basically just say, I've tried being the DPS in a group and raid situation, and in GoD all it does is get you dead.  Why?  Cause you can't DPS with nukes, too many resists, too much mana, takes too long to cast.  Have to use DoTs and that gets you killed in short order, or yer healer is OOM and you are slowing the group down trying to heal you.<br />
<br />
Far as BLs getting HoT.  No.  I have a BL.  The stuff I could do with ANY kind of HoT, even of the slow/snare variety would be insane.  I say again.  No.  Or, if they do get it and don't fix Shaman significantly, I would give serious consideration to switching mains.  Why suffer?<br />

Edit:  It occurrs to me upon re-reading my post that Shaman still ARE uber slowers, we just don't affect the mob anymore.  How ironic.</div></div><hr />
