<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is just a poll to see how people feel, please do not post arguements or opinions here - there are 2 other threads for that.<br />
<br />
3) Planar Progression.<br />
<br />
Planes of Power has provided us with valuable insight into the group and guild dynamics that are involved in large scale games. The way that we had expected guilds to advance through the story of Planes of Power has become a roadblock for some guilds, and some members have fallen behind and found it difficult to catch up. Obviously this was not our intention. We want players to play with their friends and guild mates.<br />
<br />
To correct this issue, we will be removing the flag requirements for entry into the following Planes of Power zones:<br />
<br />
Bastion of Thunder<br />
Plane of Tactics<br />
Halls of Honor<br />
Plane of Nightmare<br />
Plane of Storms<br />
Plane of Torment<br />
Plane of Valor<br />
Crypt of Decay<br />
<br />
This will make the majority of Planes of Power zones available to everyone, and should allow most guilds to travel and adventure together. We understand that those that have already earned the entry flags for these zones have put some effort into that accomplishment. We will be giving a reward to those that have done so, though you'll have to wait to see what that reward is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I voted for it being good; however, I liked the idea of making the higher tiered zones level restricted.  Like the Plane of Tranquility is minimum of level 46.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Foggy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Removing the PoV/PoS flags is fine, removing the others plain out sucks.  If people are really struggling then at most they should return the alternative entry quests to make them a bit easier, but in no way should they be removing tier3 flags.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Option 4 : Undecided.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think it is good... it gives more viable 60-65 leveling zones to everyone and lets face it if the &quot;non-flagged&quot; didnt or couldnt get the flags for tier 2+ then what makes everyone think they will continue on higher?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Add a 4th option, keep the PoV/PoS flagging requirement because that is actually a reasonable encounter that makes sense.  Get rid of the other flags because they are a bunch of pathetic artificial blocks to content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vermicide</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes I think it was a good idea to remove Tier 3 and 2 flags to get into them, my main has been trying to get flagged for over 2 months now, with no luck at all, and its very frustrating to see people that were 10 levels below you all of a sudden at 65 with 50 AA points ect ect. This gives people the ability to get good exp, and fight amongst their friends once again  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ok, I voted for PoS/PoV only.  Just thinking of it and that is the only real xp for 61+ now.  This will keep people with options, but still give some semblance of progression.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Should be interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think that opening pos/pov would be fine.  Ive tried a few times to get through the trials with a few friends of mine and we fail every time.  The problem is mainly that my friends are not DPS classes.  We can do some cool things together, but we cant pump out enough DPS to get through the trials.  <br />
<br />
My guild has set a minimum of level 60 before they will take any member through the trials.  The problem that I hve with that is that is that that would require grinding out 3 levels, and Im not wanting to grind.  Grinding is too much like work and thats the reason that I play EQ; its not work, its fun.  Im having fun letting the exp come as it may.  If pos/pov was opened I might go, I might not.  Im sure that at 57 Id have my ass handed to me fairly quickly if something went wrong and thats ok.  Im more interested in exeriencing the place than the experience the place gives.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">That ^ is why they call it the silent majority, and the flags are being removed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Actually Itemizing teir 1 would have muffled the howling, along with itemizing teir 2 and lessen the trial a little by lowering the dps requirements.<br />
<br />
I mean really, who do you consider to be really good at their class just because they can pump out short term DPS?  <br />
<br />
People are complaining that &quot;Powerleveled Newbies&quot; are going to be over running their hunting grounds, now how many people did the uber guilds drag though the trials because they needed to zerg?  Think they did quality checks?  How many high leveled idiots do you know who are in uberguild ABC?  Or account swappers, haveing a lvl 65 wizard asking you what the group evac is called is always a highlight of a raid.  The snobs have got their heads up their ass.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm in teir 2 because as Thorzion has said guild is taking those lvl 60 and above though the trials, doesn't matter if your good or not, it matters what guild your in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>howie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I voted to go ahead with the removal of flags.  Reason being.  So what if the zone is open to more people!  As stated by others some guilds carry certain classes through the trials and on to the higher tier zones regardless of their playing abilities.  I've seen chars go from 57 to 65 in a matter of weeks, because their guilds carried them.  Among one of the favorite classes is clerics, not to pick on them, and the char in question was.  This was one of the worst players I have ever seen on my server!  But now because his guild had the firepower to get them through the trials, is titled and 65.  Meanwhile as a shaman LFTG at 59, I am asked to buff groups but not join them.  Screw that, you want my buffs, I'm part of your group.  Remove the flags and the playing field becomes more even.  I can solo mobs that some people who make it through the flagging process run screaming from like little girls.  When the **** hit's the fan and there's multiple mobs beating on me I take the beating land some slows and continue to march, in true battle shaman fashion.  Does a flag make you a better player?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">IMO, a lot of people only group with guildies and friends because they don't want the frustration of bad players in their xp groups.. since I got flagged I can now meet new people and group with everyone there because for the most part, they had to know what they were doing in order to get there.. <br />
<br />
I have yet to see the cleric die and the tank high tail it out of there.. how many times does that happen in pon?<br />
<br />
Most likely the better guilds that get along will exclusively group with each other at the best spots. The other people will feel isolated. <br />
<br />
/ooc inner looking for good cleric</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I voted for the removal of all the flags.  I would hope it would be staggered, and that some kind of level restriction can be placed on at least tier 3 zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Voted PoS / PoV, though I think Plane of Torment should be added because it's lonely.<br />
<br />
Also think they could change the flagging method for the other zones to make them less of a pain in the butt bottleneck. But there should be SOME effort to it - it just shouldn't be totally dependant on having your guild haul you through</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Voted to remove them all.  My explanation is that a friend of mine thinks flag removal is horrible, because it allows all the &quot;unskilled&quot; players in to zones which were previously restricted to them.  I agree with this in theory, but I don't think that any elitist group of players should be able to make some of the best experience zones in the game their own personal playground.  They can go make some unused zone (PoG and PoH have both been updated recently, go knock yourselves out ;)) serve that purpose for them, and I will have no complaint.  But as long as VI wants to make certain zones such good experience in relation to other zones that players are practically required to visit them (that whole horrid Kunark chain phenomena), I think such zones should be open to all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">My concern is that once they remove the flag constraints, they'll also change the experience curves.  I don't care who gets in, but don't tinker with the ZEMs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Krakur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Yea it's fine, whatever.<br />
<br />
The &quot;weaklings&quot; will be weeded out very quickly. &quot;HOLY SH!T IT JUST HIT ME FOR 600 TWICE! SCREW THIS IM GOIN BACK TO POD!&quot;<br />
<br />
It will become quite clear to most people they either have what it takes to do well in tier 2+ or they need to head back to tier 1 and rethink how they play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>SimcimaTZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">their are going to be alot of bodies at the GY, heh heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Every single one of you who say &quot;sure, a few level 46's will go there, but they will leave after they realize they don't belong there&quot; need to think about one thing.<br />
<br />
Much the same as enchanter's ability to charm, the experience gain will so far outshine the experience loss that even in spite of dying constantly, they won't want to go anywhere else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Are they definitely removing the flags for the zones listed in the first post?  (it sounded like an official announcement)<br />
<br />
If so, when?<br />
<br />
As to my opinion...as someone who is a non-guilded casual player, I like the idea of opening up more of the planes.  I also liked the flag idea for a bit to give the uber players a first shot at the new stuff (if someone plays 40 hours a week, they deserve a chance at the new stuff before me), but now that PoP has been out a bit I think it's time to open up some of the other planes to the rest of us.  However, I wouldn't open up a plane unless a certain amount of people were flagged for it...(i.e.;  once it was common for the uber players to go there, then let the rest of us in.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I dont think any flags should be removed, but having a alternate entry quest into PoV/S would be fine.  Maybe the Talisman Gate quest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2 things.  <br />
<br />
First, there are 5 other trials but exec, not all of them DPS oriented.  You need to think differently about the trials.<br />
<br />
Second, there isnt much to experiance in either PoS/V.  PoN/D have more to them then PoV does.  You say you dont want to grind out 3 levels but you want the reward from doing so?  Most of us (90% id say) who are in Tier 2+ still had to grind out those last three lvls in none tier2 zones.  Finally you may not mind if you get your ass handed to you in PoV, but I'm pretty sure the 5 others in your grp do.  Having the shaman die becuase he cant land a slow only leaves a unslowed golem around.</div></div><hr />
