<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Getting a little bit SICK and TIRED of reading the same lame comments in every thread about how I screwed up our class, how I &quot;asked&quot; for nerfs, blah blah blah. Here are a few threads, show me where I EVER said Panther needed &quot;nerfing&quot; beyond the adjustment of the pet proc rate. I even went so far as to say &quot;if the proc rate on pets is reduced to lower than the rate on PCs, I will be bitching&quot;.<br />
<br />
Panther needs a nerf . . .  (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=26263&amp;highlight=Panther+nerf)<br />
Panther nerfed to uselessness (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=26448&amp;highlight=Panther+nerf)<br />
<br />
This is the only &quot;nerf&quot; I &quot;asked&quot; for. No where did I say &quot;add a re-cast&quot;. No where did I say &quot;reduce the damage&quot;. No where did I say &quot;make it group-only&quot;. The ONLY thing I stated, and was fairly vocal about, was &quot;It procced too much on pets&quot;, PERIOD.<br />
<br />
Seriously, I am sick and tired of this bandwagon jumping I am seeing. I am willing to bet that a VAST majority of Shaman thought the proc-rate on pets was too high. I can even QUOTE you some of the Shaman Regulars saying it, in the same threads I was. Now, maybe a lot of you didnt want to come out and say that you felt it was too high, for fear of exactly what happened, overnerf, but I am willing to put money on the fact that NONE of that had anything to do with this whole thing. SOE looked at the spell AFTER the proc-adjustment and said &quot;Its still too high, and has an abusable useage situation that needs to be nerfed as well&quot; and thats where we are now. <br />
<br />
And in case no one has noticed, since the extreme nerfs have been announced, I have been one of the most vocal OPPONENTS of them. I am TRYING to get the spell back into the &quot;Very very strong&quot; category, because right now, 400 damage proc, 1 minute duration, its mediocre, and more a PITA than its worth (you would need to bust ASS to get it to a &quot;respectable&quot; DPS level, as it is).<br />
<br />
So, please, all you people saying I asked for nerfs, saying I betrayed our class, PLEASE start quoting me some spots where I said ANYTHING more than &quot;the pet proc needs to be fixed, its too high&quot;. And if THAT is your &quot;big evidence&quot; of me asking for a nerf, you better start ragging out ALL the other people who said the same, exact thing.</div></div><hr />

They don't need evidence.  The important thing for them isn't what do we do now; the important thing for them is finding someone to blame.  They picked you.  Doesn't matter.  Next time they'll pick me or someone else.<br />
<br />
Those of us who can read know better than to blame you.  Those who cannot read are going to make up their own facts anyway.</div></div><hr />

Really, it's no longer important. The best thing we (shaman) could do now is unite behind one version of this spell that's not totally FUBAR.<br />
<br />
Frankly, Blazz's suggestion of:<br />
<br />
1. Put the damage back up to at least 500 a pop.<br />
2. Put the proc rate on Pets at 2x that of PCs.<br />
3. Increase the duration to at LEAST 5 minutes (including average buff extension multipliers). We arent able to spread the love anymore, no need to make it such a HUGE PITA.<br />
<br />
Looks pretty good to me. I see no reason not to have the proc 550 and it seems unlikely to me that they'll make it 5 minutes, but whatever, I could get behind this. (I'd go more like 550 DD and 2 minutes base...still, whatever)<br />
<br />
The current version on test is a shadow of the original spell. We need to unify our position on what we'd like to see and stick to it.</div></div><hr />

See thats just it. SHOW me where I said anything about a nerf, OTHER than the pet-proc thing, which I felt (and still feel) was WAY overpowered. I mean, lets face it, at 230 dps per-pet, I could pump out nearly 1K &quot;burst&quot; DPS with my pet-army alone, and probably not even have to channel to do it. <br />
<br />
I have not seen many posts recently saying &quot;put the pet proc back the way it was&quot;. That was my ONLY suggested &quot;nerf&quot;, the pet proc &quot;bug&quot;. But apparently, some people inturpreted this as &quot;asking for a nerf&quot;. <br />
<br />
/shrug, its fustrating, thats all. Once one person starts saying &quot;Blazz asked for nerfs&quot;, other people read that, and jump right in. Look at some of those posts. Its almost as if people think I WANTED this spell made useless. <br />
<br />
And through it all, I have been supporting restoring the spell to the old version, WITH the pet-proc fix, and siding with Mac and a few others who want a simple response to the REASONING behind the nerfs other than &quot;because&quot;. <br />
<br />
Look at those threads. Look at the other Panther related threads. Pet proc fix. Anymore I would bitch (and I have). Just pisses me off that so many &lt;100 people wanna jump in and make OUTLANDISH statements like &quot;Stop commenting on our class and asking for nerfs&quot;. I think I am pretty in-tune with the Shaman class and this community. I may have a few controversial opinions, but being labeled like this is VERY annoying. <br />
<br />
Even the mighty Giac, who has been TOTALLY against any nerf whatsoever, said this on 3/24<br />
Mikar never said Panther was broken or overpowered, but that the effect it had on pets was and that's pretty hard to argue against.<br />
To be fair, Giac was never one of the &quot;Blazz asked for nerfs and look what happened&quot; guys, but I use his words as an example of the extent that we, as a community, pretty much realized the pet proccing thing was broken and needed &quot;fixing&quot;. Most of us know Giac as the lovable pessimistic paranoid Shaman that he is.<br />
<br />
What happened is people started saying that a &quot;fix&quot; and an &quot;adjustment&quot; = a &quot;nerf&quot;. Once that ball started rolling, I became the poster boy, since I was pretty vocal about the pet-bug-fix-proc-whatever. <br />
<br />
Anyway, whatever, I hope some of you folks who lambasted me in other threads have now actually READ some of my posts on this topic, posts made before ANY nerf whatsoever, posts made in reponse to SOEs announcement that pet-proccing wasnt working. And next time, dont be so quick to jump on the flamewagon without a few facts. Thats all I am trying to accomplish here. I could really care less what people think of me. Its not the reason I say the things I do. I speak from what I truly believe to be &quot;real&quot; and you can judge for yourself. My goal isnt to get people to like me, all you need to do is look back about 6 months and you will understand that. I say what I feel, you can take it from there. Agree or disagree, respect me or dont, whatever. But I have put PLENTY of time in the trenches in this class to be qualified as a person who &quot;has a right to his opinion, and a reasonable grasp on the class overall&quot;. All I can do it put that opinion out there. If I wanted everyone to like me I would probably kiss a lot more ass, and if you have read ANY of my posts, you will realize I am not a big ass-kisser. <br />
<br />
I have supported SOE and their decisions in the past, because I can truly appriciate the difficulty of trying to &quot;balance&quot; this game. As I said in some other thread, I think the goal that SOE needs to shoot for is &quot;Every class is bitching, but not outraged&quot;, because &quot;Every class is happy&quot; just isnt feasible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The way I see it the &quot;fixing&quot; of PETS over procing on panther was/is not a NERF at all but a Bug fix . Of course thats just my feeling outhers may not agree .<br />
<br />
Now the limiting of panther/Leopard to Group only and the cuting of the proc from 420/550 to 300/400 ... those two things are in my opinion direct NERF's to the spell line . <br />
Apparantly the Dev's / Rytan feel NERFing was needed .<br />
<br />
It is my humble opinion that either ONE of those two NERF&quot;s would have been plenty too &quot;bring under control&quot; the DPS of the Buffs ..<br />
I feel that the combo of the two is TOO strong of a NERF .<br />
<br />
I do think panther in this form will still be good enough to be useable . I likely will still use it in this form . But in my opinion It will not be as strong as it &quot;should be&quot; .<br />
<br />
Anyway Blazz I dont blame you for the NERFing of this spell and I think that anyone who does is kinda .. well wrong .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I wanted to add that I still think the fact that pets were proc'ing more than SoE intended them to is hard to dismiss, but I would have never said that *before* they had announced the change to pet proc rates.<br />
<br />
Even after that I gave a reasonable argument for why the pet proc rate could have been left untouched and that is the big, solid argument Rytan has been ignoring, STACKABILITY. DPS classes ain't just DPS classes because they add a lot of damage, but because their damage is infinitely stackable.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I just wanted to clarify this, and stand by what I said about pet procs and them being overpowered compared to PCs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you want to blame someone blame SOE they do this crap all the time. <br />
<br />
As to this being useable every spell is useable but this makes it to much trouble. The DPS is way to low for the PITA that this spell is. If you wish to cast it great, I wont. Will I guess at this point it is kind of silly of me to post because I wont be playing untill this is changed. If its not, hello real life. See you all in the funny pages</div></div><hr />

<br />
was blazz the first one to cry out for pet nerf? no probably not, and its not right to point fingers at him.  <br />
<br />
there is more nerf to the spell than is being listed on the forums.  and its already active.  panther is now resisting alot more than before...i casted it on my pet today in unthac or dulac or torigan (was farming meat and parts), the first 12 times the pet proced it...there was no follow up spamm...mobs were resisting it ALOT.  thats significant.  add that to the 30 sec recast (3 targets max can wear panther) dmg nerf, and group target only nerf...yeah i can see me unmeming this spell in favor of cripple again.  12 resists on panther against light blue and green mobs...thats wasting my mana.<br />
<br />
next time we start to agree that a spell needs a nerf, i hope we remember that it never stops at a simple, sensable tweak...it has always ended in a serious nerf into oblivion.  next time we neeed to fight tooth an nail agaist other classes and othe forums and defend what was thankfully given to us, one of the few treats afforded to shaman since velious</div></div><hr />

Now, I don't blame any shaman because in the end we are all in the same boat, but the sad truth of the matter is this is how things go.<br />
<br />
Had we not said anything and just waited for the Pet proc adjustment things probably wouldn't have gone this bad. But ultimately, it's Rytan and SoE's fault for really not listening and just going with whatever they want, not what we want.<br />
<br />
Some of us tried to be mature and agree that a spell had an issue, now we are all faced with a new spell that really adds nothing. If this spell will be the mainstay of our class re-envisioning, I will be sorely dissapointed.<br />

Advocating an adjustment is a advocating a Nerf (albeit a small one).  However, I will agree with you that you did not call for a gutting of the spell, nor any radical changes.  You certainly have been an eloquent and vociferous advocate againt the current abomination.<br />

In 6 years of dealing with SoE, I have learned that acting like calm rational individuals gets a group nowhere.  What crazy business model they must have (I am sorry, that assumes facts not in evidence).  If they were in a &quot;real&quot; service business, they would have been out of business long ago.<br />
<br />
It is sad that they require people to act like idiots and fools for them to pay attention.<br />
<br />
I have said all along you must contest even the pet nerf if the spell was to remain useful.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>mojoejojo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Getting a little bit SICK and TIRED of reading the same lame comments in every thread about how I screwed up our class, how I &quot;asked&quot; for nerfs, blah blah blah. Here are a few threads, show me where I EVER said Panther needed &quot;nerfing&quot; beyond the adjustment of the pet proc rate. I even went so far as to say &quot;if the proc rate on pets is reduced to lower than the rate on PCs, I will be bitching&quot;.<br />
<br />
Panther needs a nerf . . .  (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=26263&amp;highlight=Panther+nerf)<br />
Panther nerfed to uselessness (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=26448&amp;highlight=Panther+nerf)<br />
<br />
So, please, all you people saying I asked for nerfs, saying I betrayed our class, PLEASE start quoting me some spots where I said ANYTHING more than &quot;the pet proc needs to be fixed, its too high&quot;. And if THAT is your &quot;big evidence&quot; of me asking for a nerf, you better start ragging out ALL the other people who said the same, exact thing.<br />
<br />
OK Blazz, I'll tell you how I see it.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am all for pushing for our class to maintain its strengths, both groupwise, raidwise and solowise, but lets not be completely insensetive to the needs of the GAME overall. Panther proccing at 2x rate on pets is an AWESOME spell, an amazing jump in our DPS. Right now, its insanely overpowered on pets, period.<br />

Honestly people, do some of you even have the SLIGHTEST concept of balance? <br />
<br />
This spell is proccing 4-5x more when cast on a pet, compared to a player. Somewhere in the middle is a common ground thats fair, reasonable, and STILL makes this a DAMN good spell line. 2x maybe, or 2.5x, but not the 4-5x we are seeing now. Its HUGELY broken like it is.<br />
<br />
&quot;Insanely overpowered.&quot;  &quot;HUGELY broken.&quot;<br />
<br />
What we are getting is insane, huge fixes for your insanely overpowered, hugely broken words.<br />
<br />
No, you didn't call for adding a recast timer, or some of the other insanity that SOE is throwing around, HOWEVER, this is the first time I can recall ANY class member calling for a NERF, (and yes, calling for a reduction in the power of a spell is a NERF) of their own class power, that I can recall.  I don't recall any bards saying &quot;Swarm kiting is way over powered.  We should be limited to kiting 4 mobs, instead of 20.&quot;  I don't recall anyone on &quot;team manaburn&quot; saying &quot;We really shouldn't be able to take out raid level mobs with a 6 wizzy team.&quot;  <br />
<br />
What in your &quot;Insanely overpowered&quot;  &quot;HUGELY broken&quot; massive ego, made you think that SOE would listen to YOUR &quot;suggestion&quot; that pet procs should be reduced by 60%, give or take?  When members of our own class (and no, you were not the only one, but in my reading, you were certainly the most vocal) are saying something is, and I quote, &quot;insanely overpowered on pets, period.&quot; and &quot;HUGELY broken.&quot;  Did you really expect SOE to follow the roadmap of your reasonable suggestion?<br />
<br />
What you SHOULD have been doing, (in my humble, and entirely unimportant opinion) was calling into question the &quot;theoretical&quot; numbers of  the calculator number crunchers, and pointing out the real world reality of the average shaman, instead of thinking up theoretical ways that the maximum theoretical benefit could be realized.<br />
<br />
I'm a decently equipped and AA'ed shaman, and in my &quot;real world&quot; experience, keeping Leopard (no, I dont even have panther yet) on more than 2-3 pets, even within my own group, is a CHORE.  My first priority is still to debuff and slow the mob, then spot heal, RGC, and cure, as needed, THEN cast Leopard on pets and PCs.  Unless fighting a raid level mob, the target is probably already below 60% at this point, and will be dead well before the spell has dropped.  If it is a raid level mob, it is a virtual guarentee, that I'll be doing primary duties for most of the fight, and doing good to throw leopard on a few pets as I'm able.  I have yet to be in an encounter in which Leopard changed the outcome.  At best, it helped kill a mob a little faster than it would have been killed.<br />
<br />
THEORETICAL numbers where a shaman with 11K mana pool, maxed mana regen from spells and AAs, etc, with NO other job but to cycle through his preset hotkeys, spamming Panther on every pet and melee, is ONLY going to cause a mob to die faster, IF EVERYONE else in the raid does their part.  If the clerics and spam healers dont keep the MT, RT, etc. alive, guess what.  Leopard/Panther wont make a difference.  In other words, Leopard/Panther just hastens the death of an already defeated mob.  It will NOT snatch victory from the jaws of defeat<br />
<br />
What Leopard/Panther DOES do, is allow me to solo, with an option besides root rot.  It didn't make Dogdog any less delicate, but it does make him worth pulling out in a solo situation.  THIS is reality (such as EQ can be).  It also allows me to contribute more than slow and spot heals to a group.<br />
<br />
As I posted in response to one of your early threads,<br />
<br />
SOEs historical record of REASONABLE nerfs, is not in our favor.<br />
<br />
I do think your intentions were well ment Blazz, but words do have meaning, and when you use extreme words, sometimes you actually get what you ask for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">You sure had a part in the original process as well...<br />
Where? Show me? I have YET to see a quote of me ASKING for a NERF.<br />
<br />
Oh wait, thats right, admiting that there is a probable bug that needs fixing is the same thing, right?<br />
<br />
And mojo, my only response to you is simple. Do you wonder why SOE doesnt request player input? Do you wonder why the &quot;test&quot; system really does fail miserably at times? Do you wonder why SOE seems to have the attitude that the players dont know whats best? Your post sums it up in a nutshell. If theres a obvious bug in the game, DONT TELL ANYONE! Use it to your advantage! <br />
<br />
Man o man, what is the state of this game when flaws cant be pointed out by players or its considered calling for a NERF. I stick by my original assessment. The pet-proc BUG was abusively BROKEN and OVERPOWERED. Do you HONESTZLY think that once SOE looked at that they WOULDNT look at the rest of the spell?<br />
<br />
Whatever. I guess I am just always gona be the guy who discoveres he got 10 extra bucks change at the grocery store, and returns it. You be whatever you wanna be, ok?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Bengali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">So people honestly think that SOE changed panther's damage, target and pet proc rate because Blazz said that it was &quot;hugely broken&quot; on pets? <br />
<br />
I don't know why anyone thinks that the spell wouldn't have been changed even if no shamans said anything.  Rytan posted the theoretical max damage numbers for Panther, etc. and thought that they were too high.  It's not like Blazz sent those to him or asked Rytan to do those calculations.  It's not like Blazz supplied the logic that the devs used in making their changes to it.<br />
<br />
And of course, there were plenty of other people who said there was absolutely nothing wrong with the spell.  Yet for some reason SOE ignored all of those people, and it's Blazz's fault.  I guess the idea is that the devs look through all of the various posts made by people regarding the game, pick out only those that suggest nerfs to particular areas, and then proceed to nerf not only what was suggested, but whatever else they can get their hands on as well.<br />
<br />
Ah, but this is a case where a member of a class suggests that something about their class is broken because it is too powerful.  So what?  Just because a class member says a spell is too powerful doesn't mean that it is, just as class members saying that a spell is perfectly fine doesn't mean that it is either.  For the record, however, I do remember at least some bards and chanters suggesting that swarm kiting and charm were too powerful, but whatever.<br />
<br />
If Blazz had suggested a nerf to a spell that didn't need nerfing at all, do we think that the devs would have nerfed it just because he suggested it?  Maybe I should test this myself by posting that ferocity is overpowered on the beastlord boards.  Then I will get ranted by dozens of my fellow beastlords who would disagree with me, but nonetheless the red phone will start flashing wildly at the Rytancave and it will get changed to a group-only spell that can only be cast during solar eclipses.</div></div><hr />

Like I said at the end of my last post Blazz, I think your intentions were good, but SOE isnt the local grocery store, and your own words of hugely broken, and insanely overpowered, I think were way over the top.  The spells POSSIBLY needed some MINOR tweeking, and while you essentially said that in your posts, you finished in your closing statements, by basicly saying they broke the game.<br />
<br />
I respect your experience, and your taking time to share in these and other forums, but I also think you should try remembering back when you were a younger shaman.  As I have used, and have even been able to use these spells, they are not at all broken.  That they were subject &quot;abuse&quot; is I believe, still an open question.  Like I said above, I dont believe even if &quot;abused&quot;, that they would change the results of most any encounter, simply get it over a bit faster. <br />
<br />
I stand by my opinion that SOE CANNOT be bargained with, and that their every reaction is an over-reaction.  I believe history supports this.  No, I dont think it is &quot;Blazz's fault&quot;, but I do believe that if we had maintained a more united front, the (proposed) nerfs would not have been so drastic.  My only hope now, is that the nerfs, once finished, are not so severe, that these spells take up a place on page 50 of my spell book.</div></div><hr />

IF Rytan gets emails from his boss asking what's going on with the shaman community, he'll have your posts all over the reply. &quot;Even shaman saw it was overpowered and needed adjustment.&quot;<br />
<br />
That's all that's needed. Thanks for making it that much easier for them. And thanks Grizlor, for making it that much easier for them (nice parse).<br />

Well what the **** do you expect? Don't EVER ask for any kind of reduction in power to your own class. Hopefully next time ppl just enjoy what they got.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>kazuyal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I don't blame anyone except for the person that made this damn spell. Its becoming a very fu**ed spell and all this fuss over a ONE MINUTE buff is extremly LAME. I don't see how one can cast this buff on 30 people in a raid. (yea i know 30 is a little high, just saying is all.) After you hit maybe the 4th person you have to start over. Its NOT WORTH IT for crying out loud. I'm thinking about putting this spell away and forgetting it ever existed. A million threads over a one minute buff.... Yea, I blame the person that created this spell in the first place. It's lame and so not worth it.</div></div><hr />

Give me a freaking break.  I said you had a part in the first part.  We all did who posted.  You sure are defensive.  Now you come back with this Holier than thou gimmic about how you were doing a service to the game, returning 10 dollars you found, holy crap you are a lamo.  You are such a joke.  And your week off, I think Brohg is a correct, a drama-queen attention whore.</div></div><hr />

Whatever, I took a few days, then I just got to thinking about exactly what I had said in those other threads. So I went back and read them, and low and behold, all I ever said was &quot;the pet proc is broken, too powerful, fix it, and we'll be fine&quot;. <br />
<br />
Attention whore? Think what you will. It was MY name being bandied about, and some even went so far as to actually BLAME me, specifically, for the nerfs. <br />
<br />
The reason THIS post went up was specifically related to the posts in the &quot;rytans final version&quot; thread, where 3 posters in a ROW said bull**** like &quot;havent you done enough already&quot; and &quot;ask for nerf, this is what you get&quot; etc etc. More of the same. I think, and still truly believe, that MANY of the people who were so quick to jump on the flamewagon and start slamming me NEVER even read my original posts on the topic. Yeah, I said HUGE and INSANELY, cause they were. 250 dps on a pet is damn huge, especially in a raid situation. Made 1K dps steady a very easily achievable norm, and jacked up the burst potential over the roof. Say what you want about &quot;oh no, now the encounter lasts 3 minutes less&quot; or &quot;oh no, why is it so bad we can do that kind of DPS&quot; and I will come RIGHT back with &quot;Because its bad for the game to have spells broken like that&quot;. <br />
<br />
Thread has my name on it Brogh, no one forced you to click on it. Title is pretty self explainatory too. Next time, skip it, ok? Probem solved. <br />
<br />
No worries though. I am seeing exactly how some of you think now. And I will say it again, its no wonder SOE does some of the crap they do, since the players cannot be trusted to even evaluate certain situaitons or the integrity to report broken applications. Stand there and say &quot;Who me? I didnt think 250/pet was all that strong&quot; all you want too. The ones who REALLY bug me are the ones who say &quot;even if it is broken, even if it is a bug, if its in your favor, keep your mouth shut&quot;. Thats pathetic. <br />
<br />
I got what I needed out of this thread, reassurance as to exactly who the people are that are actually interested in helping this class, and exactly who the people are who would rather &quot;get over&quot; with something, then lay blame as they see fit, because heaven forbid I was RIGHT about it in the first place. And your all only fooling yourselves if you think SOE would never have touched a thing if everyone had kept their mouth shut. <br />
<br />
So is everyone done quoting my nerf-requests? I concede the &quot;hugely overpowered&quot; point, and stick by that opinion still. Funny how after the nerf 90% of the posters said &quot;OK the pet-proc thing does look like something that wasnt intended in the design of the spell (which means BUG not NERF)&quot;. <br />
<br />
And you just keep that 10 bucks m9, and dont lose any sleep over it, and dont sweat that cashier who made the blunder when her drawer comes up short. You can probably even convince yourself she deserves whatever happens because its her fault in the first place. You clearly dont even understand that simple metaphor.</div></div><hr />

Man, did you even read my posts? I said VERY loudly, as loud as any opinion I ever said, &quot;Anything beyond the pet-proc fix would be over the top and unacceptable&quot;. Cripes I think EVERYONE said that. No one &quot;asked&quot; for more &quot;nerfage&quot; than that. <br />

Classic. I bet my name came up at SOE Dev HQ, I can hear em now in the Conference Room &quot;This Blazz guy thinks we should fix the pet proc, but since he is so vocal, lets nerf the piss outta the spell!&quot; Then, another guy came in and said &quot;And did you see this parse Griz did, proving the proc rate is pretty broken and unbalanced. Hey I know, instead of just fixing that, lets add a 30 second recast! They are asking for it!&quot;, and then, another dev runs in and says &quot;Wait wait, theres a bunch of Shamans who think the pet-proc thing looked like it wasnt intended in the design, they MUST mean they want us to nerf it to Group-Only, cut the damage 30% AND fix the proc thing! TRIPLE DINGER!!&quot;<br />
<br />
What a genius concept you have here, Khoz, seriously. <br />
<br />
You ignore all the bugs in the game you want too. You ignore all the broken crap you want too. You should probably just re-install Diablo 2 and go back to playing that. It was a BUG. It was OBVIOUSLY a bug. The fact that it was in our favor DOESNT CHANGE THAT. And the fact that YOU think its OK to try to let that crap slip by in the game is a pretty loud testament to your overall attitude. However, I will continue to call it as I see it, even if some of you think thats the same as &quot;asking for a nerf&quot;. <br />
<br />
The part that really gets me, though, is that you actually think that me, and Griz, and anyone else who admitted frankly that the pet-proc rate seemed pretty extreme, actually CONTRIBUTED to the nerf. I mean, asking for the pet-proc to be fixed is the same thing as asking for 150 less damage and group-only, or a 30 second recast, right?<br />
<br />
If the phone rings, and its NASA calling, its NOT for you, trust me.<br />
IF Rytan gets emails from his boss asking what's going on with the shaman community, he'll have your posts all over the reply. &quot;Even shaman saw it was overpowered and needed adjustment.&quot;<br />
Needed to have the pet proc BUG FIXED, thats the &quot;adjustment&quot;. Show me ONE SINGLE post where anyone said it needed nerfing beyond that. Oh wait, you cant. <br />
<br />
I forgot, you are on the &quot;if you ask for a bug to be fixed, your asking for a nerf&quot; side of the fence. LOL, hilarious, it really is. If it wasnt so pathetic I would be sincerely amused.</div></div><hr />

Holy crap, now he is trying to use the guilt trip about how we were somehow STEALING from SOE if we didn't scream to the rooftops about how overpowered we were before.  You certainly are a drama queen.  Hrmm, drama queen..flair..attention whore..it all adds up to something.  <br />
<br />
Blazz asked for a change that is a reduction in actual DPS of the spell:  YES.<br />
<br />
That is a fact.  <br />
<br />
Just because you don't like how they implemented a change that YOU asked for doesn't mean you are on the side of the people that were asking for no change until all this class balancing crap was sorted out.    You can't change teams now bubba.  Any intelligent person knew that SOE would hork this up and make a mess of it.  That is why many, even though they knew it might be a little powerful, took the stance of waiting until all the changes went into effect with all the classes before saying anything.  Instead, little 'miss goodie' Blazz decided to bellow on and on about how it is too powerful and breaks the whole game.  Now you see what it has gotten us.<br />
<br />

<br />
Oh yeah, as for your BUG, that you like to call it.  Have they fixed that pet proc rate thing yet?  I'm sure they saw it as a bug since they decided to nerf the spell on PC's too...you sure are a scientific rocket.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rytan's boss:  Rytan, I'm getting angry emails and threats of cancellations from the shaman community (again).  They all say that you are single-handedly destroying the shaman class.  What in the name of Quellious did you do, man?!<br />
<br />
Rytan:  I nerfed Panther.<br />
<br />
Rytan's boss:  Why?<br />
<br />
Rytan:  Well, even shamans thought it was overpowered and needed adjustment.  Check out these posts from Blazz.  He even called it &quot;insanely&quot; and &quot;hugely&quot; overpowered because the proc rate on pets was more than double that of players.<br />
<br />
Rytan's boss:  Ah, I see.  If a shaman player used words like &quot;hugely&quot; and &quot;insanely,&quot; then it must be warranted, because those guys never exaggerate.  So I presume you nerfed the proc rate for pets?<br />
<br />
Rytan:  That, and so much more.  I nerfed the proc rate on pets, lowered the damage by 25%, and made it group-only.  I figured, &quot;hey, as long as I'm nerfing something I might as well nerf some more stuff too.  Particularly since shamans liked the old version, and it is my life's mission to crush their hopes and dreams under my steely-toed boots like so many over-ripe grapes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rytan's boss:  Excellent.  The &quot;Abashi Gambit&quot;.  Well played, my good man.  Well played indeed.  All is falling into place.  This move should force more of our discontented players to our competitors, where they will sow the seeds of disdain and topple those games from within.  And together, we will bring order to the galaxy, as father and son!<br />
<br />
Gotcha.  Instead of pointing to the 10-page discussion thread on EQLive, and the numbers he posted about how they estimated Panther added 600 dps per shaman, and the *responses* from people to those numbers, and the alternative suggestions made by players, and any internal discussions that the dev team had after looking at the numbers, Rytan is simply going to point to an apparent concession from Blazz that the spell needed fixing with respect to pets.  Cause that's all you need to justify yourself when the heat is on.  Okay.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, what we were told on the beastlord boards that the bug was with all pets and proc buffs:<br />
<br />
Just wanted to pass along some information real fast about how the shaman panther line is working with pets.  This is what's been said...<br />
<br />
&quot;&quot;There's a specific bug with pets that are causing them to proc much more frequently then they should with these spells. We should be getting that fixed next patch. -Ryan&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
When asked for clarification we were told...<br />
<br />
&quot;&quot;The bug is actually with all pet proc buffs, but the only ones we really feel need changing are the panther line of spells.  So we'll be fixing the problem with them procing more and then upping the specific pet spells to compensate and retain the same rate as before.&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't know for sure, but it's possible that the bug went largely undiscovered because beastlords are the only ones who regularly rely on proc buffs for their pets, and the proc rate for beastlord pets was where the devs wanted it to be.  So now they are fixing the bug that made pets proc too much (which should largely go unnoticed by pet users) and instead giving the specific pet-only proc buffs (beastlord buffs, epic 1.5/2.0 buffs for mages &amp; beastlords) an increased proc rate to match what they were before.<br />
<br />
I have no idea whether they've actually changed those spells though.  It's possible you'll see a lot of angry beastlords and mages come Tuesday if they haven't.</div></div><hr />

Call it an educated guess, but there simply is no other spell where pets proccing it a little more often matters. Procs on weapons, proc buffs and procs on mage gear are so small that it hardly matters if pets proc them 20 times as much as players. Up to panther the only procs that are actually noticeable in the grand scheme of things have been self only.<br />
<br />
At the same time hundreds of encounters largely base their difficulty on the amount of procs the MOBs produce. Any global change to NPC procs would result in months of retuning encounters.<br />
<br />
And that would be my guess why panther got hit with the bat, but pet procs did not. There is no other player castable spell where this would matter, while there certainly are a lot of encounters where SOE does not want to change proc rate at all.</div></div><hr />

So it isn't that pet proc rates are broken..I mean they are happy with how much DPS the BL procs do.  Now much DPS pets do with NDT on them.  They were just not happy with how much DPS pets were doing with OUR proc.  <br />
<br />
Would seeing this not tell the educated person that they aren't going to nerf ALL pet procrates since they are happy with the DPS from other proc spells?  That the probable thing would be that they nerf our spell only.  That is what happened and that is exactly what many were afraid of.  SOE doesn't always make sense, but they are fairly predictable.  <br />
<br />
I think this is why some are 'irritated' that people were calling for a nerf of the DPS. Whether you say the pets were procing too much or that the spell did too much damage per proc.  The key was TOO MUCH DPS ON PETS.  This could be solved by nerfing the procrate on ALL pets, or nerfing the spell.  Which do you think SOE was going to do?  Some people knew.<br />
<br />
I hope this is a good lesson learned on how to deal with SOE.  It might be a painful one, maybe a slightly painful one, we shall see.  However, I think we should take the 'wait and see' approach in the future before calling for a nerf to ANYTHING we have.</div></div><hr />

Wrong. Pet proc rates are broken. It just did not matter until panther hit the table and now SOE is curing the symptoms instead of curing the disease, most likely because they know it would take months to then fix the parts of the game that depend on this broken mechanic. This may sound like the situation you are describing but is actually a little different. Let me explain (and please correct me if I interpret you wrongly).<br />
<br />
Your scenario: Pets should proc x times more often then players. A new shaman spell gets introduced and interacts with a legit mechanic (pets proccing more often) to create high DPS. SOE nerfs spell.<br />
<br />
My scenario: Pets are proccing more often than they should as a side effect of legacy mechanics. This is broken. But it does not really matter on the currently available spells. Pet buffs are coded with the higher pet proc rates in mind. A new shaman spell gets introduced and due to an enormous oversight said spell was balanced for being cast on players only. SOE nerfs the spell.<br />
<br />
I think this is why some are 'irritated' that people were calling for a nerf of the DPS. Whether you say the pets were procing too much or that the spell did too much damage per proc.  The key was TOO MUCH DPS ON PETS.  This could be solved by nerfing the procrate on ALL pets, or nerfing the spell.  Which do you think SOE was going to do?  Some people knew.<br />
I will give you an analogy. Let's say the next patch gives wizards the ability to deathtouch everything at will. You are solely responsible for choosing whether or not that ability gets nerfed. You know that if it gets nerfed it will be made utterly and completely useless.<br />
<br />
Now, according to your logic you would leave a gamebreaking ability in game, right? My point here is this: If an ability is overpowered it should be reworked. If that is not possible it should be removed from the game. And as players of this game we should not prefer to leave an overpowered ability in the game simply because we fear we will get an underpowered ability back. We should aim for a balanced ability instead. What that means is a little muddy. But pretending something is fine when you know it is not does not help anyone.<br />
<br />
As often as I disagree with Blazz I would never fault him for expressing his honest opinion, much less for suggesting that maybe pets should only proc a little more often then players instead of proccing several times as often. If you think he (and the others who have been saying as much) is wrong just list your reasons. If the best you can do is &quot;well, I am wrong, but I would rather play an  overpowered class then possibly play an underpowered class.&quot; then I don't think you have any place issuing moral judgements.<br />
<br />
I hope this is a good lesson learned on how to deal with SOE.  It might be a painful one, maybe a slightly painful one, we shall see.  However, I think we should take the 'wait and see' approach in the future before calling for a nerf to ANYTHING we have.<br />
Funny, I thought stating &quot;well, the pet damage may be a little high, how about we just make pets proc it as often as players&quot; was pretty much taking the &quot;wait and see&quot; approach. Unless you are trying to tell me no ability should ever get nerfed, no matter how overpowered it might be?</div></div><hr />

Your splitting hairs now, and you seem to have not even read what Murtak said. <br />
<br />
They probably knew they were broken, but didnt bother to fix them, because in the grand scheme of things, it wasnt that significant. Along comes Panther, and suddenly pets, even Boo Boo and Chanter Animations, are 250 dps machines. <br />
<br />
Whatever m9. Bury your head in whatever pile of horsemanure you want too. Justify yourself any way you want too. Sit back and say &quot;It wasnt a bug, it was JUST FINE&quot; all you want too. <br />
<br />
I will say this though, IF the pet proc thing has been put back to its original rate (28x/min, compared to 10x/min for PCs), then perhaps the double-nerf (Group Only + Reduced Damage) was the only alternitive they could come up with, other than an abusive re-cast. However, I have seen some numbers on the new pet-proc ratios that seemed to indicate it went from 26-30x/min to 16-18x/min. Heres what I am basing my assumptions on, though, I have nothing more current:<br />
Therefore if things stay as they currently are on Test, leopard/panther will go off 4.3*4 times a minute, or 17 times a minute. That's still an order of magnitude above player procs but a good chunk below the 30 or so you'll currently get from a fully buffed pet.</div></div><hr />

Which team are you on today?  The we are too powerful one or the we are not powerful enough.  As for the pet proc, they probably reduced the base procrate on the spell.  This would change it for players AND for pets.  Even better eh..  They didn't seem to change the procrate on the BL spells, so either some pissed off BL's or they didn't change pet procrate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">sorry, this is really ridiculous...<br />
blazz was absolutely right that the proc rate on pets was too much and that the rest of the spell was ok.<br />
that is reasonable, talking about this might have helped not overnerfing that obviously overpowering part of it (i guess no one ever talked about an overpowering tool as open as we did), it didnt work, sony nerfed with the large sledgehammer again, but blaming/getting personal with blazz for trying to talk about its is .... sorry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">No, Blazz didn't get a spell nerfed all by himself, he simply doesn't have that kind of influence with soe.  None of us do.<br />
Yes its a myth you were asking for nerfs.  You were asking for one specific nerf, not lots of em.  Those around you were saying 'hey, they'll screw it up'.  I'm still shocked that the over-nerf surprised you.<br />
Of course, the reasoning behind the pet nerf was flawed from the beginning.  Blazz, I've seen you post claims from anywhere from 2.8x to 4-5x pc proc rate.  Even Mikars original post on eqlive site that got us all stirred up showed 230dps from a shaman pet in total(melee+procs).  I've yet to see anyone else claim 280-500 dps per pet.  I've seen lots of pretty solid parsing that showed them proccing roughly every 3 seconds opposed to 6 seconds for players.  Some a little over, some a little under.  On average, panther ran about 100dps per pc or 200dps per pet. Powerful indeed, but now thats what you say pet procs should have been all along.<br />
Also continually calling anyone who doesn't agree with you an idiot simply makes you look bad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is complete healing overpowered? Group complete healing? <br />
<br />
Is being able to FD while stunned and instantly overpowered? <br />
<br />
Is being able to take 1/4th the damage for 3 minutes overpowered? <br />
<br />
Is being able to run at the speed of light, while casting a ton of spells at the same time and being able to instantly loose aggro from anything; all at once overpowered? <br />
<br />
What about being able to pull a named to camp from miles away, with -60 to its resists, 50% slowed, completely anulled, then raising everyone's resists by 400 while providing an insane damage shield all while also increasing everyone's mana regen AND the groups dps. Nah that one I like :) <br />
<br />
Is being able to go almost anywhere w/o aggro while doing 600+ dps overpowered? <br />
<br />
Is being able to do 600 dps overpowered by casting 1 800 mana spell every 10 seconds overpowered? <br />
<br />
What about 600 dps via a spell that costs 650 mana 12 times per minute (that's once every 5 seconds)<br />
<br />
I don't know.. that last one seems too much. MUCH too much. It could ruin the game. <br />

Heck, I never even claimed panther was/is strictly overpowered - that depends on what you compare it to. But pets proccing more then players is simply broken. Not strictly because they produce too much damage - that may put them in the &quot;overpowered&quot; range, depending on how much damage is produced. It is broken because in a game (which therefore should be fun) pets have no business taking fun away from players. Pets should never be as good as a player at anything that the player's class is supposedly good as. How would you about being told &quot;no KEI for you, I would rather spend my mana on the cleric's hammer&quot;? How would you feel about loot going to a druid's pet?<br />
This is why pets proccing more then players is a broken game mechanic. Not overpowered - plain broken.<br />
<br />
As to overpowered - let's compare it to wizard spells, since they are so nicely one-dimensional. I have never parsed the spell myself, but from all I have seen claimed the original version allowed shaman to outperform wizard DPS in any scenario involving a single MOB and a fight time higher then a full cycle of panther. I.e. any raid. Now, if we accept this is true, then what do we need wizards for again? They are supposed to be a pure DPS class, right? They have a tiny bit of extra utility to bring to a raid, namely spellshield. To a group they also bring snare and possibly evac.<br />
<br />
I am going to be generous here and claim that spellshield is as good as all shaman buffs combined. So we are down to the shaman being more DPS and having the option of slowing, healing and group curing on top of that. That is the very definition of &quot;clearly overpowered&quot;, namely being able to do everything another class can do and more on top of that. And before anyone thinks of telling me &quot;hey, the shaman can only do that damage if he is not healing and slowing&quot;, take a second to think about what that answer implies. If the shaman regards it as a better use of mana and time to slow or heal then he is even further ahead of the wizard who does not have this option.<br />
<br />
And yes, there is a limit of shaman who can do this kind of damage. But that does not make it any less overpowered. It merely makes the first shaman overpowered, the second ok and the third one underpowered. That means the spell is not only bad for every DPS out there, it is also bad for shaman themselves. Great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">I'm still shocked that the over-nerf surprised you.<br />
<br />
I will gladdly concede a big error in judgement there. I truly felt that SOE WANTED to give us a reasonable DPS spell and would do the right thing by JUST fixing the pet proc-rate. I felt that recent events (the summit, the nice bundle of utility we got in OoW, the fact that, on OCASION, they actually seem to listen) would work in our favor, and they would not return to their former &quot;Nerf the piss outta it, then adjust up and smile&quot; ways. <br />
<br />
I was wrong. You wanna bitch at me for being wrong about that? Go ahead. I made a mistake. I misjudged SOE. But MY error ini judgement didnt CAUSE them to do squat. <br />
Blazz, I've seen you post claims from anywhere from 2.8x to 4-5x pc proc rate.<br />
<br />
I've seen lots of pretty solid parsing that showed them proccing roughly every 3 seconds opposed to 6 seconds for players.  Some a little over, some a little under.<br />
Where did you see this data? I havent seen it here. I have jumped around some, true, but I finally settled on 2.8 based on the data from Griz's parse, vrs the other &quot;accepted&quot; rate of 1 proc per tic on PCs. I put the DPS of 2.8 around 250 (if 10/min on PC's is ~100) to factor in the no-crits, possible partial resists of the pet proc. I am also basing my current assumption that the proc rate on pets may STILL be at 1.7 that of PC's, based on Retrons data, where he effectively analyzes how they adjusted some proc data on pets, then re-turned it on some other procs on some other pets.<br />
 Powerful indeed, but now thats what you say pet procs should have been all along.<br />
Also continually calling anyone who doesn't agree with you an idiot simply makes you look bad.<br />
Now? By now, do you mean 2 weeks ago? Because THATS when I was saying that was a reasonable, balanced rate after the &quot;fix&quot; (nerf, adjustment, whatever). From 28 to 20ish. Keep PCs at 10. Want me to get dates? <br />
<br />
See this whole illusion that I am flip flopping, that I asked for it, blah blah blah, THATS where the &quot;idiot&quot; comments are coming from. People are making blanket statements with the SLIGHTEST bit of factual basis, and in fact, in many cases, the OPPOSITE is closer to the truth. <br />
<br />
I am not calling peolpe idiots for disagreeing with me. I am calling them idiots for being WRONG about what I said, did, whatever. If you think SOE nerfed this spell because of ANYTHING I posted, your an idiot. If you think I wanted SOE to nerf this spell into its current state, your an idiot. If you disagree that the pet-proc rate was broken in the first place, then I just suggest you get a better understanding of the game, in general, becuse 250 dps per pet with this spell was pretty damn excessive. But that doenst make you an idiot, unless your reasoning is along the lines of &quot;yeah, its too good, but SSHHH, dont tell anyone and maybe they wont notice&quot;. THATS an idiotic veiwpoint as well.</div></div><hr />

And to this arguement, sir, I respectfully disagree. It WAS exploitable. Any single spell that can shave as much time off long encounters as was being reported is being exploited.<br />
<br />
At ~200-250 dps per pet, and any Time-Ikky-Qvic level shaman able to run this buff FULL TIME on 4 pets (not burst, not Channeling, FULL TIME), thats 800-1K dps. Fudge the numbers all you want with casting times, lapses, delays in /pet attack, whatever. If you want to make the arguement that this is a &quot;buff&quot; along the lines of &quot;haste&quot; I will gladdly listen, although thats been pretty done. Fact is, SOE didnt INTEND that kind of damage from the spell, period. UNINTENTIONAL RESULTS are bugs. Excessive unintentional results most certainly are exploitable. <br />
<br />
And for the record, SOE did figure it out. Then, when they started looking at the numbers, the went even further than just &quot;fixing the pet proc rate&quot;. You blaming me for that, too, Rek? The others have amused me plenty so far, new blood would be welcome. Fire away.</div></div><hr />

Please, please, please read entire posts.  The very first thing I wrote was that you weren't responsible for the nerf.  I'll even quote myself since you didn't see it the first time <br />
No, Blazz didn't get a spell nerfed all by himself, he simply doesn't have that kind of influence with soe. None of us do. <br />
Time for you to find a quote where I ever said it was your fault.<br />
<br />
<br />
Where did you see this data? I havent seen it here. I have jumped around some, true, but I finally settled on 2.8 based on the data from Griz's parse, vrs the other &quot;accepted&quot; rate of 1 proc per tic on PCs. <br />

The katta parse by Grizlor is just about the ideal dps(old version) from what I've seen.  All of your statements list that as the bottom dps value.<br />
In no particular order...<br />
<br />
My personal compromise, which has been said here a few times: Reduce the proc rate for pets to 200% of the proc rate on Players (its currently 400-500%). Add 20-30 seconds to the base duration to compensate. <br />
Just wanted to correct you, its 100 dps EASY on Players, and closer to 250-300 on pets.<br />
Maybe you should go back and study the numbers again. First off, BL pets have an innate higher proc rate than all other pets. I suspect that Mage pets are next, then Necro, then ours. That is why I think the current proc &quot;number&quot; is 30-40 average on Mage-Necro-BL pets. <br />
Honestly people, do some of you even have the SLIGHTEST concept of balance? <br />
This spell is proccing 4-5x more when cast on a pet, compared to a player. Somewhere in the middle is a common ground thats fair, reasonable, and STILL makes this a DAMN good spell line. 2x maybe, or 2.5x, but not the 4-5x we are seeing now. Its HUGELY broken like it is.<br />
Just so you know, 25-30 is the CURRENT proc rate on pets for this spell. 25-30 is the rate that ALL the mouth-breathers on the other threads say is &quot;just fine&quot;. 25-30 is the number that **I** thought was a bit high, and felt needed balancing because its in the best interest of the game, overall. <br />
<br />
I'm not being wrong about what you said, its right there.  You know what, being wrong is no damn crime.  Happens every day, no big deal.  The problem is, you've presented each version as TRUTH.  If someone calls you on it, you get mad and call them names.<br />
There probably wouldn't be the hostility that you've seen if you simply had said something to the effect of 'okay, I was wrong, heres the way it really is'.  No, you've gone out of your way to insult those that have disagreed.  Just lighten up, mea culpa, and move on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">No Blazz did not get this spell nerfed.<br />

What he did wrong was notice the spell could in the right circumstance be overpowering and then brought it to peoples attention.<br />
<br />
Must admit i never saw a wizard saying mannaburn was overpowering and for a member of a recovering class to say that 1 of their main points from reenvisioning is overpowering was a bit much.<br />
<br />
2nd point is that Blazz tends to forget that not all Shaman are as top level as him and have the focus effects,manna etc that he does.<br />
Cant honestly see this spell being massively overpowering for your run of the mill Shaman.<br />

Wulf is totally correct. Things like Spiritual Channeling would have only been marginally useful pre-Omens. Omens content being so gimp compared to GoD is what gave Shamans a significant boost(gimp is good for Shamans as we are Masters of trivial content after all).</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately for you Blazz, you're suffering from an extremely bad case of 'Brenlo-syndrome'.   For example, why Brenlo doesn't make any of the decisions at SOE, he gets 90% of the blame for anything SOE does because he's a public advocate of SOE policies.  <br />
<br />
I've seen a majority of your posts on the boards and I agree and disagree with them as any person would... the problem is, you've been in support of SOE when they've made several unpopular decisions which is what sticks in people's memories.  Negative reinforcement (feelings of pain, anger, and resentment) is much more powerful than positive reinforcement (warm fuzzies); they stay in our memories longer because it's meant to deter us from engaging in these situations again.  Positive reinforcement is meant to be a distant memory so we continuously seek out the source but can always experience them as fresh, positive influences.  Otherwise we'd get bored of the good things in life very rapidly.  So therefore, anything 'good' you've done for the Shaman community (ie: tried to lobby against nerfs) is readily forgotten.<br />
<br />
Where does that leave you?  Well people have read what you have written here and despite all the diatribe people have left in it's wake, your persecutors can either accept what you've said and either forgive and forget (failing the ability to do that, simply let it go); or they can harbor some sort of lingering grudge forever which is not something you can change short of drugging their cocoa with something mind-altering.<br />
<br />
How you deal with this from this point is similarly a matter left up to you..... you've made your point clear, you didn't advocate nerfing the Panther line of spells into oblivion.  But one thing that should be pointed out is, SOE DOES listen to the 'pulse' of the various class communities through it's most outspoken advocates.  The impetus to nerf Panther likely did pre-exist, that can't be denied... however how they go about it and what they feel they can get away with is determined by the interaction of the community on the message boards.  Care should always be exercised because SOE has made it clear that they don't work for the players, they work for what they feel is best for 'the Game' first.  <br />
<br />
At this point, you're probably best off letting your critics continue to fight this battle for you and gracefully bow out.  It's what actions you take afterwards that will allow your naysayers to say &quot;told you so&quot; or not. <br />
<br />
<br />
Such are my thoughts and advice on this matter.  Take em or leave them, either way they are well meant.<br />

Best regards to all, <br />

How often have you heard (or read... or even read here)  a fiery complaint - and remembered it for some time?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u100"><b>Bengali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p100">The we are too powerful one or the we are not powerful enough.  As for the pet proc, they probably reduced the base procrate on the spell.  This would change it for players AND for pets.  Even better eh..  They didn't seem to change the procrate on the BL spells, so either some pissed off BL's or they didn't change pet procrate.<br />
<br />
They changed the beastlord pet spells.  They changed Base2_1 from 0 to 150, which could very well be the procrate for all we know.</div></div><hr />

Could be.  I'll be 2boxing my BL/Shaman duo here shortly, so I can probably tell you about both procs:)</div></div><hr />

Do you have Spiritual Serenity (Trushar might be enough), Ancestral Aid, Epic (may be able to squeeze by without it, but it sure helps), and the OoW heal? If so, then yes, with the proper tank, you could. You would pull slower, and have to spend more time between pulls recovering mana, but thats really the only advantage gear and AA would contribute (well, certain AA would be a bigger help, like some defensive AA for the aggro you WILL occasionally get). <br />
<br />
KT is about burst healing, really. Once you get past that initial 2 or 3 &quot;Quad for 900 per&quot; rounds, get it slowed, etc, its not hard to keep up. <br />
<br />
Nameds might be a different story. They are pretty nasty in there, as Giac was rather quick to point out. But the trash mobs, for all the speed and strength they hit at, have fewer hps than your average OoW trash, and with a reasonable group you can kill them fairly quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u104"><b>mojoejojo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p104">So you are saying pet classes are more deserving of fun then melee classes?<br />
<br />
<br />
The only melee class that I got even a small complaint from, was a couple of rogues, who were pulling agro more than they were used to.  In my experience, Melees loved it as much as the pet clases.  Not ONCE, did I have a melee class complain that pets were procing more than they were.</div></div><hr />
