<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slacethehard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyway of Parsing DoT damage? I know we Biatch alot about how crap our DPS is, so I decided to go all out offensive spell casting when we were doing Primals in Yxtta the other night, but the parse log posted on our guild website only showed my DD damage and not my DoT's. By the way I'm aware that parsing yourself will show my DoT's I was after an alternative 1st<br />
<br />
I had my pants clicky dot (Pox of Bert) 111 dmg per tick (Blood of Saryrn) 320 dmg per tick and, (Bane of Nife) 214 dmg per tick, my DD damage over the fight was 10,578 using Velium Strike with focus Item, and Tears of Saryrn rain spell these parsed to 118.84 dps but add my DoT's on top and I would have to say my DPS is'nt that bad, I have no crit DoT aa's yet which would further improve my output, also I obviously had no dogdog or swarm pets.<br />
<br />
Here is the log: http://www.intranquility.com/nof/raids-17-aug/Primal%20Reptile.htm<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you look at the duration of your parse, you will notice that it's not identical with the duration of the fight. <br />
The parser seems to start after your first DD spell lands on the mob, thus your DPS is actually lower than the one the parser is showing.<br />
<br />
Your DD DPS should be 10578(total DD damage)/112(1 minute 52 seconds fight duration). So roughly 94.4 DPS(not including the DoT damage).<br />
<br />
Same is true for everyone else with a lower fight duration than 1:52 in their statistics, however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If the dot damage is not in the parses, whoever did the parses needs to turn them on in his options. Why don't you have / use bane? Also what griac mentioned is on the column next to dps (adps).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yep, Khozik is right(I didn't look too close to it and I am not familiar with that parser so I just looked at the DPS column Slace was referring to). <br />
<br />
ADPS is showing your actual DPS(and it's showing the 94.4 DPS I mentioned).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This **** owns btw: <br />
<br />
I can't stand your negativity can't you just leave the boards. God it makes me sick to see you post the same dismal crap. GO AWAY!<br />
<br />
Gaic go back to middle school and learn how to add, multiple, divide and HOW TO ROUND<br />
<br />
These are 2 negative rep bumps I received for my comment, which as Khozik clearly showed, was perfectly valid and proven by numbers I provided and are shown under ADPS(my calculated numbers and the numbers in the ADPS column are identical!)<br />
<br />
Way to own yourself, you pricks and just 'cause I am a nice guy...Gaic go back to middle school and learn how to add, multiple, divide and HOW TO ROUND<br />
<br />
10578/112= 94.446...<br />
<br />
I rounded that to 94.4, let's see who's gotta go back to middle school, moron.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slacethehard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanx for the pointer on my actual dps guys, I've only just started looking at parses so just getting to grips with it, I loaded my DoT's up last min, and just grabbed a couple, yeah I usually use bane but not on this occasion. I've down loaded Yalp and intend to try it out in the next couple of weeks I'll post results for you if you're intrested.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Good to have Giac back posting regularly :) <br />
<br />
Keep up the good posts G. It wont let me bump you again, but I would, just because I like the way you post. No need to pull punches, in my book (and you have even let me have it a few times). <br />
<br />
I guess the dork who posted the neg's edited his post, glad you got tto quote them in first, LOL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hey G, I got a &quot;phantom neg bump&quot; from the post above this one, cause YOUR aggogant and I support you, LOL. Its just a shame the bumper couldnt affect me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, it's good to know that many of the reasonable people are still around(and active). <br />
Thanks for the warm welcome back and positive comments everyone(You know who you are).</div></div><hr />
