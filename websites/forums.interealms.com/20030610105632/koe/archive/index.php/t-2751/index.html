<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mishlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wanted to drop a note and let you all know that I appriciate very much the responce I got when cazel popped his head. You guys are the best!!<br />
<br />
Now for the other part. I am sorry if I took away anyone's enjoyment last evening. I know the things that were happening were not cause by any lack of caring. I guess I just had in my heart I would make more headway on my epic this weekend. First with the raid to the hole. <br />
<br />
I never knew a group raid could be so incompetent!!<br />
<br />
 People were refusing to listen, had no idea of controling the mob. The concept of main assist had to be a new one to them. Heck I had to ask my cleric times to heal me when I was down 2 bubbs of health and would not buff me at all until I cut off her C2 supply. If you ever see a cleric like that remind them DED chanters can't give C2.<br />
<br />
Then to top off the evening I log on my gimp to look for vessel and he was UP!!! Well I give rizz  a tell since the gimp was not guilded to see if we could get a team there. What I found was that the guild was on a CR in seb. For kickes I logged on my ranger gimp(a non level 1 with ok gear) to check the monkey spawn and get thumped on as my camo dropped. So now I have a dead gimp with no real way of getting his gear back and a confirmation that the monkey is up. I log back onto vessel gimp only to find CT is claiming the camp and all I can do is sit by and HELPLESSLY watch as they taunt me with it and kill it. <br />
<br />
Well for now I've had it. I don't like to be bullied by some 16 year old 90lb geek that in real like I could kick his butt but in the game I am helpless. This game is no longer amusing to me. I have real wants and goals that it looks like I will NEVER be able to gain them. Sorry but the &quot;it will happen just be patient&quot; is just not working for me anymore. Ali, if you want the spoon from cazel, drop me an email at kaladine42@yahoo.com and let me know of a good time to log on and meet you to give it to you. <br />

<br />
 I've seen most pick up raids by mixed groups of people turn into clusters. Often this is due to lack off communications and very often lack of class knowlage in raid situations with either nobody taking command or them not listining. I seldom join pick-up groups and never join pick-up raids unless I know who is involved.<br />
<br />
I wasn't on at the time, so I'm not sure who all was doing what and where but generaly we respond to these if we can, depends on whats going on. A CR seems valid though I've seen people not wanting to leave their exp camp though often due to transport problems.<br />
<br />
As far as many people in CT being dipweeds, yeah. <br />
<br />
Now I assume and hope the ranger is lvl 6 or above. Where is it located, FoB I assume but where? We may not be able to ress it due to timer, but we could drag to a safer spot of your chosing if you desire. Please don't let it rot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mishlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Knarlz,<br />
<br />
I'm not mad at anyone in KOE I know that nothing could have been done. It was midnight to 1am est and everyone online was helping with a real messy CR, Had to use coffins on the whole crew. And the pickup raid did get Moe his one piece of his epic and Baracus a piece for his. I was hoping to be able to get mine so I could releieve you guys of that need. But it just didn't happen. <br />
<br />
The gimp is on the island with the monkey near the wall. He's level 25 and has ivy gear on so it may not be a bad idea to at least get his gear back if I do decide to play again. I'm just really frusterated about these epic pieces. Does Varent think people have no life but to have to be online 72 hours straight to add an item to a data file? What fun is that really? and then to have it taken away from me when I had first site, to add to the bad raid, just boiled me. <br />
<br />
Right now I'm just really REALLY upset and have no  earthly idea of what I'm going to do. I want this SO badly but have no means of achieving it, no matter how hard I work. Watching Ali go 48 hours almost straight with no signs of getting one little piece then getting gang banged by CT just makes me wonder if I ever will get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Falamil Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Mish,<br />
<br />
<br />
The epic quests suck.  This is because Verant sees more challenge in making you wait than coming up with a problem to be solved or a new mob to be killed.<br />
<br />
<br />
That's the way it is.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Take a break.   Eat a pizza.  Go make a gnome and run around Steamfront yelling your head off.  Anything to blow off some steam.<br />
<br />
<br />
Then remember you play a dang good enchanter, epic or no epic.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Took me almost five months to get the silly VS stone for my epic.  I just flat shelved the whole thing until I got one, knowing the rest of the quest couldn't happen without it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So much of it has to do with luck.  Aliera has spent many days camping Cazel, Verina and other spawns.  Others have spent days for Rage, and every other rare spawn out there.  I agree that they should have made it a bit more complex and have spawnable mobs but they didn't have the forsight to work them this way to limit the number of these items in game.<br />
Don't give up, the hole piece is something we can do with 2 groups of KOE in a few hours.  Great exp, good drops, and epic pieces for ranger, shaman, and enchanter will keep a lot of people interested enough to get it done.<br />
<br />
Getting Cazel is a  HUGE step btw, don't take that so lightly.  I spent days there killing every snake, madman, mummy, ghoul, spider, beetle, and sand giant I could find and he never popped for me.  It's all a matter of luck finding it and then having the extreme luck to have people available to help.<br />
<br />
Hang tough brother.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grayeyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Mish, it may not look like it to you right now, but &quot;it will happen, just be patient&quot;.  I got sick of hearing that myself, I waited for the last couple of items for my epic for many months.  And I know exactly how you feel, it's not fun.  But it WILL come sooner or later.  <br />
Last night was just plain bad luck.  I feel bad that 60 people had to be summoned in sebilis while Verina Tomb spawned and was KS'ed, and you also missed Vessel and the monkey.  <br />
Take a break if you need, or work on other things like experience.  Epic quests can be *very* frustrating.  <br />
And pls remember what Falamil said, you are a good enchanter epic or no epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wynnie Walaryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Mishlan, i'm really sorry the hole raid didnt go as planned.  We tried our best, I can tell you that if it makes you feel any better.  The problem  was that we had too many people on this raid who had not been on ANY raid before hand.  It wasn't pickup, people just invited their friends to come along.  I'm just as sad as you that we couldn't have gotten to Kindle, and I was pulling my hair out when people wouldn't FRIGGIN LISTEN to directions!  We had many goals that went unanswered in that raid.  We wanted to get Nortlav the Scalekeeper for Gooba, we had a member of LOA who fell into the hole the day before that we would have liked to rescue, we would have liked to get kindle for you and me and any other enchanter in the group that needed it.  Take heart mishlan.  If any group of people in EQ can help you obtain your epic status, it's KoE.  I've seen them do amazing things in such quick fashion it makes your head spin.  Ever seen these guys put together a group when they hear VS is up? Not to mention VSR... its like an SR71 just drops them all off in the prep room.  Verant has made this epic mess a waiting game.  Ya gotta know that already.  So be willing to wait, or be ready to go insane (like Jael, but without the need of a mirror).  Keep up your spirits Mish, we're all here for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cshae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I did a quest tonight and it was fun, and I wonder why I havent done some quests before.  (Thanks again Humfrey, for your help, your flying, your trips to the bank (/blush) and your company.)  The only other quest I have really done before is the cleric epic, and no, that wasnt fun.  It was a combination of boring green camps, more difficult fights where you put the lives of your friends and guildmates at risk, and one very rare random spawn that I was very lucky one night when a group hunting in the zone spotted him on track, and we were lucky enough to just beat another guild to the mob.  I completed the cleric epic 3 days before I hit level 60.  I had started it quite a long time before, doing it in bits, not really expecting that I would every finish it.  <br />
<br />
I see the epic quests as detracting from the fun in EQ - people fighting over spawns, people camping a spawn for days and going without sleep, people getting so upset when they miss on a spawn due to someone else beating them or the guilds inability to respond immediately cause a) it is late and there just arent the people online, or b) people are busy and tied up like doing a CR.  I see other people getting stressed out because of pressure being put on them to help with this and that spawn, often as soon as they log in, and that spoils the game for them.  And still more people getting stressed cause they just cant do everything for everybody.<br />
<br />
Epic fever seems to have struck again :(  Please people, relax, calm down, realise that this is just another item, that the sun rising and setting does not rely on you getting this item.<br />
<br />
There are also different ways of approaching the various parts of epics.  There are the people who go quietly about it, they do whatever they can themselves, for parts that just need one group they get a group of friends and go round various parts doing what they can, if that camp is being done by others they go on to the next.  The guild as a whole is not even aware of what they are doing, and then maybe there is just one or two larger fights that they require the whole guild's participation.  Then there are other people, who even for just a simple camp, bring it to the guild's attention, publically asking for help on /gu, making people aware of yet another epic camp.  No I am not referring to the rare mobs like Verina Tomb here.  <br />
<br />
I am disappointed to see people get so caught up in epics that because they didnt get a spawn one time, they want to give up the game.  Is this game just about epics ? No.  Is it just about getting phat lewt ? No, at least I hope that isnt what you play for.  Sure loot is nice and fun to get, but it is only a small part of the game.  The important things to remember are the friendships you have made, the fun in defeating a hard mob - no not for the loot but just for the challenge and the success - the way people learn to work together, the pride when you see how a well executed plan is brought to fruition by the people all knowing what to do and doing it well.<br />
<br />
Please think about how your actions are affecting others right now, and dont let your own disappointments get to the point where they are ruining the game not only for you, but for your frirends as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Mishlan don't let epic fever get the better of you. This game is not about epics. Believe me I WANT my epic some day, but that is not why I play the game. KoE is getting more epics than ever. We are making it a focus but we do still have to contend with other guilds. <br />
<br />
There are frustrating parts to every epic. You should try the Mage epic some time LOL. Falino and I have given up so many times. How many times have we killed Phinny, Neh'Ashiir, BW wurms to see nothing? Adelrune must have the record on Phinny kills with no staff. Yes it is frustrating and won't come quickly so it is best just to not allow yourself to get too frustrated by it. <br />
<br />
The deal with the Neriak mob was just wacky this weekend. Ali will need to give more details on that one. I think the GM agreed something happened.<br />
<br />
As to pick-up raids...well what can you say? A pick-up raid might work at times but there is no way they will be able to work together as a team like an established team like KoE. I don't know the details of course on this particular one. Going all the way down there for the epic mob in the tower is tough. I suggest you give a status on your epic update in the epic section with the spoon, and send an email to Chmee to schedule a Hole run. <br />
<br />
Oh yeah and be patient. Talk to all the other enchanters and set a realisitic goal for getting it. I and others are helping on all the epics so please contact us. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>mishlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well Cshae,<br />
<br />
Guess you are right. I'm spoiling the game for everyone so the best answer for me is to leave and not spoil it anymore for anyone else. Lets not worry about that gimp now just let it rott.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the times everyone,<br />
<br />
Ali I would hate for the spoon to goto waste so its yours if you want. Just get ahold of me and we can work it out<br />
<br />
Mish</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Cshae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Mish, I did not mean that you were spoiling the game for everyone, and I certainly dont want you to leave the game.   I worded that badly, for that I apologise.<br />
<br />
The post of mine above was prompted by and posted under your thread, but it was a general observation and plea for everyone.  I did not state that in the post, and again I apologise.  <br />
<br />
Also what I neglected to say was that very little of that was directed at Mishlan himself.  <br />
<br />
All I really wanted was for people to calm down, know that if you miss a spawn one day, there will be plenty more opportunities in the future, and I failed miserably at what I was really wanting to say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Come on Mish, don't let it get to you.  Cshae was not directing that comment at you nor anyone in particular.  Yah, I've gone crazy with the epic fever and it is a very contagious thing.  But working on it and helping others has given me a new focus on EQ that I was getting frustrated with, namely the slow exp grind.  It's not about the item as much as the helping each other and getting help as well.  I was shaking the night after Phinny when we got the Cazel kill and I'm sure you were feeling the same they night you got it.  The epics were not meant to be done over a month or 2 and some are luckier (myself included) to get so much done so quickly.  Continue to have it as a focus but not the ONLY focus.<br />
<br />
We are here for you and everyone else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>mishlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thanks Moe,<br />
<br />
And Cshae I am VERY sorry. I guess I'm just a little tired from last night as I did not sleep. Came into work in a building where the AC is dead. I'm on the top floor so I've been sitting with my eyes burning, with but a few hours of sleep, in an 80 degree sauna.<br />
<br />
If the offer is still open lets get the gimp back on his feet then let me take a few days offline just to get a focus on things. I start back into school next week anyway so it would not be that bad of an idea for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">/applaud Mishlan<br />
<br />
Ok, I will be continuing to check my gimps on Tangrin, Vessel, and Verina every time I log in, log out, and bored stupid.  You have my word on that.<br />
<br />
Others that need help with gimp camps, let me know I will do what I can to have those watched as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zadu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Mish,<br />
<br />
<br />
We all need a few days off once in a while... I am avail to help with the CR just let me know when...<br />
<br />
Then go take a vacation... Forget about Epic/MOBs/VI for a couple days...<br />
<br />
Then come back as the great Enchanter that you already are...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Knarlz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">ok mish, /consent Supp.  this is my lvl 20 shaman lizzy, I'll bank most of his stuff sow. invis potion in and drop corpse at Calibas entrence.   :D<br />
<br />
or maybe WW or swamp.<br />
<br />
There is a good chance the monkey is down, or even if not you implied invis works on him. If invis dosnt work, I'll need a tag team, I can try to kite it off and someone else can grab.<br />
<br />
This may not be till Wend evening though, I might not get online tonight, but if you can pop on in and consent him. I'll do that first chance I get.<br />
<br />
Other than that, it does sound like you could use a break, or at least a return to the more interesting aspects of EQ, what ever that may be for you.<br />
<br />
I truley understand the desire for you epic, as it is achevable (sp) in concept as compaired to some others which VI has made a very insain task.<br />
<br />
I had to be proded into mine and am at *cough* ragefire *cough* perhaps the most contested critter in the game. In whines from the EQ players to VI, Brad's statement blames us for wanting these items, not VI for making quests garentee'd to cause frustrations.<br />
<br />
oh well, but do the /consent thing and let me know his name incase there is a pile of rangers there  ;)</div></div><hr />
