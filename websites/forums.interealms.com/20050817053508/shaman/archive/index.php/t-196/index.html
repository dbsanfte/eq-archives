<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brewtor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am looking to upgrade my equipment.  Dose anyone have anysuggestion to what I should start with first.  Money is a slight problem but can be remedied.  I normally can't make the Planes raid due to work so looking at non planes gear.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Falyin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I will go ahead and say it before anyone else does, trade wis for AC =\ 648 is way too low at that level, and your wis is more than enough. Your wis rings, for example, and certainly your velium veil can be traded for better (don't ask me about face pieces, lol... I can never seem to find one I am happy with) my shaman uses 6/65 rings.<br />
<br />
I will spare you the *druid* jokes, but I expect someone else won't ;-)  I am keeping this short, gotta work, but I hope that points ya in a better direction (Just as a note, I learned the hard way myself on why AC is better =\)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shakasa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As did I...just like 2 weeks ago I was educated that I was NOT a DRUID.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Get some JB stuff.  If you are nervous about not having 200 wis, just keep your old gear, and if you ever feel the need for more wis you can switch it out.  You will quickly find that you don't swap out your AC stuff very often.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">&lt;ul&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;2x Electrum Black Sapphire earrings<br />
&lt;li&gt;2x 6/65 rings<br />
&lt;li&gt;Replace the following with Totemic/Jarsath/JB: bracers, arms, gloves, boots.<br />
&lt;li&gt;Any facepiece with ac or hps on it.<br />
&lt;li&gt;Take a group into the Hole and kill golems for Imbued Granite Spaulders.<br />
&lt;li&gt;Clay Guardian Shield.<br />
&lt;li&gt;Medicine Totem or basically any range item from Maidens<br />
&lt;/ul&gt;<br />
If your keyring is correct, step one should be to get your Sebilis key.  At least have the option of going in there to get some of the armor you're looking for, or cash to fund it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Crystal Spiders eyes from velks for the face - 8ac 35hp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vanbarm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Definitely go with the 6ac/65HP rings, and getting another ivory earring would be good and not too expensive either.   Crystal Spider Eyes are a good face piece, but if you want to keep some of the wis and still get a good face item, go with an Artic Wyvern Mask or even a Bone Mask of the Jarsath.  A Tattered Mantle or Elder Wolf Hide would be good for your shoulders too.  Past that, just Totemic/JB like Megumi mentioned.  As cheap as JB is (minus legs and BP which you have good pieces in already) you could do some major AC beefing.  All of those should be semi-cheap and easy to pick up also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Nice face item from Fungus Grove... <br />
<br />
Mushroom Veil (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7100): AC 8, DEX 12, DR 15, Mana 55<br />
<br />
It's kind of a rare drop now, but the small mushrooms get slaugthered by the hundreds every day so your chance of getting your hands on one are still kind of good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">get Seb and HS keys would be a big one on my list.  <br />
<br />
Get another of those imbued earrings.<br />
camp HS for enshrouded veil.<br />
Buy 6ac/65 hp rings or one of those and a shadel bandit ring would be even better.<br />
bracers, gloves, arms, head upgrade to jarsath or jaundice bone if ya can.  <br />
Clay Guardian Shield, or Sarnak Battle Shield outta Seb/Chardok.<br />
goranga idol or divine inspiration(nodrop) outta ME.<br />
<br />
<br />
That's what popped into my head on first look at least. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just wondering, have you max your defense yet? Your equipments are not that bad IMO.  But I cann't help but wonder about the low ac.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Coldain Skin Gloves are very good and only cost me just over 1k.<br />
<br />
Coldain Skin Gloves   <br />
MAGIC ITEM  <br />
AC: +12 Sta: +9 Wis: +6 Int: +6 HP: +20 Mana: +20</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ghanimaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">He may not have entered a correct (or any) naked/base ac, which would mess up the adjusted ac number. I mean, my naked ac is only 100 below that...<br />
<br />
If your defense isn't maxed though... don't know what to tell you other than go tank some low blue mobs after upgrading your ac gear a bit. Every point of defense makes a hug difference.<br />
<br />
As far as gear goes - some good suggestions have been made and I'll agree with them in general. There's really a very wide variety of gear out there that would be good for you or anyone. You might think about offering your services to groups or raids that are taking place in the kael arena area and pick up any thurg gear that you can. That would be above planar quality gear, but wouldn't require a plane-raid level of time commitment.<br />
<br />
Places like allakhazam's are a good way to do quick equipment comparisons if you wonder about these things. You can get a list of every item (as long as it's in their database) for a particular slot and rank them by ac, stats etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Brewtor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thanks for all the good ideas and will start the change this weekend.  Ghanimaa is right I haven't updated my naked stats in awhile so next time I get killed I will have to do that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">for face slot ... Death mask of the Elysians ... 12 ac ... 3 wis  bunch of stats including mana and hp and resists ... very nice ... <br />
<br />
drops from corrupted elysians remains .... 1 solid group to take him down ... he casts ... he also drops Very VEry nice shoulders</div></div><hr />
