Slot cars - technically called scale model racing now, is a growing 'sport'. I remember the tyco sets as a kid and how theyd break in about an hour hehe.. Well times have definitely changed.<br />
Heres a pic of the cars Ive picked up so far. Scale is 1/32. The cars about about 5 inches long and man can they move! I now need more room for a new track! =D<br />
<br />
Anyone else race?<br />

Argh and all that for living in a U.S. Territory where everything has to be shipped in containers at silly costs.<br />
<br />
Do you have a picture of a porsche 917?  That's what I used to race when I was a kid.  Or the porsche slayer? (points to you if you get the reference) ;)</div></div><hr />

My brother used to race slot cars before he went to college. He's spend countless hours making them look just right.<br />
<br />
Me, I'm far more concerned about speed. I don't have the patience for painting my own. I just love to make them go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Micheall</div><div class="date">04-15-2002, 10:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Visiting my mother a couple years ago I went by where the old army surplus store was located.  Much to my surprise it was still in business, 35 years after i first went in there.  Next door to it, there used to be a slot car hiobby shop and racing track.  These days its a cheap chinese food restaurant.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, I took my daughter into the surplus store, Iswear some of the stuff in there had been there since I was a kid.  One of the things I noticed were about a half-dozen vintage slot cars with custom paint jobs, newest model looked to be a Shelby Cobra.  Oldest was a model of Barney Olds racecar.  <br />
<br />
Talked to the proprietor, since he was at the counter.  He had taken over the store from his father when he retired, and he used to race the cars in the display case when he was a kid.  Found out we knew each other a little when we were kids, we were the same age and went to the same church.  <br />
<br />
He told me slot-car racing would be making a comeback, and that those slot cars were worth a mint.  He had no ontention of selling them, they were treasures of his youth and all, hand painted each one.  After 35 years he still had passion for the sport.  Now I see he was right.  <br />
<br />
My parents thought it a waste of time and money, so I never got into it, but I had lots of friends who did.  I got to race their not so good cars once in a while.</div></div><hr />

Oro - slot cars are huge in Europe so you can get them from places other than the states.. Course I dont know if it will be any cheaper from Europe but its worth a shot! Theres tons of online companies..</div></div><hr />
