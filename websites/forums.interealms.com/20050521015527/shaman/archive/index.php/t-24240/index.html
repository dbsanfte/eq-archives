How many backpacks do you carry?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>wakonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I carry seven, and I really don't think I need that many anymore as well.<br />
Right now I have one slot open for booties that switches out for other clickies, I may drop down to four or five backpacks. /shrug</div></div><hr />

How many backpacks do you carry?<br />
<br />
I carry 6 various backpacks.  Sow boots and Epic 1.5 are in inventory slots.  I used to have VT 'sinia neck in inventory until getting epic.  It allows for fast swapping already and for the upcoming clickable-from-inv. patch it'll be all set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>jolav21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">5 only<br />
<br />
i like to keep one slot available for my Tae ew mask (invis)<br />
one for my spirit stone<br />
&amp; one misc slot...(mod rods, potions ect). <br />
<br />
I keep 2 of those slots hotkeyed in my second bank of keys for my invis mask &amp; misc slot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Heh 8.... I'm honestly blown away that folks carry less than 7.  Even 7 I'm sorta surprised by.  I was just thinking the other day &quot;Damn I'm getting another bag from the Epic, wonder where i'm going to get the room for that!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>jolav21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If I ever need anymore bags for what ever reason, like if i am ML I just summon some with my grandmaster`s Medicine bag. Just don`t forget to empty them b4 you log.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Haha I used summoned bags waaaaaay back as a little Shaman. After I camped out with my 5th bag full of steel weapons I gave up on summoned bags.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Exact same experience as Litchebane after a profitable night of camping CT. Much wailing and gnashing of teeth.<br />
<br />
I currently carry 6 backpacks. Inventory slot 1 is sowboots, inventory slot 8 is currently human illusion crown (although I swap in mod rods during raids). Epic 1.5 will go into slot 8 after I get done with my last fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I used to always carry 8, but as soon as I got my sow boots I dropped one. After I got the wood elf crown I dropped to 6 and stayed there for a while, but then started to run out of room to loot random stuff so went back to 7. Now I just have my Epic 1.5 in the empty slot and switch out whatever clicky I need there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm the same as Glori,  6 bags inv slot 5 is usually clicky Tae Ew mask and slot 8 is sow boots or whatever other clicky I need at the time.   I'm constantly asked for a quick invis so gotta keep that thing handy :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">7 sacks. i couldn't survive with anything less. my inventory slot has Phylactery. sometimes i need the 7th slot for a clicky so i usually have an unfolded bearskin potion bag there and empty it and delete it. atm it's the medicine bag for epic 1.5 until i read that it's not needed for 2.0.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Technically I keep 8 8+ slot containers.  However at all times at least one of those is a Tradeskill container made from the collapsed sewing kit or soemthing, yes for these summoned containers not being no rent!  So i have the room of 8 bags, but should i need to looot another bag i can safely destroy this.  <br />
<br />
That and i end up doing about 1/2 of my highly triv combines while i'm omw to a group, so it's nice being able to carry around 3+ tradeskill containers using 1 base inv slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Heigelyac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">6, plus a collapsible bearskin potion bag and collapsible medicine bag, sually collapsed.  then I can unfold those to make more room as needed, and can destroy em without any whining or worry. (and the unfolded ones are not norent)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">6 permanant bags, foldable bearskin potion bag, foldable alchemy bag.  If I'm ML and run out of space, I unfold the extra bags.  If not, I have 2 slots for clickies.  And as an added bonus, I don't have to remember to go to the bank when  I want to make potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I carry 5 as a rule, but I'm on a PvP server, so it is advisable to have 3 instaclickies available at all times...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Seven. SoW booties in slot 6, because Thott's containter UI shows Pri, Sec, 6 and 8 in large format on every container. And yeah, always, good to have a free slot for a container, like when the mage hands you a summoned backpack full of summoned pet gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shamylamy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I always carry 8 bags with 10 slots. I carry too much stuff and my bank is completely full of tradeskill stuff that I can't destroy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">6, slot 1 for SOW boots, slot 5 used to be Shrink Orb, but I recently started using it in Secondary slot for the extra resists so I put Spiritstone in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ghwerig-AO</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I carry 8 bags myself.  6 of them are 10 slot 100% weight reduction bags, a collapsable fletching kit, and a folded bearskin bag.  The two tradeskill containers are easily destroyed as needed.  I do keep one bag full of different clicky toys hotkeyed to a bank full of matching inventory slots.  This makes it fairly easy to swap out gear as necessary.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Always carried seven bags here and one slot for boots/clicks, old habit from being a troll (KOS everywhere) I used to carry stuff to last me for months in the field ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I carry 7 bags and have SoW boots in slot 1, also switch out other clickies with the SoW boots when needed. I dont understand why so many of you have 1.5 in an inventory slot already since its not clickable from there yet, but once it is clickable there I may put it in an inventory slot also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I carry 6 bags.  A Hand-made Backpack in the first slot that holds food and a few handy odds and ends.  I don't carry many pet weapons any more now that puppy can zone.<br />
<br />
I have a Leatherfoot Haversack, Grandmaster's Satchel, Rallic Pack, Bag of Sewn Evil Eye, and Ayaad's Runed Urn.  All are empty for loot.<br />
<br />
The last two slots are for a Ribbon of Empathy and my SoW boots.  I'm thinking of dumping the RoE on my beastlord since pet pathing has improved recently and I don't need it as much, but the new invis without killing pet thing might make it handy again.<br />
<br />
I can also bag the boots and ribbon for two more summoned bags from my brewer's trophy if I need the space for additional loot.  Great item for flexibility.<br />
<br />
If I had the extra cash I would upgrade the two 8 slot bags but I have some expensive spells coming up soon and those new augments look sweet.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>psosnake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">wow i must be missing something with all the peeps talkin about 7-8 bags..i carry 3 4 at most unless its a ldon and im ML then ill do the little summoned 4 slot bags unless mage is there to do bigger ones...and of the 4 only 2 have stuff in them..1 wit food drink potion or 2 that i carry and a few other not really needed items..seems normally never away from pok tha tlong to have to worry bout it...even if you are on a 3-4 hour raid session theres got to be 1 peep of every class there so shouldnt need anything that much..<br />
dunno just my 2 cents, no wonder im broke i gave all my cents away =-0</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">My goofy Monk is borderline overweight at 24 stones.<br />
<br />
Mystyqe (DE Enchanter) OTOH has BAGS and BAGS of crap.  Tradeskill, unfinished quest crap, you name it and that toon has it.  Faern is about in the middle. Some fishing stuff, some Alchemy stuff but he's ok.<br />
<br />
And I TRY and thin out my inventories. In bank and elsewhere.  LoY was a Godsend for the additional space alone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Right now I carry 7, with the empty slot holding booties or 1.5 or my clicky ring.  I have the slot on a bank of hotkeys with both primary and a finger, so I can quickly swap whatever's there in, click it, then swap it back without opening inventory.  An old trick, one I learned reading this board, as I'm not an old player.  ;)<br />
<br />
I'm probably going to pare down to 6 bags, though.  I find that I don't need the carrying capacity of the full 7 even with 1 bag full of nothing but pet weapons, and I'd like one more empty inventory slot handy for swapping clickies when I get into EPs (curse you Rallos Zek and your bugged script!  /fume).  Besides, all of my bags but 1 is weight reduction, and that one's full of those little things that I find I absolutely need to keep with me all the time, but don't weigh much at all (I call them the Indespensibles, things like my spiritstone, my GM trophy, my folded medicine/bearskin bag, coffins for corpse summoning, extra emergency gate potion if a friend's trapped and needs help, etc).<br />
<br />
I carry around foldable medicine/bearskin bags for alchemy-on-the-go, and I also have my alchemy GM trophy in my inventory for the skill mod when making gate potions, so I have access to more bags if I need em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>kazgal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">man you carry alot of crap in ya bags, i mean do you ever use any of those weapons?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">If I ever need anymore bags for what ever reason, like if i am ML I just summon some with my grandmaster`s Medicine bag. Just don`t forget to empty them b4 you log.<br />
<br />
Safer to use a foldable bearskin potion bag.  Yes, its not weight reducing and doesn't hold big items, but it holds enough that it works, and you don't have to worry if you go LD or log without emptying it.<br />
<br />
<br />
My main slots:<br />
<br />
Bag of the Tinkerers<br />
Bag of the Tinkerers <br />
Bag of the Tinkerers <br />
Bag of the Tinkerers <br />
Bag of the Tinkerers  <br />
Grandmaster's Carry-All<br />
Pendant of Malosini<br />
Black Fur Boots<br />
<br />
If I get really crowded for space I summon a bearskin potion bag, and if I need even more space I summon a medicine bag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>EQOracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I carry no less than seven backpacks. It used to be eight all the time, but then I got my clicky ring of stealthy travel and keep that in one slot to swap out my other ring when i need invis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">magelo shows what i have...honestly i only really loot things that i can sell for big cash inthe baz, so &quot;loot&quot; space doesn't concern me.  i only need space for gear i need to swap in and out /shrug.  always have alchemy stuff on me...you never know when someone will need stuff made...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I always carry 7 on me leaving me 1 slot for a clickie or a quest bag. I usually fill those up pretty quick too since I never clean my bank out and I'm usually carrying around a truck load of tradeskill stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">6: Rallic Pack, Grandmaster's Carry-all (permanent tradeskill GM bag), and four Tink bags<br />
<br />
First one has food/drink, reagents, and a couple clickies.  Second and third are for whatever I'm lugging around at the moment.  Fourth slot is empty.  Fifth and sixth are more alternate gear and clickies (and a momento - /wave Weniki).  Seventh is pet weps plus more of whatever I'm lugging around at the moment.  Eighth is sow boots.<br />
<br />
I like keeping the fourth slot open for unexpected bags, quest containers, temporarily unfolded/uncollapsed tradeskill containers, food to eat manually, other clickies, etc.  I tend to lug around a lot of stuff in the other bags, as I'm usually in the midst of a tradeskill project or four.<br />
<br />
It's in my Magelo, although that particular save was when I had my trader satchels on me.  Those are normally banked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Torp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I used to carry 5 bags, then sow boots, shield of striding, and mount.<br />
<br />
I had something that looked really cool in my ammo slot O_o.<br />
<br />
Shield of Striding is the greatest item ever, I could never come back to EQ unless I had another one of those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Retron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">8 containers here, all full of junk. Much like my bank - makes me wonder how I ever managed with just 8 slots in there....  ;)</div></div><hr />
