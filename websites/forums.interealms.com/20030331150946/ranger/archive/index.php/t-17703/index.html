<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Arador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm planning on taking a group of friends into The Hole tonight to have a little visit with Jael.  I've run through the route a couple dozen times with my Rogue halfling, so I pretty much know where I'm going and how to get there.<br />
<br />
Here are the people that have confirmed that they will be there:<br />
<br />
- 56th Ranger (me) (Puller)<br />
- 58th Pallie<br />
- 58th Pallie (MA)<br />
- 60th Enchanter (mezz/slow)<br />
- 53rd Warrior (SA)<br />
- 59th Cleric (Main Healer)<br />
- 55th Cleric (Backup Healer<br />
<br />
We will have a couple halfling rogues parked down there in case of trouble.<br />
<br />
This group should have little trouble, right?  I know I need an evac'er (and I'm working on it).  Any other recommendations or just general strategies?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

-Assign the non-MA pally to be the person who will keep the enchanter alive at all costs.<br />
-Abuse of stuns since you have 2 pallies there.<br />
-Move fast, kill as you go, don't stay in a camp too long. Just kill the immediate mobs around you and move forward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The golems chain-add like crazy. Not uncommon to get a string of 8 or so of em. Be VERY PREPARED.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Arador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We made it through with little problem.  One of the clerics ended up 2-boxing with her druid so we'd have a way out, and a couple other warriors (52, 59) joined the team.  No deaths, though the enchanter got real busy a few times.  Yes, Jael was a piece of cake.  Really, after hunting in PoP zones the Hole mobs are really quite tame, it's just their numbers, pathing and fast repop rate that can really be dangerous.  I really doubt anything short of a full raid could even think about trying this without a good enchanter.<br />
<br />
At about the 1/2 way mark we medded up to the right along the lake.  There are no adds there, but we did have to do quite a bit of pulling to that spot to clear for the next step, especially true once the area just outside the lake started to repop.<br />
<br />
Watch out if you fight near the doorway leading out of the city into the tunnel where Jael is - there were a lot of wanderers in the tunnel who just seemed to want to keep walking up to us and adding to the pile.  We cleared that mess eventually, but it wasn't pretty.<br />
<br />
After killing Jael we went to port out, and people started getting a little upset when they realized that there were 6 melee and only one porter, but thanks to Trak's gift to me last month we got out fine (I love it when that happens).  Unfortunately, I popped into Lesser Fay just in time to be killed at the GF zone line by the Spirit of Malevolence from a failed Beastlord epic attempt hehe.<br />
<br />
Now I just need to do a MQ with a guildee for the Swirling Sphere, run to Kaladim, and then go pick up Swiftwind!</div></div><hr />
