The Canni Dance<br />
<br />
Canni Dance when I want to,  I can leave your class behind<br />
Cause your class don't dance and if it don't dance<br />
Well its no class of mine<br />
I /shout,  we can go where we want to, a zone that they will never find<br />
And we must accept that we're in THEIR WORLD NOW<br />
and leave the RL far behind<br />
and Canni-Dance<br />
<br />
Camp Check?<br />
<br />
Aye we can go where we want to the server is young and so am I<br />
And we can dress real l33t from our helms to our feet<br />
and annoy them with our KS cries<br />
<br />
I /say they quad if they want to if they don't nobody will<br />
and you can be a druid and totally a Dood<br />
and you can can like an inbecile (whats new)<br />

He would put it all in emote format and had character movement to go with the emoted lyrics. When he would start doing it huge crowds would gather to watch. To see 40+ people standing around him just watching for 30 minutes was not uncommon.</div></div><hr />
