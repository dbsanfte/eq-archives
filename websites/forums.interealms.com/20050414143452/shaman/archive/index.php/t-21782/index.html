<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Opened my inbox today, apparently overnight I recieved 4 emails with attachments.<br />
<br />
1 of them was supposed to be a list of things I &quot;bought&quot; on Paypal, but the anti-virus stuff on hotmail picked it up.<br />
<br />
However, the other 3, in the message, had typed out: <br />
<br />
&quot;++++ Attachment: No Virus found<br />
++++ Norman AntiVirus - www.norman.com&quot;<br />
<br />
So apparently they're trying to be sneaky ****s now.<br />
<br />
Is this anything new? I haven't seen this virus before, it's never hit my email at least, and the sudden overnight spam made me wonder.</div></div><hr />
