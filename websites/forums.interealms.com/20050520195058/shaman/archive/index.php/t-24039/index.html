<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>trrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A boxed dinner lacks the unique taste flavor of something home made<br />
<br />
A boxed dinner is fast and easy to make<br />
<br />
A boxed dinner has no respect at all for the the other homemade dinners <br />
<br />
A boxed dinner is food I guess... but not the best food you ever tasted<br />
<br />
A boxed dinner is nice in a jam, if there is nothing better to eat<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I detest Boxed dinners...<br />

In before Litgruv realizes he has no ability to grasp analogies.<br />
<br />
And, I concur with the original poster.  Good buddy of mine (monk) bots a shaman.  But I easily see how much utility is lost when he bots it versus when I play my monk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Then again so do most chars.<br />
<br />
Especially if you run a meelee.<br />
<br />
Ive been boxing for years and the best chars for boxing are clerics (sit on horse and wait for heal opportunity) Mages (send in pet, wait till mob been beazted down a bit then toss in a nuke or two) and wizzies (wait till mob at 80% then nuke a couple of times).<br />
<br />
I loose 3/4 of my effectiveness when dual boxin cause shammies require constant maintenance to maximise mana regen and dps.<br />
<br />
Two best boxed chars.......<br />
<br />
Two clerics, people will drive several thousand miles to offer you oral sex, and two clerics means that you can actually combat the extreem cleric booredom by running two at once 8)<br />
<br />
Two mages are awesome as well, but lack of crowd control means you need ot run around a bit.<br />
<br />
Sham and a mage are fun, mage is basically on autofollow with two hot buttons, assist shaman and send in pet, assist shaman and nuke.<br />
<br />
Most effective secondary for a sham has to be a mage, and if you use the earth pet you avoid all them runner issues.<br />
<br />
Then again two mages are fun fun fun!<br />
<br />
Never any runners, and just per chain things to death 8)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What is this 'real food' about which you speak?<br />
<br />
Food: I only eat stuff that takes less than 30 seconds of interactive preparation (coffee, water, hot dog, sammich, pot pie, take out) or stuff in a restaraunt. Or sometimes both.<br />
<br />
Toons: I only play Samanna, and I don't pay attention to who else is boxed or not. I'm too busy to worry if it's a good boxer or a bad player.</div></div><hr />

Main shaman or boxed shaman ... end result over time is only one of them is a pile of crap (this is 90% true.)</div></div><hr />

This mysterious item can be found by asking my fiance very politely to make it for me.  I have no clue where she gets it, and it usually takes a while for her to find though it does exist.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately this is a very rare drop, so i'm very fond of hamburger helper...</div></div><hr />

Note, however, that Marie Callendar makes a fantastic microwavable chicken pot pie.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Real food&quot; is an uncommon drop from a raid-force mob (The Grocery Store) in Anytown USA. Zone is rather appealing and a bit quaint, but this mob is nasty. Procs a $50-$250 DD hit at the end of the raid event, depending upon the size of your group. Can also proc a rather nasty snare effect called &quot;Coupons,&quot; guaranteed to make your encounter with the end mob (A Cashier) more drawn-out than it needs to be.<br />
<br />
I play this damn game too much. :p<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />

Sometimes the encounter is broken and the &quot;Cashier in Training&quot; MOB pops instead, and then a GM has to come and despawn it...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I don't two box much these days, but it's nice to have the option. My Monk, for example, is a decent single puller and a passable MT on &lt;500 content, so I whip the lizard out now and then when needed even though it's a bit of a chore to run both.<br />
<br />
Do I lose efficiency when dual boxing? Sure, but sometimes the benefits outweigh the downside.<br />
<br />
Dual boxing also means that you can make money considerably faster, although I find it boring.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I have found that I can effectively box with my Warrior Shaman combo. All I need is a corner for the warrior to fight in. I pull with slow, and get the mob near the corner. Switch to the tank and corner the mob. back to shaman, drop pet on the mob, and dot. The main thing I have to be careful of is not dotting too much to pull aggro off the Warrior. I don't take this combo to tough zones since the tank hasn't hit 65 yet, but it is very effective when I want to farm cash or bazaar fodder in places like Seb or Droga. The only real challenge is controlling runners, and getting the tank a Kunzar Ku'juch solved that problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Guys, you're forgetting that if you're in a rush, you can grill on the BBQ.  If I don't really care about perfection I can BBQ a quick steak and a potato in about 15 minutes while I do other things.  I imagine that's a lot like 2 boxxing as well.  Sure, sometimes the steak tastes pretty good, but it's never the same as a carefully prepared and grilled piece of quality meat, especially if the &quot;cook&quot; is trying to return phone calls, check on a mob, surf internet porn, or send telepathic messages to Jojo's psychic friends network while grilling.  Any monkey can grill meat and potatos, hell, this monkey has.  There's very little cleanup, very little prep and even done badly, it's 1000 times better than a boxxed lunch, even better for you.</div></div><hr />

There's no waiting while a critical class is afk and enjoying the seating capabilities of my thumb.<br />
<br />
Do I group with a single toon, at times I do. Do I sometimes group with all 3, only when the other people involved know ahead of time. Do I spend time LFG? Never.<br />

May not be the best meal, but it works for me.<br />
