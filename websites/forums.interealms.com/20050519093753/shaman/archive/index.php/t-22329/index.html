<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i was thinking those still on the eq live board would sony (or the poeple sony has to read boards like kytherea) think/do etc if noone replied to anything except class balance issues?<br />
<br />
for instance kyth chats if noone replied to that, just deathly silience . would that work? (although it might be impossible as not everyoine who post there are crucible readers, but is they only get a few responses might worj too, and only on anything none balance related:))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Many people play EQ with little thought to balance and if their class is gimp compared to class Y.  THey play to have fun.  If they do use message boards, its to talk about how much fun they have in the game and some of the things that happened to them lately.  These type of players have little to no concern for class balance, and are easily identified in blanace threads as the person that posts once saying &quot;My X is fine, what are you talking about?&quot;<br />
<br />
You probably wont see an end to the 'lighthearted' posts on any site, EQlive included.  And anyway, Kytherea is fun to chat with.  Id like to have drinks with her, just to see if there is a naughty streak just under the surface like it sounds like there is &gt;:-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yes i dont wont to seem to be punishing kytherea she does seem to try her best though i know when i was in customer services i pretty much short everything expect major problems. And i got answers, within in a few hours if not days and a week about the longest. But then maybe the company set up is different, i could basically steam roll anyone to get a solution, even managers though had to be a little bit more delicate there. i not sure but seems devs have alittle bit too much power to me.<br />
<br />
but anyhow, back to point it is really to get at brenlo or kyth, but just curious as to if anyone posted or not they would notice:)</div></div><hr />
