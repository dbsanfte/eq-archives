<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I sign up for fear raid which specifically says epic items will be randomed to those who post for the raid. I am the only one who posts for tear. some level 52 shaman shows up at the raid spontaneously and snatches it right out from under me because the person who was going to lead the raid ( a friend of mine ) couldn't make it so he had a guildy run it (who knew nothing about the mboards).<br />
<br />
I really dont mind losing a random but I can't stand it when I'm 'guarenteed' something only to be taken from me by someone who casually decides to waltz into a raid.<br />
<br />
oh well, I guess there's just going to be another blue con running around with his spear while I use my howling spear. :D  :D  :D <br />

 :(  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I know how you feel. I was 63 when I got my epic =\. That damn tear took em almost a year and I must of seen about 15 tears go to other people because I have the worst dice in all of EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Doesn't your guild have a discilpinary commitee?  File a complaint with your guildleader and make him MQ the tear if you really feel that you were cheated.  <br />
<br />
If your guild doesn't follow it's own rules maybe it's time you started looking for a better run guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">wasn't my guild, it was a Union guild, meaning we work very closely with each other for raids and such, but do not share the same officers or guild rules.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Had something similar happen to me.  Guy defaulted the Tear without saying anything, after the posted default was already done.<br />
<br />
Very important -- if the leader of a raid does not specify loot rules &amp; defaults at the beginning of the raid, ask out loud.  I'd almost recommend not going if they refuse to say.<br />
<br />
I also refuse to do pick-up raids with folks I do not know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">just an update, Fear zone crashed some time this weekend so all 3 golems were back up ahead of schedule by this afternoon (sunday). I came along the fear raid and this time my buddy was leading the raid. He reserved the tear, and I got it. Yay now I just gotta kill Rak and Neh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I feel your pain...<br />
<br />
I managed to lose lottos on about 15 or more fear raids until I finally got into a guild raid where I was the sole shaman without an epic.  I think I had an easier time getting RE in Hate on public raids. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fenora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yay Penny! Congrats on the tear :)</div></div><hr />
