Even light blue mobs give decent xp. 45 to 48 you can solo the 9 mobs around the bridge area and even take some from the pool area behind it when needed. At 49 move to Temple and stay there for a while.<br />
<br />
At 45 with 900ac and 1600hps self buffed and a JBB i tore the place up. Lots of fun. At 50 i moved to Temple and it's more of the same. Challenging but fun. You wont always get single pulls, but thats how you build skills. And the zone isnt too far away when it hits the fan. I'm even thinking of getting a Grav Flux up to the ramparts when i get 53 or 54 to continue on. <br />
<br />
Love this place. Can you tell? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yes com or solo at the undead ruin in NE DL<br />
<br />
echo caverns is pretty good too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Meener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Erm, what if you've got around 700 AC and no JBB though?  Still useful?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nanin of the Faed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you're more of a wis Shaman then wait till 49, the 2 dots you get then are pretty amazing and you should do fine. Just root and rot. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Seanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Soloing or grouping at the Poacher Camp is fun from 48 to 50+, and the gnolls good too north of town.  The only downside is the propensity for animals to jump folks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">CoM, i hunted here for a little with groups, im level 48, JBB'd, good ac/hp, could i solo here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Beemine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think it's very likely you could solo there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Beemine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">but better partnered. monk for split pulling would be the sweetest<br />
<br />
Sol b and lguk would also be good places to hunt, prob sol b better as it's easier to get in and out of. at 48 you could solo in DL or OT... there were mobs in OT blue at 56 or so.<br />
ej or TT might have some mobs to solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Here is the best experience for the least amount of work for you:<br />
<br />
Echo Caverns!!<br />
<br />
Yep, in Shadowhaven go through the dwarven part of the city and zone out there - this will bring you to Echo Caverns (not Echo).  Keep going straight and you will run into some bugs on the left - past this point turn right and there is room with 6 spawns (bugs, rocks, aliens) and also in this room there is a ramp up to another room where you will find 6 skeletons and the Taskmaster (big snakey guy).  <br />
<br />
Very easy to kill all these mobs solo at 45-46 except the Taskmaster and the occaisonal(sp?) appearance of Fireclaw (big bug).<br />
<br />
I got 25% of level 46 by killing 8 mobs in this zone - very lucrative but also its getting very camped.  Experience is good here until level 52 I've heard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>korshatiz123</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Im currently doing plaguebone thief camp in dl, getting 3 yellow per dose of kei with my 49 shaman (no jbb). This is very nice because they do not assist each other walk at 20% and spawn relatively fast. By the time you kill one another will have spawned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ribeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I got close to 2 yellow bars of xp per KEI soloing stonegrabbers in DSP at 48, no JBB.  There are no adds, they are not social, and rarely camped on my server.  Close to bazaar as well.  Just root and dot, rinse and repeat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bazgul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hiyas,<br />
<br />
I just checked out DSP and I did not see any stonegrabbers.  Where are they?  Are they in the cave?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Naala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Echo is where I did 48 through 51.<br />
<br />
48:  Underbulks and Fiends near the Deep Zone or Underbulks,Fiends and Grabbers next to the taskmaster room.<br />
<br />
49 &amp; 50:  TM camp.  You can single pull him with slow, then work on the skellies, sometimes they come as a pair but you can root park one.<br />
<br />
51:  Gnome camp.  Not a lot of people know about this little gem of exp.  Perfect for 51.  They are in an area not far from TM camp (take a right before u get to TM camp and you'll see 2 gnome guards up a ramp)  Single pulls, ez kills.  After dispensing with them, move in a bit.  Ignore the gnomes to the right (they r light blue at 51).  Head NW and u will see a drape.  Kill the 2 guards there as well.  Past them is the throne room with the 2 gnome kings and his posse.  I only pulled Harold the Herald and the Court Jester, (single pull with slows).  Ignore the others, especially if kings are there.  You'll get multiple pulls.<br />
<br />
FYI, kings are like lev 45 but I soloed them a few times when they were by themselves.  Someone must have pulled them and the kings tend to stay where they were pulled to instead of returning to spawn point.<br />
<br />
So you have 6 gnomes total, all on a 20 minte timer.  I had to clear all 6 about 6 times to get 1 gold bub (maybe 7 times).  So thats about 2 hrs to 2.5 hrs per gold bub.  Not bad IMHO.<br />
<br />
Also, you can kill the Haven Defender who patrols the hallway, she's a hotty but I whacked her good.  Be careful not to kill her too much cauz u lose faction with defenders of shadow haven, Im dubious there now.  Also, the gnomes are on kingdom of above and below faction, which only exists in there camp, so slaughter away.<br />
<br />
Good Luck,<br />
<br />
And hope this helps.<br />

Chow Chow for Now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Wow I'll second CoM. Amazing XP in the Temple area at 49. I get about 80% single pulls, 20% double. Get a KEI and you'll slice through things at an insane rate. Everything in the Temple is dark blue and great XP. The 49 pet tanks them very well as long as they are slowed. I pull with togors, let pet take a bubble of hp out of the mob and then ebolt and join in the fray or med if I don't have too much aggro.<br />
<br />
And of course it gives me the opportunity to get the 6 scrolls. Got 3 so far and hope to get the rest soon and maybe even the strange ochre clay. <br />
<br />
It was totally deserted in there at 1am PST which I can't say for many other places on Karana. A bit spooky being in there by yourself though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>throxis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I went from 48 to 50 in GD doing Frost Giant Elites. At 49 they give nearly half a blue each solo and kiting them is cake. As an added bonus I have a good start on my CoV faction (apprehensive now) and got the first 2 Coldain Shawl quests done. While I was in GD I did the Coldain Military Wristguard and Kromrif Military Leggings quests. All in all a very productive 4 days. Unfortunately for those of you using the JBB crutch this area won't be very appealing, Elites resist the hell out of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ssarahh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Another place to hunt in Echo is in the other half of the zone, head in threw the secret ent by the soulbinder and go to the evil area bang a left at the end of the tunnel and you will be facing a castle lookin thing, there are 4 spawns here you have to worry about 2 guards (scones) at the entryway they are too close so root park one and pull the other out a ways, sometimes the other will follow after the root breaks and sometimes he wont but you only have to worry bout that untill you get the spawn broke. once you finally finish off the guards pull doggy back a ways and target one of the archers these guys rock as they summon (my personal favorite) and are permarooted so not only do they bring you up to them but they dont run away! if you can get it off cast your summon companion between hits and go to town on him besure to guard your doggy there when you are up there <br />
<br />
all 4 of these mobs are low on MR and are good XP for quite a while but they have a metric Ton of Hps and hit like a ton of lead (well the scones do) so you might want to look at your AC a little hehe also life is much easyer with them if you have a JBB (i dont oh well) enjoy. Also you get + faction with all 3 major houses in SH and the defenders if i remember correctally and you get - faction with the evil city and the Shadel bandits</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Anywhere in CoM is good.  Get epic items here.<br />
<br />
Giant Fort in GD is nice as well.  Get thurg faction while your at it.<br />
<br />
Chickens in TD might be too high solo but a group may be able to take them.<br />
<br />
Maybe water gobs in LoIo.  Need a group probably.<br />
<br />
SGs in Oaisis is a change of pace.<br />
<br />
The Tower of Frozen something in EW is good.<br />
<br />
Tower in FoB may be good exp for you range.<br />
<br />
EJ has many wondering MoBs you can do with a group.<br />
<br />
BW is good.<br />
<br />
Droga maybe.<br />
<br />
Front part of the Hole maybe.<br />
<br />
IGs in EF.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tilanali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Maybe water gobs in LoIo. Need a group probably.<br />
<br />
No need for a group, I went from 48 - 51 here in 3 days, soloing 6ish hours/per day.  Make sure you have some EB item like the fishbone earring, casting EB all the time gets old, fast.  <br />
<br />
Stand away from the gobbies (usually sitting in pairs) until they Just come into your field of view.  Pull one with togors, wait for him to come to you and hit you once. Dogdog will protect his master, allowing you to back up, instill, Dot and sit/med.  The other of the pair will not aggro using this method. Once the first gobbie of the pair is dead, sic dogdog directly on the second, Togors, Dot, instill, sit/med.  I was getting amazing xp/time-spent here.  <br />
<br />
Hit away with JBB if you have one. Not essential this bit.</div></div><hr />
