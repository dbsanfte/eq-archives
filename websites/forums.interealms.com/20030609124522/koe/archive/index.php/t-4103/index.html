<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>xacnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello KoE,<br />
<br />
I was thinking with Luclin coming out on the 4th, it might be nice to have a dungeon romp in Chardok, almost as a pre- celebration to the expansion.  So here's my idea.<br />
<br />
I want to hit Chardok and hit it hard.  I'm sure that there are must be quite a few of you that want to hit the royals for epic pieces, or just nice drops.   I want to go for both, myself.<br />
<br />
In any case, I'd be willing to provide components for CoH, and help out with other costs.  I'm not however, experienced enough to run a raid this large, so I was hoping someone who is would step up.<br />
<br />
If we don't get enough for a full-fledged raid, I wouldn't be opposed to camping the gatehouse.<br />
<br />
I've decided to petition, and would like another chance to play with you all, and I thought this would be a good way to get myself more known.<br />

Would be more than happy to come and help.  Royals do not have anything I really want/need - but sounds like fun none the less.<br />
<br />
I am 56 atm but I am sure will be 57 by the time you do this.  3 Blues to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wedeln</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well... I'm not a petitioner or anything but i count KoE among my closest friends.  I will CotH for the raid if needed.  Only thing is I might not be able to if my guild needs me.  Chances are i can skip out and do at least CotH for you guys.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ramanon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Too funny - looks like this is going to be a KoE raid with no KoE in it.  LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>xacnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A raid is not KoE if it doesn't have any KoE in it.  My intention was to get to know a few more potential guildmates, however, if nonKoE are the only people willing, I'll still run it, we just probably will not be able to do more than camp the entrance.<br />
<br />
I just don't want any confusion, that's all.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vederian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd like to go on this Raid be it KoE or not :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nekky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just an FYI.. KoE does have something going on during this time on sunday that  requires some guild support. I am not sure how many KoE members will be able to attend Char. Just wanted to let you know so it dosen't seem that we are ignoring you. I may try and swing by for a little bit with 1 or 2 of my characters, I really like hanging out in that zone. Good Luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nadonius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well im an hour late on posting, but was unable to attend due to the @Home service shutdown. I'm on dialup now temporarily</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>xacnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm sorry about this.  My campus connection cut out on Sunday.  I couldn't even post to let you all know.<br />
<br />
I feel really awful about trying to set something up then being unable to attend, or even let you know that I couldn't attend.<br />
<br />
I don't know what else to say.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Xacnar- better be careful :)  Hehe, I was in the exact same position as you maybe even more than once... not sure many KoE liked it too much, heh :)<br />
But the fact that there was another KoE guild-supported event probably took a lot of members away anyway, so you may want to try again.  If you ever need my help, give me a tell.</div></div><hr />
