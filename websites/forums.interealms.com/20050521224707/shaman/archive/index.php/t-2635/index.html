<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay..I have read through here and as far as I can tell, there is no way to ever be a successful shaman without this item? Well, at 51 I admit, I haven't tried getting a group in Seb yet to camp for it... Figured I'd be too young yet and get laughed out, and I surely do not have 20k+ to buy one, IF anyone even sold it. <br />
<br />
So, my question is.. how badly do I need this item? I can tell it would be helpful, but is it so necessary that I need to be ripping my hair out worrying about getting one? I do solo some now, usually just rooting and dotting and siccing pet at half health and it works fine. Normally there is enough chanters around I can get KEI easily and cheaply so mana is not much fo a problem...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I didn't get one until 57, I did just fine.  Iksar shaman never get one and are still &quot;successful&quot; shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks, Glori... You'd think by reading here that it is /essential/ to have jbb. Nice to know that I don't need to worry about it right now... After getting alchemy to 70 and buying spells I pretty much stay broke:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Its a wonderful useful item...but not necessary. Hell the recent Lodi solo was done essentialy without the bracer. <br />
<br />
It DOES help soloing some mobs that are immune to poison and disease though...vampyres, sentient suits, things like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I dunno. If you listen to the suitcases on this board they equate the JBB with sex or oxygen:<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't notice it when you are getting them - but lack of either one will KILL YOU.&quot;<br />
<br />
:)=</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree with Gloriana.<br />
<br />
JBB is an outstanding item.... that I lived without, quite easily, until level 57 (or was it 58?) as well.   Just play, try to get in crypt groups and get a chance to win it.  (Make sure you know the loot rules ahead of time, many many pickup groups will decide they are no longer Need Before Greed when nice items drop).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kieran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">A lot depends on your situation. For some, epic is easier to get than a JBB by virtue of having lots of people to call on to help you - plenty of shamans get epiced at 51/52. But by the same token if you have that social structure around you, your personal damage output isn't that important anyway because you are working more as a force multiplier with your groupmates.<br />
<br />
If you're forced into being a lone type by virtue of play hours then you might never get the epic, while the JBB is doable by plugging away at raising the cash. I'm in that boat, and consequently I am completely reliant on my own damage output. For me the JBB was all that, particularly when things go really badly instead of just burning mana to do damage and eating yet another unrezzed death on an unlucky string of resists, I can prevail despite being OOM.<br />
<br />
Either way, getting hung up on one goal like the JBB really isn't healthy for the EQ experience. Because of the nature of EQ and the endless timesinks, I find I'd rather be working towards several goals at once so when I find myself being frustrated by being unable to progress I can just switch to another.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">/agree all<br />
<br />
I am a troll without JBB or snare necklace! OMG!<br />
<br />
But I still enjoy playing :)<br />
<br />
PS - if you have around a dozen friends of similar level, you could do all of the epic quest apart from the plane of Fear. Befriend people in larger guilds to get in on their fear raids, hey presto, epic poker :)</div></div><hr />
