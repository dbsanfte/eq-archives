<br />
I got myself uber this christmas, with the gift of PoP..... i went exploring, and tried to go to a couple of planes..  spent about an hour LFG...  <br />
<br />
I am looking for advice on what planes to hunt in...  I have heard that PoI and PoN are good for my level...  <br />
<br />
also, at what lvl is it feasable to fear kite the rats in PoD?  <br />
<br />
I gave it a whirl, but I was getting resisted alot.... I spent most of my adventure..  running away and rooting, trying to heal up, and getting my &quot;Train!&quot; hotkey ready.. lol...  finally warned the zone, and had to beat feet for the zone.</div></div><hr />
