<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I don't know about you, but we've gotten a majority of our guild flagged for Kod'Taz, but only about 4 people in the guild have GoD spells that drop in sewers, tipt and vxed.  I have Breath of Trushar from a rune in KT, yet no Nihil or Daluda.  I only know of one shaman on the server who has Nihil.<br />
<br />
We killed about 20 named mobs in sewers today and 2 spells dropped (Apathy of the Nihil and War March of the Mastruq).  10% seems really rare.  Considering they can't even be MQed like EPs, SPs and runes, I think the drop rate is too low.<br />
<br />
NONE of the clerics or druids in my guild have their new instant heal.<br />
<br />
<br />
Does anyone have information about where the non-rune spells drop, if they drop in places other than trial areas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Malaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">eheh funny, but the only shaman spells i saw drop were nihil and daluda, both in vxed/tipt , on nameds.<br />
<br />
We had also a few runes drop in kodtaz, from the trash nameds in zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Rumor is that they are going to improve the drop rate for spells and make them tradeable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've seen daluda drop off the named at the end of trial one. He seems about 50:50 from dropping spells based on my limited experience with him. I haven't seen any spells drop off the regular nameds in trial 6 yet. On trial 5 the named lizard (Umbiki or whatever) has allways dropped a spell and an item when we've killed him. He pops pretty close to the zone in so I suppose you could set up to farm him for spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Seen a total of 6 spells.  This counts hours of raid killing to farm smith parts in ferubi, about 6 or 7 sewer trials.  22 quick farms of the first named in vxed, and 6 full tipt runs.  5 of the 6 have been the mage nuke, and the 6th was the bard reflect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My guild has also been hitting GoD, lots of Kodtaz flagged, lots of time spent in the sewers/vxed/tipt.  We havent got any geomancy stones in kodtaz yet.<br />
<br />
I have plague of whatever.<br />
Cleric has holy light<br />
My druidboy has Sylvan Infusion<br />
1 wizard spell<br />
1 necro spell<br />
2 rots of same beastlord spell<br />
chanter has new nuke<br />
like 12 retarded berserker tomes.<br />
<br />
I've killed probably 70? (i dunno, tons) nameds or so in GoD.  Barindu, Vxed, Sewers, Ferubi, Kodtaz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've killed probably 70? (i dunno, tons) nameds or so in GoD.  Barindu, Vxed, Sewers, Ferubi, Kodtaz.<br />
<br />
<br />
All the elites we've kill in Ferubi dropped Luclin spells.  We got Brell's Mountainous Barrier and Cloak of the Akheva the other day.  Utterly stupid. We've gotten no GoD spells from Ferubi and we've done the Smith encounter 4-5 times and have farmed quest drops for a few other people in the guild for future Smith kills.  So that's like 25-30 elite kills and no GoD spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">There are new spells in GoD??!!?<br />
<br />
We have picked up plenty of Berserker Tomes and beastlord nuke scrolls.  When am I gonna wake up and play one of the new classes? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Oongah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Has anyone gotten any spells drops in the crematory or pools sewer trials off the random named?  These 2 trials are soloable up to a point although a bit frisky. I've managed to kill a couple named in there playing around but they didn't drop any spells.  If they have a chance to drop spells though it might be worth keeping at it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">All the elites we've kill in Ferubi dropped Luclin spells.   <br />
<br />
Same here, KEI and BoA as well as Berserker Tomes.  /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jaeydee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">As far as I know there have only been 2 Nihil drops on our server (the Tribunal) and thats it.</div></div><hr />
