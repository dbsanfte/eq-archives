hmm that would suck that would mean the zone isgeared to 52 and lower and beyond that no one higher could get in unless they raise their army of alts heh</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jahvah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Scuttlebutt at the sony.station boards has it that they forgot to add the zone line from Sol B to Sol C. So the zone is there, you just can't get to it...I can just imagine the quality checklist before going live:<br />
<br />
1. Monsters...check<br />
2. Prenerf loot table...check<br />
3. Broken quest mobs...check<br />
4. front door... uhh, front door?</div></div><hr />

My husband is sneakhiding his 65 rogue outta Chard B now and on his way to find Sol C /grin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">yea, you go past the bats on the left, staying on left. You will pass a lil lavafall just before the SolA zone, go across and swim in. Saw 1 piece of &quot; ok&quot;  no drop loot, but i left cause it was just too insane, trains and just complete madness. Its amazing how a individual and be smart, but when you put them with others they become so dumb.  Ill probably check it out in 8 hours or in a few days, HoB was the same way, but once people stopped being retards or just left to go back to whatever, it was a nice zone. This will be the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>cahyre kitty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">My husbands rogue had the following occur... He's 65 with NToV/Luclin and better armor (some ornate) - so there's no lack of HP here and resists aren't bad.<br />
<br />
He did the sneak hide dealy through Sol B (he has the AA level so nothing sees through), he jumped in and zoned, he started drownding as was under water/lava, he swam looking for shore (it was ahead and up a ways), he almost got to land before burning to death...<br />
<br />
After a rez and getting bored with jerks in zone he tried to zone out the same way, he took 2.5 k in lava damage before zoneout, then zoned into a fire giant camp. They helped him die quickly before he could get sneak/hide up.<br />
<br />
What I'm hearing is you need 3k buffed HP and fire resist &gt; 100 at least to even consider making it to shore and an eb item is preferred and good swimming skill. Do not even consider zoning out into Sol B as you will die. Take a porter. Rumour has it there is a Sol A entrance and/or exit and I hope to find out more... supposedly the mobs are a bit lower level that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">The solA entrance is by uppernox, at the top of the lava falls (source of the lava flow).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sounds like your husband's rogue has really terrible swimming skill.<br />
<br />
I've seen more than one naked int caster survive the swim and not drop below 50% health. The lava is painful, but nowhere near as deadly as you describe.<br />
<br />
For zoning out, I don't know...that's what gate is for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Yeah if you cant swim DONT go.  Its a good swim and the longer your in the lava the longer your going to burn.  I didnt remember about the EB as I have the lodi shield.  The biggest problem so far is that as soon as you zone into SoL C your taking damage.  If your one those people with low graphics Memory/System Memory you start taking damage when you enter the zone not when you take control of your charactor.  That length of time can but up to 45secs or more.  So those players that zone slowly will have no chance at making it to the zone with out some time of big heal or Heal over time.  The SoL A side seems to be used less on my server then the Sol B side.  So tends to be alot safer with less trains.</div></div><hr />
