<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snt_asher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I wouldnt worry about your wiz i found that once you get in a group that your never at FM any way and then Wiz dosnt matter.<br />
just go Ac and Hp and cani when you need the mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think you're worrying over nothing.  :)  138 wisdom is just fine (it's about what I have at level 51, and I consider myself fairly well-off gear-wise.)<br />
<br />
If I were to change anything for under 1k...<br />
<br />
Swap out one of your RMBs for a CBB (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=809) (chipped bone bracelet).  Same stats (minus the 4 str) and you get &quot;Affliction Efficiency II&quot; (25% less mana to cast any level 44 or lower DoT - I still use it for stacking VoS on top of EBolt.)  You should even make a bit of cash on the swap.<br />
<br />
You might want to think about a BA Medallion (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6020) (I say &quot;might&quot; because that Innoruuk piece is nice!)  Stats aren't bad (ac 6, +5 wis, +5 int.)  You'll also get &quot;Mana preservation II&quot;, which will cause all spells you cast under level 45 to cost 10% less.  That's a great effect... especially since you've got 14 levels to go before any spells you cast won't work with it!  This should also be pretty reasonably priced (few hundred PP.) <br />
<br />
That's about it- your gear looks pretty good... not much to upgrade without blowing big plat.  Well, I might swap out the charred guardian shield for a clay guardian shield (ac 25, +50 hp, few hundred pp) - but that's taking you in the direction of less WIS- which is not what you say you're looking for.  :)<br />
<br />
Make sure your defense is maxed- it's free AC!<br />
<br />
You're getting close to the stage where incremental gear improvements are going to give you a lot less bang for the buck then just putting money away for the big stuff (JBB, Horse, Fungi staff/tunic, etc.)<br />
<br />
Good hunting!<br />
<br />
P.S.  You might want to check out this thread (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2439) for a few ideas on shaman legs (most of them are too expensive, but there are probably a couple nice reasonable suggestions buried in there.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Haven't had any real problems at 134 wis...or even when it dipped down into the high 120's (went on an ac rampage for a bit...lol).  Be mindful of your ac and hp, young padawan....they will serve you well.<br />
<br />
Cayen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Joo look fine but get somthing on dem skinny green legs :).<br />
<br />
After that just plow cash into da jbb fund...  then da horse fund.<br />
<br />
At 59 I have 141 wisdome 151 when a grizzle bear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for all the help<br />
<br />
I have 100pp saved for the JBB so far, i just keep all gold, and half the pp i make from looting, and put it for the JBB. <br />
<br />
Also, what legs? Should i get the Rygorr Legs( More ac, better stats) or the Totemic( Need FR [its at 5] and completes the plate look cept my bp)<br />
<br />
Also, i spent all 1k, on upgrades, then sold the other slots, and now i have 350 for legs, my equipment now looks like this:<br />
<br />
Ears:Those ac2, 35hp/25mana(this or forest loop?)<br />
Neck: Regent Symbol Of Innoruuk <br />
Face: Bone Mask of the Jarsath<br />
head: JB helm <br />
Rings: 6ac/65hps <br />
wrists: RMB and Chipped bone bracelet<br />
Arms: JB vambraces <br />
Hands: JB Gauntlets <br />
Shoulder: Tattered Mantle <br />
Chest: Ikky Ceramonial BP <br />
Back: Rygorr Oracle Cloak <br />
Waist: Flayed Turmoilskin Belt(got it for 400, woot!)<br />
Legs: Nothing( Going to get Totemic/Rygorr, which??) <br />
Boots: JB Boots <br />
Weapon: Spine Chill Spear( Also Blight) <br />
2nd: Charred Gaurdian Shield (or Sheild of falsehood[gotta do quest] or clay thingy)<br />
Range: Slime coated Harpoon <br />
<br />
Stats are now, my ac was like 694, now its 702. wis is now 133 :( (But got 50+ mana) 945hps!(good switch for 5 wis).<br />
<br />
Any other changes, i have about 350pp need to buy legs, and rest will go to JBB fund.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ok if this was me?<br />
<br />
Get the Rygorr legs and get rid of both those bracers, I would get Rygorr bracers or Sentry bracer if you have the cash from selling the other bracers.<br />
<br />
Use the Clay shield till you can get a Sarnak battle shield and earrings are fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ok, probably the last update for awhile, but still need to know if sentry bracers are good investment. I got a Clay Gaurdian Shield and Rygorr Legs, my Hp is now 1015 at level 35, and ac is 746 or around there. My Wisdom is only 130, and if i get sentry bracers it'll be down to 126. Any other help would be greatly appriciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Keep the CBB, get one sentry bracer.  <br />
<br />
Stats on the sentry are nice:  AC 9, +2 Wis, +2 Int, +15 HP +15 Mana, +3 Dex, +2 vs Magic +5 vs Posion +5 vs Disease<br />
<br />
Between the 2 Wisdom and the 15 mana- you're not really losing much from your mana pool from the 5 WIS of the RMB.<br />
<br />
As for the legs, just grab whichever one comes available first.  Stats aren't different enough to matter.  I might grab the totemic just for fashion- hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dredak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Worked Dragonbone Bracers are pretty good.  AC 12 wis 8 and some charisma i think?<br />
<br />
or is it dragonhorn?  might be dragonhorn, yeah.<br />
<br />
-Dredak</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Heh I finally broke 700 ac at lvl 44, by getting a clay guardian shield<br />
not sure what my wis is, prolly, 150 or so</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The AC 2 hp 35 mana 25 ears are much better than the forest loops.  Forest loops at your level give you in the high 20's of mana, and the others give you 25 mana plus 35 HP at what, the loss of 1 AC and dex 3?  Easy choice.<br />
<br />
I'd go with rygorr legs.<br />
<br />
I'd also get used to having to carry backpacks full of alternate gear.  You might have to do a lot of earning to do that.  <br />
<br />
At 52, I soloed with 120 wisdom and did fantastic.  But grouped, you want to get more wisdom.  People will need your heals, and you'll have to make some sacrifices.  Other times, you'll need some resists -- there's always a sacrifice waiting to be made somewhere.  <br />
<br />
My shaman at 60 carries 3 bags PLUS full of stuff -- one bag is full of blue diamond resist gear alone.  Then there's the froggy crown for fire/cold resist, etc, etc.  Pre-epic, he carried a dark ember for fire resist and a spine chill for cold resist.<br />
<br />
You already have the ikky BP, which is incredible at your level.  My guess is you are seriously kicking ass.  I'd recommend you solo constantly until your defense and all your weapons are maxed -- get a 1h blunt too.  At your level, with an ikky BP, you can kick the hell out of mobs in The Overthere and make much more exp solo than you would in most groups.  When you get your 39 pet, you'll be real happy.  Use it smartly and it will NEVER die. <br />
<br />
Basically, with the ikky BP alone you're very well set.  Time to start saving up for the JBB.  It isn't sold very often at all, so you need to save as early as possible so you have the max possible window of opportunity to buy it.  It is truly god-like at 45, and while 15k (JBB price on my server) is well beyond the ability of most non-twink shamans at 45, the sooner you get it, the faster you will rocket through the late 40's and low 50's.<br />
<br />
Fill out your stuff with cheap stuff like rygorr(which is actually good stuff) and save, save, save.<br />
<br />
And when you get done saving for the JBB -- start saving for a fungi.  <br />
<br />
Shamans can go a long way without buying too many upgrades.  And they pretty much have to if they want the good armor and equipment.<br />
<br />
P.S. -- another thing worth saving for -- rune etched icewurm fang, 12/19 piercer that proc's a very nice cold DD.  You can actually do some serious damage with this thing.  As a comparison -- a mini-epic monks have called the Whistling Fists is only 12/20, and has NO DD component.</div></div><hr />
