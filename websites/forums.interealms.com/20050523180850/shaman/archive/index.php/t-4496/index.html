<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I don't really pay that much attention to loot.  Luckily my guild has been doing everything outside Emperor/VT and we get lots of drops.  My problem is since I don't pay that much attention, I often make mistakes on loot requests.  Its to late for me to take back this one, but I was curious as to opinions on the best back slots in game:<br />
<br />
Thoughts?  Give me it order of that you think.  I know they are all good, but still curious how people rate them.<br />
<br />
Some ones you might consider in no particular order are:<br />
<br />
Cloak of the Sky<br />
Cloak of Icy Shadows<br />
Shroud of Emerald Vines<br />
Cloak of Mourning<br />
Heriphant Cloak<br />
Net of Deep Seas<br />
Cloak of the Black Wind</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The net is a decent item for the effect and ac. Cloak of Mourning is a great item for all around. I use the Shroud of Emerald Vines right now, and I am quite happy with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There was a good thread on the top 5 back slot items not long ago, trying hard to find it, may have been on the old board.<br />

It was posted by you...whats changed?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>smashie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hiero Cloak is the easiest best cloak to get by far. I duoed in the crypt with a ranger and we ended up leaving because we didn't want another Hiero Cloak to drop and rott. :b<br />
<br />
Lodi Shield is very nice for resists, but lack of hp makes it kinda crappy. <br />
<br />
My favorite is the Cloak of Sky because I like HP. No other cloak is 100 hp...<br />
<br />
But now that the healing penalty has been removed, the Shroud of Veeshan is very very tempting with 110 mana and it's focus effect... If the focus effect stacks with AA skillz, sup heal could possibly heal for over 1k!</div></div><hr />

Off hand both the Cloak of Mourning and the Cloak of the Black Wind both have 100 hps on them. Not sure on Cloak of Icy Shadows since I don't know that one off hand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There is a cloak off the hp also, thats what ive got on atm.  Its got 90 hp and mana, and 12 sta plus other stuff.  Not exactly the best cloak on the list, but you'd probly be happy wearing it for a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ok, excuse my ghettoness (I wear a Acrylia Cloak)...what about Cloak of Truth?<br />
<br />
AC 15, lots of stats +5% to meditate (Is that like flowing thought 0.5?)<br />
<br />
Yes? No? Go back to Kenny's house Faern?</div></div><hr />

I'm lusting after a Cloak of the Sky at the moment.  Tho my friend in another guild that does ssra more often got a totally kick ass cloak with FT and everything else you'd want on a cloak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Snacko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Cloak of mourning from the Cursed is hands down the best cloak for us.  Cloak of sky would probably draw a close second.</div></div><hr />

Another good choice for the not so uber guild shaman. Rumblecrush drops it.</div></div><hr />

Everything without resists/hp can go right in the crapper.  Outside of the painfully obvious Cloak of Black Wind I would hafta pick Shroud of Emerald Vines.<br />
<br />
Crashem, j00 just go and dig this thread back up a couple months after VI gets done with the bug fixes in PoP k?? :)</div></div><hr />

stats don't beat the others mentioned but it has 34% haste for all the melee shammys out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">It would totally depend if you have a spell haste III focus item.  If so, one of those; if not, then Dain's cloak.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oooh...I'll have one of them please :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ronfar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Cloak of Maneuvering<br />
<br />
AC: 25 <br />
Skill Mod: Dodge +5% <br />
DEX: +15 AGI: +15 HP: +115 MANA: +80 <br />
SV FIRE: +12 SV DISEASE: +12 SV COLD: +12 SV MAGIC: +12 <br />
SV POISON: +12<br />
<br />
I think I'd consider this to be the best shaman back slot currently in game. It's from Thall Va Kelun in VT if you care. While there is at least one 125hp cloak that is shaman usable, the dodge mod and avoidance AC from the agility (assuming you don't have it maxed) make this cloak spectacular.<br />
<br />
Cloak of Icy Shadows <br />
<br />
AC: 30<br />
STR: +15 AGI: +15 HP: +125 MANA: +50<br />
SV FIRE: +5 SV DISEASE: +5 SV COLD: +5 SV MAGIC: +5 SV POISON: +5<br />
Effect: Icicle Aura (Casting Time: Instant)<br />
<br />
I guess this would have to be a close second. Drops from Thall Va Xakra in VT, and probably now rarely off Eom's that are caster classes. The effect is a 6 point DS, that stacks with everything but the effect on Cloak of Thorns, which we can't use anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Yah cloak of mourning that was it.  That's the best cloak hands down from my PoV.  I know we can have nice mana regen and all that with canni but all-the-time-no-work-involved mana regen is also pretty nice and worth losing some resists in my opinion.  Plus it's arguably easier to get than a VT cloak which is the next closest cloak out there.  <br />
<br />
What I want are three or four items that max my FT.  That cloak, a burrower tunic, a IV neck, and my POTC earring would come close at 12 total.  Yah yah i know, dream on :P</div></div><hr />
