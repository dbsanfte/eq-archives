<br />
A guildie dug this one up and I must say it is damn impressive. I have already set mine up to track Slow, Malo, Cripple, Canni5, Disease Dot's and a general use 1hr timer.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>dennman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">oh wow this owns!!!! what timers did you guys set? cann5 is 3 min..and how long is turgur again? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Batuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am using this timer.  It just plain rocks.  I'm timing Turgur's, PoI, Regrowth, MGB, and most importantly Canni V!<br />
<br />
Get this!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This is very nice.<br />
<br />
I got Turg malo and PoI up there so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have tried it... only thing I would like to know is how you reset the individual bars if you don't recast at exactly the end of the timer... like CanniV for example... I don;t always recast at exactly 3 minutes. If I cast it in the middle of the timer bar, I wouldlike to reset the bar. This would save me a button on my hotkeys.<br />
<br />
Or is this what the sliders are for?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">if you say reslow at half the bar you set the slider to the middle. the bars are in a loop.  when it reaches one end it starts from the beginning. when it gets near your slider you know its about to wear off. <br />
<br />
this is especially cool becuase it doesnt reset after you zone. many times i die after a slow and this way i can keep track on how close a slow is to wearring off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Chuk has it right.<br />
You just move the &quot;tick&quot; mark to the point in time where you cast or did your particular action. The timer loops around, and when it approaches your tick, its time to redo.<br />
I set one up for:<br />
6mins - turgurs.<br />
13mins - malo/cripple (figured they both cast at around the same time)<br />
1.8mins - disease dots<br />
3mins - canni5 and I let it double as a PoI timer<br />
1hr - general use timer - it breaks down to 10mins per major mark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">OMG!  /drool<br />
<br />
This mod is a must have</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kongming</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Cause I think this is needed to be seen by all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>CheezorChic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm having problems with this file, my ui just DONT like the friends xml i'm putting in<br />
<br />
when i first tried it i only put in 1 buff timer, worked fine so i started adding more, when i did it the second time with 5 windows it rejected it...<br />
<br />
when i put it in my custom it just rejects it and makes me load my default, so i put it in my default thinkin it was one of my other mods bein stupid, but alas no it just overwrote it when i logged in /boggle on<br />
<br />
anyone else have problems with this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>CheezorChic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">never mind! fixed it<br />
<br />
i didn't wait for the whole page to dl when i went to view source so i cut it off halfway not thinkin that that file would be bigger than my 1 buffer would be bleh<br />
<br />
heheh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Winnow D'Minnow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I like this.  I've been using it for Ferine Avatar and SLTW mostly but do have FOS and Boar timed as well.<br />
<br />
With CanV it's easy enough to just click/press the HotKey to see how much time remains.<br />
<br />
Be sure to adjust times for SCR and SCRM : )</div></div><hr />

In my over 3 years of playing (half of that in an uber guild, now in tier 4 planes)  I have only ever timed slow and can easily do that with my watch.  I time buffs by when it blinks its time to recast :).  It seems to me the constant resetting and adjusting of timers would be a much bigger hastle then its worth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Any advice on getting more than one timer to show. I did the 1x5 and 5x1 option for 5 timers and all I see on my screen is the first timer I defined?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I only use one of these timers in my UI, and that is for Turgur's. <br />
<br />
It isn't much of a hassle at all since it takes all of a second or two to set the slider on the timer to let you know when you need to recast.<br />
<br />
My own preference is to have a visual aid that lets you know when you need to recast instead of watching the minute/second hands on a watch.<br />
<br />
 I personally think this is worth sticking into your UI.</div></div><hr />

It's all done online and generates the content of an XML file for you. You can choose quite a few options:<br />

Might just be issues with the web host.</div></div><hr />
