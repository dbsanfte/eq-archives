<br />
Quite often we have another Ranger (55) with us also.<br />
<br />
Currently be doing Right Courtyard / Dog Capt / Skel in Karnors Castle. Occasionally ZI and ZO in Chardok.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions please?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

You are losing at least 50 percent of the potential EXP you can make almost anyplace else.  KC is probably the worst Zone Experience Modifier (ZEM) in the game.  After level 51, no one should use KC as a EXP zone unless you just like to prolong leveling.  (yeah, yeah basement is decent till 59ish , but not likely hes gonna be soloing or doing much duo down there)<br />
<br />
Chardok is great place to Duo (but only if you dont want rings or cords, cause it will tank your faction and it takes weeks to repair it).<br />
<br />
Since you have a 59 cleric to pull/break with, Zin/Zout for Sebillis.  Howling Stones Zin is really good, once you break with cleric pulling its cake and usually unoccupied zone on all servers.<br />
<br />
If you have Velious, hit Kael Frostie House.  Good till mid 57-58.  Otters in Cobalt Scars are good, most quaders leave the shaman otters alone, Cleric can single pull them easy.<br />
<br />
If you have Luclin, Akheva Ruins, Acrylia Caverns, plataue in Scarlet Desert, The Grey is really good EXP.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Twinrivers</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 03:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, thanks for the great advice. Aye a few days back I moved from Karnors and into Sebilis. Since then I've been doing ZO, ajoining room / guards etc... when things settle down in the zone and there are not so many people running trains out its been great!<br />
<br />
I've also dabbled in Chardok ZI / ZO, but only briefly. I am very close to 57 (Like hald a blue) so once I obtain and secure that I'll move out and try some of the other suggested spots.<br />
<br />
Once again, thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />
