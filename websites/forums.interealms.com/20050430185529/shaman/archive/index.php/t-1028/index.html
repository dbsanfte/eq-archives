<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am looking to get some ivory imbued jewelry. Just wondering what mobs drop it and where.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Phern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I remember getting Ivory in The Overthere, off of the succulents (cactus) I think, and I also had some drop in Fironia Vie from Drolvargs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nothenon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've gotten ivory as a drop from aviaks in South Karana and more commonly from evil eyes in the Gorge of King Xorbb.<br />
<br />
I've also been able to find it pretty commonly on vendors for 7 to 11pp depending on faction and charisma.  Check merchants in East and South Karana, as well as Rivervale and Misty Thicket.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure that there's a lot of other places where it drops since I tend to see it on vendors all over the place from time to time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Drops occasionally off skulking brutes at the entrance to Dalnir in Warsliks's Woods (doable solo around level 30 or so).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Drops off most level 20-35 mobs.  Easier to just check a few merchants in those level range zones and buy them for 10pp or so each.  I usually could find enough on merchants and then imbue them all and give them to an Enchanter to make my jewelry and let them keep the extra imbued ivory as payment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the quick response.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have always been able to buy ivory from vendors in Thurgadin. One of the vendors in the bank always seems to have ivory, as does the guy in the gems/metal shop</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zillanex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Looted one ivory from a cockatrice east of the outpost in OT, not very common it seems though, think i seen 1 drop in 10 levels :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Daxon Fatebringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ice Giants seem to drop a LOT of ivory.  At least a lot more than others from my experience.  A good day long session will yield about 3 to 6 ivories.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've looted ivory all over the place.  2 places that spring to mind immediately - Crystal Caverns and just about anything in Lake Ill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zenyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah have looted ivory in LOIO, Frontier Mountains (from the giants) even looted a piece of ivory from a named bandit in the bandit camp in EK (Holson...?) just last night</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">also drops in sol B off of kobolds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>flinx_21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">all I know is now that I am not looking for it I see it for sale at every other merchant  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Lexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">3 pieces in riverdale, 1 off the poison, desease, vendor in everfrost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Cynthia (non-faction hit gypsy) in Rathe mountains drops ivories as well as other lesser gems.<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />
Frekkels<br />
