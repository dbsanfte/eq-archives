<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ridik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm at a crossroads in my gear and looking for some experienced advice.  I've been sporting a Fungi for 40+ lvls now, and have always considered it my prize piece of gear.  It helps me keep my mana up with Cana, it helps me tank, saves group healers mana.  But now I'm 61, and have replenishment and Torpor, and that 15hps a tick vs. pop mobs really doesnt seem to be such a big deal anymore.  <br />
<br />
I've been considering selling off the Fungi (before the price drops any harder) and picking up a Tae Ew Tunic and Shield to replace my chest slot and SBS.  But I'm just having a hard time letting go of an item I've treasured for so long.  What I want to know what are the opinions of some who have done this, tossed the fungi post Torpor or 61.  What are your experience in changing playstyle.  Does it affect your downtime soloing?  Will pushing me over 1K AC mitigate the damage that the fungi would have regened anyway?<br />
<br />
hmm, I just did the math and I think I may have convinced myself... if I swap out Fungi &amp; SBS for Tae Ew gear I'll be upgrading: AC:+34 Str:+6 Wis:+19 Sta:+3 Agi:+18 Dex:+15 Magic:-5 Fire:+20 Cold:-5 Posion:+12 Disease+12 Hp:+60 Mana:+100, and probably about 30K or so to spare.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?  thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
Also, my magelo is in my sig, feel free to suggest any easy upgrades if you like.  I know most on this board are jaded to the equip inquiries, so I wanted to make my main question more specific but am always open to suggestions as well.  For reference, I'm in a small guild only about 20ppl average lvl 58.</div></div><hr />

lol...sell that...but dont ditch the fungi until you are 60 and have torpor, no matter what. Unless you have someone that wants to buy it for suffecient funds to cover the cost of torpor now, dont let go of the fungi.</div></div><hr />

60+ shammy with torpor has no need for a fungi - sold mine to buy torpor when I reached 60, and haven't regretted it for a second.  You'll get more benefit from the stats on the tae ew than you'l get from the fungi regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>reaper23</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Also if u have 30k extra after bp and shield upgrades than u can buy a hierophant's cloak for a extra 75 hp and 75 mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">LOL and I was chewing someone else for not reading the entire thread. My bad, by all means ditch the fungi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Torguren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What I did to get a Tae Ew Tunic and shield was buy the blood needed to make the items, at about 2k per blood.  So thats 6k then for the tunic I bought the distilled mana for about 400pp, I then found a smith who said they would do the combine for me for a donation of 1 blood per combine.  He also provided the metal, the molds, and the other item needed in the shield combine he charged me 100pp for.<br />
<br />
So after all was said and done I paid 6.4k for the tunic and 2.1k for the shield.  I got really lucky in finding a smith as well as a brewer all in one who was not hung up on only doing cultural combines, like a few smiths I have come across.  Is a pretty cheap way to get some nice upgrades, if you can get as lucky as I did then you could prolly just save up about 9k and hang onto your fungi.  Just an idea not sure about what the smiths are like on your server.  Good luck.<br />
