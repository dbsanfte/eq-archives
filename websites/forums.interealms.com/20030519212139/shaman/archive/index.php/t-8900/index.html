<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lehua</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The Cudgel Quests For Good Races<br />
<br />
This quest has been completed by a barbarian shaman of the tribunal.  Total estimated time for the cudgels 1-8 is about 30 game hours depending on your faction with the Mystics of Cabilis.<br />
<br />
Faction<br />
<br />
To even start this quest you need to be at least amiable to the Shaman guild in Cabilis  and the maximum faction you can get from turning in bone chips or explorer knives will get you to indifferent.  I personally have turned in more than 3000 bone chips and 120 explorer knives to get my faction from scowl to indifferent.  I suggest not doing the explorer knife quests if you are below level 60 because you will eventually become KOS to Firiona Vie and you won’t be able to buy anything from there until you fix your faction again.  If you’re not concerned about Firiona Vie faction, the explorer knives do give a lot more faction than the bone chips do.  <br />
<br />
If you are KOS to the troopers of Cabilis, you need a friendly enchanter with project illusion to cast illusion iksar on you until you become non kos to the trooper you hand your bone chips into without iksar illusion.  The troopers do not see invis, but if you hand something in to them you will automatically become visible.  It took approximately 1500 bone chips to get from scowl to dubious to do the bone chip quest without having to get iksar illusion.  Same goes with the explorer knives quest.  If you are not at least dubious to the trooper you hand your items to, you would need illusion iksar cast upon you.  You can start the cudgel quests once you become at least amiable in iksar form to the Mystics of Cabilis which may be still KOS without iksar illusion, but I suggest becoming non KOS to them before starting the quest just in case.  Dubious faction without iksar illusion should make you amiable/kindly with it.  <br />
<br />
A good way to test your faction without having to go inside Cabilis to con the shamans is to stay outside away from the Crusaders and con them.  When you do the explorer knives or bone chip quests, you gain 5 factions with Cabilis which are Mystics, Troopers, Crusaders, Merchants, and Monks.  People tend to get Trooper faction up quickly because they take faction hits from hunting in Old Sebilis. Even though Troopers may con a higher faction to you, crusaders/mystics/merchants/monks will still be KOS to you.  Since you will be taking the crusader faction hits at the same time you’ll be taking the mystic hits, your faction with crusaders and mystics should be about equal unless you have killed iksar crusaders before.  <br />
<br />
Without doing the explorer knife quests I have been told it takes at least 5000 bone chips to get from scowl to dubious.  Your friendly enchanter will need to help you with all 8 of the cudgels, so make sure he/she is in a safe place in Cabilis before casting iksar illusion on you for your quests.  Even with iksar illusion it is still possible to be KOS to all of Cabilis.<br />

<br />
Penance<br />
<br />
If you want to bother with this quest, there is no way a good race can complete it.  You need to go to the necromancer guild in West Cabilis for part of the quest and all good races are naturally KOS to them.  The penance quest can be found &lt;a target=&quot;pennance&quot; href=&quot;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1259&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  You would need an iksar to actually do the quest to get the cudgel of the petitioner and multiquest it with you to get your first cudgel.<br />

Iron Cudgel of the Clairvoyant (Cudgel 1)<br />
<br />
This part of the text has been taken from the first cudgel quest off of &lt;a target=&quot;Allakhazam's&quot; href=&quot;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/&quot;&gt;Allakhazam’s&lt;/a&gt;:<br />
<br />
Talk to Hierophant Oxyn in the Temple of Terror. After you return complete the Curse Wafer's Quest, ask Hierophant Oxyn &quot;What lost skulls?&quot; and he responds, &quot;You must have heard of the Trilac Brotherhoods disappearance. They are the skulls of three soon to be ancients. They were taken from this temple by a silent intruder. Crusaders are always on duty. I do not know how they got into our vault. Every petitioner is ordered to search for the three skulls and return them to me along with their petitioner cudgel and then they shall become clairvoyants.&quot; <br />
<br />
When asked &quot;What Iron Cudgel of the Clairvoyant?&quot; Hierophant Oxyn shakes his head and waves a finger in your face. If you are looking to be handed the Iron Cudgel of the Clairvoyant then you are sadly mistaken. Perhaps if you were to gather a few [lost skulls] for the temple we may find you worthy to wield one. So you obviously need to gather the skulls to find out how the get the cudgel. The three skulls are named Waz, Morgl, and Logrin. The intruder can be found in the &quot;sewer&quot; area of East Cabilis. (I have been told he has been spotted in the Swamp of no Hope as well). <br />
<br />
The way to get to the sewers from the Temple of Terror is to swim past the bridge then to the left and under one of the docks that the gondola stops at. If you find an underwater tunnel that has barracuda swimming in it, you have found it. Follow the tunnel and you'll occasionally come to some open areas that you can jump out of the water. Any jump-out point is good, however the last one allows the greatest access to MOBs to kill and cause the Iksar outcast to spawn. In this area spawns mostly mosquitoes, and scorpions with the occasional decaying skeleton. The rare spawns are the Iksar outcast and the giant leech. <br />
<br />
Collect all 3 skulls and return them to Oxyn along with the “Cudgel of a Petitioner” you received when you gave your guild note to the guild master (NOT THE WOODEN ONE). You receive some faction, coinage, your very own Iron Cudgel of the Clairvoyant and the second skull quest.<br />
<br />
Estimated time: 3 hours<br />
<br />
The way I did it was I had a friend create a newbie iksar shaman and turned in the note to get the Cudgel of the Petitioner.  Go to the sewers in Cablis where this quest explains to go, and kill everything that spawns in that one square area until you get your 3 skulls.  It’ll seem like you can’t jump up from the water to the ledge but you can.  Once you get the skulls have, ask the enchanter to project illusion iksar on you and have the newbie shaman turn in the Cudgel of the Petitioner.  Then you turn in the 3 skulls and you get your Cudgel of the Clairvoyant.<br />
<br />
Iron Cudgel of the Seer (Cudgel 2)<br />
<br />
This part of the text has been taken from the first cudgel quest off of &lt;a target=&quot;Allakhazam's&quot; href=&quot;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/&quot;&gt;Allakhazam’s&lt;/a&gt;:<br />
<br />
After completing the first quest, Heirophant Onyx sends you on a two part quest. The first part is to get two Cleansers of the Outland skulls and return them to him along with your Iron Cudgel of the Clairvoyant. He says when you have done this he will tell you where to get the next two skulls. Skull with I is found on a stuffed giant barracuda in Lake of Ill Omen. In Warsliks Woods, a Rogue Shaman Spawns. He drops a Jawless Skull and a note. The note tells you about the barracuda. You need to go to Field of Bones and kill another rogue shaman to get the Mandible. The note also says that you can buy Mendglow Clay in Cabilis, but nobody can find a place that sells it. It can however be foraged in the Burning Woods by a master forager (with much effort). Take your Jawless Skull, Mandible and Mendglow clay and combine them on a potters wheel (make sure you have a decent pottery skill). Do NOT add water. The combination will result in Skull with II. Turn Skull with I and Skull with II along with your cudgel of the Clairvoyant to Oxyn and get some xp, coin and an Iron Cudgel of the Seer (4/21). When you finish this, Hierophant Oxyn says, 'We are in your debt. You are truly one who shall collect all the lost ancient skulls. Take your weapon. Go to Hierophant Zand and he shall guide you further. Tell him you are [the chosen saviour.]<br />
<br />
Estimated time: 3 hours<br />
<br />
You might need the help of a druid/ranger for this part of the quest.  You need to kill the stuffed barracuda in Lake of Ill Omen which is always up for the Skull with I.  The rogue shaman in Warsliks Woods spawns in the first ruins when you enter Warsliks Woods from Field of Bone.  There are 3 placeholders in those ruins which you kill to make the rogue shaman spawn.  It took me about 20 minutes to get the shaman to spawn.  Loot the jawless skull from him and the note which tells you about the rogue shaman in Field of Bone.  The rogue shaman in Field of Bone spawned for me at 3:00 a.m. game time.  You need to keep clearing all of the spawns around Kurns Tower for him to spawn.  He will aggro on different random NPCs which could kill him so keep an eye out for him or ask a druid or ranger to keep tracking for him.  He drops the mandible for the second skull.  Mendglow Clay is foraged in Burning Woods.  You can either have your nice druid or ranger friend spend the next hour or so foraging in Burning Woods, or you can find someone in bazaar usually selling it.  You need to combine the Mendglow Clay, the mandible, and the jawless skull in a pottery wheel to get the Skull II.  My pottery is 140 and was trivial.  People have had lower pottery and combined it no problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lehua</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Iron Cudgel of the Mystic (Cudgel 3)<br />
<br />
This part of the text has been taken from the first cudgel quest off of &lt;a target=&quot;Allakhazam's&quot; href=&quot;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/&quot;&gt;Allakhazam’s&lt;/a&gt;:<br />
<br />
Tell Hierophant Zand &quot;I am the chosen savior&quot; and he closes his eyes and bows before you. &quot;I am honored to meet the one who shall pledge his life to the return of the Skulls of the Ancients. However, I must see proof of our prowess as of yet. Go to the outlands and retrieve one Froglok Hexdoll, and no, they are not found on Frogloks. They are shaman dolls made by the goblin tribe.&quot; The doll can be found on a Goblin Hextracer in Warslik's Woods. After you turn in the Hexdoll, you get a note to deliver to Crusader Quarg in Field of Bones. Quarg gives you a six slot container and tells you to go to the Tower of Kurn and bring him the Skulls of the Caste of Bone Bretheren, a caste of powerful shamans who perished fighting undead in the Field of Bone several decades ago. You are to get the skulls of the 5 Caste members along with the Skull of the Leader. The Leader Skull is a Lore skull with an &quot;X&quot;. The others are non lore Skulls with an &quot;X&quot;. (When Identified, they say Caste of Bone Bretheren). They all off the Crusader in Kurn's Tower. Put them in the bag and combine it. This turns the bag into &quot;C.O.B.B box&quot; Take that back to Crusader Quarg, along with your previous cudgel, and he will give you the Iron Cudgel of the Mystic.<br />
<br />
Estimated time: 6 hours<br />
<br />
This by far has to be the most boring part of the quest.  I can personally vouch for the 6 hours on this quest.  The Goblin Hextracer is always up in Warsliks Woods, so ask your friendly druid/ranger to help you track him and kill him.  Loot the Hexdoll and then you ask your friendly enchanter to illusion you in cabilis for the note and in field of bone to get the box.  Note: You have to be in iksar form for any turn in you do or you will lose that part of the quest.  I have spent almost 4 hours completely clearing out all the skeletons in kurns many times over and gotten one undead crusader to spawn.  I am not sure if this is luck or if the undead crusader despawns if you don’t kill him in a certain amount of time, but the only place I have seen him spawn is on the stairs between the third and fourth floors in kurns.  The loc they give on Allakhazams is -98, -223, 122.  I am not sure if the sitting makes it spawn more often, but I have gotten 5 skulls in 2 hours just by sitting in that spot.  Even if it’s just luck, it won’t hurt to try.<br />
<br />
Iron Cudgel of the Prophet (Cudgel 4)<br />
<br />
This part of the text has been taken from the first cudgel quest off of &lt;a target=&quot;Allakhazam's&quot; href=&quot;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/&quot;&gt;Allakhazam’s&lt;/a&gt;:<br />
<br />
After completing quest No 3, Crusader Quarg says... &quot;The temple shall be pleased. As instructed by the Hierophants, here is your Iron Cudgel of the Mystic. You have done well that I must ask you to [collect the Crusaders of Rok Nilok]. Take this chest (6 slot). Inside you shall combine the skull of their leader and at least five of the caste members (sound familliar). You then will go to the Swamp Garrison and deliver the full chest and your Iron Cudgel of the Mystic to Mystic Dovan. Go to him now and inquire of the Crusaders of Rok Nilok.&quot; Mystic Dovan spawns after 9pm on top of the building with the warlord in Swamp of no hope and says when you inquire &quot;Mystic Dovan lowers his head in sorrow let us have a moment of peace. I cannot find the words to speak of the unspeakable act of the gods which took the lives of the legendary Crusaders of Rok Nilok. You must find the answers for yourself. All I can do is wait for their return.&quot; The legend of Nilok says that he and his followers were shrunk down by a magical rain and that nilok's head burns red. You need to go to the first goblin ruins in Warsilik's Woods (when entering from Field of Bone) and hunt the Goblin Bloodtracers. These drop the 5 glowing skulls you need. You also need to get one Lore glowing skull (also dropped by these goblin bloodtracers, but much more rare). Combine the 5 skulls and lore skull in the box given by Dovan and return them to Donovan, along with your previous cudgel I think, and you will recieve the Iron Cudgel of the Prophet.<br />
<br />
Estimated time: 5 hours<br />
<br />
Mystic Dovan actually spawned at around 11:00 p.m. game time for me.  He spawns next to Warlord Hikyg in Swamp of No Hope.  There are Goblin Bloodtracers all over Swamp of No Hope, but the easiest place to find them is in the goblin fort.  Just kill all of the goblins in there and the bloodtracers will randomly spawn.  They always drop either a glowing skull or the lore skull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lehua</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Iron Cudgel of the Channeler (Cudgel 5)<br />
<br />
This part of the text has been taken from the first cudgel quest off of &lt;a target=&quot;Allakhazam's&quot; href=&quot;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/&quot;&gt;Allakhazam’s&lt;/a&gt;:<br />
<br />
After completing quest 4, Dovan tells you about the skulls of Di Nozok. He says &quot;bring them to me, I shall wait within Zand&quot;. Go talk to Heirophant Zand about the skulls for more information. <br />
<br />
The first one is the Skull of Die Nozok. It drops in the Sarnak fortress in the Lake of Ill Omen off of the Iksar Adherant. <br />
<br />
The second one is the Skull of Dai Nozok. The details of this are still sketchy, so I can't vouch for all of them. You need to kill Overseer Dlubish in Nurga and get the Dai Nozok Canopic. You also need to get the two keys of Zai, which drop in four pieces as froglok ton totems (I think there are three ton totems and one orange totem -- use identify to be sure of what you get) off of Froglok Ton Warriors in the Swamp of No Hope. I think that these need to be combined with some mendglow clay to create the two keys. You then hand the keys and the canopic and 400 gp to Galdon Vok Nir in the Overthere to get the Skull. Be careful of your faction here. You may need an enchanter to help you do this part. <br />
<br />
Turn in both skulls and your Cudgel of the Prophet to Heirophant Zand and you will get the next cudgel.<br />
<br />
Estimated time: Days<br />
<br />
This cudgel took me about 3 hours.  You can kill 2 birds with one stone here if you have a druid or ranger along with you.  Yes, you do need mendglow clay again, but this is the last time you’ll need it.  In Swamp of No Hope there is an iksar brigand camp at 2400, 0.  You need to clear this camp and the entire surrounding area of mobs to make the Froglok Ton Warriors to spawn.  The warriors are kos to everything else that spawns there so you need a ranger or druid to track him and kill him before the other mobs do.  It took me about 1 hour of clearing the area to get 1 whole key of zai and 3 fragments from the ton warriors.  You need to go to a pottery wheel and combine the 3 broken pieces with mendglow clay to get your second key of zai.  My pottery skill is at 140, but I have heard other people doing it with less skill.  <br />
<br />
The skull off the Sarnak Adherants in Lake of Ill Omen is fairly common.  Just go to the Sarnak Fort and kill the Adherants and one in two will probably drop a skull.  You might want to have your ranger or druid friend to tag along and track for a Sarnak Dragoon also.  There’s a helm you need from him for a future cudgel.  Be careful though, this helm is no rent so you’ll have to do that cudgel before you log off or you’ll have to look for another dragoon in the fort.  <br />
<br />
The Dai Nozok Canopic was pretty easy to get.  Overseer Dublish can spawn more commonly in Nurga but I have also seen him spawn in Droga also.  Have your ranger or druid friend track in Nurga for him and stonechanter goblins.  They drop chant rocks for your next cudgel.  You need the one that looks like a skinning rock or a sharpening stone or dragon egg graphic.  It’s tan in color and identifies as slate chant rock.  Have your ranger and druid friend forage for you also because you need a sponge mushroom from there also for your next cudgel.<br />
<br />
Now that you have your 2 keys and the Canopic, head to Overthere with your enchanter friend.  Have him/her cast iksar illusion on you before you head into the outpost.  The npcs here are on venril sathir faction, so if you killed in karnors, kaesora, or howling stones before I suggest invising before heading inside.  Galdon Vok Nir is pretty easy to get to.  He’s in the corner away from all of the other npcs in the outpost so you shouldn’t have a problem turning in your 2 keys, canopic, and 400 gold to him to get your second skull.  Turn in the skull from the Adherant and the skull from Galdon plus your fourth cudgel to Hierophant Zand and you get your next cudgel.<br />
<br />
Iron Cudgel of the Hierophant (Cudgel 6)<br />
<br />
This part of the text has been taken from the first cudgel quest off of &lt;a target=&quot;Allakhazam's&quot; href=&quot;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/&quot;&gt;Allakhazam’s&lt;/a&gt;:<br />
<br />
After you complete the last quest for you Cudgel of the Channeler (and many <br />
congrats by the way you are an elite Iksar Shaman by now) you speak to <br />
Hierophant Dexl, the other Hierophant. This is the conversation. <br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail Hierophant Dexl' <br />
<br />
Hierophant Dexl seems to be preocupied. He is examining an egg. 'What?!! <br />
Who has [sent] you to me? Bah!! Away with you.' He ignores you and <br />
continues chanting. <br />
<br />
You say, 'Di Nozok sent me' <br />
<br />
Hierophant Dexl drops the egg he was holding. Egg yolk splatters on your <br />
foot. His eyes roll back into his head. He speaks, but his voice is that of <br />
a female. 'I await you, Cradossk . My sisters and I yearn for the return of <br />
our skulls. We are the [Sisters of Scale]. Find us and bring to this <br />
hierophant our skulls and your iron cudgel of the Channeler. Go.' <br />
<br />
You say, 'Who are the Sisters of Scale' <br />
<br />
Hierophant Dexl wipes egg yolk from his clothing. 'My, what a mess!! <br />
Hmmph!! What did you say? Sisters of Scale? They were a legendary trio of <br />
mystics. We once had their skulls sealed within this temple, but now they <br />
are lost. I sent a channeler to retrieve them. His name was Vagnar. I am <br />
sure he shall find them.' <br />
<br />
You say, 'who is vagnar' <br />
<br />
Hierophant Dexl says 'He's a capable channeler, I trust he knows where to <br />
look and will prepare himself. Any competent servant of our Lord would <br />
prepare potions and supplies before going on such a quest. If he doesn't <br />
come back, it's no great loss, he wasn't Hierophant material anyway <br />
<br />
This is as far as Dexl goes. The next set of clues was found on the Herb <br />
Vendor Island in West Cabilis. The dialogue goes like this. <br />
<br />
You say, 'Who what where is Vagnar' <br />
<br />
Jaxxtz says 'Vagnar? I don't recall.....Unless Vagnar was that shaman <br />
supposedly on some quest to save our entire race from total <br />
destruction..someone always on one of those. He bought some charms to ward <br />
of [Dragon kin]. He's most likely in the belly of some beast now. <br />
<br />
You say, 'What Dragon kin' <br />
<br />
Jaxxtz says 'Yes he said he needed to steal secrets from the hated Sarnaks <br />
to aid him in his true quest. He said the sarnak know ways to cleanse the <br />
mind from intrussion, he would say no more. <br />
<br />
There is an Alchemy potion recipe that drops off Sarnak Adherants in the <br />
Sarnak Fort in Ill Omen. This ties directly into the text given by Jaxxtz <br />
the herb merchant. The recipe is written in Lizardman and when read show's this <br />
<br />
Xinth <br />
From Opal Slush and Dristilate shall come Xinth. From Sarnak Nightdust, <br />
Gorge Moss, and Sponge Mushroom shall come Opal Slush. From Firiona Drixie <br />
Dust, Stoneleer Emerald plume, and Slate Chant Rock shall come Dristilate. <br />
<br />
OPAL SLUSH - OBTAINED <br />
1. Sarnak Nightdust - Sarnak Partisans in Overthere <br />
2. Gorge Moss - Foraged in Gorge of King Xorbb <br />
3. Sponge Mushroom - Foraged in Mines of Nurga <br />
<br />
DRISTILATE <br />
1. Firiona Drixie Dust - From Drixie's in Firona <br />
2. Stoneleer Emerald Plume - Found on Cockatrice's in Overthere <br />
3. Slate Chant Rock - Found on Goblin Rockchanters in Nurga. Tan in Color. <br />
<br />
Once made the potions will be called &quot;A Potion of Swirling Mists.&quot; It is <br />
not a drinkable potion, only a potion in name. It is trivial to make with <br />
alchemy at around 40. <br />
<br />
At this point you will need to head into the Crypt of Dalnir. On the second <br />
floor there is a spawn called the Coerced Channeler. He mumbles to himself <br />
and if killed screams about a river of Xinth. Give the Coerced Channeler <br />
the Potion of Xinth. He despawns and is replaced by our Friend Vagnar the <br />
Channeler. Vagnar gives you the first of the skulls of the sisters of scale <br />
and immediately becomes KOS and runs off screaming &quot;Go to where the pines <br />
have been smashed. Must reach great heights!&quot; <br />
<br />
If you go to the Burning Woods outside the Sarnak Fort/Chardok there you <br />
will see 2 guard towers. The top of the East Guard Tower is reachable. You <br />
must go back 150 feet from the gate on the zone wall. There is a spot there <br />
where you can climb high enough to be above the roof of the guard tower. <br />
Fire up levitate and scale of the wolf. Then run straight at the tower, <br />
preferably in windowed mode. You should run right in. Inside you will meet <br />
an NPC named Atheling Plague. <br />
<br />
He tells you,' Ahh!! A conversationalist. How good to meet you, Cradossk. <br />
Yes. I have heard of you. Go ahead and ask for that which has brought you <br />
to my tower and emboldened you to slay my weaker minions.' <br />
<br />
Say to him &quot;Give me the skull of the sisters of scale&quot; <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;'What a coincidence! I, too, seek a skull. Perhaps you might <br />
help me [obtain the skull]. Perhaps then you shall have the skull you desire.' <br />
<br />
You say, 'I will help you obtain the skull' <br />
<br />
Atheling Plague says 'I am sure you would not mind removing the head of a <br />
scaled mystic. I hope not. There is an old Iksar who once called me slave. <br />
Now he shall adorn my wall, mounted on a fine plaque. His name is Digalis. <br />
Find him. Do not return until your task is complete <br />
<br />
In the Temple of Droga in the Jail there you can find the room which spawns <br />
Iksar Prisoners. One of the Spawns is an Iksar Slave. There are 2 that look <br />
identical but say different things when hailed. You want the one that when <br />
hailed gives you this - an iksar slave peers up at you. His face is covered <br />
with grime and he shows scars from goblin whips. He shakes his head and <br />
goes back to his thoughts. If you ask him his name he tells you he is <br />
Digalis. This is a weird part of the quest in that you must kill him here <br />
to get your skull. You do take negative faction with Scaled Mystics which <br />
doesn't make a lot of sense. He's an easy enough kill. <br />
<br />
Return to Atheling and hand him in your skull of Digalis. It shows as Iksar <br />
Skull LORE NO DROP. After handing it in you get this: <br />
<br />
Atheling Plague tosses the skull over the edge of the tower. 'Excellent. <br />
You show signs of a true Iksar slayer. Too, bad I have already given the <br />
skull of the Sister of Scale to another. Perhaps you would like to meet him <br />
before he departs. Say hello, Doval.' <br />
<br />
Atheling then spawns Clerk Doval who resides in Cabilis. Doval is a Traitor <br />
and friend of the Sarnaks it seems. You get time to get a pet out and <br />
prepare to do battle. He is no particularily tough but he is healed by <br />
Atheling. Atheling doesn't join in the fight though. Once you've killed him <br />
he says this: <br />
<br />
Clerk Doval says 'All Iksar residents.. shall learn.. of my demise. Ungghh!! <br />
<br />
Loot the 2nd skull from his corpse. <br />
<br />
The 3rd skull info was discovered before the 2nd one was completed, it is <br />
probable that asking about Clerk Doval could produce results leading to <br />
Klok Poklon. By asking Klok Poklon, in the &quot;Upstairs Bar&quot; near the shaman <br />
guild , &quot;Who are the Sisters of Scale&quot;... <br />
He responded &quot;Hmm, yes, the Babble around here is that one of the Klok's in <br />
the Lake Garrison has one of the Sister's of Scale Skull up for Auction. <br />
The Temple will bury him when they hear of it! <br />
<br />
Asking around the vendors in Lake of Ill Omen yielded this: <br />
<br />
Klok Sargin says 'Looking for the skull I had for sale? I am afraid I sold <br />
it to a staunch lizard champion. I would gladly give you his name if you <br />
would do me a [slight favor]. <br />
You say, 'what slight favor' <br />
Klok Sargin says 'The lake garrison has requested that I work on a helm <br />
similar to the ones worn by sarnak dragoons. The problem is.. I need one to <br />
examine. You go get me one and I will tell you who purchased the skull. <br />
<br />
The Helm is dropped by Sarnak Dragoons in the Sarnak Fort in Lake of Ill <br />
Omen. The Helm is NO RENT so run straight back to the garrison and Klok <br />
Sargin. Hand him the Helm and you get this: <br />
<br />
Klok Sargin appears a little shaken. He has a few bruises on his face. <br />
'Uhh. Thanks. I sort of told the lizard who bought the skull that you were <br />
asking for him, and, well, he was kinda mad, and... Cradossk , meet Bruiser&quot; <br />
<br />
He Spawns an Iksar Warrior named Bruiser who says this: <br />
<br />
Bruiser Noz is a battle-scarred lizard with arms the size of tree trunks. <br />
He approaches and speaks. You feel the lager-tinged breeze blast your skin. <br />
'Stay out of this, Klok !! I didn't spend 30 seasons in the legion to be <br />
pestered by the likes of you!! Here I am, you little croak!! You want my <br />
skull? Come and get it!!' <br />
Klok Sargin shakes with fear. A dark stain begins to spread across the <br />
front of his trousers. 'Ye.. Ye.. Yes.. Yes, Bruiser.' <br />
Bruiser Noz says 'Ha!! Who dares to take what is Bruiser's!! I will make <br />
swamp mush out of them!! <br />
<br />
Bruiser gives you time to get a pet out etc. He's an easy kill at lvl 51 <br />
I'd say he's at most lvl 38 probably less. Kill him and you loot the 3rd <br />
Skull. Take this skull with your 2 other ones and the Cudgel of the <br />
Channeler back to Cabilis and down to Hierophant Dexl. Hand all 3 to him <br />
and you get this message: <br />
<br />
Hierophant Dexl goes into a trance and speaks with the voice of an ancient. <br />
'You have returned the skulls of the Sisters of Scale. For this you shall <br />
be rewarded. Take this hierophant's weapon. May you use it to smite the <br />
foes of our people.' Dexl comes out of the trance. 'What?!! Whew. Hey!! <br />
Where is my cudgel?' <br />
<br />
You now have the cudgel. <br />
<br />
Thanks to Cradossk Trandoshan <br />
http://www.iksar.org<br />
<br />
Estimated time: none<br />
<br />
My personal estimated time on this might be more near 6 hours.  Sarnak Midnight Dust only drops off of sarnak partisans in Frontier Mountains.  Fairly uncommon drop.  Gorge moss again needs to be foraged in Beholder maze.  By this time if you still have a ranger or druid friend, ask them to help you by foraging the gorge moss and if you read my last notes you should also have the mushroom from nurga.  Combine the sarnak midnight dust, the gorge moss, and the mushroom in an alchemy bag to get Opal Slush.  My alchemy is 120 but there have been people who combined it with a lower skill.<br />
<br />
Stoneleer emerald plumes drop off of random cockatrices in Overthere.  The Slate Chant Rock you should already have if you read my last notes, and you could ask someone to kill the firiona drixies for you in Friona Vie if you don’t want to take the faction hits.  Note:  Drixes and pilgrims assist eachother.  I got the dust off of the first drixie I killed, so I felt I was kind of lucky on that part.  Combine the plume, the rock, and the dust in an alchemy bag to get Dristilate.  Combine the Dristilate and the Opal Slush together to get A Potion of Swirling Mists.<br />
<br />
If you have the no rent helm that you get from the dragoon in Lake of Ill Omen, I suggest doing that skull first.  Always have your enchanter with you before turning in anything to cast illusion iksar on you.  Give the helm to Klok Sargin.  He’s a iksar merchant in one of the buildings near cabilis in Lake of Ill Omen.  A few minutes later Bruiser will spawn and he’s KOS so kill him and loot his skull.  I’m not sure what his hammer is for, but it’s a no rent hammer.<br />
<br />
You can do any of the skulls out of order it’s just that you need all of them before turning it in with your cudgel.  The person you want to look for in Dalnir is on the second floor.  His name is a Coerced Channeler and he is not KOS to anyone so don’t kill him.  I cleared out the second floor a couple times and got him to spawn.  Give the Potion of Swirling Mists to him and he turns into the Channeler Vagnar who gives you the skull.  He was not KOS to me so I just left him alone.<br />
<br />
For the last skull, you need to go to Droga and shrink yourself twice.  None of the goblins see invis,  so run down to the prison area and jump through the bars.  I am not sure if it’s a bug or not, but you can just jump through the bars.  Makes you wonder how the goblins actually keep the prisoners down there.  Anyway, there are 2 iksar prisoners in one cell.  One has a cabilis faction hit if you kill him and the other doesn’t.  The one that gives the hit is the one you need to kill for the iksar shaman you need to spawn.  I just killed both of the prisoners till the shaman spawned.  Kill him, loot his skull, then you need to head to Burning Woods for a tricky run.  <br />
<br />
Before the entrance to Chardok there are 2 towers.  The towers are almost impossible to get inside unless you can find a high point or cliff to run off into the tower.  The atheling plague is in the right tower if you’re looking at Chardok.  You need to levitate yourself and run to a high point on a cliff to the side of chardok, cast spirit of scale on yourself, and just run directly for the bone beams that hold up the roof of the tower.  If you can make it to one of the beams you can run across to the next beam till you get inside the tower where the Atheling plague is.  This is a pretty easy fight, but the atheling heals the iksar during the fight so just keep your high end DDs and Dots up and you should be fine.  Give the skull from Droga to the Atheling and Clerk Doval spawns.  Kill him and now you have the 3 skulls to complete your sixth cudgel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lehua</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Skylron Cudgel of the Arisen (Cudgel 7)<br />
<br />
This part of the text has been taken from the first cudgel quest off of &lt;a target=&quot;Allakhazam's&quot; href=&quot;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/&quot;&gt;Allakhazam’s&lt;/a&gt;:<br />
<br />
You will notice an NPC on the Bridge in East Cabilis named Hierophant Granix. He is as Shaman Trainer and when hailed says, &quot; 'Leave me in peace <br />
Cradossk, I have little desire for company now. The Faceless sends visions <br />
to me that may hold the fate of our race in sway. ' <br />
<br />
You ask him, &quot;What Visions?&quot; and he replies, &quot;'The spirits tell me of <br />
strange happenings around the ancient city of Charasis. None of the mystics <br />
that have been sent to investigate have returned. Something is surely <br />
happening in the ancient tombs of that city. I pray to our lord for some <br />
way to calm the tortured spirits of our fallen brothers that haunt the <br />
Howling Stones. &quot; <br />
<br />
You must now gather a force strong enough to fight in the South Wing of <br />
Charasis or Howling Stones as it is known. If you aren't aware Charasis is <br />
a dungeon in Overthere that requires a key to enter (the key quest information can be found here). <br />
<br />
The dungeon requires a solid group of 50's to go very deep in. Kill random mobs <br />
until you have aquired one dusty skull and 4 glowing skulls. <br />
<br />
Return the Dusty skull to Hierophant Granix and you recieve this message, <br />
&quot;Hierophant Granix peers at the skull intently. 'There is strange magic in <br />
this skull Cradossk, what ever necromancer animated this skeleton was a <br />
powerful warlock indeed. I sense the power of several ancients in this <br />
relic. Take this skull to Oracle Qulin in the field of bone, he may be able <br />
to perform the ritual which will free this ancient's spirit from the mortal <br />
realm. &quot; <br />
<br />
You will find an NPC by the shore in Field of Bone named Oracle Qulin. Give <br />
him the skull. <br />
<br />
Oracle Qulin runs his scaled fingers slowly over the cracked, brittle <br />
skull. 'Granix did well to send you to me, I may yet be able to recover the <br />
spirit of this ancient and set it free. Come! I shall need your help with <br />
this ritual. ' <br />
Oracle Qulin dips the skull in the crystal waters. He lifts the skull over <br />
his head and stands completely still, allowing the water to drip down off <br />
the skull down over his body and finally on to the parched sand. ' <br />
Oracle Qulin begins to chant. Quietly at first but then louder and faster. <br />
He speaks a language you only vaguely recognize. It is the voice and <br />
language of the ancient oracles. His voice booms out over the water filling <br />
your mind with images of the ancient Sebilsian empire and the great Iksar <br />
rulers of old. ' <br />
Oracle Qulin 's voice stops suddenly, leaving the air completely silent. <br />
Even the waves seem to have stopped for a moment. You begin to move toward <br />
him, but he raises a hand toward you motioning for you to stay still. ' <br />
Oracle Qulin says 'Suddenly without warning the skull flies from Quilin's <br />
hands and flies into the murky waters. It stays submerged for a moment and <br />
then flies toward you, but this time an entire corpse is attached to it. <br />
<br />
This spawns an Arisen Iksar who you must kill. He is approximately lvl 50 <br />
so you will want a few friends for this depending on your level. Once <br />
killed he drops Wet Skull Fragments. Give those to Oracle Qulin. <br />
<br />
Oracle Qulin says 'It seems this particular ancient does not wish to be put <br />
to rest. Return this note to Hierophant Granix and tell him what happened. <br />
He will surely wish this skull to be disposed of properly, but I do not <br />
have the power to do it myself. ' <br />
<br />
You return the note to Hierophant Granix. Hierophant Granix says &quot;It is as <br />
I feared, the mark of the warlock has surely driven these ancient spirits <br />
mad. We can not allow these spirits to roam free in our world Cradossk. <br />
Take this case and place the glowing skulls of other ancients inside of it. <br />
Return it to me with your Cudgel of the Heirophant so that we may remove <br />
these cursed spirits from our world forcefully. &quot; <br />
<br />
He gives you an Ornate Skull Case which is a 4 slot combinable container. <br />
Put the 4 Glowing Skulls from Charasis in this container and combine them. <br />
Then hand in this combined container and your Iron Cudgel of the Heirophant <br />
and you receive your new cudgel.<br />
<br />
Estimated time: none<br />
<br />
My personal estimated time on this cudgel is about 6 hours.  You need a rogue for this part of the quest and depending on your level and how daring you are, you could solo at just the south wing entrance of Howling Stones for all of your skulls.  I had a monk, druid, and cleric friend to help me clear out south wing to get my skulls faster though.  The rogue is a must because he/she has to open the south wing door for you or you could work your way around by killing the North and West wing rare mobs to get the key to South wing.  Once you get the 4 glowing skulls and one dusty skull, you are pretty much done with the seventh cudgel.  <br />
<br />
Oracle Qulin is on the shoreline in Field of Bone.  Give the skull to him and he goes through the motions to spawn the Arisen Iksar.  Level 51 and he summons, but easy to kill.  Loot the fragments from his body and give it back to Oracle Qulin who gives you the parchment to take back to Hierophant Granix who then gives you a 4 slot container to put the 4 glowing skulls in.  Put the glowing skulls in the container, combine, and give it back to him with your sixth cudgel to get your seventh cudgel.<br />
<br />
Skyiron Cudgel of the Ancients (Cudgel 8)<br />
<br />
This part of the text has been taken from the first cudgel quest off of &lt;a target=&quot;Allakhazam's&quot; href=&quot;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/&quot;&gt;Allakhazam’s&lt;/a&gt;:<br />
<br />
After handing in your Hierophant Cudgel and Skull box to Granix he gives you your 7th Cudgel and says, &quot;You have done well Cradossk. Perhaps you can help clear these troubling dreams from my tired aging mind. Commune with the spirits of our Ancestors and learn from them. Never forget that the ultimate power comes from knowledge. The ancients are privy to much knowledge that mortals will never see. Should you be granted enlightenment from our ancestors, share your knowledge with me so that we may use this knowledge for the benefit of our brethren. I will continue to study the [dreams] that [cloud] my mind. &quot; <br />
<br />
When you ask him &quot;What dreams cloud your mind?&quot; he replies, &quot;I see much darkness...darkness and death. A void of life...the cold grip of death. An Ancient pact...with forces too terrible to describe...A great Leader...a fall, and a second coming. I see...a symbol of...an ancient city...Kaesora. I would begin there young Mystic. The spirits of that fallen city may hold <br />
a key to our future. &quot; <br />
<br />
Go to the ruins outside Kaesora and you will see a new Shaman NPC there, Oracle Vauris. Hail him and he motions for silence. He points at the shifting sands below him without a word. <br />
<br />
Go to Kaesora and Kill Xalgoz. He spawns every 20 minutes or so in the Church there and is approximately lvl 48 or so. He's an easy kill for a couple lvl 50 plus. He drops a Shrunken Iksar Skull Necklace. Loot that and give it to Oracle Vauris. <br />
<br />
Oracle Vauris takes the necklace from you without a word. He looks into your eyes for a moment. He seems to be searching for something. Apparently he finds whatever he was looking for as he pulls an empty bag from his belt. He takes th enecklace and snaps the cord wit his teeth allowing the skulls to fall into the bag. he looks you square in the eyes again and <br />
motions for you to put out yoru hand. You do so and almost immediately regret it. Vauris takes the knife from his belt and slices open your forearm allowing your blood to fall into the bag. He uses the cord to tie the bag and hands it back to you. &quot;You now share the mark of Rile, Cradossk. Your fates are intertwined.&quot; He then gives you a Bag of Iksar <br />
Skull Dust. <br />
<br />
Ask him, &quot;What Rile?&quot; and he replies, &quot;Have you learned nothing in all your years of service to the hall of Terror? The skulls on that necklace were <br />
the bones of the traitorous Iksar who defiled Rile's Relics. Their final moments were spent in Charasis, destroyed by their own dark magics. Rile was the son of the most powerful and terrible [emperor] the Iksar have ever known. Not since the days of Ssrae... 'His voice trails off and his eyes glaze over a bit. You sense that Vauris has been touched by some unmentionable terror. ' <br />
<br />
If you ask him about Xalgoz, he replies, &quot; 'At last you see Cradossk. The one you speak of is indeed a servant of Rile's father. His presence on this <br />
world has disrupted the spirits of the ancients. This disruption must be put to an end. Slaying him will do little good unfortunately. We will have to make use of other powers to truly banish him from this world. If we are to do this we shall need a true relic of Rile, and the soul of his father. Only with these items can we hope to free Rile's soul from the void between <br />
death and life. But first there are others that serve the risen emperor that must be destroyed. &quot; <br />
<br />
Ask him &quot;what others?&quot; and he says, &quot;The servants of the emperor wear many faces. One in particular is know to wear several himself. Of Serpents and Iksar is his current incarnation, a twisted vision of a dark union. Bring me his essence, for I will need a vessel to siphon the emperor's soul into. Bring me these 3 items along with the pouch of bone dust and we shall see <br />
what fate the ancients have chosen for us. ' <br />
<br />
The Changeling Essense drops from a Named Goblin in the Frontier Mountains by the name of Thuuga Dengibl. He is about lvl 50 in strength and can be found on top of a rock near the Lake of Ill Omen Zone at -2100, -2400 <br />
<br />
Next you must kill a Named Froglok in the Froglok Village in the Swamp by the name of Kaggy Krup. He is of about the same level as Thuuga is. 3 or 4 50+ can take him. He is actually up in one of the buildings in the western part of the village. He drops 'Glowing Kunzar Amulet' <br />
<br />
The 4th item you need is dropped by Venril Sathir in Karnor's Castle. There are two versions of Venril. One is much tougher than the other. Both drop the Blackened Iksar Bones which you need. These can be master quested so this may be a good way to get the item if you can't easily field a group to take down Venril. <br />
<br />
Give Vauris the Changling Essence, Bag of Bone Dust, Glowing Kunzar Amulet, and the Blackened Iksar Bones. Oracle Vauris says 'You have done well Skek. Now it is time for the true test of your clairvoyance. Only a true Scaled mystic will be able to put these spirits to rest. Be warned, these souls will not go quietly into the next world. They have strong ties to this <br />
land, and it is these ties we must break. Take them to the City of the Kunzar, the birthplace of the emperor. Only there will you be able to tear asunder the dark rituals that have twisted the souls of our ancient heroes. I will await you in that place Cradossk. &quot; He gives you Iksar Relics NO DROP, LORE. <br />
<br />
You now need to head into Charasis again with a decent force. At least a single group of 55 plus from all accounts. In teh South Wing you will find An Iksar Apparition. Give him the Iksar Relics. He immediately turns into Venril Sathir and 4 other mobs - an Arisen Disciple, Priest, Necromancer and Acolyte - aggro you. This battle can be fierce but this version of Venril is not the same as the one in KC thankfully. Venril Sathir drops a Skull of Rile. After you kill these mobs an amiable mob, the Spirit of Rile appears. Give him your Skyiron Cudgel of the Arisen and the Skull of Rile and you get the following message. <br />
<br />
The spirit of Rile says 'Use your cudgel to unite my soul with my body Cradossk ' <br />
<br />
The spirit of Rile begins to shudder and shake, the bones fly from your hands to meet their rightful soul. The spirit and bones being to glow and meld into one another, forming a swirling mass of ethereal energy. Abani begins to mouth incantations in an unfamiliar tongue. Their voice rises ever higher as mystic energy surges through the room. Then, in a suddenly flash, the spirit and corpse disappear without a trace, leaving only Cradossk holding a Faintly glowing Cudgel in his hand.<br />
<br />
Estimated time: none<br />
<br />
I approximate the estimated time for this might be days or weeks depending if you ever get to go and kill Venril Sathir or Venril Sathir’s Remains.  The necklace that drops off of Xalgoz in Kaesora drops every time.  If you make potions of invis undead you can run down to Xalgoz every time.  Just invis past the live part and when you get to the undead section use your potion and run the rest of the way down.  Xalgoz has a placeholder that spawns every 30 minutes.  The necklace that drops off of Kraggy Krup in Swamp of No Hope drops every time also.  He’s located in the Froglok city in the middle of the swamp.  He has a slow/snare/dot proc but he’s slowable and soloable at level 60.  Be careful not to run under the city if you’re not invis.  There is a druid epic mob that is up sometimes and he hits for 250s and is unsnareable, unrootable, and unslowable.  Thuuga Dengib is usually up in Frontier Mountains.  He’s also soloable at 60 and has a really fun proc.  I’ll let you find out for yourself.  He always drops the changeling essence.  VSR is up every 24 hours +/- 2 hours from what I hear.  You do need a ranger or druid to spawn him though so I guess this is where you pay back that druid or ranger friend for helping you all those times.  VSR always drops the Blackened Iksar Bones.  He’s doable with 1 group.  VS on the other hand also drops the bones and other epic pieces, but you might need more than 1 group to take him out.<br />
<br />
The last fight in Howling Stones takes at least one good group of 55+ members to take out Venril Sathir.  The iksar apparition you need to hand your relics into is between the south and east wing. He’s not the real VS and he does not drop any of the VS loot.  The thing about this fight is you cannot pull the arisens in his room once Rile spawns.  You have about 5 minutes to pull the 2 arisens closest to him before he goes to the platform to meet Rile.  If you don’t have a monk pulling and you pull an Arisen while he is talking to Rile, he will aggro on you and kill you.  Venril and Rile are untargetable while doing the dialogue and they can hit you and kill you if aggro’d.  Once Venril Sathir becomes targetable pull him and have the enchanter CC the adds and kill Venril Sathir.  He drops the skull of rile which you need for your eighth cudgel and an amulet that is also no drop.  It has 4 to all stats and saves and ac.  It could be for another quest, but I am unsure at the moment.  Turn the skull and your seventh cudgel to the spirit of rile who spawns after you kill Venril Sathir to get your Skyiron Cudgel of the Ancients.

<br />
Now I couldnt really see all the way into the room as I was back in the tunnel, but our monk was FD just inside the room.   By the time the script was finished, the entire room had respawned also and we ended up getting like 8-10 harmtouching mobs as well as the 4 arisen and VS.  Ouch. <br />

Any pointers would be appreciated =)<br />
<br />
edit: Oh and Harvyst I met a Vah Shir last night who already had the 7th cudgel, so kitties might even be able to do this without an enchanter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Lehua</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I am not sure why the room respawns so quickly but I had that problem also before handing in the skull to Rile.  When I pulled the Arisens closest to Venril Sathir when he was forming they didn't spawn till after I pulled Venril Sathir.  You could ask an enchanter to use wake of tranquility on the arisens or have a higher level monk to pull VS and a couple of Arisens.  It may or may not be level dependant on how many you pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ridgey Didge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">This end fight is confusing?<br />

Give him the Iksar Relics. He immediately turns into Venril Sathir and 4 other mobs - an Arisen Disciple, Priest, Necromancer and Acolyte - aggro you.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't understand this Rile bit, Rile should only spawn once VSR is dead, he's the guy you hand the skull and cudgel too, right?<br />
<br />
Oh, and does this Carnage spell stack with all our other shammie spells?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Lehua</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yes, the targetable Spirit of Rile spawns after Venril Sathir is dead but before that there is this big untargetable Skeleton which I believe is Rile who goes through the dialogue with Venril Sathir.  I am not sure if the quest is bugged, but I have had more than 4 Arisens spawn when I went to do the 8th cudgel.  Carnage does stack with the focus line, does not stack with Voice of Berzerker and Avatar.  I am unsure about the werewolf form or ranger/druid attack buffs yet.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well you can't mez them until VS is targetable or else you're all dead correct?  High level monk pulling the room when everything has become targetable sounds like a good plan (I bet at 65 you can single pull all but the Arisen and VS).   <br />
<br />
Wake of Tranquility is what I was looking for though and might be the way to go.</div></div><hr />

Nice walk through Lehua, and I only have one thing to say for the coming hordes of Barbarians: <br />
WELCOME TO KURNS!!!! &quot;<br />
<br />
get a necro friend with flesh to bone, goto SH and buy meat for 1s each and have him turn a full stack of meat into a full stack of bone chips every 7 sec, fast way to the 7k bone chips you are going to need...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;So you need a 61 enchanter with PoP aa's to cast Iskar Illusion on you to do this quest?&quot;<br />
<br />
use the ornate velium pendant, takes you from indiff to amiable so you can do the quest, gonna need about 8 of these pendants tho, lots of turn ins to do.<br />
<br />
<br />
hope this info helped.<br />
<br />
deviator</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The pendant should work i'd imagine. I haven't personally done the quest but no reason it shouldn't work.<br />
<br />
As far as using the charges goes the best thing to do is just gather up as many turn ins worth at a time as you can. Since the faction change effect lasts until you zone and works for anything of that faction in the zone you should be able to do turn ins for multiple cludgels in one sitting as long as you don't actually have to trigger a spawn by having the previous cludgel.<br />
<br />
Looking threw the quest quickly I didn't see a lot of triggered spawns so by camping several steps worth of turn ins you should be able to minimize the number of charges you'd use or number of times you need to bug your enchanter friend.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Flesh to bone is a necro aa skill that converts a peice of meat or alot of other assorted body parts into a bone chip one at a time.

<br />
Best option is just to use PoK to visit a bunch of newbie cities and check the vendors for bone chips. I've found alot of bone chips that way. Best if done was around 30 - 40 stacks of bone chips one time</div></div><hr />

Factioning Cabilis is relatively easy, getting unlucky with the 3rd cudgel camp will make you cry.<br />
<br />
Those of you yet to begin factioning Cabilis best start looking/camping/auctioning for Iksar Skulls Marked with an X'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Lehua</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Quest updated on cudgel 5.  There are 3 broken peices of the totem not 2.  Thanks Tranquilius of Stormhammer for finding that out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">*bump* Good post shouldnt' get forgotten.<br />
<br />
Also.<br />
<br />
1) Is the lore skull with an x no-drop? (Two skulls down and I am hating kurns)<br />
<br />
2) Do things in Cabilis see through invis? Aka, I am still KOS in Cab, trying to alternate gathering things for one big massive turn in fest and wondered if I could get the first 3 skulls while KOS... or would I be writing my own death sentence?<br />
<br />
3) The glowing skulls from Kurn aren't the same glowing skulls from the goblins in warsliks woods are they?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Lehua</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">The lore skull is not also no drop.  Did you try sitting on the stairs?<br />
<br />
Most things in Cabilis do not see through invis, but invis will only turn you indifferent and the quest can't be done at indifferent.  Also, we found out the hard way that even though you have a buff invis on your buff list, you lose it when you hand anything in to an NPC.  You do not lose the buff, but you do lose the invis.<br />
<br />
No, the skulls from kurns and warsliks are different sorry.  Keep trying and don't give up :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Does it have to be sitting?<br />
<br />
I was wiping out the upper room then running up and down the stairs. The undead crusader popped... once at the bottom of the stairs, once at the 3rd floor. <br />
<br />
So, just sitting there, or do I have to kill any ph's?<br />
<br />
3 Skulls down, still don't have the lore one, and newbies are loving me.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Also, which way should I face when I am sitting so to see him walk by?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Lehua</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I just sat on the middle of the steps he spawns right at the middle and he has a shorter ph time than the rest of the spawns.  I just sat looking downwards.  Either way you look, if you're sitting and near a skeleton they will come over to hit you.  If you need any immediate help you can usually reach me in game by /tell lehua.fenninro hi or something :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">A newbie ended up camping it for me - I offered 300 plat :) I got the last two skulls this way and it was worth every damn cent :)<br />
<br />
A few more questions.<br />
<br />
1) Sarnak Nightdust - the notes list it in Overthere, but Alla's also says it's in Fronteir Mountains - I killed sarnak partisans in both places and none dropped the dust. Which is it? (There are only 3 sarnaks in Fronteir, 10 minute respawn, annoying camp).<br />
<br />
2) Does anything see invis between the gates to Cab and the pits near the temple of terror? Aka, if I run in there invised to get bits before I am not kos, I am asking for certain death?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">The nightdust drops in FM not OT.  The loc in the guide is where you want to camp for it but beware there are a lot of wanderers in that spot.   I have no idea about Cabilis sorry I'm scaley.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>gummox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I ran around Cabilis invisible to scout out who was on Brood of Kotiz faction (target suspect, run somewhere safe, drop invis, /con, rinse, repeat) after I got most of the non-necro factions above KoS.  I didn't run into any that saw through invis.  There are a couple lizards in E Cabilis that you might need to keep an eye out for if you're not in the good graces of the Kotiz yet:<br />
<br />
Grype- hangs out in the second story of the Tink and Babble bar.<br />
<br />
Librarian Zimor- in one of the top floors of the shaman/sk guild building.  He's far enough above ground level that he's not a threat while you're talking to the cudgel quest givers, but be prepared if you go exploring upstairs.<br />
<br />
Haggle Baron Klok- is actually on the vendor faction, which takes more effort to raise than the rest of the non-necros.  He isn't a vendor though, so he can and will aggro on the unsuspecting.<br />
<br />
All the npc in W Cabilis are on Kotiz faction except the Crusaders, Troopers, and one of the vendors in the tents.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Ah the cudgel quests, such a pain in the ass =P<br />
<br />
The nightdust will only drop in that one camp in FM, it really is time consuming if you aren't lucky.<br />
<br />
The skulls in Kurn's are probably the worst part of it.  His spawn pattern may have changed since I first did it long ago.  What I did was just go kill the ph and wait 1 spawn every time I logged in and out for a week.  Eventually got them all that way.  He has 2 possible spawn points, 1 is the walking skeleton on the back stairway up to the top level.  There are 2 static spawns on the side, and the wanderer pops in between them, walks downstairs, and back up.  The 2nd spawn is in the room he walks to down 1 level.  There is a little cement square with a hole in the middle that drops down lower, the ph spawns right in front of that.  <br />
I'm pretty sure when I first did it, only 1 would spawn every 8 hours, so camping him for stretches was futile.  Now I've heard from people in there that he can spawn more frequently, but I haven't had reason to go camp that again to see myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Well, I finally got the sarnak nightdust, and all the skulls from kurns, and the froglok totems.<br />
<br />
There's only one piece now that's giving me trouble.<br />
<br />
The skull of the die nazok from the &quot;iskar adherant&quot;. The notes in the comments of Alla say it's really a sarnak adherant. Well, I went and killed about 25 of them (oh, my poor chardok faction), but the only thing they dropped was &quot;iskar skull helm&quot;, a +3 wis no-drop head piece.<br />
<br />
Is that the correct item? If not, how rare is the skull of the die nazok? I am hunting in the sarnak fort to the southwest of LOIO, am I hunting in the right place?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Lehua</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Yes, that is the right helm.  It identifies as skull of die nazok.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Slisth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">First of all ... thank you for this wonderful post. I wish it had been here two years ago when I started my first cudgel quest as a young Iksar. Now on to business.<br />
<br />
Ok, I know this has been discussed, but I don't want to kill all the 8th cudgel mobs, go to Howling Stones and then screw this up. So I have some questions .....<br />
<br />
1) The room that Venril Sathir pops in ... how many other &quot;regular&quot; spawns are there and what is their spawn timing? VS + 4 Arisen + X other mobs = death in my books. Can anyone answer this question?<br />
<br />
2) What level are the Arisen that accompany VS? Allakhazam's doesn't have info on them<br />
<br />
3) Can the monk single pull the Arisen after they spawn, but before the talk begins between the skeleton (the skeleton is supposedly VS's son btw) and VS?  Or is it better to pull all four and kill with SPAM? What size / level of group would be needed to kill all four at once? My concern is that with the monk single feign pulling you would never kill all four before the VS junior goes to talk to VS senior... and then you are faced with killing VS and his Arisen all at the same time.<br />
<br />
4) What level is VS? Allakhazam's doesn't have info on him either &lt;sigh&gt;<br />
<br />
5) As a pragmatic question, can you get more than one key to Howling Stones? In the event of a total party wipeout, how the heck would you ever get all the corpses back?<br />
<br />
6) What is a &quot;safe&quot; group to do this part of the quest? two 55 plus groups? three 55 plus groups? one group of 65's? What composition of groups did others use? Are there any classes that are ABSOLUTELY necessary (like rogues, how many clerics, CH rotation needed etc)?<br />
<br />
7) Has anyone actually fought VS and all of the Arisen at the same time and lived?<br />
<br />
If anyone can answer any of these questions, I PROMISE that I will post as much additional information as possible as soon as I get this quest completed. Maybe even get some screenshots etc. for Allakhazam to post at their site.<br />
<br />
Slisth<br />
52 Iksar shaman, Xev<br />
<br />
FYI, I have finished the 6th cudgel but not 7th cudgel. The seventh seems fairly easy though, and one of my guild members hunts there fairly often so it shouldn't be a problem to get the skulls. For the 8th, I already have the blackened iksar bones which looks the hardest of any of the pieces other than the final fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">1) The room that Venril Sathir pops in ... how many other &quot;regular&quot; spawns are there and what is their spawn timing? VS + 4 Arisen + X other mobs = death in my books. Can anyone answer this question? <br />
<br />
I believe there are five. Two randoms on each side, and the spectral keeper or his ph on the stage. They did respawn before I was able to do the turn in, but with a necro scaring and an enchanter mezzing, I was able to do the turn in anyway.<br />
<br />
2) What level are the Arisen that accompany VS? Allakhazam's doesn't have info on them <br />
<br />
Dark blue to a level 65. Didn't get cons from my groupmates, we were a bit busy at the time ;)<br />
<br />
3) Can the monk single pull the Arisen after they spawn, but before the talk begins between the skeleton (the skeleton is supposedly VS's son btw) and VS? Or is it better to pull all four and kill with SPAM? What size / level of group would be needed to kill all four at once? My concern is that with the monk single feign pulling you would never kill all four before the VS junior goes to talk to VS senior... and then you are faced with killing VS and his Arisen all at the same time. [Q]<br />
<br />
We ran into all sorts of issues trying to single pull the arisens away from VS. VS attacked us while untargetable, we wiped, ran back, wiped again, then he despawned. I lost everything.<br />
<br />
I cannot stress this enough... DO NOT PULL THEM.<br />
<br />
One bad aggro on the non-targetable VS == you lost it.<br />
<br />
Bring an enchanter, bring a necro, bring two, bring a bard. I had a 63 necro and a 61 enchanter, and we dragged them in 3 at a time, mezzed, scared, killed, and I kept pulling as fast as we could handle until the room was cleared.<br />
<br />
[Q]4) What level is VS? Allakhazam's doesn't have info on him either <br />
<br />
Dark blue at 65. Died fast. Small harmtouch. Clearing the room was a bigger issue than killing him.<br />
<br />
5) As a pragmatic question, can you get more than one key to Howling Stones? In the event of a total party wipeout, how the heck would you ever get all the corpses back? <br />
<br />
The key is soulbound, but it is also /key'd, so once you use it once you can always go back in without it. It goes on your keyring, if you haven't been to seb in awhile... just like the seb key, and the VP key. <br />
<br />
<br />
6) What is a &quot;safe&quot; group to do this part of the quest? two 55 plus groups? three 55 plus groups? one group of 65's? What composition of groups did others use? Are there any classes that are ABSOLUTELY necessary (like rogues, how many clerics, CH rotation needed etc)? <br />
<br />
Absolutely need a rogue to open the first door. You can go further without, aka bring a level 40 rogue to open the first door, pay him, then go on...<br />
<br />
You need at least one cleric, and at least one mezzer, although I think 2 is much better for the amount of crowd control needed.<br />
<br />
My group was:<br />
<br />
63 necro<br />
63 warrior<br />
61 cleric<br />
62 rogue<br />
me - 65 shaman<br />
62 shaman<br />
61 enchanter<br />
63 monk<br />
<br />
And we did ok :) A bit hairy at times, but we succeeded.<br />
<br />
7) Has anyone actually fought VS and all of the Arisen at the same time and lived? <br />
<br />
I just pulled and got VS + 2 adds, then the other 2 adds + 1 trash, then 3 trash mobs. So I never had more than 3 in camp at a time. But we were prepared to handle all 4 with the necro and the enchanter ready to mezz.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Iranicus Spellbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Everything Harvyst said was good but IMO she overkilled the VS in Howling Stones. I did it with only 3 people, well 2 since the second person was 2 boxing. It consisted me (at the time 58 shaman) a lv 65 necro and a 62 cleric (cleric didnt have virtue yet either). Clear the room of all the spawns first and you have about 12 mins for respawns I believe. Hand in the Iksar Relics to the Iksar Apparition and a ritual begins lasting a boring 11-12 mins. Now we played it safe and stayed in the tunnel until VS became targettable. Then the Necro pulled VS with a snare agroed 2 Arisens but Fded when they all came. The arisens walked to their spawn and VS stuck around. I then landed A slow on VS and pulled him deeper into tunnel at which time my Dogdog and necro's pet easily destroyed the slowed Venril Sathir. (Venril Sathir has no more then 12k hp easy, and only does one harm touch at the beginning of the fight). After we killed VS, my turn in mob spawned. So necro pulled him to the tunnel and fded. Before Turn in mob started to return to the platform area I did turn in got my cudgel and he despawned. After We finished the quest, necro single pulled the arisens for exp, we cleared all 4 easily and gated out. IMO this fight is really simple if you just play it safe. But YOU will wipe if you agro VS to early when he is still untargettable. Mind you none of us were extremely well equiped, but my necro friend knew what he was doing as he soloed Drusella before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Baror69</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Just to reiterate Barb shammys  can do this quest but all turn ins have to be in Illusion form. I did a turn in following a friends advice and lost the 3rd cudgel and skulls when i was not in illusion. a gm came and helped me though so i got it back but he did state that for sure that you have to use illusion form to do it since Barb shammys can not get any higher in faction then indiff. which is odd since ya can get the quest started with out it! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Kherys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">A note about the arisen spawns.. it does no good to kill them before killing VS, they just keep respawning (fairly quickly.. like within 30 seconds of dying).  The whole point to the encounter is just to kill VS, and if you have to whatever arisens come when you pull him (AFTER you kill VS).  After VS is dead, the arisen stop respawning and you can kill them if you want before talking to the spirit of rile.  He despawns in about 10 minutes or so.  The regular room mobs start repopping not long after VS dies if you kill him as soon as he is targetable and cleared the room just before turning in to start the show.  All in all the fight is very easy if you are doing this at 60+.  I did it with a 64 monk, 63 SK, 62 rogue/63 cleric two-boxed and myself, a 62 shaman and we were overkill, the cleric had to heal maybe twice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">The arisens respawned quickly for me -- after VS died but before doing the Spirit of Rile hand-in. Maybe you have to do the final hand-in before you can kill arisens. Either pull all 4 and mez them, or just run up and do the hand-in real quick while they beat the crap out of you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Baror69</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Question about the final fight location i have looked on many maps and i dont see any Iksar Apparition in the south wing but the maps are older. can some one give me a loc of where i will find him at i am fast approching the final fight and i want to be able to tell the group that i am with exactly where we should go. maps would even be better!</div></div><hr />

I do have one last question, the Iksar Apparition, I con'd him as aimable and my puller con'd Kindly(gnome sk doing Greenmist), so that mob shouldnt add when she pulls the regular mobs from that room, correct? or will it assist regular mobs?<br />

It will NOT add onto anything, but just make sure the KoS people keep a very very safe distance. It's annoying when it aggros someone and you have to port out, or let the person die.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Rikax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Hello All, my plan wasnt as solid as I thought, puller got VS and all 4 of his buds, and died, but the group didnt get aggro.<br />
<br />
My rogue was a no show, so I got a pick up and they took it upon themselves to drag the puller, which then aggro averything on us, VS resists my slow and it went down hill, I died, second cleric died and a few others.<br />
<br />
They managed to kill VS and get the arisen mez'd, rezd me and i went in for hand in with out gear and no heal, of course the room repops and I take one HT as I am putting second item on Rile, die and then the rest of the group wipes or gates(evac).<br />
<br />
So I have my 7th Cudgel and the drop from VS but when we return the Spirit is gone, I can only assume I need to start number 8 over again, or will the Spirit of Rile accept multiple turn-ins, or does he de-pop on first turn-in?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">One more l'il question - looks like I'll need 12 illusion iksar potions to get through all of the turnins here, does that sound about right?  I can't believe I'm starting something that's gonna take this long.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Ouzo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">how much of this quest can you do solo and at what part do you need to have a group/raid?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">At 65, it took me about 2 weeks of solo work before/after the nights raids.  I was able to solo all but the final fight in HS.  None of the mobs were dificult, some camps (kurns tower especialy) were long.  For the final fight, I took a full group: 2 mages, SK, Paladin, Bard -all 65.  It was massive overkill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just wanted to point out, the initial quest with the *evil* hammer which needs to proc till your eyes pop *IS* do-able by cats. I did my initial faction work by camping the bandits in the cave in FoB, which gives positive necro faction and maurauder MM nose rings... you can turn these in for a bigger faction hit than bone chips, and my kitty is not hated by the necros...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">Ok, so I gathered up hordes of bone chips, zoned into FoB, put on an Ikky illusion via potion and then went to the guard.<br />
<br />
Still scowling. <br />
<br />
Can't turn in, do I need to kill a ton of ton Sarnaks so the illusion potion will at least get me to dubious?</div></div><hr />
