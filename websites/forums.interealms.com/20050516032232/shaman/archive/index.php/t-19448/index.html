<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
Well I have been getting a little bit frustrated lately on getting whacked by green and light blue mobs, makes me crazy that at 65 I still get pounded on.<br />
<br />
I was looking at CA3 and LR5 and wondering if 27 aa is worth it? That's alot of aa and want to make sure I get my bang for the buck.<br />
<br />
Anyone have both can comment on their experiences and whether it's worth it or not?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It is definately worth every AA and I've very stingy with my AA's since I take forever to get any.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tauran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In my experience LR5 is one of the best AA's you can get.  Some people don't think it does much, and they might be right, but I noticed a big difference.  It's definetly worth 27AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">LR is woth 100 AAs.  I regard it as being the single best AA that any class can get, and easily our second best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jonat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">When I first started training CA i was hugely disappointed. So much that at CA2 I switched to healing AAs. Being the way I am I could not let 2/3 on an archetype stare at me too long so I finished up CA3. To me the improvement was noticeable and I then grinded to get LR5 in about 4 days (POEarth helps  :) ). I highly recommend them. Nothing beats having a mob in your face and not hitting you for a couple rounds.</div></div><hr />

I don't exp that much since by the time I get home from work it's raid time.<br />
<br />
So I tend to be a little picky about the AA points I spend and I would have to say that CA3 / LR5 was a good investment.  <br />
<br />
Nothing like being at 20 percent health and Sol-Ro missing you 3 times in a row =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ougabouga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Definately worth it!!<br />

I don't know how many times I've had a mob aggro me when I bounced the first slow attempt off them, and getting it slowed while it was swinging and missing!!</div></div><hr />

It is always nice to see a series of misses when a mob resists one of my slows.  I just smile and know it was a wise investment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'v recently started doing hard LDoN adventures, so my thoughts have turned to staying alive a bit longer when I have things hitting me for 950...  I'm leaning towards starting down the CA/CS/LR/ID path before I get ND3, with the thought that a miss of a 950 hit is more beneficial than 300 extra HP.  Does this make sense, or would y'all that have all these fine AAs recommend I still get ND3 first?  I guess the one with with ND3 is that those HPs are guaranteed to be there, whereas there's only a chance they'll miss...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">humm maybe ND3 before CS/ID ?<br />
I did ND3 before CA ( I have CA3 now, heading to LR )</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">It all depends what kind of mobs you're fighting.  Against your average BoT giant it's not important.  If you're in the elementals you very quickly learn that mobs hitting for 2000 would have killed you if not for the &quot;tries to hit you and misses&quot; lines three times in a row.  It's streaky like everything involving the rng, but every bit helps.<br />
<br />
PS: In regards to the parses, the statistical error in any sample is usually assumed as n^-.5, giving you 10% error for a sample size of 100, 3% for 1000 and 1% for 10,000.<br />
So if you're trying to evaluate an effect that should show you changes by a couple percent you need to let a mob beat on you for a very long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Very interesting to read all the positive posts about LR5.  I have a 65 Sk and on the SK board, they rate the LR AAs pretty low in priority.  Makes me rethink my shaman AA path.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">No way ,they do nothing  . <br />
<br />
  27 aa wasted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I was tied of getting my arse handed to me when I was playing in BoT.  Kriger resisted slow, and the next thing I knew I was naked at my bind point.  A chanter I know told me that LR 5 made a huge difference for him, so I started working on CA.  <br />
<br />
In PoP, CA did not really help me that much - heck, I only started seeing a difference after LR 3 if I recalled correctly in PoP zones.<br />
<br />
Now, I do not remember if I did ND before CA.  HPs are always important to a Shaman.  Just because it is only 10%, that small margin may help you from no receiving low health aggro if you canni, etc.<br />
<br />
Also, if you are going to get CA3, I would continue working on LR after you complete CA3.  Do not start something different until you finish LR.<br />
<br />
I am working on CS now.  Only have a rank in it at the moment, so I do not have any input on this.  BUT, I assume the same as with CA/LR.  I will not see a big difference until I get into the higher ranks of ID.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I think CA/LR are a good set of AA, despite what my test shows.  <br />
<br />
The effect is hard to measure, since it is so streaky, so my tests were way too short.  Don't expect some dramatic increase in surviveability when you buy it, because that is not what happens.  CA/LR gives you a slight advantage, but even a slight advantage is enough to save your ass.  It is a lot of AA for the whole set though and there is a lot of other AA I did before it.  If I had it to do over, wouldn't put higher priority on this line than I did.<br />
<br />
I certainly wouldn't advise CA/LR before say SCM, ND for the average shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I've said it on the board before, but before I got LR5 I was getting smoked inthe elementals.  Once I finally got it, I swear my deaths went down tenfold.  CS/ID is nice, but you won't see the huge difference thatyou see with LR5 (like last night I got hit from Tallon Zek in time when he summoned me 1312, 1312, 2178, 2878.  Those weren't his exact hits, but basically he hit me for max once, min twice and middle once.  I just got an unlucky streak and didn't get missed.  Now, when Vallon Zek's adds hit me, I survived four rounds with them and still didn't have low hp agro cause they missed alot).  Getting hit withthe mobs min is nice, but you are still getting hit.  I would rather just get missed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>EQOracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">With the exception for canny, Natural Durability and Combat Agility/Lightning Reflexes are the best aa we have imo</div></div><hr />

I notice a slight difference I guess, but I think I would have gotten more from doing the healing AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I am also tempted to say that it sure has seemed that LR is working a lot better for me in the last few months, especially in LDON hard.  I gotta look at the gear upgrades I have got during that time though.  That would ignore the fact that I have got 150 more AC (and 1000 more HP) since I first got CA/LR  (and I also have CS/ID).<br />
<br />
here is my screenshot of shaman avoidance in action in BOT.  Was like 3am and I seen Gaukr was up and uncamped, wonder of wonders.  Me, Bard, Cleric and my pet Druid decided to kill him... I was the tank most of the time.  This was sometime back in December.<br />
<br />
dodgy!  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">If you are expecting lr5 to change the way you play the game or massivly alter your playing experience you will set yourself up for a dissapointment.  But honestly we only have 1 aa that does that, cann5.<br />
<br />
lr5 keeps you from dying once in a while.  If you don't ever die now, then dont get lr5.  But if you are in situations where you die several times a day because a mob beats you into the ground, having lr5 will mitigate that in a small but noticable amount.<br />
<br />
The value of not dying quite as often will vary depending on how you see the game.  To me it relieves a lot of frustration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Have not gotten to this point of AAs with my Shaman, but with my Warrior I noticed a difference going from CA2 to CA3. Also, besides the smile it brings to your face seeing mob_01 tries to hit you but misses 3 times in a row, when you're fighting a mob with an innate proc effect, their proc will not land on a missed attack, potentially saving meven more damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I noticed a large increase in tries to hit you but misses/your dodge messages from no AA in defensives to just CA3....I am working on finishing up SCM3 at the moment (RL just too packed for much play) and as soon as its done, I am LR bound....that being said, I wouldnt pick up LR or CA before I had Cann5, SCR/SCRM and ND...as others have said, LR is streaky and random, where SCR/SCRM and ND are proven, viewable changes in your toon that are always useful, not just when Uber_mob_001_ swings and misses you three times in a row.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Nuggruk RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">As a time enabled shaman that also likes to solo I cannot recommend LR5 ID5 highly enough.<br />
<br />
In my limited AA grind time I needed to locate a place where I would never be trained, have to keep up with spawns or otherwise have to even acknowledge the existance of anyone else unless I wanted to. I needed to be able to stop whenever I needed to in case the Kids needed something or I had a work call or whatever. Lucky me I located such a place and NO I am not telling you where :)<br />
<br />
Before I got LR5 ID5 when I was fighting these mobs, tanking in the face, I either needed my cleric bot on hand or I had to cast at least 2 Q's on myself (sometimes 3) to last out the fight. With LR5 ID5 I never have to cast Q more than once a fight.<br />
<br />
Maybe this is situational to my specific circumstances and gear - I did get a couple of Elemental upgrades during the time from no LR to LR5 - but these were not massive upgrades and my personal perception is that LR5 is responsible.<br />
<br />
There is however a large step change as you go up in LR levels, with the a noticeable difference between LR4 and LR5.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">LR5 could do absolutely nothing and people would swear by it.  Hell, LR5 could make it MORE likely that you'd get hit and people would still swear by it.<br />
<br />
Sony has you over a barrel with that AA.  And psychologically, anyone who spend that many AA on a skill wil just assume that it provides  a bonus.<br />
<br />
It's just like the old belief that STR just HAD to increase your damage a ton.  But people found out that it didn't when they parsed it.<br />
<br />
The problem with LR5 is that it is difficult to parse.  You aren't going to get hit by PoF guardians for 1,000 hours, log it, spend the AA, get LR5 and then log the same mobs with the same gear for another 1,000 hours.<br />
<br />
I bought it, of course.  And of course when some uberhitter misses me 5x in a row, I think &quot;woot LR5&quot;  <br />
<br />
Of course, that happened before I ever got LR5 too.<br />
<br />
Get it, but it isn't as good as Can5, run3, RC1, or spellcasting mastery 3, and probably some others depending on your playstyle (VP if you ldon CC or solo root dot a lot, suspend minion if you are into farming, MGB and SCRM if you raid a ton with no or few other shaman, etc.)<br />
<br />
I am not saying it does nothing, I am saying that it might only do a trivial amount.  We'll probably never know.  <br />
<br />
Remember, people &quot;noticed&quot; more DD crits with DEX buffs and &quot;way higher&quot; channelling success with +20 agility too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">CA/LR is one of the best AA's that we have access to after Can V.  As you get to the higher level zones in the game, you'll truely appreciate it.  There is nothing like seeing Blazz miss you 3 out of 4 times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Dekurgen Heyokah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">For more in depth parsing, you may want to visit steel warriors board. I noticed a significant increase in mitigation with LR5. Then I read some info on LR5 vs ID5 and the damage mitigated over the longrun was equal, so I would recommend getting both. I can't agree with likening LR5/ID5 to &quot;It's just like the old belief that STR just HAD to increase your damage a ton. But people found out that it didn't when they parsed it.&quot;as stated above. It's comparing apples to oranges. LR5/ID5 have been parsed extensivley and there is a noticeable difference. <br />
You're a shaman. You will get aggro and you will get hit. It's nice to have the option to increase your survivability via defensive aa's and I would highly recommend taking advantage of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I would not assume that we get the same effectiveness out of those aa's as warriors.  Its a good AA, but I think I started on CA/LR at about the 120AA mark, and for the effectiveness I have noticed, that seems about right.  I feel like most of the AA's I selected prior to those made a bigger difference in my overall abilities.  At no point have I said, &quot;OMG I should have gotten that earlier!&quot;  I started the CS/ID climb at 175 or so and I am still working on them.  Depends on your game play I guess.  I would not put the defensive stuff ahead of SCRM, SCM, MGB, RC, QB, etc unless you just end up tanking a whole lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">CA is 2%/3%/5% so totally adding up to10% added avoidance, LR adds 1% per rank, so in total of 15% added avoidance.<br />
In terms of avoidance per aa:<br />
CA1: 2%/2aa ~ 1%/aa<br />
ca2: 3%/4aa ~ 0.75%/aa<br />
ca3: 5%/6aa ~ 0.83%/aa<br />
<br />
LR: 1%/3aa ~ 0.33%/aa<br />
<br />
This is the same gained in terms of mitigation for CS/ID with the same gains per aa spent.<br />
This is based on parsings posted at the steelwarrior, still looking for the link I will post it when I locate it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">It definetly is. I would say, try for Ca3 or even LR1. If you dotn start seeing difference worht it to you, you can save some AA. I dont think you will be unhappy though. Keep in mind that the whole doge system is rather streaky, so you cant just run a parse and go, oh well it doesnt work. Use it and pay attention to it and you will see that sometimes you will get noticable streaks of not getting hit and while that doesnt make you &quot;super tank&quot; it makes it easier for you to heal and for people to heal you. Think of it as like a &quot;crit&quot; dodge. It doesnt happen every single time, but its definetly worth it when it does. Do you regret getting Crit AA for your heals and nukes?<br />
<br />
Next to Can5 i can honestly say that this is my favorite AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Hail,<br />
<br />
I've noticed a significant improvement in survivability because of CA3/LR5.  Is it game-changing for normal play?  Not obviously.<br />
But I definitely die less because of it, whether soloing, grouped, or raiding.<br />
I certainly wouldn't advise CA/LR before say SCM, ND for the average shaman. <br />
I would agree with that.  Canni5, SCM, and ND would take precedence for me still if I had to do it over again.  I personally picked up SCR3 &amp; SCRM (&amp; MGB) before getting avoidance AA's, and if I were doing AA's over again from scratch I would choose getting LR5 first instead of SCRM.  MGB would still take precendence if you raid alot in my opinion, otherwise it would come after.<br />
<br />
It is also quite fun to compare how many swipes a mob took at you and missed before you finally go splat.  &quot;Ubermob killed me in 5 shots, but he missed 6 times too!&quot;   On smaller boss mobs, LR5 helps you survive instead of die.  I tanked a Manaetic Prototype last night from ~95% until its death (why it never punted me I have no idea) and more than once the string of misses enabled me to survive where I thought I was doomed.<br />
<br />
Definitely worth 27 aa's in my opinion.<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

But now I have it you will have to pry it from my cold dead hands, and even then I'll put up a hell of a fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Well, I notice a TON of difference, especially in Sol Ro Tower and beyond. I duo quite a bit at the Sol Ro zoneline, and if my partner is a monk he cant usually hold aggro off me. SK partners are better, but good ones are harder to find, at least on my server. Anyway, I noticed a lot less hits as I was training these skills. <br />
<br />
I wouldnt place it as 2nd best though, I personally think that VP is our second best AA, especially with the release of LDoN. But its Top 5 for sure to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Tyck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I got CA3 and LR1 right now.  I am definitily getting LR5.   Here's why:<br />
<br />
I was soloing (yeah I know... but ya gotta do something during snow days) and I got into trouble with a few too many golums showing up.  (hey, Weissbrau recommended the spot so it had to be OK, right?  :p  )After I managed to root and get far enough away to kill them I noticed something totally wierd about the msg texts.<br />
<br />
I saw the misses... I saw the hits followed by DS msgs... and then I was seeing DS messages with NO hit msgs.<br />
<br />
I was doing Damage Shield hits on the attacking mobs but they were NOT doing any damage to me.<br />
This has only started since I purchased CA.<br />
<br />
So, if you want to parse and find out if it truely IS working, here's a plan for doing it.<br />
<br />
Go to PoV or someplace with a fast hitting mob that is easy to debuff (like golums) and then put on a damage shield and have somebody just keep dropping HoT's on you while you collect data at CA1, CA2, CA3, LR+.<br />
<br />
Any Damage Shield msg that shows up without an accompanying Hit message is damage that CA mitigated into eternity.</div></div><hr />
