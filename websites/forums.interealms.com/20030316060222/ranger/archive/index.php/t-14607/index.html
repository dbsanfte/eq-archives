<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>norik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Whats the best way?<br />
I'm trying to get my Shaman bot to a lvl where he'll be useful/XP with me. <br />
I'm guessing the best way is on animals red to Shaman and something like this~<br />
<br />
1  Ranger- Snare, Panic Animal.<br />
<br />
2  Shaman- Dot, DD, Melee.<br />
<br />
3  Ranger- Panics, Snares and Tangling Weeds as required.<br />
<br />
4  Ranger- Kills the Mob when the Shaman has it at 40%.<br />
<br />
5  Start again<br />
<br />
<br />
How does that sound?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nerya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I plled my friends wizard to 25 or 26 in paludal, so it should be np with shammy to do the same, just let bandits die on DS, and with kei, its piece of cake. and I think he can group your ranger at 26 so then you can do echo or whatever and both get exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tathagata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1 - 10 hand in bone chips and belts/pads. Will take roughly half an hour to get to 10.<br />
10 - 16 go to Kurns tower, let the skeletons kill them selves on the DS.<br />
16 - 26 Plaudal caverns, start with Phlargs then move to Bandits, let them die on DS, root works well here.<br />
26 - 29/30 Needlites in Echo Caverns.<br />
<br />
Thats as high as Ive Pl'd, but I have managed to get 3 chars to level 25 in one day played (each) using this system (and that includes running around finding spells and training every few levels).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>norik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Upto what level do you get XP handing in GLs in NK? A guildie suggested this and i wondered how far I could get Henlan if I killed on Eruds Crossing till I had 2 or 3 backpacks of GLs to hand in, then headed to Paluadal with him.</div></div><hr />
