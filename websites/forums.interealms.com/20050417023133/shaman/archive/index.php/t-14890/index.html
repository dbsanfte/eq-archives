<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently dragged myself out of Dulak and to the Grey.(once I find somewere I like I don't like to leave). I found the trip there really pretty.(I haven't been to many zones in the moon). So when I made it there I was impressed at first.. many dark blue mobs.. it looked cool. I even have a nice wall up on the mountain I can sit on and not worry too much bout the mobs. The vapors seemed ok they aren't too tuff but overall, it didn't really seem worth it. Getting to the Grey is a pretty decent run, you have to have a EB item too. The mobs give ok exp.. but so far crappy loot a few pp... Am I just having bad luck? Am I killing the wrong mobs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grixx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The Grey used to be great exp, prior to PoP and before they nerfed the zone a little out there.  You're correct in saying that exp is &quot;ok&quot; but not phenomenal.  It's on par with most other zones of that level.  As far as loot is concerned, most of it centers around the pyramid in the middle of the zone.  Common practice is to set up on one side of the pyramid and pull Shissar Revenants and Golems there.  Shissar uncommonly drop scales which sell for ~18pp each (stackable) and also shissar organs, which are used in an EB item quest in Katta.  Occasionally, a named Shissar can spawn (I believe there are 2 different ones) which have 2 items each in their loot table - some boots, cloak, BP, and um...I forget the other item.  They're nice items for the difficulty.  Be careful with the named - they do not cast, but they do hit for ~170 if memory serves and fast.  I prefer to root, DoT them.  Golems also have a chance of spawning a named golem (again I forget his name).  He's a beefed up version of the regular golems and can drop some nice arms and a necklace I believe.  These named can spawn off of ANY of the spots where the regular golems/revenants spawn around the temple - the static ones.  There are also a couple other named mobs in the zone - a Hierophant skeleton and one other I believe, which have nice drops, but I've never pursued those, as I hate the traps and prefer to sit in a set spot.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Getan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Xp in the Grey has actualy been nerfed. It is one of the only zones that has an xp penalty. IE you get less exp for the same lvl mob then you would at any regular outside zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">REALLY???? That sucks.. I mean alot.. it is a pain to get too.. nothing special about it.. theres traps.. and those shimmering dudes give you crap exp for having like 10k hitpoints(my estimate). Oh well I don't care.. I'll just grab good ol goner and move on somewere else.. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Qatrixaro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Only thing that might be of worth in the Grey is doing that eb necklace quest.  Other than that, avoid the zone.  Bad exp, bad pp, average loot... you'll get more bang for your buck in LoY at the same level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Getan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There was a certain exploit involving rounding up a few dozen mobs and PBAEing them to death in The Grey. Druids, CLerics and Bards where making a killing there so ofcourse it got hit by the nerf stick very hard. Incidentaly, LOIO also has an xp penalty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yea I went on this morning again, I tried the shissar dudes they suck.. are they immune to poison? I hit them with malosi and BoN never stuck once.. it really sucks tryin to kill these dudes with a pet and our sorry 10 second nuke. Yes LoY is far better..  Sadly I get about the same or better exp off light blues in dulaks harbor lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Samyen Elementia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Actually, I was getting great exp there with my 51 Necro charm kiting.  Just pulled with Snare (Dooming Darkness; DMG doesn't matter just the snare), Slow (Shackle of Spirits) and sic in Charmed Shissar Revanent (hit for ~120 doubled... almost like Quadded with Augment Death on them).  I tore through all the mobs by the pyramid and even one of the nameds.  Dropped something that I gave to a 59 Druid since she was complaining that I stole her mob /boggle<br />
<br />
For Charming classes that can work there (Necromancers and Enchanters) the zone is great exp cause you kill so fast that the exp penalty doesn't matter.  For other classes (unless you're a quadder), it may be a bit rough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Horrible zone for a shaman. Horrible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Shissar outside the temple are all undead, so no, dots won't stick.  Golems are quick kills, but a soloing shaman won't have a very good time fighting the snakes (note the missing scales with patches of red underneath them *grin*).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Trena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I recently dragged myself out of Dulak and to the Grey.(once I find somewere I like I don't like to leave).

<br />
My advice? Kill the skellies to get your VT shard. That's about all this zone is good for nowadays  :p <br />
<br />
Also, Getan where did you hear that LOIO has an xp penalty? It's a newbie zone and coded as such (last I heard) so if it has an xp penalty, that would make it easily the worst newbie zone ingame (when Iksar newbie hunting grounds have always been a major plus for them).<br />
<br />
Just curious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Getan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If you dig around the showeq website you will find a list of all ZEM.<br />
<br />
LOIO xp was nerfed a long time ago because in the old days you could lvl from 1-50 in LOIO fairly fast because of newbie zone xp bonus.<br />
<br />
Baseline ZEM is 0.75<br />
The Grey ZEM is 0.65<br />
LOIO ZEM is 0.60<br />
Newbie Dungeons are 1.60<br />
Most Dungeons are 0.85<br />
Some new Dungeons are 1.00<br />
1st tier planes after nerf is 1.19<br />
<br />

As for camping the Grey, there are some nice drops of named mobs but the zone totaly sucks for a soloing Shaman. Great for Clerics and Paladins though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Actually a lot of us would probably be interested in a complete list of ZEMs -- I know I would be -- but I do not really want to go to the showeq website because that sort of thing is illegal on EQ(or at least was before I came back after my 2.7 year abscence).  So please -- post the whole list here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lol, so you don't want to break the agreement, but want someone else do it for you?<br />
<br />
Going to the website isn't illegal anyway. YOu're perfectly within your rights to surf the site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Webber</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I just reciently hit 57 and decided to try the grey since I could finally single pull. I killed 6 mobs at the temple and still didn't get 1%. The worst xp I've seen anywhere.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Samyen Elementia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The Grey = 49 - 55.  Anything over that would be overkill for exp there.  BTW, I never had any problems landing Poison and Disease DoT spells on the snakes after Malosi.</div></div><hr />
