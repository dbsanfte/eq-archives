<br />
i am still looking for another peice or two ... i do have two 65hp rings that i use as well as listed rings ... <br />
<br />
when i have been searching for other upgrades tho it is reaching a point where i would spend over 2k more just to get 15 to 20 more hp .. to me that isnt worth it yet ... my AC unbuffed is just under 1k (around 980 if i recall) <br />
<br />
with my buffs on my hp is around 1700 i want that to be higher ... <br />
<br />
i have invested 1 AA into regen thus far .. and will be putting another point into it in about 3 more blues then going back to leveling full till 60 then full AA to get a few more of the nice choices...</div></div><hr />

EDIT - NM seeing a bug where I only see my Magelo profile</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kongming</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Urg wis rings.... 6/65 rings are a great improvement there and they aren't that costly.  hell even 5/55 are better and those are alot cheaper as well<br />
<br />
for belt I would go spider fur.  those have nice hp and ac and is pretty cheap as well.<br />
<br />
Boots I would go Barbed dragon boots if that in your price range. 19ac 9sta and 30 hp is just nice.<br />
<br />
Ft1 earring while costly is a very nice earring too, it will cost about 9k i assume so that might not be an option for you.<br />
<br />
Crystal spider eyes are a decent upgrade for your face.<br />
<br />
Remember hp is the key not wis</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Flea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">thanks so far yeah i know HP is the key .. but when it costs around 2 to 3 k more just to add 15 hp to me that isnt worth it ..<br />
<br />
i have the 65hp rings in a pouch and when i am fighting they are equipped ... i just have the others when tradeskilling <br />
<br />
i am slowly gathering up items for the potc quest to get that earring ...<br />
<br />
but for that effect i could just xp some more and save the money and use AA points to increase mana regen and still have the money for other upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Kong,<br />
I couldn't disagree with you more, hp is not the key.  There is a very fine line between both.  I would prioritize wis over hp and here is why:<br />
<br />
We shall say Flea is lvl 55 and has a base wisdom of 195 (his current stats).  This gives him 2255 mana before a 20 wis modifier, were gonna change out his sbs for say the shield of bane warding.  With the 20 wis modifier, he gets an additional 142 mana.  When the fight is close this would enable him to can once and cast quick heal, or better yet can once and topor (once hes 60).  <br />
<br />
I am not sure about your experiences but for me I am usually casted as a healer in a ch rotation, and 142 mana is of greater use than the 40 hps the sbs provides.  I do say that hp's and wis are important but a shaman should not neglect one in order to max the other.   Mana is important if you are dependent on it and try to can as few times as possible, cus as we know once you drop down in hps, you can quickly become the low hp taunt magnet.<br />
<br />
Also another thing to address is his resistances, this is also of importance when doing tov, and I hate swaping out for resist gear.  Get some gear with resists structured into it.  Personally I find myself getting hit alot less in tov with my base 115 cr, especially when there is a druid to cast cos, and a bard to twist in the resistances song.  It has been my experieince that, cr and fr are extremely important.....but then again don't forget the dr and pr mobs such as Zlandicar and Severilous.<br />
<br />
Basically I have my bank filled with items I may at one point need and usually tend to wear the armor that suits the task at hand.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Flea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">that makes sense Hlaan .. my resists are one thing i am working on more right now ... this is my normal gear listed .. i do also have BD rings and face peice for more resist when needed ... <br />
<br />
but the HP vs Mana part is what always gets me ... when i am grouped .. just slowing and crippling the mobs and hasting with light buffing the melee in a full group .. with my current setup ... during ALL of the grouping including much of the downtime i am hitting C3 to make sure i have enough mana still ... with my regen where it is .. plus casting regrowth on myself ... i still sit at about 40 to 50 mana max in a full group that is constantly pulling till clerics are lom ... <br />
<br />
so i am debating on if i should get my wis up to the 200 mark and sacrifice some hp gear? ... is there really a special point in the wis that changes how much mana per point you get? .. i have seen several different answers to this so i am still unsure ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You would be foolish to sacrifice HP gear.  <br />
Do you die more often from running out of mana, or running out of HP?<br />
<br />
For shaman HP = mana.<br />
It will get better when you get canni4 at level 58.  I felt pretty comfortable at 170ish wisdom I had through level 60.  And that was in the old days of walkin uphill, barefoot in the snow before KEI.  Canni more, try to get your hands on a fungi tunic.  :)<br />
<br />
Kong has some nice suggestions for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hello Again,<br />
You are right people die to a lack of hp.  However, groups die bexause a lack of mana to heal the ma or to slow  the mob.  Like I said both hp and mana of extreme importance.<br />
<br />
But here is the example you gave:<br />
A lvl 60 shaman with 170 wisdom, he has 2160 in mana.  Now make this shaman have 215 wisdom (what I normally sit at).  At 60 with a wisdom of 215, the shaman has 2607 in mana.<br />
<br />
Now let us review some beneficial spells.<br />
<br />
Can III   75hps:36-38 mana Cast time 1.25 sec<br />
Can IV 148 hps:82 mana      Cast time 2.50 sec  Delay 3 seconds<br />
<br />
Malo                                  350 mana Cast time 5 sec  Delay 10 sec<br />
Turgur's                             250 mana Cast time 3 sec  Delay 6 sec<br />
Krag's Mending                  400 mana Cast time 10 sec<br />
Topor                                 200 mana Cast time 6 sec<br />
<br />
Ok now for the scenario, shaman x is at a raid in Kael.  Target is the statue of Rallos Zek.  Ch cycle is every 3 seconds, and shaman x has been casted with druid x as the same ch number in the rotation.  If shaman x had 2160 in mana he could ch 5.4 times withoutmoding or canning.  However, with 2607 he could ch 6.52 times without moding or canning.  Also keep in mind this shaman has 3500hps fully raid buffed.  IMO mana is the more important factor.<br />
<br />
Old school vs New school (Hps vs Wis)<br />
I was once a firm believer in the hps way of thinking.  I even considered spending the 60k on the elusive fungi tunic:<br />
<br />
Fungi Covered Scale Tunic   <br />
LORE ITEM  <br />
AC: +21 Str: +2 Agi: -10 Dex: -10 Int: +2  <br />
 <br />
But if I had a choice what to spend the 60k on it would be the tov bp:<br />
<br />
Wolf Caller's Breastplate Submitted by: <br />
MAGIC ITEM NO DROP  <br />
AC: +43 Str: +6 Sta: +6 Agi: +6 Dex: +6 Wis: +15 Magic Resist: +4 Fire Resist: +4 Cold Resist: +4 Poison Resist: +4 Disease Resist: +4 HP: +45 Mana: +90  <br />
 <br />
Luckily one of my HoT farming runs payed off.  I would take this bp hands down to a fungi.  First off, the tov bp has more stat increases.  Secondly, more things drop from HoT than Seb.  So the cash you can make in tov farming is much greater than Seb.  I have personally seen more tov bps drop than fungi tunics.<br />
<br />
There will always be the hps vs wis debate and it is for you, young shaman to decide which path to take.  I have personally chosen to walk the middle, and not compromise either hps or wis.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hallyguk_RZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My suggestions:<br />
<br />
belt: Girdle of mithaniel ( common now and very good)<br />

      aint that good imho.<br />
Shoulder: Obolus death shroud or death watchers shroud<br />
fingers.  6 ac 65 hp rings 2x<br />
face: Death mask of the elysians<br />
neck: tracking wolf collar<br />
<br />
With those upgrades you will be set for a very long time, might take some time and money to acquire them though. GL!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Flea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i have barbed ringmail in the bank ... when i have used it i have noticed the difference when grouped on my hp regen ... it doesnt show up as much tho when i am soloing ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kongming</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">hmm I didn't notice her level of only 55 but I think even with canni 3 hp would help more.  with Canni 4 I would say that hp is greatter then the extra mana pool.  at 60 without Canni 5 yet in groups without C3 or a bard I manage to malo, slow, cripple, and bane mobs as well as keep my group fully buffed and still hardly fall below 30% mana.  hitting the canni button often helps my mana.  The only time small mana pool seem to bother me is at i join agroup and need to summon pet, fully buff everyone, that will take a whole 5 mins maybe which is slow star I knowand sucks but after that I'm set he whole way.... <br />
<br />
But it just my style of play and I gave my advise.  You don't need to take it or not.  But it what I found to be most useful.  I do waste a few of my hp for good focus effects.  I believe that my Ammy of insight for stat just suck.  Coldain miltary bracer stats are average.  JBB stats just suck.  Fungi ac ect ...but for the effect I take the hp/ac loss.  I'm still tring to find a way to push it to 1kac and like 2k unbuffed Hp  but I don't think I will be able to manage that for some time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hlaan, level 60+ with torpor is completely different than level 55 without torpor.  Raid situations are, overall very different than general exp groups.  <br />
<br />
There are certainly times when a large mana pool is a very good thing.  Overall though, for shaman, HP is more important.  If you are having trouble with your mana pool I might suggest the AA skill Canni5.   You need to have a minimum amount of HP to be able to use that skill effectively.<br />
<br />
I would argue that the goal of most shaman at the high end, 60+ is to increase their hp and mana, while maintaining some AC level that they are comfortable with... bah, and getting focus effects they like.<br />
<br />
No where in that equation is people wanting to raise their wisdom.  Wisdom raises naturally when you get better gear.   You would be working against yourself and backward to a future goal, to start trying to get wisdom gear at this point.<br />
<br />
Certainly you are free to disagree.  Personally, I feel our spells in POP (with high mana costs and short durations) are balanced against the fact that we can regain mana quickly through the use Cannibalize 4 and our AA skill Cannibalize.</div></div><hr />
