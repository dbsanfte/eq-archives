<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>humburto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just got by JBB at level 51 and was wondering some good places to try this new thing out. I had been killing IG. They are great, but boring and the JBB doesnt work on them anyways. Looking for zones I can solo or partner in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">check out the hunting guides for lvl 50-60.<br />
<br />
i recommend seafuries :) nice and relaxing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Run around the dreadlands just east of karnor's castle and kill anything that cons blue.  Pull with slow and click click click.  Mobs die very fast and give good exp.  I camped here and other places all the way to 54.  At the time it is boring, but looking back on it, it wasnt boring at all compared to the places I solo now (at 57).  In dreadlands there are usually 50+ people, oftentimes closer to 100.  You've got someone to talk to.  Where I camp... about 4, and they're all german =\  I get so lonely I try to start conversation on the auction channel /cry</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've been doing pretty nicely in Skyfire without a JBB, so you can probably nicer with one :)<br />
<br />
I've been pulling in over a blue (in lvl 54)  in a couple of hours soloing - which may or may not be good, but it's good for me :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gamil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">For me from 49 till current 52 with JBB it has been scarlet dessert on the moon and burning wood.<br />
<br />
for both places, i get a pet up buff him with talisman or hos and haste. then find a mob slow it and tank for pet while i spam my jbb.<br />
<br />
some of the higher mobs like the the blood tribe and cheetahs in SD and some the apes and higher end undead in BW ill toss an Ebolt.<br />
<br />
Bw is best for loot with gem/jewlery possiblities and the odd spell when the moon and planet are allined with your back and teh giants are looking over your shoulder</div></div><hr />
