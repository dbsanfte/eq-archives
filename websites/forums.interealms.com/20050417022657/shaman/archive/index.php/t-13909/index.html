<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kashale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Lately I&#8217;ve been spending a lot of time in The Grey.  During this time I have noticed that I periodically get jumped by mobs seemingly popping from out of nowhere.  From what I have gathered, these are &#8220;traps&#8221; that are triggered by me moving over or near the trap.<br />
<br />
I would like to know more about how these traps work.  Any information on them is appreciated:<br />
<br />
Are these traps static, as in always in the same spot?<br />
<br />
Are they triggered only by moving over or through the trap?<br />
<br />
In The Grey, the spots where I have always been jumped are when I am moving over a rock or between 2 rocks.  Is this the only case or are there traps in the middle of the open areas as well?<br />
<br />
If I levitate high over a spot where there is a trap will it still trigger?<br />
<br />
If I move over or through a trap will it ALWAYS trigger the attack mobs or is there only merely a CHANCE of the trap going off?<br />
<br />
If a rogue were to Disarm a trap does it stay disarmed for a specified period of time?  How does this work? (I know, this isn&#8217;t the Rogue board but maybe someone here knows  :p  )<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I remember these traps being static. I remember them always being by a pile of rocks. <br />
<br />

They seem to be triggered when your character crosses their location coordinate. <br />
<br />

I remember them all being by rocks, can't recall any that are in just an open space. <br />
<br />

Your Z axis does not effect the trap. You will trigger it when you cross it's X, Y coordinate. <br />
<br />

Yeah, pretty sure it will always trigger the trap. <br />
<br />
If a rogue were to Disarm a trap does it stay disarmed for a specified period of time?  How does this work? (I know, this isn’t the Rogue board but maybe someone here knows  :p  )<br />
I asked my friend who plays a rogue and he does not recall ever being able to sense or disarm the traps in the grey. <br />
<br />
<br />
Some extra notes about these traps is that I remember most of the spawned mobs cannot see invis. So if you're invis, you can trigger the trap, you'll see the message spam from the trap and the mob will spawn, but it will not have agro on you. I believe that after the mob is non-agro for a couple minutes, it will despawn. <br />
<br />
Best tip I can give you about the trap is to not run over them ;)  ... run around rocks instead of over them if you don't want to trigger any of them. <br />
<br />
Good Luck</div></div><hr />

<br />
You bring up a good point.  I have been invis when I apparently triggered a trap.  I saw the spam indicating I was being attacked but was never hit.  Of course, I just kept running and had assumed that I had simply outrun my attacker(s).  I will try to trigger a trap while invis and just stand there and see what happens later tonight.<br />
<br />
As a side note, I have triggered at least one trap by running between 2 closely situated rocks without actually touching any of them and it did trigger a trap.  Therefore, it seems that running on top of certain rocks as well as between them can trigger the trap.<br />
<br />
I have a level 30 rogue and was thinking about running him safely to the area where I know there are traps and seeing if I could sense/disarm them but not sure if they are level restricted ala picking locked doors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kinadafz60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Depends on what type of trap you are talking about...the rock trap, I would just avoid the rocks as I am not sure.  the wurm traps, well, you can see them on the ground...a moving white light thing that is moving.  you walk over them, they spawn and chase ya.<br />
