<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am looking for some advice on where to direct my AA progression.<br />
<br />
Take into account I am the archetypical ghetto shaman. i.e. Crappy gear, non EP flagged. Either unguilded or in small social guilds (i.e. not raid shaman). I mostly solo, duo or LDoN. I play on a PvP server.<br />
<br />
Currently my AAs look like this:<br />
<br />
Runspeed III<br />
Regen III<br />
Stamina I (doh!)<br />
<br />
Mental clarity III<br />
Natural durability II<br />
<br />
Cannibalisation V<br />
<br />
Radiant Cure I<br />
Virulent paralysis I<br />
Spirit call I<br />
<br />
I don't get AA real fast (for obvious reasons), so I am looking for some guidance as to what way to go. The normal path would be Mass Group Buff, but I almost never raid, and on the od occasion that I do, there is invariably a shaman with MGB.<br />
<br />
At the moment, I am thinking of heading for Suspended Minion II (for soloing and PvP), but I also think I should bite the bullet and get Natural Durability III (although it doesn't seem like you get all that much bang for your buck with ND, but on the other hand my hp are kinda low...)<br />
 <br />
So, help me out, please, wise comrades</div></div><hr />

<br />
I honestly don't know enough about PVP to help you out; if you were on a PVE server, I would recommend:<br />
<br />
1. Finishing VP3 - it is awesome in LDoNs; then<br />
<br />
2. Finishing up ND3 for the HPs; then<br />
<br />
3. SCR3/SCRM to get max duration of your buffs (including Q).<br />
<br />
I think the path after that should be based not just on what 'category' Shaman you are, but your personal playing style. Read what's already been posted and see what seems to apply to your game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ND3 would be a solid place to go next. When ND was given to shaman a lot of us had HP right around what you have now. It was worth it then and as you continue to pick up sta items it just gets better.<br />
<br />
VP3 was also really worth it for me for soloing and LDoN.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">don't underestimate SCM3, it's QUITE good for your mana pool :)<br />
<br />
and i'm kinda curious about how it interacts with second forte too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I just re-read the Medecine Cabinet's thread on AAs again (thanks for the link Samanna). The trouble with that thread is it always leaves me just as confused as I was to start with (being proof of the old adage &quot;opinions are like a$$holes:  Everyone has one!&quot;).<br />
<br />
Like, everyone agrees that Canni V is primo. Thereafter, there are as many possibilities as there are colours in the rainbow.<br />
<br />
Have revised my thinking slightly - am thinking NDIII (I hate saving 6 AA, I am impatient, but I have 2 AA banked already), VPII, RCII, then start thinking about getting more ticks out of torpor...but I will probably change my mind several more times yet... ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">After SCRM im going to get all my healing AA's i think... but thats just me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>AtommWarbird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you're primarily soloing/duoing, then I suspect you are looking for to do a few basic things:<br />
<br />
1.  Kill quickly<br />
2.  Emergency crowd control.<br />
3.  Tank &quot;in the face&quot; when necessary<br />
4.  Eliminate as much downtime as possible<br />
<br />
Perhaps thinking of your next few AA's in this way will help you:<br />
<br />
ND3 - More hitpoints = tank longer without healing = larger mana regen &quot;buffer&quot;  (Note it's like 200-300 hps you get TOTAL with ND3, so the jump from ND2-ND3 isn't that impressive.)<br />
<br />
VP2/3 - Longer, more reliable lasting root *that is manaless*  Also good emergency crowd control if mobs aren't too disease resistant.<br />
<br />
SCM3 - 10% saving on mana.  Less downtime<br />
<br />
SCR3/SCRM = Buffs last longer and Torpor/Quie heals more, less mana spent over time rebuffing, less downtime<br />
<br />
SC1/3 = Basically a DOT with a knockback component *that is manaless*, also good for emergency crowd control (until the pets get killed/depop)<br />
<br />
What you pick really depends on what you feel you're suffering most from.<br />
<br />
Most shaman I know seem to gravitate towards SCM3 and SCRM before moving on to VP/SC and the Healing AA's.  I know personally I needed a larger mana pool to keep downtime to a minimum so I went for SCM3 then SCRM.  I think the mana savings is VERY noticable with both.  Also a nice convience factor of not having to rebuff every few min (FA and haste).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Meddow Spiritwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My progression was:<br />
<br />
Regen 3<br />
Run speed 3<br />
<br />
Mental Clarity 3<br />
<br />
Canni V<br />
MGB<br />
<br />
SCR 3<br />
<br />
SCRM<br />
Alchemy 1 (just for the elder title)<br />
<br />
ND 1<br />
<br />
as of current. I did the buff route for 2 reasons. At the time I was the only Shaman in my guild at 65 so me having MGB Fo7 was quite useful. and second reason was LDoN. Sucks having to rebuff 3/4 through an LDoN<br />
<br />
Now my plan is:<br />
Finish ND3, LR, VP, and crit Dots. after that i dunno</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Alchemy 1 (just for the elder title) <br />
<br />
for those last couple AAs to the title, QB1 would have been a better choice</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Dugann, you cracked the 1K post milestone! Let me know if you want a special title :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">VP3 and SC3 are both highly useful on a PVP server.  I don't recommend that you get spiritcall 4 or 5 yet until the full extent of the &quot;improved&quot; AA is explored - in PVP you WANT push and you WANT more pets because more pets = more interrupts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'd have to also mention runspeed 4 and 5.  Especially for pvp it should be usefull since they can't be dispelled. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Most shaman I know seem to gravitate towards SCM3 and SCRM before moving on to VP/SC and the Healing AA's.

<br />
I bought SCM3 and SCRM long before I started my Healing AA's and VP.  I was not soloing as much, so I did not see a huge reason for me to get VP or SC yet.  When I made 65, I was in a guild that raided at least three days a week.  In my free time, I was grouping with friends.<br />
<br />
Buff Duration and Mana Pres were a must for me - hence why I started SCM3, SCR3 and SCRM after I completed Canni V.  I think I have MGB in there as well.  I do not remember if I bought that before or after these.<br />
<br />
I was slow picking up ND3, but if I had to do it over, I would get these AAs after Canni V.  Low Health Aggro from Canni V sucks.<br />
<br />
Next, I worked on QB.  Having a 3.0 Qui was nice.  I was duoing a lot with a Pally Friend who had nice gear, and Qui would be enough after I slowed the mob.  Mainly we played in HoH or BoT.  Even if we were in a group setting, 3/4 people, I would be main healer and slower.  Occassionly I would have to blast heal, but that is only when we had a few adds.  We were crazy with our pulls at times.<br />
<br />
After QB3, I started working on my defensive AAs.  I was tired of dying in BoT when mobs were resisting slows.  I started with CA, and I worked til I bought LR 5.<br />
<br />
Healing AAs.  I saw myself healing more and more, and I thought it would be wise for me to invest into some Healing AAs.  I worked on HA first, and I switched to HG when I bought HA3.  <br />
<br />
I bought VP around this time I think.<br />
<br />
For a short time, I worked on CS3, but I skipped ID to work on more Healing AAs.  I just finished AHA3, and the next set of AAs will be AHG.<br />
<br />
In the end, it all depends on your play-style.  I was in raid / group settings more, and I was not worried too much about VP/SC.  I had Ornate Legs, so I was not too worried about CCing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">theres a few AAs that most consider to be top priority after cannibalize. Those being SCM3, SCRM, QB2, VP3, ND3 and LR5. Choose according to your play style.</div></div><hr />
