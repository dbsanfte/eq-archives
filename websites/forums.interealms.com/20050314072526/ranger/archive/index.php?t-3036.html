I don't know where they went.  Also, I am farming bats right now, just buying them would be a lot easier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unfortunately, spending 8 hours killing 100's of bats for 50 to 100 bat wings isn't going to cut it for this guy.  If he truely has ruined his faction enough , he really needs to buy quite literally 1000 or more bat wings to get the faction needed.<br />
<br />
To answer your question, no, there is no closer place than EC.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seriana</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They sell them in EC, and in the caster guild in Freeport.<br />
<br />
Can also buy them in Shadowhaven (I think) and FG (I know).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greym</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Umm yes there is a vender closer than EC. In the bazaar there is a merchant that sells bat wings, first guy on the left as you enter the central building. Spire up to nexus and zone into the bazaar. Don't even have to lug the things back just toss them in the bank and spire back down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dhiemn</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just buy a port to WC and back to GF.  I'm sure a mid level wizard would do it for an easy 40pp.  Be done in an hour tops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raytheon</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are sevearl batwing merchants in the Bazaar and Shadowhaven.  The Bargain Merchants in SH in the Fordel Quarter, and the first merchant on the left as you enter the south side of the merchant area in the bazaar.  Much easier than going to EC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taimus</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 12:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought they sold them in the Int. Casters guild in Felwithe or near there.<br />
<br />
could be wrong, havent been there in a coons age.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Giland</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 12:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He didn't ruin his faction, I have never done anything to hurt my faction with Felwithe or Kelethin at all. But being a half elf, I start out with merchants not liking me in either city, let alone some guild people.<br />
And I believe the guy  you do the pot quest for to get the recipe for is on the same faction as the batwing lady, so giving her batwings raises your faction with him.<br />
 I had to do this same quest. I would recommend the shadowhaven version. Takes a little longer, but you don't have to shout for a port, or find someone willing to do it. I was able to buy in WC as I have a porting wizard at my beck and call, but it still took alot of wings get high enough to attempt the boat ride again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Underbrush</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Batwings are not sold in Felwithe, or Greater Faydark, or Akanon, or anywhere you can get without a port or a boat. They will only be found on vendors if players have sold them to th vendor. Fish scales are much the same way. Bazaar is probably the safest route to get them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Emer</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I too had to go the same route you did.  Katha Firespinner sells them in East Commons.  Easiest to just load up there and catch a port to Gfay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anteil</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 01:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I eventually just found someone to port me to Nek and back, and btw, the quest from Niola (mage guild) takes 4wings/quest and you can do 4 stacks of 4 for 4 hits at a time.  I got to amiable in about 300 wings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dhiemn</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">sounds about right.  You've always eben able to do stacked quests in groups of 4.  At least all the quests I've done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tolian</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shouldn't be an issue.  Just load up 2 or 3 backpacks full of wings (10 slotters if you can, even trader satchels will do) and make 1 trip.  Way quicker than farming them, and way cheaper than buying them, even figuring in the port donation.  Won't take that long if you use the 4x4 method.</div></div><hr />
