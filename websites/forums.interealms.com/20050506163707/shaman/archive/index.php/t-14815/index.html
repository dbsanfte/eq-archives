<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all. post pretty much says it all. Ive looked around neriak and dont see the quest npc. Ive also looked on the boards here and havent found anything. Any input guys? Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, this quest still works i did it last night with my new troll shaman. To start with you need to got to East Freeport secret tunnel where the evil merchants and gms are there you should find a dark elf female wearing silver armor i dont remeber her name but it starts with an s. Dont try hailing her that dosnt work anymore and hasnt for a while thats a bug that sony hasnt fixed yet but you need to say &quot;I am a devooted follower of Innoruuk&quot; im preety sure thats what you need to say ill check on that but she should reply and give you a note that you need to take to Piree Nexus in the Neriak cleric guild its in neriak 3rd quarter you cant miss it. It will take 2note hand ins to get your faction up for the first part of the quest. <br />
                       <br />
 But after that you should hail him and he will ask for 4 woven grass amulets dont get them yet instead go up to the top floor of the cleric guild and hail Ithnol or something like that he will tell you the second part of the quest and ask you to get master woompas head. Master woompa is west of the bridge on the commons side he at a post surrond by halflings but to get him to spawn you must first kill the halfling standing directly by the post this is his place holder he should spawn about 5-6 minutes after the halflings death also kill as many halflings around the post as it takes for you to get 4 wooven grass amulets the halflings here drop them as well.<br />
                    <br />
After you have the head go back to the cleric guild and give piree your grass amulets he will give you the first neck piece. Then head back to the wizard mage enchanter guild in neriak commons (use the new map tool if you dont know where this is just look for the mage and wizard gms then head for the building) When you first enter you should see a bunch of Dark elf npcs but past them to the right is a flight of stairs go up to the top and hand draxis the head. He will then give you a mask that has 1 illusion halfling on it BUT dont use it yet! very important. You need to head to west commons for the next part.<br />
                         <br />
The halfling your looking for is usually along the road that leads to kitikor forst i found him quite close to the zone line he may wander a bit off the road but you shouldnt have to much trouble finding him use your mask to turn into a halfing then hail him he will say something and you just have to say &quot;I will help you&quot; he gives you a note to give to master woopa but hehe you killed him so take the note back to good old draxis in the caster guild and he will tell you of a spy in neriak. <br />
                              <br />
The spy is hiding in the secret room near the preist of discord you have to swim up the water fall to get enter it look around and should find him he will attack you on sight but is not to much trouble just be sure to have your buffs up and nukes/dots ready. After he is dead loot his corpse and get his head. You then have to turn in everthing draxis told you when he told you  to inthonl (Not spelled right im not good with names or spelling and grammar sorry about that but im in a rush) <br />
                            <br />
After you turn in the items into inthovl hail him again this time you have to deliver supplies to a de camp in lfay but first you need 2 steel bonings These can only be made by a smith i just /ooc in the pok 20pp is a fair price but you may have to pay more if you cant anyone or just make them your self :)  <br />
                        <br />
Once you get the bonings go to slags place its in neriak foreign corner on the human/good race side his building has a sign on it that resembles his name so it shouldnt be to hard to find hes in the basement but once you get in there hand him the bonings unstacked if they are satcked it wont work. He will then give you a crate. This crate needs to be taken to Sazoor or something like that in lfay the dark elf camp is on the southren zone line in between mistmoore and SteamFont but once you give him the crate he will send you to steamfont to find a gnome<br />
                           <br />
 Shes past the wind mills on the left side of the ridge in the north eastern part of the zone loc Is 1300,-800 i think....... but when you find her hail her and say Hate be my guide and she will tell you of a elf that has the crate and you must kill him<br />
                            <br />
 He will spawn and walk right up to the gnome about 10 minutes after you say the words He is a level 29 pally and does use lay of hands on himself at about 50% health but isnt to much trouble just kite him around and root rot him till you go oom then jump in and melle after hes dead loot up and go back to the de camp in lfay.<br />
                             <br />
Give Sazoor the crate and he will thank you and tell you to give Inthovl the items youve aquried after that you get your snare necklace which is very nice item. I really cant see banking it for a very long time. I didnt orignially mean to type this much but oh well thought id help out other shamans that are having trouble with this quest. And sorry again for my horrible spelling grammar and lack of specific data and locations of the npcs for this quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">did it 2 weeks ago - yes very doable <br />
<br />
snare takes 6 sec cast time and it helps prevent runners/downside is it only lasts 48 secs.<br />
<br />
So its not comparable to ranger /druid snares<br />
<br />
In hindsight root works just as well, necklace is fairly situational, like when your low on mana. <br />
<br />
6 secs feels like a long time, when I use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Necklace is an amazing item.  Makes soloing dungeons much easier, makes PoP root dotting in close quarters much safer (both overall, and it makes the use of initial dd dots in addition to pop ones more feasible).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Smellious Oderous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">IMO the necklace is better than root on runners. When you root a runner he'll fight you or your doggie. When you snare him, he runs until he's too hurt to move and just stands there and takes the beating from you and your doggie. I use it all the time in Dulak and Nadox.</div></div><hr />
