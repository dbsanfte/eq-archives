Given this track record, it's not wonder those feks aren't interested in mixing it up in iraq.  Keep positioning yourselves as &quot;anti-American.&quot; We got something for that too.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Gallic Wars - Lost. In a war whose ending foreshadows the next 2000 years of French history, France is conquered by of all things, a small group of Italians.<br />
<br />
Hundred Years War - Mostly lost, saved at last by female schizophrenic who inadvertently creates The First Rule of French Warfare; &quot;France's armies are victorious only when not led by a Frenchman.&quot;<br />
<br />
Italian Wars - Lost. France becomes the first and only country to ever lose two wars when fighting Italians.<br />
<br />
Wars of Religion - France goes 0-5-4 against the Huguenots<br />
<br />
Thirty Years War - France is technically not a participant, but manages to get invaded anyway. Claims a tie on the basis that eventually the other participants started ignoring her.<br />
<br />
War of Devolution - Tied. Frenchmen take to wearing red flowerpots as chapeaux.<br />
<br />
The Dutch War - Tied<br />
<br />
War of the Augsburg League/King William's War/French and Indian War - Lost, but claimed as a tie. Three ties in a row induces deluded French the world over to label the period as the height of French military power.<br />
<br />
War of the Spanish Succession - Lost. The War also gave the French their first taste of a Marlborough, which they have loved every since.<br />
<br />
American Revolution - In a move that will become quite familiar to future Americans, France claims a win even though the former English colonists saw far more action. This is later known as &quot;de Gaulle Syndrome&quot;, and leads to the Second Rule of French Warfare; &quot;France only wins when America does most of the fighting.&quot; (Note that the French entered this conflict in order to oppose Britain more than to aid the colonists.)<br />
<br />
French Revolution - Won, primarily due the fact that the opponent was also French.<br />
<br />
The Napoleonic Wars - Lost. Temporary victories (remember the First Rule!) due to leadership of a Corsican, who ended up being no match for a British footwear designer.<br />
<br />
The Franco-Prussian War - Lost, no contest.<br />
<br />
World War I - Tied and on the way to losing, France is saved by the United States. <br />
<br />
World War II - Lost. Conquered French liberated by the United States and Britain just as they finish learning the Horst Wessel Song. Popular German joke: Why do the French line their roads with trees? To provide shade for invading German soldiers.<br />
<br />
War in Indochina - Lost. French forces plead sickness, take to bed with the Dien Bien Flu.<br />
<br />
Algerian Rebellion - Lost. Loss marks the first defeat of a western army by a Non-Turkic Muslim force since the Crusades, and produces the First Rule of Muslim Warfare; &quot;We can always beat the French.&quot; <br />
<br />
(Balkans in the 1990's- When the French had an armored car stolen by Serbs from their peace keepers, and generally made such a mess that the Americans had to go and sort things out. This would be that Second Rule again.)<br />
<br />
War on Terrorism - France, keeping in mind its recent history, surrenders to Germans and Muslims just to be safe. Attempts to surrender to Vietnamese ambassador fail after he takes refuge in a McDonald's.<br />
<br />
Let's face it. When it comes to war, France gets rolled more often than a Citroen on an icy road. They've been beaten so many times there's no fight left in them. Of course, the latest news includes the Belgians and the Germans, both of whom have terrible 20th Century track records, not unlike the French.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
    Dear Dad,<br />
<br />
               A funny thing happened to me yesterday at Camp Bondsteel (Bosnia): A <br />
<br />
  French army officer walked up to me in the PX, and told me he thought we <br />
<br />
(Americans) were a bunch of cowboys and were going to provoke a war in Iraq.<br />
<br />
                 He said if such a thing happens, we wouldn't be able to count on the<br />
<br />
  support of France. I told him that it didn't surprise me. Since we had come to<br />
<br />
  France's rescue in World War I, World War II, Vietnam, and the Cold War,<br />
<br />
  their ingratitude and jealousy was due to surface [again] at some point in the near<br />
<br />
  future anyway. <br />
<br />
              I also told him that is why France is a third-rate military power with a <br />
<br />
  socialist economy and a bunch of pansies for soldiers.  I additionally told him that<br />
<br />
  America, being a nation of deeds and action, not words, would do whatever it had to<br />
<br />
  do, and France's support, if it ever came, was only for show anyway. Just like in <br />
<br />
ALL NATO exercises, the US would shoulder 85% of the burden, and provide 85% of<br />
<br />
  the support, as evidenced by the fact that this French officer was shopping in the<br />
<br />
  American PX, and not the other way around. He began to get belligerent at that<br />
<br />
  point, and I told him if he would like  to, I would meet him outside in front of the<br />
<br />
  Burger King and whip his ass in front of the entire Multi-National Brigade East, thus<br />
<br />
  demonstrating that even the smallest American had more fight than the<br />
<br />
  average Frenchman. He called me a barbarian cowboy and walked away in a huff.<br />

This is a very poor attempt at criticism. It isn't even criticism, it's a compilation of vague notions about history of France, shorten ideas and preconceptions.<br />
<br />
  If that's what you learn at school, on TV or any other medium, then you are to be pitied, for your confidence is being abused. What you call &quot;a small group of italians&quot; is actually the Roman Empire, which meant at that time the whole perimeter of the Mediterranee. And this is just an exemple among others.<br />
<br />
  Now it's my turn to give you an exemple of what our memories keep from the 2nd world war. At that time, the USA had a great need of informations about USSR. The nazis had a lot of informations due to many years of spying. When the war ended, a nazi responsible of &quot;jew epuration&quot; in the city of Lyon was appointed by the USA as a spy for his informations, and protected so he could flee to South America when the french court was after him. His name was Klaus Barbie and we still remember him as &quot;the butcher of Lyon&quot;.<br />
 <br />
  But american soldiers gave their lives and I do not hold a grief against Americans for what their government did. I have no selective memory. Maybe I'm too much optimistic about human nature, too.</div></div><hr />

Good for you!  That is a good philosophy on life.  Having a sense of humor is another good philosophy so when others make sarcastic comments, you will be able to wink and them and laugh.<br />
<br />
Speaking of funny, I saw a stage production by a small group known as The Reduced Shakespearre Company a couple of years ago (you may have heard of them, been on Broadway and other cities for years).  The production I saw was &quot;The History of the Millenium (1000 AD to 2000 AD).  Was a hilarious look at &quot;world history&quot; during that period and included a song titled &quot;Everybody Hates the French&quot; sung by a gentleman in a stiped shirt, beret, and playing a concertina-style accordian.  He brought the house down - including the French couple I attended the show with.<br />

&gt;&quot;Never fired, only dropped once.&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I'm sure its pointless to weigh in on this, but here goes:<br />
<br />
Americans make fun of themselves all the time in a similar fashion as people have done on here.  It is a form of flattery that people care enough to even mention them.  Deep down, many Americans are hurt by the fact that the French consider American culture so poisonous that is must be repelled from French soil at all costs.  At the end of the day though, nobody really believes these things.  Friends to tend to rib each other about shortcomings, and I've heard similar French jokes about Americans.  At times like this, especially, we need to have a sense of humor and try not to let ourselves blow things out of proportion. <br />
<br />
Current policy toward Iraq boils down to something rather simple.  The world, collectively, has allowed Iraq to not fulfill its obligations under the agreement ending the Gulf War.  <br />
<br />
For whatever reason, at least partially due to domestic pressures in the US, and partially due to intelligence that leads many experts to believe Iraq is close to developing something very nasty, Bush decided to apply pressure to Iraq to get them to comply with their obligations.  Through many blunders, however, some entirely unrelated to Iraq, Bush has managed to upset quite a few world leaders.  They are using this as an excuse to &quot;punish&quot; the Americans by not supporting their policy toward Iraq.  <br />
<br />
The problem is that, rightly or wrongly, Bush expected a solid front against Iraq, and he has not gotten that.  Saddam would likely have backed down before now, if the world had presented a collective front against him.  As it is now, however, he believes he has us divided against one another.  He likely didn't believe that the US would force the situation militarily until it was too late for either side to back down.  <br />
<br />
Jacques Chirac (France's president), and Gerhard Schroeder (Germany's chancellor) had extremely rough re-election bids during the time that Bush was attempting to push world opinion in favor of applying more pressure to Iraq.  Much like foreign leaders are often ignored or misunderstood by Americans, Bush was misunderstood by the citizens in France and Germany.  Many swing voters in those countries saw Bush as pushing for a war for unsavory reasons, which they opposed.  <br />
<br />
Chirac and Schroeder both jumped onto the opportunity public opinion presented, and made de facto promised during their elections that they would not support any use of military force in Iraq.  Chirac and Schroeder, no doubt, expected Bush to act like other politicians (from all over the world) and that his speeches regarding Iraq were all bluster.  Unfortunately, for a politician, Bush is a straight shooter (please forgive the cowboy expression), and often does mean what he says.  <br />
<br />
As many things do, this all comes down to politics and self-preservation.  Bush knows he would not be re-elected if Iraq managed to sneak something nasty into the US.  Leaders of other countries behave in the same manner.</div></div><hr />

Some 230 years ago,  the Soldiers of France stood in our ranks as we became a Nation.  It was French sails off the handlands of Yorktown that prevented the reinforcement of the British.  We have owed France a debt of honor but this debt has been overpaid with a massive interest in American blood.<br />
<br />
The people of France are cowards to be held is slight regard, and worthy of any scorn and contempt we care to heap apon them. Some 56,000 of our honered dead lie baried in the fields of France.  It is time to bring them home to America so that the memory of their sacrifice can be honered and respected instead of spit apon.<br />
Perhaps we could reclaim those lands on which sit the building of the UN and clense that stench from our shores by establishing a new cemitary for our soldiers that died restoring liberty to the cowards of France.</div></div><hr />

the US have had a past filled with war , i imagine that after sometime this country assimilated that for normal , and now wants a war here and there ....Bush and iraq .... maybe Lil Bush wanna walk in his fathers steps ? or maybe he is just extremelly pissed because he can't find Bin Laden and wants to lapidate a victim to appease the revenge thirsty crowd ...as for relations with weapons hidden in Iraq , nothing has been proven , btw if Iraq had some left i bet they would have used it at the beginning of war ... <br />
Bush claims he is doing it for the good of the world ... really ? <br />
i mean you guys watch TV and co , you don't just Hate Saddam because they tell you to i hope ? let me tell you a good one , he has the support of his people , yes he acts like a tyrant , but his people are happy that way .. world protection act to start a war ? @#%$ , thats just revenge . the inspectors couldn't find @#%$ because there was nothing , or little . think about it , if inspectors came into your country and asked to see all biological weapons and atomic heads and potential threats to populations disarmed/destroyed , would you like it ? i mean the US are definatelly the country with THE MOST WEAPONS .... <br />
i don't seem to remember Saddam or Iraq using anything against anyone the last 12 years ....and where the hell is the link to terrorism that allowed Bush to jump in there and to @#%$ up people that were happy without him ? come on , open your eyes ....that war was pre made , it has no valid reasons .Bush went over the Un decision by declaring war , that alone is an act of disrespect and something that shows me that Bush is not acting for a better world unified but for world domination , and it gets scary trust me when i read some of your post guys ... really scary , some of you just plain hate others ... just extremelly saddened , and deeply concerned with the US passing over a world council decision .<br />
don't get me wrong guys , the US are the biggest force right now , but if the rest of the world finds a reason to unite , like if the us start outpassing other decisions and taking other directions ..as this is a rant i am going to add that a consequent portions of the EQ database is constitued mostly by low to mid class people , that could explain why there's so many idiots in here , who refuse to see the situation as a whole , or who consider the US as the judges of the world , or as the superpower in control . to those i say you're wrong . our world is made out of plenty of different countries ..<br />
from internal and international point of vue ( my close friends are mostly made of people from different countries , jordan , china , japan , russia , germany , norway .... because americans are too cool to hang with international people anyways ) the american crowd don't know @#%$ about world politics , they think they are the center of the world , and would solve every conflict by force if they can ... always at their advantage but would put it as ' an act for the good of the world population ' ... you think you are better than everyone else , and your medias are as biased as a good lot of the people i meet ( well maybe thats just los angeles heh ... people are just too @#%$ fake here ) .<br />
thats my rant , don't talk if you can't see the situation from the outside , what i see is just hate from a lot of posts , and here and there an enlightened post from someone who understood the stupidity of it all . @#%$ Bush . <br />

Hitler was not as dangerous as Hussein. Hitler untill very late in the war wasnt even close to making nuclear weapons, Hussein was, and is. The FRENCH gave him 72 kilos of weapons grade nuclear material, and helped him build a nuclear reactor, guess what, Isreal had the balls to intervene and destroy it, otherwize, Hussein would have a minimum 3 Nuclear weapons. Hitler did not have WMD, the means to deliver them, all he had was balls, which everyone lacked untill it was too late.<br />
<br />
Think Saddam wouldnt use them?<br />
<br />
<br />
And, butthole, the whole reason hitler kicked ass is because people wouldnt listen to Churchill, and did exactly what the French want now. If they would have listened to Churchhill, they could have stopped him.<br />
<br />
<br />
Appeasement. It doesnt work you jackass.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, I bet before 9/11 if the US would have wanted to wage war on Al Quaeda, I bet the same retarded *******s like you would be protesting it. But oh look, we did nothing, and they killed 3000 americans. Is that what you want dirtbag? Stand around till somone shoves a suicide bomb up your ass?<br />

<br />
why so much hate ? <br />
i am sorry , i am french , and anti war .<br />
i am absolutelly happy about France's Veto and disaproval of that war .<br />
why do i have to suffer so much hate and disdainfull feelings about my heritage ?<br />
<br />
Because your government feels that we should not protect our sovereignty by removing a threat to us, a threat that conquered it's neighbor until we pushed them out.  Not only that, but your country's government purchases large quantities of oil from Saddam and has sold him weapons grade nuclear material.<br />
<br />
from the step back my status allow , i stand behind the frenchs , not considering them sissies , but proud and defending their opinions ... <br />
the US have had a past filled with war , i imagine that after sometime this country assimilated that for normal , and now wants a war here and there<br />
<br />
The weapons inspectors have found violation after violation after violation of res 1441, the French aren't standing behind their opinions, their government is refusing to see what's in front of their noses and we are tired of it.  The wars we fought, at least 2 of which kept your country as a sovereign nation was to free the opressed, not to conquer and take their resources.<br />
<br />
 ....Bush and iraq .... maybe Lil Bush wanna walk in his fathers steps ? or maybe he is just extremelly pissed because he can't find Bin Laden and wants to lapidate a victim to appease the revenge thirsty crowd<br />
<br />
The whole Bush Sr. thing is a weak arguement.  We followed the mandate we set forth in the Gulf War, which didn't include removing Saddam, only freeing Kuwait.  We are following the money trail, which led to Iraq.  The funding and training of the terrorists that killed our people happened there.<br />
<br />
as for relations with weapons hidden in Iraq , nothing has been proven , btw if Iraq had some left i bet they would have used it at the beginning of war ...<br />
<br />
They did use them.  They fired scuds &quot;they don't have&quot; at us.  they have the al samoud 2 missles &quot;they aren't supposed to have&quot; and are supposed to have been gone TEN years ago.<br />
<br />
Bush claims he is doing it for the good of the world ... really ?<br />
i mean you guys watch TV and co , you don't just Hate Saddam because they tell you to i hope ? let me tell you a good one , he has the support of his people , yes he acts like a tyrant , but his people are happy that way .. world protection act to start a war ? @#%$<br />
<br />
It's called Fear.<br />
<br />
If you would be killed for speaking out or looking the wrong way by your government, you would be happy too.  The Iraqi people are oppressed and cheered us before and cheer us now.<br />
<br />
<br />
the inspectors couldn't find @#%$ because there was nothing , or little . think about it , if inspectors came into your country and asked to see all biological weapons and atomic heads and potential threats to populations disarmed/destroyed , would you like it ? i mean the US are definatelly the country with THE MOST WEAPONS ....<br />
<br />
The difference here is that the US doesn't have sanctions against them disallowing these weapons, Iraq does.  the US doesn't use chemical weapons to kill it's own people, Iraq does.  The US doesn't round up people and have them kille for dissent, the Butcher of Baghdad does.<br />
 <br />
i don't seem to remember Saddam or Iraq using anything against anyone the last 12 years<br />
<br />
That's because the kurds have been protected by our no fly zone for those 12 years, which covers a lot of Iraq.<br />
<br />
 ....and where the hell is the link to terrorism that allowed Bush to jump in there and to @#%$ up people that were happy without him ? come on , open your eyes ....that war was pre made , it has no valid reasons .<br />
<br />
Follow the money, and the meetings.  Iraqi government officials met with Al-Qaeda operatives prev to 9/11.  Another reason this has been allowed to happen is because of the dirtbag we had in office for 8 years previously :(<br />
<br />
Bush went over the Un decision by declaring war , that alone is an act of disrespect and something that shows me that Bush is not acting for a better world unified but for world domination , and it gets scary trust me when i read some of your post guys ... really scary , some of you just plain hate others ... just extremelly saddened , and deeply concerned with the US passing over a world council decision<br />
<br />
Bush is enforcing the &quot;World council&quot; decision.  If you choose not to forget, the passage of resolution 1441 was unanimous, and it was for the immediate disarmament of Saddam hussein.  The fact that France chooses not to enforce it shows their hypocrisy.  To be trying to dominate the world, we would have to takeover countries.  Instead we push out dictators and install governments of people in the country to rule over their own people.<br />
<br />
consequent portions of the EQ database is constitued mostly by low to mid class people , that could explain why there's so many idiots in here , who refuse to see the situation as a whole<br />
<br />
Like yourself, who seems unable to use punctuation of paragraphs.<br />
<br />
from internal and international point of vue ( my close friends are mostly made of people from different countries , jordan , china , japan , russia , germany , norway .... because americans are too cool to hang with international people anyways )<br />
<br />
That is just nonsensical propaganda.<br />
<br />
the american crowd don't know @#%$ about world politics , they think they are the center of the world , and would solve every conflict by force if they can<br />
<br />
And yet we tried diplomacy for 10 years........<br />
<br />
... you think you are better than everyone else , and your medias are as biased as a good lot of the people i meet ( well maybe thats just los angeles heh ... people are just too @#%$ fake here )<br />
<br />
Our biased media is the one that agrees with you, which is why I try not to watch or listen or read it as they present it and instead search for the information myself.<br />

 No one who is worth anything will pick on you about english being your second language, most people don't know 2 languages and that is an accomplishment. As far as Bush goes, you really need to wake up, he is kicking ass, while Ch-Iraq is supporting terrorism, murder, rape, and torture, openly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Screw the French, they are worthless as an enemy, even more so as a friend. France needs to be worried about its rep, not the US, we kick ass in everything we do, France lays down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">AvalanchW,<br />
<br />
It is clear that the Soviets paid a huge price in the defeat of the Germans in WWII.<br />
<br />
We lost some half million dead in WWII and the Soviets lost close to 20 million people in and out of uniform.  It is one of the reasons that Stalin was allowed to take Berlin even thow the US was in a good position to do so.<br />
<br />
One clear reason that the US gets so much credit for liberating France in WWII instead of the Soviets is that we are the ones that liberated France.  Also, it might be worth noteing that the Soviet union may have paid the highest human price in the defeat of Germany but they did not liberate anything.  Instead they simply became the replacement country of ocupation and those portions of Europe where not once again free and independant nation untill much more contempory times.  If the US, Britain, and Canada had not landed in Normady, then even if the Germans had been defeated,  France would not have been free.  I hope that it is now clear to you why the US gets so much credit.<br />
<br />
Hadd,<br />
<br />
I am not surprised that you feel fear if you are French.  You come from a culture of cowardice and I would not expect you to rise above that unless you where a particuarly strong person of character.<br />
<br />
Please also note that it was I who first mention the debt that America owed France for her aid in our war of independance.  I, unlike the French, do not forget what debs we owe and my opinion is that this debt was discharged in full some significant time ago.<br />
<br />
It is quite interesting to note that as the war progresses we are starting to uncover  more and more evidance of Iraq's lack of complice with UN resolutions.  Note the large facitly that was recently discovered and apears to be for the manufacute of chemical weapons.  It was secured and disgised chemical plant of about 100 acres in size.  When we have alook at the equipment I will not be surprised if we find that much is French or German in manufacture.<br />
<br />
The UN Inspectors are not detectives.  They simply will not ever have the resourses to find hiden weapons and weapons programs because this is not their job.  It was the job of Iraq to disclose those same items and then the Hans and crew could have a good look.  To think some small number of people are going to run around Iraq and find weapons that are deliberatly hidden is just stupid.  We now have some 300k people doing the job with force of arms and very soon we will have lots of things for Hans and friends to &quot;inspect&quot;.</div></div><hr />

We as a species are buggered along with everything else that inhabits this chunk of coalesced dust. To put it frankly and at it's most basic we evolve for no ther reason than greed.

Mankind is the dominant species on the planet not because of our superior intellect, sound logic solving abilities and opposable thumbs. More because we use those tools at what we do best, KILL THINGS.<br />
Countless governments spend huge sums of money annually trying to perfect a better weapons system. When it's been around for millenia now already.<br />

1. Saddam pays and encourages families to make their sons and daughters suicide bombers.<br />

2. Saddam has gassed entire towns, of his own people, women, children, everyone.<br />

3. Has killed estimated 100's of thousands of his own people, if so much as suspected of dissent, and all of their families.<br />

But even with saddam playing the part of evil here doesn't automatically make the us and the western world the paragons of good simply because they are on the other side of the fence. The us is acting according to their own national self interest which so happens to overlap with the getting rid of one of the nastiest people on the face of this planet. When you say &quot;USA is right, and just&quot; you ascribe a moral superiority to the us foreign policy that many people including myself feel isn't there, it is however possible to do the right thing for all the wrong reasons.<br />
<br />
I do however believe this intervention is needed. Why? Because this is a mess that was created by the western governments, we are the ones who armed him because it seemed like a good idea at the time and he was the lesser of two evils. I would have preferred if this has gone through the un with all the i's dotted and all the t's crossed simply to make sure everyone was toeing the line but this is an imperfect world and sadly we cannot have everything we want. <br />
<br />
The only real worry I have regarding this war is the fact that it fuels the anti western sentiment in the region and creates an even more fertile recruiting ground for all sorts of religious extremists and that it can blow up in every ones face and utterly destabilize the region instead of the opposite.

UK, US, Australia, Japan, that alone is more then enough. Germany, France, one has been and one never was. Russia, used to be badass, now pretty worthless, China, who cares, they have the people, but thats it.<br />
<br />
We are at a dangerous time in history, people are increasing in population exponentially, and the slowest riser is the western people, they have a sense of birth control and smarts, if you can't feed 12 kids, don't have em. We deal with them soon, or lose alot more later. Most of the screaming idiots you see in the street are nothing but dumb animals, ignorant to the point of fanatacism.<br />
<br />
Saddam is a hero according to them, same guy who gasses and murders thousands, ask yourself what kind of idiot would believe that?<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, then you must think it was wrong to go after Hitler and Japan right? Hitler posed no threat to us at all, japan only killed a couple thousand at Pearl, less then the 9/11 blasts. We should just lay down like a vegetarian and get eaten?<br />
<br />
<br />
When does a people become evil enough to deal with? How many millions must they kill?<br />
<br />
<br />
Churchhill was 100% correct, WW2 was unnecessary, we could have avoided it if we listened to him and took care of Hitler early, just like Saddam now.<br />

What is happening now should have happened directly after the Iraqi invasion had been delt with but the fact that there has been 12 years muddles the waters, better late then never though.<br />
<br />
Just because you are against the war doesn't mean you are pro-saddam, sure there are a few idiots who are but they are after all has been said and done precisely that, idiots.<br />
<br />
The world has been a dangerous place since the ww2, first the cold war and then the power vacuum left by the cold war. This is the bed we made during that time and now we are being forced to lie in it. We have a un who is completely crippled because thats how we liked it when maintaining the status quo was more important then anything else. The only thing that has really changed recently is the fact that some people where forced to stop wearing those rose colored glasses and view the world for what it really is.<br />
<br />
Projecting more military power is a way to dealing with nations without wmds but does very little against those that have them or terrorists who aren't playing by the same rules as the rest of us, hell they aren't even playing the same sport.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Ahh, but thats where alot of people disagree, it is 100% confirmed Hussein supports terrorism. No Al-Quaeda link has been 100% confirmed, but any rational person would agree it is very likely.<br />
<br />
Nazi Germany was 100% NO THREAT to the US, none, zero, nadda, they did not have the means to so much as reach US soil. In Todays world, Hussein easily has the means to kill Americans, anywhere in the world. Do we wait for more 9/11's? How many thousands of American, Isreali, and our other allies need to die before we take action?<br />
<br />
America came to Europe's aid because we knew our allies to me morally right, and thats it. Germany declaring war on us was just words, with no threat.<br />
<br />
Japan attacked us ya, but still no worse then 9/11 attack was, less deaths even. Should we have gone after Yamamoto and his fleet and called it a day? Or should we do what we did, the right thing, and take it to the evil powers?<br />
<br />
Do people really think by doing nothing, and relying on the weak, ineffective, worthless UN and their idiot countries, that the world will fix itself?<br />
<br />
Arabs hate us because they are envious of us, we have wealth, freedom, they do not. Rather then fix their own problems, it is always easier to blame us.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Actually Mill Germany declared war against the US and had submarines that were more than capable of reaching US soil.  In fact had we not defeated them they would have had nuclear weapons and the warplanes to send them over. <br />
<br />
One of the reasons we went after Japan in the Pacific was to stop thier expansion, so it wasn't entirely about Pearl Harbor although it was a huge wake-up call.<br />
<br />
I have mixed feelings about this war, on the one hand you have the United Nations who have been crippled for a long time.  On the other you have a viable threat in terrorism, albeit one without a strong central government to lead their &quot;Jihad&quot;.  <br />
<br />
There are also a ton of oil interests in the region obviously, and France and Russia had just signed deals with the Iraqis for oil rights, so this is part of the reason they are upset and do not want a part of this war.  Which is twisted.  They probably think that since the majority of the cost of the war will be shouldered by the US and Britain then they will not get the contracts that they need, thus effecting their economies.  Well I say too bad, put up or shut up.  Get your ass to the front lines and help or stop being a part of the problem. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Jenoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Pearl harbor and 9/11 where more than simply attacks that cost lives, they where attacks on the pride and security of the us, in a very real way they where a slap in the face. So why did the us enter the war? Well with japan that is pretty straightforward, they had started a war of aggression and was threatening us interests in the pacific. As for germany I would have to guess it would be like getting kicked in the nuts and then having someone taunt you about while you where on the ground. Being a threat to the us is more then simply being able to project power against us soil, it is also about being able to threaten us interests and allies.<br />
<br />
I dont think you can find a single country in the middle east that doesnt support terrorism in one form or another, it can even be argued that the us supports israels brand of state sanctioned terrorism. As for saddam, he is most likely on bin ladens little hitlist just a few lines below all the western infindels, they might share a common enemy but they are far from friendly. Is supporting the ira a crime in the us btw?<br />
<br />
There are quite possibly arabs that hate west for a whole lot of reasons. Anything from they support the usurper Israel or they are trying to dictate how we live our lives to these are they guys responsible for the crusades, bastards!</div></div><hr />

North Korea is a scary place and actually a good reason to why Iraq should be attacked sooner and not later. There is very little chance of using strong arm tactics against nk, in fact the only country that I think could pull that off would be china since they are quite possibly ruthless enough. Having nukes and leadership the other side views as slightly nutty makes for one hell of a bargaining position :)<br />
<br />
Once you aquire a fair amount of power you become fairly shielded from aggressive moves against you, in a way its a small scale version of mad. You wont be able to destroy your attacker but will sting them enough for it simply not to be worth it. After all we are talking about an army that can flatten Seoul with standard artillery fire and most likely make japan glow in the dark.</div></div><hr />

 Yes, Germany did declare war on us, but in 1941, they could barely reach England across the channel with their air force, we were in absolutely no danger, also, we did not know anything about their weapons program(well not much) and there was no reason to think we were in danger. Later on we found out just how dangerous they were, working on the bomb, the first true ICBM in the works, etc, jet power. So at that point in time, Germany wasnt a danger, U-boat cant do anything to a country, some Jap subs shelled CA during the war, was scary, but innefective.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hussein declares war almost weekly on the US and Isreal anyway, Jihad is his most popular word.<br />
<br />
<br />
North Korea,<br />
<br />
 A very dangerous country, but still one we could easily handle. Remember, right now, people get upset at 14 combat deaths with an estimated(CIA estimates) 25 to 30 thousand dead Iraqis, so in fact, we are kicking ass on an amazing scale in Iraq, resistance isn't fierce, it is quite docile, we are more of a danger to ourselves then Iraqis are.<br />
<br />
If NK ever thought about using a nuke, especially on Japan, it would pretty much sign it's own death warrant, and they know it. Japan does not go on the offense, ever, they have laws against it, so attacking them would be nothing but spite, and the world would get mighty angry.<br />
<br />
US could withstand a hefty nuclear barrage, and return fire ten fold, everyone knows it, it is what has kept the peace all these years, mutually arrured destruction. NK can't destroy us, I wonder if even Russia could anymore.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you isolate and sanction NK enough, eventually something will happen internally. If nothing else, the crazy haired pygmy will get old and die.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hopefully we get our ballistic missle defense systems going, and shield us, UK, Japan, and our other true allies.<br />

Islam is a truly evil religion, they hate, they hate, they hate. I love it when people try and say it is peaceful, yet at every terror scene, guess what? An arab did it.

<br />

I dont hate USA, I have many friends there but Im starting to hate you and your ****ed up views on things. <br />
Mike's words (http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/message/index.php) <br />
Just a little link. <br />
<br />
<br />
About your and other people's comments about the French are a bit incorrect imho. You might probably be right in saying the motives of the French government (just like those of Bush) are also influenced by the Iraqi oil. <br />
But making comparisons between WWII and this war, and judging the entire French nation by the actions of one man and/or government (Chirac) or by the actions of a minority of collaborators, is completely and utterly wrong.<br />
<br />
In WWII France and other countries were invaded by the agressor Nazi-Germany. The U.S. only joined in '41, AFTER Hitler had declared war on the U.S, after Pearl Harbor. If he hadn't done that, they might have not helped France and Europe at all, we may never know. Hitler invading Poland, Tchekoslovakia, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, etc. was not a premise for war, it seems. <br />
In this war however, the U.S. is not being invaded. The U.S. is not being bombed. But I hear people calling the French cowards for not joining the war against Iraq. I hear people reproaching the French and reminding them of the help the U.S. gave them during WWII. Excuse me???? Those are totally different situations, as explained above. Are you going to call everyone who does not want to wage a war a coward? Has it ever entered your mind that maybe the French are opposed to war because they think it's unjustified? Has it ever entered your mind that maybe the war IS unjustified?<br />
And if you are going to call the French people cowards, might as well take the Belgian people, the German, the Spanish, the Russian, etc.<br />
<br />
If the U.S. would have been invaded by Iraq, I am pretty sure France (and all other countries) would be &quot;brave&quot; enough to give help. But this isn't the case. The U.S. is the agressor here.<br />

It may come as a surprise but a lot of the British people were also against the Iraqi conflict (before it kicked off, in public polls more ppl were against it.)<br />
<br />
Yes we are all behind our troops now we are at war, we are patriotic people, but when the Weapons inspectors were being sent in before this operation started it was said that it would take upwards of 6 months for the task to be completed, the inspector program was not given enough time to work.<br />

If Bush wants a war vice president Blaire goes along with it.  I don’t think Blaire or his party will be voted in again in the next election thou.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">Mike's Words?  LoL.  Like this is an objective and rational view.  *giggle*<br />
<br />
<br />
Salorm,<br />
<br />
Clearly it was Bin Ladin's group that was responsible for the operation on 9.11.1, but the war on Iraq is far more about preventing future acts of Terorism then in punishing for those in the past.<br />
<br />
This does represent a clear shift in American foreign policy and is significantly more agresive then in the past.  I think it is an apropriate shift considering the reality of 9.11.1.<br />
<br />
What steps can a nation take to stave off repetitive attacks directed against soft civilain targets?<br />
<br />
We have lots of large buldings, bridges, sports stadiums, airpoorts, and so on.  It is just reasonble to expect that we can directly protect all the soft targets that a terorist can chose from.  They have distinct and significant advantages in that they can pick the time and the place and can thus gather information, materials and formulate a plan that will defeat even significant safeguards.<br />
<br />
The way you stop terorists from conducting operations like 9.11.1 is to reduce or elimated their ability to perform such missions.<br />
<br />
a) Kill them<br />
b) Confiscate their monies.<br />
c) Destroy thier training facilites.<br />
d) Destroy governments that provide treasure, training, or materials to<br />
    terrorists.<br />
<br />
Consider Iraq,<br />
<br />
1) It has weapons of mass destruction and the will to use them.<br />
2) It is trying to develope atomic arms <br />
3) It has given aid / training to a number of terorist organizations including Bin Ladin.<br />
4) It hates the US<br />
<br />
President Bush is doing the right thing and I am pround of him. <br />
<br />
<br />
Homeless,<br />
<br />
The US does have a population of poor / homeless people and this is a very good thing not a bad thing.  Every time I see a homeless person I am so greatfull that I still live in a free nation.  Show me a nation with no homless and I will show you masive socialism, a huge central government and crushing taxes.  A free county will have people that are very rich and other people that are very poor.  You are wrong to consider homless people to be a &quot;class&quot;.  America is not a nation of classes.  A person of the most humble parantage can rise to become the leader of our nation or enourmously wealthy.  While those born into riches can become poor and homeless.<br />
<br />
The only way to guarentee econimic equality is to elimate freedom.  I am very glad to live in a county with poor homeless people instead of one without freedom.<br />
<br />
Poverty is also relative.  About halft the worlds population lives below the poverty line of $1 per capita per day.  The US has the &quot;richest&quot; poor people the world has ever known and the dregs of our society are far better off then the majority of the worlds population.  Give ous another 50 or 100 years and our poor will be richer then the average person living in socialist Europe.<br />
<br />
The problem with the world economy is not an unequal distrabution of capital but an unequal distrabution of capitalism.</div></div><hr />

A war on the korean peninsula will be fought with conventional arms and (hopefully not) wmd's as a last resort by the losing side.

If you want an honest answer you should give them yourself instead of just stupidly picking out a few sentances and making snide remarks.  How about presenting a coherent position with reasoned argument instead of just a bunch of clever quips?<br />

<br />
I don't think you realize just how advanced our air superiority is, yes, NK has a large military, decent air force even, but it cannot compete.<br />
<br />
Guys, I love how when the US loses 1 soldier or piece of equipment to the enemies 1000's it is considered somehow a defeat for us. People and stuff die and break in war, even to the US.<br />
<br />
Key things for victory in a real war is, production, production, production, and training, training, training. US has great vehicles, and top notch training. Ask Russian pilots how much flight time they get now, they can't afford fuel or spare parts. I have F-16's over my house every hour of the day, and I am damn proud.<br />
<br />
If Old Europe wants to flex their might, how about they actually do something that helps the world? Because they are cowards and selfish. Millions, MILLIONS of people die every year in preventable atrocities by evil dictators, I am surprised even we waited this long, but if Old Europe had their way, Hussein would be given more time, more aid, more weapons, nuclear material.<br />
<br />
France went out of their way to give Hussein nuclear weapons, luckily for us, Isreal had the nuts to take that reactor out, or there probably would have been a global nuclear war.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hate me all you want, doesn't bother me, I can't stand stupid people, including the peace activists here in the states, would  happily see a tomahawk missle kill all of em.<br />
<br />
But let's face it, Old Europe caused this war, if they would have stood up to Saddam, none of this would be needed. Instead France wants to feed Saddam weapons in exhange for oil rights, same for Russia.<br />
<br />
<br />
How many Korean terrorists have you seen by the way? Hmm? It is because they aren't really alot of muslims, it is religious, Muslims, the majority of them, are evil, freedom hating people, who have no concept of right and wrong. Koreans at least have some sense of honor.<br />
<br />
<br />
We are in Iraq now because of the cowardice and selfishness Of France, and it's love of murder, rape, and torture. Yes, they love Hussein, you would have to to support such an incredible scourge on the face of humanity.<br />

2.  Is it right to defend you country?<br />

Most of Europe doesn't have anything to fear from terrorists, because they basically think it is okay, they either support them directly, or turn a blind eye. Al Quaeda isnt going to hit France or Belgium, because they know they are on their &quot;side&quot;<br />
<br />
They reserve all their hatred and anger on the US, because they as countries have totally failed themselves, and need to place blame on others. Who better to blame then the shining example of the greatest country on earth?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Jenoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">I think you may have just a tad bit too much confidence in the power of the air force, it has its strenghts and weaknesses much like any other form of military might which is why there is such a thing as the combined arms theory where the whole becomes greater then the sum of the parts. Airpower is fast, flexible and can deliver massive amounts of munitions to the target but even with pgms it is still not a great way to hunt for dispersed regular army units. For maximum efficiancy there needs to be personel on the ground ready to exploit the tactical superiority that close air support provides. If you need to hit a stationary hard or soft target behind enemy lines, such as a factory or a command post then fighters or missiles is the way to go. It allows for the highest chance of success with the least amount of risk but airpower is a finitive reseource and sooner or later you will run out and need to replenish.<br />
<br />
But let's face it, Old Europe caused this war, if they would have stood up to Saddam, none of this would be needed. <br />
<br />
As frightening as it is to admit you are actually partially correct here except that you need to replace &quot;old europe&quot; with &quot;the western powers and the soviet union&quot;. France sold him things like a nuclear powerplant, mirage fighters, exocet missiles. Germany chipped in with nice little plant for chemical weapons (insecticide plant i believe the official explaination was). And the us threw in some choppers, some strains of biological agents and in 1984 it even removed iraq from the state department's list of nations that support terrorism. The powers that be also eased the ban on technological export to iraq and allowed them to import things like supercomputers and critical machine parts.<br />
<br />
Those where differant times, iran had just fallen and saddam was viewed as one of the few things that could keep that revolution in check and so he became the lesser of two evils, our own little pokemon. War is about political power in its purest form, the ability to extend the influence of a nation, the ability to shape the world. And when he used those chemical weapons against iran and the kurdish uprising he stained the hands of our goverments, the goverments that turned away from places like halabja convinced in the knowledge that they where serving a greater good, the self interrest of their respective nations, as well as his own.<br />
<br />
Most of Europe doesn't have anything to fear from terrorists, because they basically think it is okay, they either support them directly, or turn a blind eye.<br />
<br />
We have had our share, everything from confused leftists like the baader-meinhof to the separatist ETA or the wonderful people from the middle east that stopped over from time to time when they felt like murdering some israeli athletes or perhaps nab a plan or two. And lets not forget northern ireland, everyones favorite completely in-house christian royal rumble, where we find such brilliant examples as the ira who in the past atleast has drawn support from parts of the american population.<br />
<br />
Al Quaeda isnt going to hit France or Belgium, because they know they are on their &quot;side&quot;<br />
<br />
Dont kid yourself, we are all on their list and you just happen to have the honor of being at the top. Once they feel that the great satan has been disposed off they will come for the rest of us, we are after all decadent imperialistic pigs who threaten their twisted view of the islamic faith.<br />
<br />
Millions, MILLIONS of people die every year in preventable atrocities by evil dictators<br />
<br />
Dicatators our goverment doesnt really mind being in power as long as they conform to our will and dont start to rock the boat. I do however feel that the MILLIONS figure is just bit exaggerated.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">The French produce much good wine, &amp; excellent cheese. Their cuisine is, in general, excellent. they have produced many great artists. We all have our strengths and weaknesses.<br />
<br />
America thinks going to war against Iraq is the right thing to do, but the French do not. Neither point of view is necessarily and indisputably right. <br />
<br />
Saddam Hussein is a brutal dictator, who has done some terrible things, and would, if not stopped,<br />
probably continue to do terrible things. So, however is Robert Mugabe. So are the Junta in Burma. Will we be invading them any time soon?<br />
<br />
Saddam might have Weapons of Mass Destruction. Pakistan and India definatley do. Are we gonna invade them soon?<br />
<br />
Saddam Hussein did not, directly or indirectly, assist Al Quaeda with September 11 atrocity. He may, or may not, have funded other terrorist organisations in the past, but he did not have any association with Al Quaeda (reference leaked MI6 rports, 2003). There is plenty of evidence linking Al quaeda with funding from Suadi Arabia: Why aren't we pursuing the Suadis for this?<br />
<br />
The USA provided arms, funding and training for the guerillas who fought against the Afghan government and the Russians 20 or so years ago. Those guerillas were the Taliban. The USA (and other countries) sold countless weapons (including weapons of mass destruction) to Hussein when he was fighting the Iranians. Ironically, George Bush Senior - then head of CIA, was also selling weapons to the Iranians at the same time. Doubly ironically, the money from selling weapons to the Iranians was being used to provide weapons and support for a terrorist organisation (the Contras). <br />
<br />
I am against the war in Iraq. Well, that is not strictly true: I think that the war in Iraq may be justifiable, but not for the reasons currently being given. Thinking that the war in Iraq is wrong is not an unpatriotic act. Nor is it a treasonable act. To seek alternative solutions other than war to the Iraqi problem is not necessarily cowardly.<br />
<br />
One can be against this war without being &quot;anti-military&quot;. I am well aware that much of the freedom I &quot;take for granted&quot; comes at the cost of a strong military. I am grateful to the men and women who put themsleves in harm's way so I can enjoy my freedom. I respect them for doing a job that I would not want to do. If I were a religous man, I would say a prayer for their safety while this war continues. Any soldier who returns from Iraq, that I meet in a bar, can have a free beer on me. But I do not (currently) support the war.<br />
<br />
My point is, if I have a point at all, is that this situation, like most similar situations, is not black and white. The good guys and the bad guys are not neatly delineated. Nobody is wholy innocent. To condemn a man because he does not see things the same way as you do is inappropriate</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">Weyalan and Jenoe,<br />
<br />
 I am enjoying this debate in my boring ass job, both of you have the eloquence I so sadly lack. I know I come across as gung-ho hateful person, but I really am not, I am just angry at what I see in the world.<br />
<br />
 I agree we should hold Saudis responsible, most of the hijackers were Saudi, our Govt. has too smoochy a relationship with them. Untill we increase our own oil production(which we could do) we will continue to be too nice to the Saudis.<br />
<br />
 No one doubts that Hussein kills thousands of his own people, finances suicide bombers in palestine, and I think any sane person would agree he has ties with Al Quaeda. Fact or not, he is a terrorist, plain and simple, to me, that is reason enough.<br />
<br />
 We, as a world, should be heavy handed when it comes to dealing with evil, any country that grossly mistreats it's people or neighbors should be dealt with swiftly and harshly.<br />
<br />
 Does anyone even question the difference in our approach to dealing with civilians and prisoners of war, compared to Iraq? Why would the world not get mad about Hussein's attrocities, yet they are up in arms about us holding terrorists in Guantonomy bay?(spelling?). Our soldiers are dying because they are trying to do the right thing, yet most press, arab and european skew this as some sort of heroism by Iraq, is disgusting. BBC alone is just a horrible cesspool of anti-americanism, their own reporters are proud of it.<br />
<br />
 France now pre-vetoing any resolution giving US and Uk control of post war Iraq, I mean jesus, doesn't this Ch-Iraq freak ever get enough? The UN has hamstrung itself, it is accepted fact by US at least, if you need to get something done, don't go to the UN, they are a selfish, greedy, evil lot who care nothing about people, only about self interest.<br />
<br />
Yes, the US provided aid for people in the past we should not have, we didn't do it for evil reasons, we did it for what we thought was right at the time, I think it was right to help the Aphgans during their war with the soviets, to slow communisms spread if nothing else. Hindsight helps no one though.<br />
<br />
What gets me the most, is people trying to say Islam is a peaceful religion, yet how many of them in this country even have condemned 9/11 or suicide bombiongs? It is a religion that preaches hate, death to everyone but them.<br />
<br />
If the arab world tries to confront the &quot;Great Satan&quot; it will be their own folly, we will send them to hell and the world will be a better place with out death loving savages intent on killing everything non-islam.<br />

<br />
I agree that Hussein is an evil and dangerous man. I agree he has commited atrocities in his own country. I agree that he has funded terrorists. I agree that the world will be a better place without him. I do not agree that he had  any ties with Al Quaeda. You say that any sane man would accept that he has ties with Al Quaeda and Sept11. Am I insane? I don't think so. The British intelligence community don't think so either: MI6 (who still have a reasonable reputation) believe that there is no link between Hussein and Al Quaeda. Are they insane too? MI6 says there is no link. Bush says he has evidence, but he will not show us - that smells like horsesh1t to me.<br />
<br />
The point I was making was that although the war may be justifiable, it is not justified on the grounds that are currently being given. If you take away the idea of linls to Osama Bin Laden, you are only left with the fact that he is an evil dictator who does terrible things in his own country...and lets face it, he is not Robinson Crusoe in that respecrt, but we seem to be content to let plenty of other dictators do evil things in their own countries.<br />
<br />
Also, it is a cheap shot to talk about wars prosecuted by Islamic countries from a supposedly &quot;peaceful&quot; religion. Christianity does not exactly have a glorious history in that respect given its essentially pacifistic nature. Throughout history, egotistical powermongers have used religion as a tool to control people into doing what they want. Unfortunately, in general, people are not very good at noticing that they are being duped. Many terrible things are being done &quot;in the name of Islam&quot; that are contrary to the teachings of the Koran. Just like many terrible things have been done in the name of Jesus that are contrary to the teachings of the Bible.  <br />
<br />
Millman, I think you are perfectly capable of eloquence if you choose. But I do think you tend to shoot from the hip. Which is, of course, your choice. Nevertheless, you do seem to display a strong &quot;them and us&quot; mentality, and it seems that if we are not with you we are against you. All I am trying to do is to demonstrate that neither of those attitudes are correct. I may disagree with you about the justifications of this war. I may not like George W. Bush's government's foreign policies. However, that does not stop me from liking the USA as a country, nor its people in general. I spend holidays in the USA on occasion, and I find Americans in general to be a warm, generous, friendly people. I have many american friends. But that does not make me like Bush's foreign policy any better: Do you see what I am getting at? Unfortunately, the &quot;if you aren't with us you are against us&quot; attitude seems to be ruling US policy in this matter. I have been called all sorts of names on other forums because I expressed views similar to those which I have presented here. Like I give a phuque, but that is not the point.<br />
<br />
Many people also seem to think that it is ok to disagree with the war, but once the war actually starts, we must all fall in behind the government because otherwise we are traitors and lack patriotism. I reiterate that I have great respect for the men and women of the armed forces, but I will not meekly acquiesce just because people are dying over there. I will continue to argue against this war, and I will continue to urge people to seek alternative solutions.<br />
<br />
Please do not get the idea that i am some sort of hippy beatnik peace freak. I can envision conditions where I would accept the war in Iraq as necessary and jutifiable, I just don't beieve we have met those conditions yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">Well, since this thread basically has turned into &quot;what do you think about the war,&quot; I'll throw in my 2cp worth:<br />
<br />
Am I against the war?  Yes and No.  If it means getting that nut-job Hussein out of power and providing the Iraqi people with a more stable way of life, I am all for it (one of the very few things Bush and I see eye to eye on).  <br />
What I do not agree with, however, is the way we are going about it.  I would prefer a more covert ops approach to it, or maybe a series of small, specialized military actions.  Full-blown war just causes unnecessary deaths and property loss (property loss that, I might add, will ultimately come out of our pockets as compensation).  Only good thing is that it appears to be going quickly and efficiently.  Hopefully that is a good omen.<br />
<br />
My views on Pres. Bush:  He most likely is doing what he feels is best for the American people, which you can't fault him for (that is the job of the president, after all).  That said, I personally do not agree with much of what he stands for politically, and, barring some sudden sweeping change in his platform, I will most likely not be voting for him next election.<br />
<br />
Do I support French/German/UN-bashing?  Nope.<br />
Granted, a clever, or well-intentioned jab is something I would find amusing, but a malicious attack on another country/nationality is just plain childish.<br />
France and Germany have their reasons for not supporting us, just as we have our reasons for attacking Iraq.  Weyalan said it best when he said earlier:  &quot;America thinks going to war against Iraq is the right thing to do, but the French do not. Neither point of view is necessarily and indisputably right.&quot;  Might does not make right.<br />
<br />
Do I support our troops?  Yes.  They are just doing their job and serving their country.  I salute them and wish them a safe return.<br />
/salute US and coalition troops  <br />
<br />
I think what annoys me the most of all of this is that a lot of people are jumping on the whole blind patriotism bandwagon (i.e. I support it just because my President says it's right) and not stopping to think for themselves.  This leads to unnecessary hatred and spreading of propaganda.  <br />
<br />
Sometimes I think it would be nice to take a plain old black and white stance on this issue, but I just can't (for most things I can't, actually).  There are so many factors and points of view involved in this that it makes a simple &quot;I'm right and you're wrong&quot; impossible.</div></div><hr />

The thing is, france doesn't just disagree, they are doing everything in their power to thwart our actions, also, they are actively suporting a murdering tyrant, with money, and goods. They are literally one of Saddams propoganda tools.<br />
<br />
Damn right I can say that about islam. When was the last time you saw a christian or jewish group come out in the streets calling for the slaughter of all muslims? Happens everyday in the muslim world. Of course christians, an any religion has been evil at some point in time, but right now, it is all islam.<br />
<br />
France has been very, very malicious, hell, they are PRE-VETOING any resultion about post Iraq that gives power to the &quot;belligerants&quot;, can't get any more malicious than that.<br />
<br />
What is wrong with black and white anyway? You don't believe in right or wrong?<br />
<br />
Also, recent events have happened and the coalition supposedly has proof linking N Iraq orginizations with Al Quaeda, if that is proven, then what will be the excuse to feed Saddam then?<br />
<br />
<br />
He has killed minimum 500,000 of his own people, experts think more along the lines of MILLIONS, when is it going to end?<br />
<br />
Blind patriotism is stupid I do agree, but these same peace hippies call bush a terrorist, yet care nothing for millions killed by Saddam. Red Cross isn't even allowed to see our POWS, where are the hippies on this one? Probably because they are being tortured, and executed.<br />
<br />
France, Germany, they have hurt their relations with the US forever, it will never be the same, and I am glad, their actions lately border on evil and murderous, they should be held accountable. Every US and Iraqi death is on their hands, they could have helped pressure Saddam out, instead they tried to pressure the good guys out.<br />
<br />
There is no grey area here, we and our allies are good, France, Iraq, Germany, Syria, etc etc, are evil powers of the world, and if we are not extra vigilant, they will at some point attack us with terror.<br />

Then I guess this is where we will just have to agree to disagree.  I don't believe there is any true &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil&quot; in the world.  I believe everyone has elements of both.  Granted some (like Hussein, bin Laden, and Hitler) have more evil in them than good, but I don't think anyone on this Earth is pure good or pure evil.<br />
Of course we in the US are going to paint ourselves as &quot;the good guys,&quot; but those in Iraq and France and China and Qartar and Canada, etc. are all going to paint themselves that way.  It's all a matter of who you ask.  And that is why I feel there is no straight, black or white answer to such things -- there's always two sides to everything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even if the guys who oppose the bad guys are the good guys, being the good guys does not excuse acts that are bad.<br />
<br />
I mentioned earlier the lack of any specific evidence of a link between Hussein and Bin Laden /Al Quaeda. This, in my opinion, gets to the heart of the matter. If there is no link, then Hussein is just another crackpot dictator who oppresses and murders his own people, and occasionally invades nearby countries. If (and I accept this is hypothetical) there is no link between Hussen and Al Quaeda, does Hussein pose a threat to the USA, per se? I would say no; not directly, and if you include indirect threats, the list is as long as your arm.<br />
<br />
Yes, dictators that repress and murder there people and invade their neighbours deserve to be deposed, but I will bet you a dollar that there aren't many others that USA turns towards after this one.<br />

We are told that this war is about fighting terrorism. When it comes to funding terrorism, it is generally accepted that Mummar Gaddafi is a bigger source of finance and training for terrorists than is Hussein, and that Saudo Arabia funds more terrorists than does Iraq. <br />

We are told that this war is about figting terrorism. Will we be fighting a war against the Sendero Luminoso in Peru soon? Can we expect an invasion into Spain to curp those pesky ETA terrorists?

Here's an article on policing in Iraq, perhaps all you people who are supporting Saddam with your words now, here, on this board, might like to think about it a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">War is about the PREVENTION of terrorism. And the fact that Saddam Hussein has violated 17 UN resolutions over 12 years, the UN is too mired in smug PC ideals instead of action, so the real countries of the world are taking care of business.<br />
<br />
there is right and wrong and it is clearly defined. To weyalan and rodhan, if you honestly think there is grey area about slaughtering millions of people, torturing and killing POW's(in gulf war too), gassing your own people, killing women and children, forcing women and children to try and run a UN roadblock, rape rooms, throwing people in plastic shredders, cutting tongues out, firing squads, then I seriously question your sanity and your goodness.<br />
<br />
<br />
You need better arguments than saying you aren't sure if Saddam Hussein is the most evil man since Hitler and Stalin, possibly more so. He is, we are right, and thats that.<br />
<br />
Muslims want to kill innocent people in the streets, they gleefully do it, how is that a grey area?<br />
<br />
You guys can be good posters here, but you really need to define what you think is right or wrong. Slavery wasnt as brutal as what Saddam is doing, was the US in a grey area there too? I think not.<br />
<br />
You really are with us, or with Saddam here, if you are with saddam, then your country should be punished, sanctions, military strikes, you name it. Vandalizing UK, canadian, US graves in France is typical cowardice by the french, they can't fight so they take it out on dead people, and McDonalds, I would love to drive my fist through the back of a frenchman's head right now, my god they piss me off, and I am not alone, believe me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>Jenoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">War is about the PREVENTION of terrorism.<br />
<br />
No, wars are based on the furthering of interests be they international, national or even personal. This is what is happening now as the us is moving its pieces into a better position on the board. Perhaps you mean to say that this war is about the prevention of terrorism? Then why is there such concern about this war fanning the brush fire that is terrorism, which thrives when people feel powerless and oppressed. Stamping out terrorism demands much more then simply dropping bombs and occupying territory, it is a movement and one of the few realistic chances there are to stop it is to remove the need for it. Very few of these people would ever strap a bomb to their chest and blow up a bus if they and their family lived a decent life. Doing something like creating a peaceful solution in the israel palestinan conflict would do more to stop this terrorism then all the bombs in the world.<br />
<br />
Mill, some of us disagree with you since we do not view the world in the same way. For me there is no such thing as only two sides or absolute positions, I don't believe in the us being white simply because saddam is black. Its a scale and just because we feel we are better or more morally correct doesn't really make it so. Saddam is nasty piece of work, much like stalin (not surprising since that is his idol),no one here has to my knowledge even disputed that. But if that where all the reasoning it took to provoke an armed response from the us we could most likely be forced to spend the next few generations fighting wars. Demanding that people fall in line about everything concerning the war gives me visions of the good old ussr. It isn't a package deal, it is entirely possible to disagree with why the war is fought and still support the troops doing the fighting.<br />

Muslims want to kill innocent people in the streets, they gleefully do it, how is that a grey area?<br />

I haven't risen to the bait on any of your little anti-muslim rants but I think it might be time to do so. What do you base you rather insulting generalizations against over a billion people on? Is there some sort of survey out there that found that all followers of the islamic faith wants to kill innocent people? Because I must have missed that one. Among the people I know the ones who where most upset with the attacks on 9/11 where alot of people from the middle east, people of the muslim faith. For many muslims the attacks on 9/11 where more then simply horrific terrorist attacks, they where actions that tainted islam, the most extreme in perverting the teachings of muhammed. Are all christians hatefilled terrorists with a preference for bombs simply because the groups in northern ireland view themselves as christians? Is every palestinan a terrorist because hamas blow up buses? Does every jew fire live tank rounds that injure and kill civilians? Is every white american male going to blow up a federal building because Timothy McVeigh did? I will however give you a gold star for your quite excellent efforts in demonizing the &quot;other&quot; side, nothing like making sure the ones who you perceive as your enemy appears to be less then human. It helps to know that the ones you kill are not really human, not worthy of being alive.<br />

 You really are a piece of work. You deny that everyday in many countries, all of the ones mostly islamic, you see death messages in the streets? You denying that?<br />
<br />
 Tell me this then Tim Robbins, when was the last time you saw a christian group chanting in the the streets to kill the infedels, murder their women and children in the streets?<br />
<br />
<br />
NEVER?(in your lifetime of course, I said before christians have done some horrific things)<br />

I am so glad that you exist,  it proves just how great a country we live in.  In no place where life is hard could someone so removed from reality survive.<br />
<br />
At this very moment, the Vatican has taken a very open and public position in oposition to the US war in Iraq.  Please show me any Muslim cleric in charge of any major Islamic sect that had taken the analgous position by condeming the actions of those on 9.11.1<br />
<br />
Please show me the crowds of good moderate Muslims that are in the streets condeming the the attacks on America.  <br />
<br />
It will be hard to find any such oposition when on 9.11.1 the streats where filled with Muslims celabrating the attacks on my nation.  Instead you will find that the walls of Palastinian schools are hung with the portraits of suiside bombers.<br />

With all due respect, you are talking bollocks.<br />
<br />
To say being against the war must mean you are pro Hussein is so ridiculous and illogical, the average 7 year old could pick the logic holes in it.<br />
<br />
If, for example I am against the war, but would prefer to saturation nuke Iraq instead, am I pro Hussein? If I am against the war, but support stealthy covert assasination of Hussein and his sons, am I pro Hussein. <br />
<br />
You reduce this entire situation toa range of options of 2: This war or status quo. It is not that simple.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, you seem to deliberatiely misunderstand and misinterpret my arguments so that you can effectively argue against what you would like me to be saying - this is a classic &quot;straw man&quot; defence, and doesn't hold water.<br />
<br />
I make no claims of knowledge of Iraq's military capability (although I remeind you that the weapons inspectors did not find any weapons of mass destruction, and neiother have the coalition of the willing, yet). What weapons Iraq has or doesn't have does not make them a direct threat. Britain has nukes, but you do not view them as a direct threat. Having weapons is not the same as being a direct threat. Al quaeda has demonstrated in a horrible and despicable way that it is a direct threat. What evidence do we have that Hussein intended to harm the USA? What is it that makes Iraq a direct threat to the USA? Hussein may be mad and evil, but even he would not be so deluded to think he could attack the USA and win. He will talk the talk, because talk is free, but why would he ever walk the walk, when it is a walk he cannot win?<br />
<br />
The point I was making, and you were deliberately misconstruing, was that if you take away the assumption of a link between Hussein and Al Quaeda, then you take away the only logical justification that Iraq is a direct threat to the USA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>Jenoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">Why is it that you can view the peace demonstrations in the us and say &quot;they are a small minority, they are deluded&quot; and then turn around and look at arab demonstrating on the streets of amman and say &quot;they represent the whole, all muslims share the their feelings&quot;? How is that unless the arab community is out on the streets with huge &quot;We love the us&quot; signs they are automatically on the same side as the disturbed individuals that run around chanting &quot;death to the west&quot;. Would you be out on the streets wearing your &quot;america is alright&quot; tshirt under those kind of circumstances? There are always radicals on all sides and a large number of people who don't really care, those people aren't out protesting this or that since they simply wish to live in peace without having extremist cracking their skulls. I'm not saying the middle east is not a very screwed up place who creates more terrorists then any other but when I read some of your posts you feel that every single one of them is just waiting for a chance to strap bombs to their chest.<br />
<br />
It might have been different if you had stated that you felt that some or even most muslims where condoning the actions on 9/11 but you didn't do that did you? No you went directly to the &quot;all of them are evil and the islam only promotes hate and violence&quot;. Do you even understand why someone might take offence at such a statement? Its like saying that all people born in virginia are criminals because last night you saw some criminals from virginia on tv.<br />

&quot;Attacking innocent people is not courageous, it is stupid and will be punished on the day of judgement. It's not courageous to attack innocent children, women and civilians. It is courageous to protect freedom, it is courageous to defend oneself and not to attack&quot; - Sheikh Muhammad Sayyid al-Tantawi of al-Azhar, the highest institution in Sunni Islam<br />
<br />
“All Muslims ought to be united against all those who terrorize the innocents, and those who permit the killing of non-combatants without a justifiable reason. Islam has declared the spilling of blood and the destruction of property as absolute prohibitions until the Day of Judgment. ...  necessary to apprehend the true perpetrators of these crimes, as well as those who aid and abet them through incitement, financing or other support. They must be brought to justice in an impartial court of law and [punished] appropriately. ... [It is] a duty of Muslims to participate in this effort with all possible means.” - Shaykh Yusuf Qaradawi, Qatar; Tariq Bishri, Egypt; Muhammad S. Awwa, Egypt; Fahmi Huwaydi, Egypt; Haytham Khayyat, Syria; Shaykh Taha Jabir al-Alwani, U.S.<br />

“Any attack on innocent people is unlawful and contrary to shari'a (Islamic law). ... Muslims must safeguard the lives, honor and property of Christians and Jews. Attacking them contradicts shari'a.” - Shaykh Muhammad bin ‘Abdallah al-Sabil, member of the Council of Senior Religious Scholars, Saudi Arabia<br />
<br />
“The horrific terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, in the United States were perpetrated by cult of fanatics who had self-mutilated their ears and tongues, and could only communicate with perceived opponents through carnage and devastation.” - President Muhammad Khatami of Iran<br />
<br />
“The undersigned, leaders of Islamic movements, are horrified by the events of Tuesday 11 September 2001 in the United States which resulted in massive killing, destruction and attack on innocent lives. We express our deepest sympathies and sorrow. We condemn, in the strongest terms, the incidents, which are against all human and Islamic norms. This is grounded in the Noble Laws of Islam which forbid all forms of attacks on innocents. God Almighty says in the Holy Qur'an: 'No bearer of burdens can bear the burden of another' (Surah al-Isra 17:15).” - Mustafa Mashhur, General Guide, Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt; Qazi Hussain Ahmed, Ameer, Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan, Pakistan; Muti Rahman Nizami, Ameer, Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh, Bangladesh; Shaykh Ahmad Yassin, Founder, Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), Palestine; Rashid Ghannoushi, President, Nahda Renaissance Movement, Tunisia; Fazil Nour, President, PAS - Parti Islam SeMalaysia, Malaysia; and 40 other Muslim scholars and politicians<br />

Christianity, judeism and islam are what you make them, they are for better or worse puzzles that every person lays in slightly different pattern and creates his or her own image of. That is a strength that can give rise to immense compassion, great solidarity and a villingness to sacrifice oneself so that someone else may live a fuller life. It is also one of its most dangerous flaws since it can be twisted by traditions and the deeds of men to produce some of the most nightmarish parodies on the face of this planet, things that are beyond mere evil, things that taint everything that is good and just. Christianity has for the most part already suffered its baptism in blood and emerged weaker in organization but perhaps stronger in spirit and I can only hope that islam manages to do so as well. <br />
<br />
Bottom line is, you think Saddam has a side to hsi story, well, I am sure Hitler and Stalin did to, according to you, there was grey area, that, makes you a very, very sad person.<br />
<br />
Of course he has, we all have but that doesn't move me one iota from the fact that his elimination would most likely serve the world and the iraqi people a far sight better then him being alive ever could. Hitler committed evil deeds, stalin committed evil deeds, out governments have most likely committed evil deeds but does it really matter? Is hitler any less of a monster because churchill is less of a saint? I just don't want us to walk into another situation where we arrange the pieces to our liking because we are &quot;right&quot; and we know &quot;best&quot; and then only have it come back and bite us in the ass once again. <br />
<br />
You want to know what makes me sad? The socio political climate that is emerging, the way we are moving further away from peaceful solutions and more towards peace through war. I wish we would have climbed out of those trenches long ago but its an imperfect world and sometimes there is need for force but it hardly makes it any less of a failure each and every time. I can view the outcome of this war as needed and still feel that we failed deep down, that we should have been able to solve this in a better way. <br />
<br />
I know evil when I see it, and sometimes, things are perfectly, crystal clear. If a crack head shoots a pregnant woman, steals her wallet, I suppose to you there is a grey area? The poor crack addict was sad and needed a fix?<br />
<br />
You and I don't seem to agree on what a grey area is do we? I think of it as a scale where we are all placed along its axis. The us ends up more towards the &quot;good&quot; side of the scale but iraq ends up more towards &quot;evil&quot;. Other nations are spaced out along the axis as they fall, perhaps nk is slightly less evil then iraq so its a little to the right of them or perhaps france is slightly less good then the us so they end up to the left of the americans. Something bad is done and we move a little towards evil, something good and the reverse happens. It is neutral and we gravitate toward sides without really becoming either<br />
<br />
You view things as two points, there is nothing except those points. One is good and one is evil, there is no middle ground, no moderates. You are either one or the other and the positions become polarized by the most extreme views of either sphere.<br />
<br />
I don't really see how your little junkie example translates into this debate, I haven't argued that saddam is any less of a monster just that the coalition might be motivated by less the pure goodness. But since you tossed it out here I might as well give you an answer. Of course we give him a fair trial with the best possible defense and when he is found guilty we give him a nice warm cell, a hot meal and some new clothes. Then we shoot him in the back of the head the next morning unless there happen to be a questionable situation (but this is in theory and you never added such as stipulation). No billing the family for the bullet though, thats so barbaric.<br />
<br />
you hide behind bull**** fancy posts trying to promote equality between terrorists and US citizens, Saddam Hussein and Bush.<br />
<br />
Well I'm sorry if my writing style offends you, I'll try to use shorter paragraphs and perhaps swear more in the future. I want to see equality between americans and [I]arabs but then you view every arab as a terrorist right? <br />
<br />
If you never read anything else I write then I ask you to read this. Do not misunderstand me in this, terrorists are nothing more then cockroaches with fewer legs, they are the filth of humanity just like all the other extremist movements who like to spread their own personal brand of things &quot;right and true&quot; and then try to force it onto others. Unfortunately they are also very hard to kill off, that is why it is imperative that we remove the conflicts that spawn them. Do never presume that my somewhat soft attitude towards the average moderate arab will in any way stop me from corking up that big bottle of champagne when they parade bin ladens head around on a pike.<br />
<br />
Oh, and up untill now you friggin dipstick, if France launched a war against a terrorist nation, think the US would thwart them? Think 33% of americans would be rooting for the terrorists?<br />
<br />
I fully expect 33% of the us to answer a question about a french invasion of algeria in order to wipe out terrorists to be answered by &quot;Algeria? Yeah I know that place, its near brazil right??&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">but you really need to define what you think is right or wrong.<br />
<br />
It is almost impossible for me to explain what I feel is &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; because the assigning of those terms is purely situational.  If I had to take a stab at it tho, I would say I view something as &quot;right&quot; if it agrees with my set of personal morals, and &quot;wrong&quot; if it does not.<br />
If you want an example I would say that I feel Saddam is in the wrong (as I stated in an earlier post when I said that I am all for the unseating of him from power), because I think how he conducts himself as a leader is morally bad.  However, I feel Pres. Bush is in the right because I feel his wishes for wanting to give the Iraqi people a better way of life (if that is indeed his true intention) is morally good.  Then agian, I can't get inside either of these men's heads, so I can only judge them on their words and actions.  <br />
<br />

<br />
I'll quote Weyalan here when he said:  &quot;To say being against the war must mean you are pro Hussein is so ridiculous and illogical, the average 7 year old could pick the logic holes in it.&quot; <br />
I am anti-death penalty, but that does not mean I support murder and the committing of capital crimes.  I am anti-abortion, but that does not mean I support the attacks on abortion clinics and their staffs.  I have no religion, but that does not mean I am anti-religious.<br />
<br />
If you are looking for black and white answers, I'm sorry, I have none to give you.  I just don't see the world that way.<br />
I can assure you that I am in no way pro-Saddam/terrorist.  I fully support those who have and continue to fight and die for our country.  But I am not a blind patriot.  If something is happening in America that I do not agree with I will question and analyze it for myself and not have some politician make up my mind for me.<br />
<br />
I'll conclude this with a quote from Tom Cruise's character (Ron Kovic, who was a Vietnam vet turned anti-war activist) in the movie &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot;:  &quot;People say that if you don't love America, then get the hell out. Well, I love America.&quot;<br />

All we are really arguing about here is what is the best way to go about getting rif of him and his regime.<br />
<br />
By the same token, nobody here is supporting terrorists. Again, we are arguing about what are the best methods to eradicate terrorism.<br />

<br />
Really.<br />
<br />
This war is the only hope that the Iraqi people have of getting rid of Saddam Hussein and his family dynasty.  If you are against this war then - no matter what you might wish to believe - you are for letting him and his clan remain in power.  That puts you very firmly on his side.  If the average 7 year old could pick the logic holes in this then why can't you: this point has been made before.<br />
<br />
OK, I'll say it again in slightly different words, just in case you are having difficulty understanding.  Imagine you see an old lady being mugged, and you see another passerby draw a gun and take aim at the muggers.  Now you don't believe in guns and you don't believe in mugging either.  But you take the gun away from the man (because killing is wrong), and the muggers do their thing and run off.  You may say that you aren't on the side of the muggers, but what difference does that make - you just helped them.</div></div><hr />

 I simply do not understand any grea areas. I think, we , the US, should make a stand and confront evil wherever it is. World population is increasing exponentially, it is either stop evil now, or try later when there is more of them.<br />
<br />
I have never seen any muslims take a stand and defend the US, nor defend anything but themsleves. I would love it if some cleric somewhere would do a complete heal on the muslim faith, but at this point, if I see an arab, I walk on the other side of the street, he probably wants to kill me.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u102"><b>Jenoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p102">Of course the world should confront evil when it appears so that we can create a better future but we should never stop questioning ourselves about our motives and methods. It is one of the fundamental aspects that can save us from becoming totalitarian states such as the old ussr. As long as our leaders must justify what they do and why they do it we, the people, can make sure that our will is served. There will always be victories for humanity such as in the balkans or tragedies such as rwanda but I feel we may have turned a page in history and moved slightly away from the cold war where the maintaining the status quo was paramount. <br />
<br />
I believe in the intervension in iraq even though I question some of the motives of the american administration and wish they had been slightly more diplomatic. The loss of human life is always tragic even though sometimes the few need to be sacrified for the many to survive.

<br />
Couldn't agree more but we need a new kind of un for that, one without the ability to veto. The world made the un into a weak political entity during the cold war, vetoing power made sure everyone could always protect their own interests and that is coming back to bite us in the ass. Clinton didn't need support in the un because he wasn't working in opposition to a quite as many of other governments. <br />
<br />
When I wish they had been more diplomatic it is very much like wishing that it rained donuts, pretty darn far fetched but still something you can wish for. A un sanctioned operation, undersigned by the arab nations would have helped counteract a lot of the negative fallout from the war against iraq but it is still a pipe dream.

You seriously believe that Islam is the only religion that preaches hate and death? Have you been to Northern Ireland in the last 50 years? How many people, men, women and children have been murdered? maimed? shot in the kneecaps? This is a Christian War. A war between two warring factions - Protestant Christians and Catholic Christians, but Christians nevertheless.<br />
<br />
Now I know that the actions of the IRA, UDA, etc are not representative of the broader christian community, but showing christians not fighting, not doing anything extraordinary, just living normal lives isn't exactly great TV. Sameis true of Muslims - you get to see all the dickwads and fanatics, you don't get to see the silent majority that just want to be left alone to live normal lives.</div></div><hr />

Very good job dredging up some quates and some picks.  Just as not all Christians are good, not all Muslims are bad.  No population is monolithic and most people just kind of folow along without thinking.  The photoes from Iran show only a few score people, and not crowds filling the streets.<br />
<br />
Are all Muslmins evil?<br />
Are all Christians good?<br />
<br />
If we examine the impact of the two religions on the societies where they are prevalent,  clearly I would much rather live in a nation that was largly Christian then one that was largly Muslim.  The options must be even more clear for a women consider the widespread and substantial opreshion of the female in Islamic nations.   Islam itself is a danger in the world and an evil because the it's practice have led to widespread opreshion to the poeple living under it.  This in no way implies that each individual Muslim is evil or that even the majority of them are.  Not all of Hitler's soldiers where evil, but the end results of there collective actions was of such horid praportion as to receive univeral condemnation.  Comunism is also an Evil in this world but most poeple that live in comunist nations are not evil.<br />
<br />
Consider that Christianity has done horible things as well.  Consider the 3rd crusade and the Inqusitions.  Religions change and moderate over time and perhaps Islam will do the same.  At this very moment,  Islam is as dangerous and intolerant and vicious as Christianity ever was.<br />
<br />
I can remember how angy I was after the attack on the USS Cole that killed a number of our Sailors.  Then Pres Clinton discribed the two Muslim terrorists as cowards and then he did not a dam thing about it.  The truth is that those men where not cowards.  They where enormously motivated and sacrificed there lives in order to target a US war ship that could blow them out of the water with ease.  To dismiss them as cowards is very stupid and leads to significantly nderestimating the willingness of our foe to do harm to our nation. The attack on the Cole was a frigteningly powerfull demonstration of resolve that should not have been ignored.  That resolve was again demonstraited on 9.11.1 and continues to be demonstraited by the suiside bombers that attack Isreal.<br />
<br />
People form social groups. It is just part of being human like wolfs forming packs or ants forming colonies.  As long as man has existed their have been conflicts between the groups that we form.  At times this is as benign as the behavior exhibited by fans of oposing sports teams and at other times it is as bad as one race trying to exterminate another.  It is normaly easy to determine who is a member of such a group &quot;us&quot; and who is not &quot;them&quot;.  It is very natural for people to see things in terms black and white with no room for the gray. I am a member of a large number of diffent groups for different purposes but in this case I am a member of the people of the Untied States of America and on 9.11.1 we went to war because of a horid attacked.  The group that attacked us wher Islamic terrorst exhibiting religous zeal and enourmous dedication.  We asked France to become part of the &quot;us&quot; but they refused.  This was particuraly painfull because in he past the US and a lot of other people became an &quot;us&quot; with France to overthow a &quot;them&quot; that was Germany / Italy / Japan.<br />
<br />
Mill clearly demonstatrats the kind of resentment the &quot;us&quot; can feel for the &quot;them&quot; and view things a black and white.  The them is simply all those that are not part of his group.  Pleae note how much respect he gives to the British and how much contempt he feels for the French. I also feel the same.<br />
<br />
So who are we fighting?<br />
<br />
Weyalan would identify the &quot;them&quot; as only those in Al'Quida or those that have given them direct support like that Talaban.  This position is quite defensible if you maintain that it is only moral to be reactive in your defense.  Basicly, Weyalen would maintain that it is not moral to attack first.  I personaly think that in light of the events of 9.11.1 and in consideration of the effects of weapons of mass distruction, that this position is no longer defensible.  The consequnses of Weyalan's position could easily be the loss of a major US city and all the people living in it.<br />
<br />
My &quot;them&quot; is admitadly vague.  It includes all who would act in the maner of  those on 9.11.1 and all that would supply them with weapons, training, or safty.  It as includes all those that would view themselves as members of the group we are fighting.  Recent poles show that as much as 95% of some Muslim national populations (Pakistan) hate the US.  This is the feed stock of terorism and are part of the &quot;them&quot;.<br />
<br />
I view the Islam faith as a direct threat to the United States and our freedoms not because I hate Islam and am a bigot but because they hate us.  Over and over again poeple have stated that this is not a religous war and from our perspective they are corect.  It is very stupid to ignore that the other side does not hold the same values of religios tolerance that we hold and that they do consider this conflict to be <br />
a relgions war.<br />
<br />
Unlike Millman,  I don't think we should fight every evil that exists in the world.  I personaly feel that our foreign policy should undergo a radical shift and we should become much more neutral in our dealings with other nations.  Switzerland might be a good starting model.  With out a doubt we should not be supporting any Government that oppresses it's own people.  We should tell the King in SA to shove off and we should not be dealing with the military dictator of Pakistan.  We sure as hell should not get involved in places like Sumalia or Bosnia where we have no nation interests.<br />
<br />
However;  every single time we are attacked or suffer under a significant threat like that form Iraq,  we should bring out the big stick and hit them as hard as we can.<br />
<br />
Lot's of people try to justify this war on Iraq as a liberation of the it's people but I reject that argument. Pres. Bush stated his reasons very clearly when he said that we are fighting in Iraq with our Soldiers so that we will not have to fight in our cities with our firemen and police.  The fact that some significatant ethnic groups in Iraq will view the US as a liberator is a diserable consequence of the war but not a reason saficient to justify it's conduct.  We, and our friends, are in Iraq to remove Iraq as a threat to the our nation.  It might make a bunch of liberal tree-hugers happy to think we are doing this out of some altrustic cause but the only reason I nead is to protect those same tree-hugers as they march in protest in the streats of our cities.<br />
<br />
The would is becoming a very dangerous place with more and more countries having nuclear weapons  (Pakistan scares the hell out of me) and people who are willing to use them.  This situation is not going to impove.  Consider North Korea and both it's nuclear weapons program and it's willingness to sell weapoins to any nation with a few bucks.  Are we willing to loose a number of Cities to do somthing about NK?<br />
<br />
The world is changing and the role of America must also change or we will simly start to have a crop of mushrooms growing along the East or West coast.<br />
<br />
The only hope I see for the long run is economic development.  Half the woulds population lives below the poverty level of $1 per person per day and this is after significant gains in the 90s.  Fat comfortable poeple don't like to go fight but poor starving people have nothing to lose.  The cure is a century of Capatilism.<br />
<br />
In that time between now and utopia,  the US should vigorously and proactively destroy the capability of our enemies to cunduct operations against our people.<br />
<br />
France is a nation of cowards and when we are done with Iraq we should extract a pound of flesh in revenge for their recent behavior.  Perhaps we should reclaim our honered dead and bring them home, or just compleatly exclude them from any part in post war Iraq.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u110"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p110">Something to consider:<br />
<br />
Islam now is as old as Christianity was when it was in its heyday of killing folks for not believing.  Perhaps we have another 800 years to go before they grow up.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u111"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p111">Radag,<br />
<br />
Your last post was made me happy, not that my happiness should be of any importance to you, per se.  By showing less broad generalizing and blanket statements than previous posts, you demonstrate that you are not merely jingo-ising as is all too often the case. I seriously believe that we are all basically seeking the same end result, and that you, Mill, Jenoe and I are not so far apart ideologically as might be concluded from first appearances.<br />
<br />
The world would be a dull place if we all agreed on everything, and debate is healthy if only because it forces us to re-examine our own beliefs in the light of the evidence presented to us. Our beliefs may not change as a result of this process, but at least we get to test them.<br />
<br />
You suggest that I am essentially reactive in my ideas of defense. You are basically correct, but this position is not particularly a moral stance, but a pragmatic stance. Too often, in my opinion, &quot;proactive defense&quot; has come back to haunt us. Let me give some examples:<br />
<br />
We installed Noreiega in Panama as a proactive defense against the perceived rise of communism in Central America. We anded up having to go in with significant military force to remove Noriega and his regime, after he turned in a megalomaniac and brutal dictator.<br />
<br />
We were proactive in our support, funding and supplying of arms to Saddam Hussein when the perceived threat in the Middle East was the Ayatollah and his Fundamentalist Islamic regime in Iran and we wanted someone to oppose them. Now we have to go in there and clean up a mess that if not entirely of our own making, for which we must take some responsibility.<br />
<br />
We were proactive in arming, training and funding the Afghanistan Mujahadeen when we percieved the soviet support of the government in Afghanistan as a threat. These same Mujahadden were the Taliban that we had to fight when we invaded Afghanistan. And, quite frankly, I remain unconvinced that the regime that is in place in Kabul right now is significantly better then the one we deposed…we may well be back there again, down the track<br />
<br />
The above are just 3 example of where “proactive defense” has come back and bitten us on the ass. There can only be one outcome in the current war in Iraq; and that is victory for the USA and her allies. Nevertheless, the problem, in my view, is not going to be winning the war, but what is going to happen after the war. Winning a war, for the US, at least, is relatively easy – creating a workable peace that can withstand the eventual withdrawal of the peacekeepers; that’s the hard part. One only has to look at the former Yugoslavia today, to realise that. That is not to say that it is impossible, just more difficult than the military phase. <br />
<br />
Do not, however, get the idea that I am entirely opposed to proactive military intervention. You guys probably didn’t get to hear too much about Timor, specifically East Timor. The UN went in there (well, essentially, Australian forces and a few New Zealanders) and removed the guerrillas that were terrorising the local population. The forces stayed and supervised the interim government and the subsequent democratic elections and hand over of power. Now, apart from a small token force, the peacekeepers have withdrawn, and all seems to be going well. I supported that action completely.<br />
<br />
So, Radag, we are not so far from each other as you might expect idealogically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u112"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p112">Weyalan: I see you have chosen to ignore my last post.  Do we take it that you now concede that its not really possible to help someone in a perfectly neutral sort of way?  Or are you still out looking for that 7yr old child?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u113"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p113">I missed this one earlier, but the mistake in Rodahn's logic actually highlights my point.<br />
<br />
I'll quote Weyalan here when he said:  &quot;To say being against the war must mean you are pro Hussein is so ridiculous and illogical, the average 7 year old could pick the logic holes in it.&quot; <br />
I am anti-death penalty, but that does not mean I support murder and the committing of capital crimes<br />
<br />
This analogy is incorrect.  However, if you were to say that the police had no right to stop a murderer, or imprison him, I'd say you were on the murderer's side, whatever you claims you make about your attitude to murder itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u114"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p114">Really.<br />
<br />
This war is the only hope that the Iraqi people have of getting rid of Saddam Hussein and his family dynasty.  If you are against this war then - no matter what you might wish to believe - you are for letting him and his clan remain in power.  That puts you very firmly on his side.  If the average 7 year old could pick the logic holes in this then why can't you: this point has been made before.<br />
<br />
OK, I'll say it again in slightly different words, just in case you are having difficulty understanding.  Imagine you see an old lady being mugged, and you see another passerby draw a gun and take aim at the muggers.  Now you don't believe in guns and you don't believe in mugging either.  But you take the gun away from the man (because killing is wrong), and the muggers do their thing and run off.  You may say that you aren't on the side of the muggers, but what difference does that make - you just helped them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Crusty,<br />
<br />
The above post is the post you say I ignore. I read it, I considered it, but I did not respond because, quite frankly (and by yourown admission), you are not saying anything new - just resaying what you have said before.<br />
<br />
Basically, you and I part ways in the first line of your post - You maintain that war is the only way of getting rid of Hussein. I mentioned before two plausible ways of getting rid of him that do not require three hundred thousand of your countrymen to put themselves in harm's way. Now I am not here to argue the relative merits of covert ops or nukes agains massive land assault - I am sufficiently ill informed to not presume that I know better than the guys in charge - nevertheless, those 2 options do serve to emphasize my point that it is not as simple as &quot;this war&quot; or &quot;support Saddam&quot;.<br />
<br />
So, comdemn me as a Saddam helper if you will...that is up to you. Let me just reiterate that i am anti-Saddam, but I do not agree that the war is the only option. Perhaps we should leave it at that, because, frankly, I think we are going to have to agree to disagree - you have laid out your stall, and I have laid out mine. I respect you no less for our disagreement.</div></div><hr />

Weyalan, <br />
<br />
respectfully, war is the only option at this point, what happens if Saddam would go in to exile for instance? Think he would really lose power? Think his secret police would just go away and leave the iraqis alone? Hell no.<br />
<br />
No way special ops could ever take out saddam, his sons, his cabinet, his secret police orginization, his special republican guard. All really, really bad men.<br />
<br />
Once again though, how many 9/11's is it going to take for the world to wake up? France is obviously safe, maybe they are the smart ones,  siding with a murdering, raping, evil dictator so they don't get bombed.<br />
<br />
France will get whats coming to them, sooner or later. Hell, my two brothers and I are thinking about traveling to UK, taking that chunnel thing and going to France(not spending any money in there) and walking in to bars with big american flags on us, and then clearing out whole bars full of pussies, wonder how many we take out before we create an international incident? Hmmm. Bet we could take out 3 or 4 bars before the French would have to call in the military, and even then prolly take out an armored division of them retards, hell we might even be able to occupy Paris.

We supported the shah in iran who did some very abusive things to his own people, we support the the ruling elite in saudi arabia who are not exactly men of the people. The west gets a black eye in the arab world for things we have done in the past and because the only time we end up in that region is when we are waging war or buying oil. That are some of the reasons why we get to play the part of the bad men, some of them are true and some of them are not.<br />
<br />
Quite a few prominent figures in the arab world stated that the attacks on 9/11 where acts of cowardice/barbarism and so on. They viewed those attacks as acts of terrorism but not those carried out by hamas or islamic jihad in israel which they view as war using non conventional means. In a way its very much like how we view iraqi soldiers using human shields as repulsive acts but not the israeli use of tanks against unarmed civilians. Nice world we live in right?<br />

Arabs chanting &quot;death to the us&quot; is good tv, it gives higher ratings then a few hours of tv from a bazaar in amman.

You will note that the last time southern iraq tried to stand up to saddam the alliance sold them out. I dont know about you but the idea of fighting choppers and tanks using small arms is not something I view as anything other then suicide. Perhaps they learned their lesson, once burned, twice shy you know. As far as I know the alliance even denied the uprising the use of captured iraqi material. Saddam is too powerful to be overthrown by those he oppress, he has made sure of that after the last war.<br />
<br />
You know why I fear the dprk much more then iraq? Beacuse those people have nukes, they most likely have other types of wmds as well and they need cold hard cash. They would most likely sell an ballistic missile to the peta if they where given enough cash and thought they could get away with it. We cannot strongarm them in the same way as we can with iraq and while their leadership are not religious fanatics I dont want to be around when we try to find out which drop makes the cup flow over. I have a little problem picturing saddam (being as paranoid as he is) handing over wmds to bin laden who is his ideological enemy but the dprk? They would most likely giftwarp the thing if offered enough money.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u122"><b>Jenoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p122">During the early years slightly before saddam took total control of iraq the country was one of the countries in the arab world with the highest standard of living. People arent all that interrested in armed revolt against a goverment that is doing ok. <br />
<br />
The fundamentalist revolution in iran made saddam into a needed figure for the west and the soviets because if it was one thing they feared it was for the rest of the arab world to fall to the same thing that took iran. Any uprising against saddam would have been crushed most likely with the blessing of the west because the stakes where too high. Saddam was and is a brutal dictator but then he was our brutal dictator who was used to keep the region from imploding. <br />
<br />
One of the simplest and compelling reasons for the invasion of iraq now is that the us is cleaning up the mess they made, no more no less.<br />
<br />
The arabs dislike israel because they view them as invaders who have displaced the people who lived there and can you really say that they are wrong? The whole creation of israel was handled with all the finess of a smash and grab. I would however have had more sympathy for the arab cause if they hadnt started several wars against israel (and lost badly). The conflict between israel and the palestinians have moved beyond who is wrong and who is right, it is now just a vicious circle of neverending violence where civilians on both sides draw the shortest straw.<br />

Too bad they were involved in a war of national survival in less than two years after Saddam entered the scene (a war he started, BTW).  Kind of puts you in a tough position to overthrow the very government that is protecting you from the somewhat psychotic, human wave employing, neighbors to the east.<br />
Now it is too late, they need help to do it, which like it or not, we are giving them.<br />
No kidding - Saddam's utter &quot;thugification&quot; of that country is beyond the ability of nearly all the rest of the world to stop - except by the US (using the &quot;Can you hear me now?&quot; approach) or the French (If we treat him extra-special nice, he will eventually become a nice man :D ).<br />
If they dared to use a nuke, the world would turn on them, if they sold one, I seriously doubt a terrorist orginazation would have the means to use it in any effective way. <br />
Once possessed, nukes are still fairly easy to move around and set off.  It will be a few years before we have a reliable, accurate means of following the covert movement of WMD.<br />

Not entirely.  The Coptics and many other christian sects do just fine in Jordan, used to do OK in Lebanon (when it used to be a country), and do ok in Egypt.  Even Iraq allows open christian worship.  But like any disagreement, there are two sides to the story, and if either (or both) sides of a dispute are represented by extremists, there's no ready solution - just compromise.  In the case of Israel, both sides are represented by extremists.<br />
They are the reason Saddam is not a nuclear power right now, they and they alone defied the French plan to equip Saddam with nukes.<br />
Well . . . they absolutely did do the bombing - and one HELL of a job they did too, but they had some pretty nice jets to fly, and some superb, &quot;fresh,&quot; pictures to target from. ;)<br />
I am aware of some of the issues with isreal by Palestine specifically, but they need to work it out themselves.<br />
I think Israel is pretty well convinced they've &quot;worked it out&quot; already - it's just a large portion of the rest of the world that takes issue with that viewpoint. :)<br />

 Unfortunately, I think Isreal is being too hard headed here. I respect em, but would it really kill em to seal their borders, let the palestinians form their own state? I don't know much about it, but the occupied lands, what is it, gaza and stuff, they really need em?<br />
<br />
I am an isreal idiot when it comes to knowing stuff about them.<br />
<br />
If it is so easy, why hasnt anyone used a nuke in an attack since 1945? Russia alone must be swimming in extra nukes, with a weak government to police them, huge black market.<br />
<br />
We all watched True Lies, but for some reason, i do not think it is as easy to aquire nukes as the crimson jihad did.<br />

One of the good things that came out of hiroshima and nagasaki was the cold hard realization (well for sane people anyway) that nukes where just to terrible to unleash. That knowledge has kept us safe for quite some time. Even most terrorist movements would not touch the things due to the political and military repercussions that would follow. <br />
<br />
Israel is a strange place, their national sport is paranoia but perhaps that is to be expected when you face extermination once in a while. The israeli want defendable borders and the palestinans want one state (not a lot of pieces all over the map) and then we have the extremists on both sides that settle for nothing less then the complete and utter annihilation of the other side.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u126"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p126">Droping the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was the right thing to do when it was done and if similar circumstances arise It would be more then sane to do the same thing.<br />
<br />
What is so dam strange is at the same time we also staged a massive fire bomb raid on Tokio that killed more people in one night then either of the atomic arms we droped on Japan.  Similar efforts taken on some German target cities like Dresden and also resulted in massive loss of civian life.  All of these activities where required and nesisary to defeat those Nations in WWII and if similar situation arise in the future, the we should not hesitate to repeated our methods.<br />
<br />
Why is it sane to kill 90k people with a fire bombing raid and insane to kill 70k with an atomic weapon?<br />
<br />
WWII was a war of attrition with the economic resourses of all countries involved where compleatly oriented towards the conduct of the war.  In such a war their are no inocent civilians.  On a weekly basis the USSR killed some of it's own factory workers that did not fulfill productoin quatas. In the US the war had a huge impact on domestic industry.  Just try and find a car built during WWII or anthing else for that matter.  Have a little look at the steel peny that was minted in order to save the coper.  We lost some 50k men taking Okinawa and killed about 250k Japs in the process.  Truman did exactly the right thing when he gave the camand to drop the bombs after Trinity was detonated.  American losses might have toped 1 million and several times that for Japan if those men on the Anola Gay and Box Cars had not done the job.<br />
<br />
The formation of Isreal was extreamly heavy handed.  How can you form a country of imagrants in a land that is inhabated without generating enourmous resentment?<br />
<br />
Isreal exists and it is going to stay.  It is time that the Palastinieans are crushed and ground into the dust.  This constant and continual low grade war that goes on between Isreal and the displaced Palastinain people will come to an end when the Palastinians no longer have the will to fight.  If Isreal want peace, it must first defeat it's enemy and then dictate a peace.<br />
<br />
This situation is not much differeant then the problems the US had with Native American populations in the 19th century even if the size of the lands involved is much smaller.  The solution to the problem is the same.  In the end, a lot of liberals in Isreal will pine about how unjustly they treated the Palastinians just as a lot of liberals in America cry for our Indians, but in both cases the violance will have stoped.  In no way do I think this is a nice thing or kind or even fair.  The Native Americans got shafted bad and so have the Palastinians, but no peace will be acheived untill one or the other of the groups wins.</div></div><hr />

Had those bombs never been deployed then we would quite possibly not have seen the kind of uneasy peace (and the proxy wars) that came from both sides of the cold war having them and both sides knowing the consequences of their use. Tests are all well and good but nothing really sobers people up like having a few thousand humans turned into pollution in a second or two.<br />

How would you prefer the israeli grind the palestinian into dust by the way? Concentration camps? Showers filled with zyklon b? Perhaps they can even borrow the &quot;arbeit macht frei&quot; sign, seeing that on israeli soil would really make things come full circle.</div></div><hr />

Make no mistake, kim jong ill pumps out some SERIOUS anti-US propaganda. (Americans eat babies is my favorite). Of course, while he's maintaining his anti-US front, we're feeding his country and providing oil so they can stay warm.<br />
<br />
One reason Bush won't negotiate with N. Korea is - what's the point? We already know they re-started their nuclear weapons program in violation of that horrid 1994 treaty (Clinton you schmuck).  So what - we give MORE concessions so they do what THEY'RE ALREADY SUPPOSED TO BE DOING?<br />
<br />
I don't think so.<br />
<br />
Make no mistake. North Korea is rapidly acquiring the ability to hit Hawaii, Alaska and the West coast of the US with his TPD2 (tae-po-Dong 2) missle system.<br />
<br />
At that point we HAVE to smoke his weapons programs. His TPD2 isn't spread out all over the place ala our ICBM's. It's still too much in its infantile stage - NOW.  6 months from now...I dunno.<br />

As an aside, theh S Korean president (Roh) ran on an anti-American campaign. (Much like Shroeder of Germany).  Well now that the Pentagon agrees (Along with the PACOM (Pacific Command) Commander)) that S.

More than once. The end result? A lot of dead arabs. Israel with as much land mass as it wants to acquire.<br />
<br />
Make no mistake - the United States keeps a strong grip on Israel. Should Saddam lob a chem round into Tel Aviv we WON'T be able to stop their retaliation. And retaliate they will.<br />
<br />
The problems that plagues the Arab armies in 1967 continue to haunt them to this day. Or as someone much wiser than me said &quot;A SFC (E-7) in the US Army has as much authority as a Colonel in the Egyptian Army.&quot;<br />
<br />
Numbers don't mean squat. The Israeli's are outnumbered and outgunned, although their (Israel's) weaponry is superior. The Arab world (As they are now and as they did in 1967) would be proclaiming victory after victory, while Israel was riding the road to Damascus.<br />
<br />
Make no mistake either - the first time some delusional religious despot or military dictator (Israel does have a form of representational government complete with real elections) lobbed a chem round from say Iran, - Tehran would turn to glass.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I think Jordan and Saudi Arabia would sit this out. Oh they may move forces around to appease the &quot;arab street&quot; in their country, but pragmatism &gt; blind hatred and misguided, antiquated ideology.<br />
<br />
Finally, they do HATE Israel. With a passion. Whether it's their reading of the Koran through misogynistic glasses or a simple mob mentality - they HATE Israel.  And you know what?<br />
<br />
They can't do a damned thing about it.  Israel's daily existence is testimony to how far the muslim culture and the arab world has sunk. Their WEAKNESS and IMPOTENCE is BROADCAST daily by every breath taken by every Israeli.<br />

The &quot;marine letter&quot; is so fake.  There are a number of versions of this floating around the internet.<br />
<br />
First, Camp Bonsteel is in Kosovo, not Bosnia.  As a Marine officer, I would think she would know what country she is in.<br />
<br />
Second, TF MNBE is an ARMY operation, not a Marine one.<br />
<br />
Third, I doubt seriously that she would use her full name and rank in sending a letter to her father.  <br />

The overwhelming majority of Senior Marine Oficers I have met are the class acts, amazingly smart and completely tactful.  This boor would not have lasted long enough in the Corps to make it to Lieutenant Colonel.<br />

Having flown with or against members of all of the armed forces over there (either as a US Aggressor in Red Flag or during my 2 year stint living in the Middle East training the Saudi, Jordanian, Bahraini, and . . . drum roll . . .

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u134"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p134">Krup your experiences do not dovetail with other reports on Arab v Israel dogfighting or US v Iraq in GW1.  Granted in both instances one side had overwhelming supremacy, but in the US example the pilots reported that the Iraqis could barely FLY the plane much less maneuver. (And I may be thinking Israel v Egypt in 67, as in GW1 a lot of Iraq's AF flew to Iran (Who promptly kept the planes - LAUGH))<br />
<br />
Unless Janes, and all other news sources have it completely wrong, the Israeli pilots were far superior to their Arab counterparts. <br />
<br />
(I am discounting the possibility you suck :) I am assuming that the baseline US pilot (Air Force or Navy or Army Aviation) is far superior to 95% of pilots in the Middle East))</div></div><hr />

<br />
Israel flew no air-to-air in 1967 since the entire Egyptian air force blew up on the ground (certainly speaks volumes about their opposing strategies though! ;) ).<br />
<br />
In 1973, Egypt pretty much avoided the Israeli Air Force.  They had the luxury since Israel wiped out a large chunk of their own combat aircraft fleet running it into the Egyptian's Russian SAMs repeatedly.  Outcome of the war changed rapidly when the US bailed them out in the form of a whole bunch of replacement aircraft (and the new SA-6 defeating jammers) over in a 4 day period of time.<br />
<br />
In Bekaa, Israeli flown, US built circa 1980 F-15s wiped out any Russian built, circa 1965 MiGs.  Woo hooo! Maybe someday you'll hear first hand (like I did) how the first Israeli kill with the F-15 was with a gun since the F-15 4-ship wasted several &quot;BVR&quot; Sparrow missiles by launching them out of range!!!  Very impressive - not.  The gun camera film, conversely, is especially impressive though, as the kill was a very high off-boresight shot.  The pilot credited with the kill was also reprimanded for &quot;risking&quot; his shiny new F-15 to get that kill. :)<br />
<br />
By 1985, Israel and Egypt are both flying F-16s (Egypt is a &quot;friend&quot; of Israel by this time) - from a Red Flag perspective, in air-to-air vs my circa 1970 F-5E, they were both average, and no where near as good as a similarly equipped USAF squadron.  I also flew against Brit, German, French, Dutch, and Belgian fighters in the late 80s in Red and Maple Flags and found them all to be more skilled, disciplined, and professional than either the Israeli or Egyptian pilots.  Neither were bad - just average - and about equal to each other (given their similar technology).<br />
<br />
I've seen a similar level of mediocrity in the other Middle Eastern forces I've flown with.  Not terrible like one might assume, and comparable to a similarly equipped Israeli.  However, one item of note:  The Israelis really have the Arab air forces completely psyched out - and I think they would quake in their boots if they found out the blip on their scopes was an Israeli pilot! :D<br />
<br />
And Janes has the numbers right - in the one Israeli &quot;war&quot; with real air-to-air in it (Bekaa) the Israeli's handed it to the Syrians (I've never had the &quot;honor&quot; ;) ).  And since the kill ratio was infinite (87 to 0) it's hard to compare it with the US's similary &quot;infinite&quot; 39 to 0 in the 1991 Gulf War (although there may have been an F-18 air-to-air loss, but it's still unproven).<br />

What I think isreal should do to the Palastinians is round them all up and forcably move them to a very large &quot;reservation&quot; where they can be confined behind barbed wire and excluded from participation in Isreal society untill such a time as they have been &quot;educated&quot; to the point that they will no longer have the will to fight back.<br />
<br />
Some hundred years hence the liberals of Isreal can feel guilty for what they have done in the past but reguardless the problem will be solved and the volance will have ended.<br />
<br />
I am not recomending that the Isrealies build death camps and kill all the Palastinians.  I would however suport almost any tactice short of genocide to solve this problem of an inbeded population of displaced Palastinians that have no goal other then the compleate destructoin of Isreal as a nation state.  I certainly understand that the Palastinains have some rational justification for the way they feal but at some point that just does not matter.  In the end I think Isreal should form a seperate Palastinian state but for peace to be acheived they must first defeate the Palastinians and break their will to fight.  A Palostinian state should be dictated by Isreal, not diplomaticly nagotiated.</div></div><hr />

There is a sect that deliberately misinterprets the message of the Islamic religious doctrine in order to gain political power.  These so-called clerics poison the minds of their exclusively male followers to believe that they will be rewarded in heaven for committing atrocities on earth in the name of God.  As I understand it from the Bible, God isn't really all that wild about suicide, but these clerics brain-wash their 'troops' to believe that not only is suicide bombing women and children a good thing, but that God will smile on them.  These leaders are the people we are fighting against in the war on terror.<br />
<br />
There was a similiar belief in Christianity in the middle ages.  &quot;Convert or die&quot;, the Inquisition, and the Crusades are historic examples of this philosophy.  Christians of today are generally less militaristic. <br />
<br />
One thing to think about for the US haters.  Given that Iran and Iraq fought a decade long war to a stalemate not that long ago, the US would have similiar success if we rolled into Tehran.  We could have conquered Iran or Iraq long ago, and made them States.  Instead, we invaded because we had evidence of chemical/biological weapons and a link to terrorists before we went into Iraq.  If our purpose in Iraq was conquest - we'd have the US flag flying over every building and we'd be voting on statehood today, instead of sending in food, medicine, and people to find and destroy chemical and biological stockpiles.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u156"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p156">Isn't condemning Frace for selling stuff to Iraq just a wee tad hypocritical? The USA has not been averse to horse trading with the Iraqis - weapons being the best seller. Australia (one of the &quot;Alliance of the willing&quot; has been selling grain to the Iraqis for Years. The British trade with Iraq.<br />
<br />
You condemn the French for &quot;protecting their own intersts&quot; <br />
<br />
You seem to have missed the point - trade (in agreed items) was allowed with Iraq, and many countries did so.  Yes the USA traded with them, yes the UK traded with them.  I do not condemn anyone for having traded with them.  But which of all these countries decided to try to help keep the Iraqi regime in power?<br />
<br />
Now you might be stupid enough to say that the French did this out of some misplaced sense of altruism.  But that's the same French government that a few years ago murdered a peace activist in the pacific (the French agent responsible was caught and convicted so don't argue that one, please).  Its the same French government that still today uses mercenaries to hold onto the remnants of its old colonial possessions.<br />
<br />
It is not a coincidence that the government that has done the most to help Saddam Hussein - by trying to stop the war - is also the government that had the closest links to that government, whose industry made the biggest profit out of it.<br />
<br />
You might also want to reflect on the French governments help to the Milosovic regime.  The Clinton administration delayed bombing the Serbs because they were convinced by the French (and sadly also by the British) that bombing would simply harden the Serb's attitude.  Well eventually things got so bad that this advice was disregarded: the Serbs decided they didn't like being bombed and the process started that eventually lead to Milosovic's trial in the Hague.<br />
<br />
I suppose there is at least consistency in French foreign policy: they back the bad guys without compunction.</div></div><hr />

Please dont take the following as support of Hussein. He is an evil man who deserves everything he is getting. His family are as bad, and his regime has been brutal. But, to comment on your above points:<br />
1. Chem / Bio weapons<br />
Wheres your proof? UN inspectors found none. USA/Brit/Aussi soldiers have found none, so far.<br />
2. Stockpile of chem/bio weaps.<br />
Wheres your proof, see 1 above<br />
3. Previous use of chem weaps<br />
Conceded (but we didn't see that as a reason to depose him last time, when we had him by the balls).<br />
4. Active link to known terrorist network<br />
You got me...Ok, I give up - what terroist network are you talking about? Because THERE IS NO LINK BETWEEN HUSSEIN AND AL QUAEDA. British Intelligence (MI6) has proved that there is no link between Hussein and Al Quaeda<br />
5. Government funded training camps for terrorists.<br />
Where is your proof? I think you might be confusing Hussein/Iraq with Gadaddi/Libya?<br />
6. Overt Hatred &amp; direct challenge to the USA<br />
Hussein was always big on talking the talk, but not real good on walking the walk - sure he spouted off about hating the USA, but what did he actually do directly challenging the USA? A big fat zilch, thats what.<br />
7. Tortures / kills own subjects<br />
Conceded, but Saudi Arabia has plenty of blood on its hands in that respect too, just you dont get to hear so much about it. Who do you think runs countries like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, etc? Because they weren't democratically elected, that is for damn sure. Saudi Arabia has a record on human right that would make you physically sick <br />
8. Invaded Kuwait/Iran<br />
Conceded, but recall, when Iraq was at war with Iran, the USA sided with Hussein! They supported the Butcher of Bagdad! They provided weapons so that he could better fight Iran.<br />
<br />
Like I said before, Hussein is an evil dectator who deserves to die. However, it is the Saudis that funded Al Quaeda, but we will never take them to task for it, because it would not be in our own self-interest, and for that we are, I think, hypocrites.</div></div><hr />

It will not be long now and we will know the truth.  We are still in the middle of a war but things are looking rather good for coalition forces and with the active cooperation of the now free people of Iraq it is very likly that we will be able to form a very clear picture of what weapons Iraq has, their location, and any development programs that where underway.   Already at this time we are finding lots of places of &quot;interest&quot; but athorities are bing very carefull and not drawing conclusions. When Iran is fully defeated and the pople are free, we will have time to look and look hard.<br />
<br />
Inspectors are not detectives and even 1000 of them are not going to find sqauat.  Just today US forces found an underground complex of rooms at a nuclear research facility that the UN has inpected just a month before the start of the war.  Over time we will locate the scientists / militalry officers / and even truck the truck drivers.<br />
<br />
Just consider the restrictions placed on UN U2 servaliance flights prio to the war.  We where required to give 48 hours notice before any U2 overflight and to file a flight plan that would not be deviated from at the time of that notice.  The UN inspectors where not detectives operating with the police powers of the Iraqi government.  They where unwanted intruders with very limited numbers operating under bazaar restritions.  I can't beleive that anyone would think they would find anything.<br />
<br />
In then end I think we should thanks the Coward that is France.  Perhaps if France had joined with the US / Britian / Austrilia within the UN then Sadum might have complied and the Iraqi people would still be living under his boot.  A united front might have convinced him that he should have honestly complied with the UN.  Instead we get to kick his ass and free his people :).  It is just a bonus that we learned how deap the cowardice is in the nation of France :).</div></div><hr />

I have been arguing that the war is basically &quot;the right war, for the wrong reasons&quot;. Effectively, I am saying that the war will achieve goals that are desirable (the removal of Saddam Hussein and his regime), but that the justification for the war, as given by the American government, is wrong.<br />
<br />
I am glad that Hussein has been deposed. I am glad that the people of Iraq have been freed from the terrible yoke of oprression. I hope he and his family are captured, charged tried and publically executed, or faling that are killed by a bomb. The invasion of Iraq has achieved good things, and will, I hope, lead to more good things in the future. However, I still maintain inequivocally that there is no link between Al Quaeda and Hussein, and that there is a link between Al Quaeda and the ruling families in Saudi Arabia.</div></div><hr />

I just cut/pasted right quick cuz I am almost done medding.... but I found the above statement pretty damned funny =)  Saddams people never supported him. They lived in fear. I have been overseas, and I know how ****ty people live outside the US.<br />

You love France so much? Then return there. I hold no ill will towards those Americans with French backgrounds. They are still American.<br />

I *DO* have a problem with Americans not supporting Americans. I think those people need to leave the country and see for themselves just how much they have.<br />

Nothing quite like living in a house filled with bullets, no running water, and a filthy rich government who doesn't even have the decently to feed the populace, many of whom are starving.<br />

you really need to watch the damn news man, if you really think they don't have WMD you are insane. Yesterday alone, reports of a site possibly containing weapons grade plutonium, no not confirmed yet, also mobile bio-weapons lab possibly found. You think these are all made up? Think our intel services and british, even FRENCH, are lying?<br />
<br />
ALL intelligence agencies agree they ahve the weapons, UN inspectors are about as gay and innefectual as they come, headed by a douche-bag with no balls at all.<br />
<br />
When confronted with atrocities, you argue &quot;heh, but so and so does it too&quot; what kind of an argument is that?<br />
<br />
We have the legal right to do it, under 1441, which BTW, your French brothers supported wholeheartedly, and then lied about backing the US.<br />
<br />
Saddam has violated those 17 resolutions for 12 years.<br />
<br />
And eys, Iraq has been found to conatain terrorist training camps, doesn't matter to me Al Quaeda or not, but the government certainly thinks so.<br />
<br />
Look, your arguments are backed up with no facts, and are strictly anti-war anti-american, and they are flat out wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
Saddam has WMD, Saddam supports terrorists, if not Al Quaeda, other dangerous sects. <br />
<br />
He has paid 35 million alone to families of palestinian suicide bombers.<br />

Wake up and smell the coffee man.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u162"><b>Jenoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p162">We know without a doubt that saddam has had access to chemical weapons (see halabja) and that he has had access to nuclear components. Iraq has also to the best of my knowlege imported strains of anthrax and other biological agents. <br />
<br />
It would be unlikely that he did not manage to hide away some components of the various weapon systems. But it is also a gamble since unless a substancial amount is uncovered there is a risk for a political black eye. Knowing and proving are very differant things, even more so when your evidence might tarnish your trust in the publics eye.<br />
<br />
Un resolution 1441 is vague as hell, &quot;serious consequences&quot; can mean anything from making saddam watch reruns of the love boat to transforming iraq into a radioactive parkinglot of glas. Resolutions 660 and 678 are more precise in the way that they specify goals and what is asked of the international community.<br />

I would like some links to some articles about the camps though.</div></div><hr />

I like vague, gives you alot more leeway. What was terrible, is that Colon Powell flat out asked the french dude if they sign 1441 will they back the US on a future resolution? They said yes.<br />

Correct me if I am wrong but hasnt the kurds controlled a fair bit of northern iraq since the last gulf war? If you asked the turks then they would most likely just shrug and say something along the lines of &quot;of course there are terrorist training camps there, the pkk are terrorists after all&quot; :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Resolution 1441 required Iraq to show evidence they had destroyed known stockpiles from before the Gulf War (you know - the ones you conceded had been used against the Kurds).  Burden of proof on Saddam.  No evidence of destruction provided.  Given time - the stockpiles will be found.  The troops have been a little busy stomping on the &quot;elite&quot; republican guard (obviously heavily trained by France).  Remember - Saddam had 12 years of the UN's &quot;Stop, or I'll say stop again&quot; policy to perfect their hiding places.  We also know about the US intelligence showing the mobile labs.  Those could be anywhere.  You didn't happen to drive one home did you?<br />
<br />
There are links between Al-Quaeda and Saddam.  Aside from terrorist training camps already found (including an airplane simulation, btw), lists of terrorists have been found on government computers.  These will be helpful in rooting out more Al-Quaeda.  I think you need to ask your secret British spy mole to stop selling you misinformation.  Saddam didn't just bluster about challenging the US - he paid the terrorist networks, provided land, weapons, etc. for training camps, and was developing the chem/bio weapons for the use of the terrorists.  Do you need a nuke in NYC to convince you?<br />
<br />
You have evidence that Saudi Arabia is holding children hostage to force their parents to be human shields?  Thought not.  The money links are not to the government directly, but to individuals in the government.  Kinda like if it were found out that that idiot George Stephanopoulos<br />
were providing funds to terrorists.<br />
<br />
USA sided with Iraq - sort of.  We sold them arms to prop them up so Iraq wouldn't be an Iranian territory.  Russia and other countries sold arms to Iran - what's your point?  Did we encounter any of our own weapons in this war?  No.  So we obviously didn't maintain that relationship.  That's like holding someone accountable for their Ex-wife's actions 20 years after the divorce.  Note - Russian and French technology were used against us - who has been supporting whom?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u167"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p167">One thing that lot a not of people realise, is that Al Queda hate Saddham. And I mean hate.<br />

More like they follow leaders who deliberately badly misinterpret the Koran for their own motives.  AL Quaeda hates anyone in power and may hate Saddam, but they don't scorn his training camps or cash - since he's a fellow Islamic militant that openly hates the USA.</div></div><hr />

Theres three tiers to the Koran. The first tier is the part that if you want to be a muslim, you have to abide by. The second tier is a bit more up it's self and some people follow it, some don't.<br />
<br />
The third tier is the nasty one, that has all the extremist ideas within, like women having to wear shrouds over their faces all time.....cutting peoples limbs off, all that kinda crap. This is the tier that the fundamentalist extremists follow....and they HATE anyone who doesn't. Thats why they hate saddam, he makes his own tier up. He hardly follows the first tier, let alone the third.</div></div><hr />
