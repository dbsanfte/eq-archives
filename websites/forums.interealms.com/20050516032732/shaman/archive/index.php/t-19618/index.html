What level would you stop at 1 or 2?<br />

Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Exactly what he said.<br />
<br />
It's a fun ability for just 4 points.  You can use it to help with pulling - just send in your dogs on the mob and all the adds will attack them, then pull off adds one at a time with slow.  You can also use it to help push mobs in to corners on raids.<br />
<br />
However, the extra two ranks just aren't good enough to justify buying them before some other abilities.  Defensive AA, healing AA, Quick Buff, SCM, SCRM, VP, and probably some others I forget should be higher on your list than SC3.  I got SC1 right when pop came out, but didn't finish SC3 until well after 200 AA - Don't regret it a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yeah, i rarely use them, other than the initial positioning of mobs on raids.  I'll use them for named fights sometimes, but most of the time I just forget, although it's cool to see it once in a while</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zigmund</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Spirit Call actually has a DD compnent to it when you first cast it.<br />
<br />
So you cast,<br />
<br />
it hits mob with a DD like effect (no damage taken - but gives you agro)<br />
<br />
and then your puppies come out one at a time, every half a sec or so and attack the mob.<br />
<br />
I wish they would not have that DD effect, wish it was like my puppy, it doesnt take agro until it actually bites the mob.<br />
<br />
SC is useful and a fun aa, but not as stated earlier as important as some other aa, get it if you want it, but then wait to max it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I picked up Spirit Call 3 somewhere in my 40s or 50s in terms of AAs, don't regret it at all.<br />
<br />
Very very few things can channel a CH or a gate through the five additional dogs and your pet beating on them.  It also lets you position things just where you want them, or distract a second mob while you deal with a first.<br />
<br />
It depends a lot on your playstyle.  I do almost all my playtime in small, non-perfect group situations where everyone has to be flexible and any little trick you have helps.<br />
<br />
Someone who spends all their time in PoP or LDoN pickups or a full time raider wouldn't place the same importance on it.  All depends on your priorities.  :)<br />
<br />
I think all three of the PoP ability style AAs (RC, VP, SC) are really handy in terms of extending our class, not just making you more efficient at stuff you can already do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well, I use the dogs most foten because of their push, but it is not like the last level of spirit call pushes unprportionally more then the previous levels. Unless you often fight over lava pits or on bridges and find that spirit call 2 just barely does not push the MOB over the edge I wouldn't worry about it.<br />
<br />
About that DD component . . . how do you figure that? I will have to try it out on an orc pawn or something, but I have never seen a MOBs health drop before the first dog bite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Calling it DD is a bit of a misnomer, since it does no damage. It's more like an instant aggro component, a fraction of a second before your first pet is off and running.<br />
<br />
It can actually be quite useful, in my opinion, since it seems to be very minor aggro, and it can be used to pull your first target slightly away from any other mobs that might add if you cast a higher aggro spell.<br />
<br />
I recently tried a triple pull with SC1. To my surprise, the mob came solo, he got about 5 yards before my dogs intercepted him. But far enough not to cause adds. By the time he was hit with malos, slow and root, he'd killed a dog, but it worked very well.<br />
<br />
Previously, on the same pull, pulling with Malos resulted in a triple pull.<br />
<br />
There may have been other factors involved, but for the life of me I can't think what they were.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not really a DD, but it will cause a mob to rush you exactly as SC fires, before the first pet even begins running at or attacks the mob.<br />
<br />
I've used it soloing to pull a single mob like the person above this post describes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>lfclan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If your concerned with the push, just use a spread pattern for your dogs...<br />
Cast SC and run a slow circle around the  mob... it will disperse your pets all around the mob and stop the pushing since they will all be pushing against each other...<br />
 if thats the effect u want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">AA &lt; 200, then 1 or maybe 0<br />
<br />
<br />
Very very very very poor advice.<br />
<br />
Spirit call is priceless. <br />
<br />
Mana free tankage/damage, think that one over for awhile.<br />
<br />
I finished it off around the 40-50 aa range as well and never looked back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It is worth getting a single rank in Spirit Call and might be worth getting more ranks in if you pvp a bit or are cursed with too many AA points.<br />
<br />
Spirit Call is basically a utility for pushing/distracting mobs.  The DPS from it is minimal (can't even kill Sgt. Slate) and EP level mobs will eat your entire dogpack in about 2 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Odinson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I got all 3 levels.  I do lots of ldon, and not only is push good when controlled, but so is the fact that the dogdogswarm bashes quite a bit.  Very useful to control casters especially healers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You can control the push...<br />
Make it as little (even next to nothing) or as much as you want by circling the mob as the pets are popping.<br />
<br />
IE if you cast then immediatly run a complete circle around the target you cast it on then the push will be next to nil because you will have all the pets pushing against each other.<br />
<br />
Run a half circle to control push (herding) a certain way.<br />
<br />
Takes some practice to get it the way you want but not that difficult.<br />
<br />
Another nice thing I use SC3 for is Cleric mobs :)<br />
They dont quite get as many cheals off with puppies surrounding them beating the crap out of em.<br />
Found that pretty handy on the LDoN hard rares that are casters (especially Clerics).<br />
<br />
The best use though imho is still raid positioning.<br />
4-5 Shaman and 3-4 Mages all hitting pets at the same time is an insane amount of push.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Mana free tankage/damage, think that one over for awhile.<br />
<br />
CA/LR, CS/ID, ND3, SCRM, HA/AHA and HG/AHG are all mana free tankage too.  The first two directly add to your tanking ability.  For no mana cost!  ND3 gives you more of a buffer before you absolutely have to be healed.  The last three help you stay alive longer through better heals, at no extra mana cost for the extra healing.<br />
<br />
SCF/FoM, rabid bear/HR are both mana free damage.  Rabid bear rawks!<br />
<br />
CA/LR and CS/ID don't take 8 seconds or whatever to cast either, they're always on you.  They don't go down for 12 minutes after you use them.<br />
<br />
Levels 2 and 3 are not worth it, once you have the first three, until you can afford to waste AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">CA/LR, CS/ID, ND3, SCRM, HA/AHA and HG/AHG are all mana free tankage too. <br />
<br />
Not really, they all require that the mob be beating on someone. Spirit Call really is free tankage. Root a mob, spirit call and you know that mob is gonna be busy for a minute. Doesn't really matter if it's a caster or if it summons. Even if you don't slow, there aren't that many mobs out there that will eat through 3 puppies in a minute. <br />
<br />
I'd agree that SC2 and 3 aren't a very high priority but the first lvl has a lot of uses given how cheap it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I have the first level of it...its the most fun thing i can do every 12 minutes.  It gives me one reason to stay somewhere for 12 more minutes :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Just had a thought...  That new GoD AA that allows group buffs to hit your pets...  Will group buffs hit your SC pets?  I could just see unleashing sc3 and following up with a talisman of alacrity...  Might be a good amount of added dps to have 5 hasted dogdogs running wild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">No offense, but why the heck wouldn't you get SC2 and SC3?  It's only 5 more AAs.  4 for the 1st rank; 5 more for the 2nd and 3rd.  I found a large difference between SC1 and SC3.  SC1 was weak and disappointing.  SC3 adds a whole new dimension to many scenarios.  5 dogs with ~3k hps each = 15k hps collectively.  All the defensive AAs in the world don't equal 15k hps.  It's great for raid/group positioning, soloing, crowd-control, and like others have said, pulling --- I think a lot of shamans here under-estimate SC.</div></div><hr />
