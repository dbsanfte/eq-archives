<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Soloed the Emperor for 14 hours at the weekend, 11 emperor spawns, here's the spells I got...<br />
<br />
Aegis<br />
Bane of Nife (pity I just bought it for 500pp)<br />
Sha's ferocity<br />
Trepidation x2<br />
Mask of the Hunter<br />
Form of the Hunter<br />
Winds of Gelid<br />
Disintegrate<br />
Greater Voceration Air<br />
Conjure Corpse<br />
Tears of Prexus<br />
Omakin's Alacrity<br />
<br />
Nearly all of these are junk and will be sold to a vendor.<br />
<br />
Still waiting on Malo, Tigirs and Pox.<br />
<br />
- Chottal hits for 170ish max, but not often as the fool keeps casting a low level root on you when he gets LoM, blood of chottal actually had more of a DPS<br />
- always fought him near the door and never had him gate on me<br />
- the pet is just a nerfed lil green skel that dies with one epic dot<br />
<br />
I had my 60 necro bot in the room to snare chottal and res me. I just cannot see how this can be done without snare, I tried to keep him perma rooted but as soon as it wore off he moved away from door, when I re-rooted he gated, summoned and killed me. With snare, things only got bad once when he turned me into a skel which stopped me torporing myself, other than that he's a wuss. Bah I should have been a troll :p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I almost stepped into emp tonite , i was following a group down there and thouhgt i might just invis to undead myself and camp in the room before emp and try to camp him solo for many many much times for torpor. group stopped fro a while at the guardians and im glad they did cause after thinking about it i ported out and decided to try another time.<br />
<br />
from this post it doesnt sound like it possible for me to camp him. gating and summon doesnt sound like fun and i spend alot of time in seb so i get to see the corpse runs from when he does summon and dispmantle.<br />
<br />
I gotta say , everyone said that that drops rate is SO much better , well i would hate to see what they were like before cause ive been camping EVERYTHING from telk to king and queen in chardok to SF GW's to Emp to Jumpy to Trak to Prot to Severlious to anyhting that has the word torpor in their drop table and i still havent gotten it. I feel sorry for people who cant play this game so heavily. Hell i cant even find one for sale and im been in contact with almost every top 10 guild on my serrver.<br />
<br />
Oh well ,  i still have faith !!  Didnt think id get malo either and i have it :D<br />
<br />
Sorry to vent in your thread :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Winds of Gelid, Disintegrate and Tears of Prexus are 3 not so common wizard spells.  At least you are definitely accumulating good trade bait.  <br />

Don't sell those to a merchant.</div></div><hr />

I have killed trak and all his buddies and still nothing. I am beginning to think torpor is a myth perpetuated by the older shammies to have fun with us younger ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Take heart, it's REAL.  Guild was doing a &quot;strike raid&quot; night, where we pop around and take out targets of opportunity; needed to get Trak for the teeth, so while a lead group was setting up a COH chain in seb, half our raiding force popped over to DL to wax Gorenaire.  Took her down in 23 seconds and she dropped just about everything we could possibly be interested in from her except for the scale for the WIS cloak, INCLUDING both Torpor and Malo.  We had two 60+ shaman with us, one got Torpor and the other got Malo.  Two very happy shaman, I can tell you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Mask of the Hunter is a rare druid spell, sells well as it's like 3 FT in a self buff for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bigcat Daddy-o</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Same problem here<br />
I 3 box Guardian wurms (Warrior, Shaman and cleric for early heals. Once warrior has agro, just need the odd catch-up healing help). All kinds of spells that are pretty much merchant bound to pay for a  KEI in Nexus. Only decent spell was Tigirs. I have camped guardian wurms a lot. (no record of time spent. )<br />
<br />
Camped Emperor yesterday, two boxing warrior and Shaman for 12 hours. lots of spells. No Shaman spells. <br />
<br />
Getting a bit discouraged and wondering about this pseudo drop rate increase.<br />
<br />
Basically a critical spell in a Shaman's arsenal nearly impossible to get, or to buy. I have contacted all the big guilds and offered up plat, posted here, and apparently just don't have enough money to buy it. <br />
<br />
I don't belong to a guild, and haven't been invited to any pickup raids to take out Kunark dragons, soooooo the search continues. <br />
<br />
I am wondering if nerfing manaburn was such a good thing for Shaman. At least then we occasionally saw a Malo or torpor for sale..... <br />
<br />
Talked to a Chanter last night. Paid 45k for KEI, and earned it back in a week, selling KEI in Nexus. <br />
<br />
Maybe some of the Shaman community folks that are tapped into the powers that be, could drop a bug in their ear. Kunark been out a long time. Most of the loot has dropped off to nada, yet MALO, a defining spell of the class is still worth buku bucks cuz of the insanely low drop rate. Compare to any other class spell that drops in Kunark of lvl 60 is pretty much merchant bound.....<br />
<br />
A Little help here would really be appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Nerfing ManaBurn was definitely bad in that respect (at least on the Rathe).  That is how I got Sunstrike on my (then 60) wizard, by trading Torpor to a guild for Sunstrike.  I don't relish the day I need Torpor with this toon.  Yes, they say they've upped the drop rate, but who does Kunark content anymore?  Not many, unfortunately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>gnarishal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, it does still drop. After months (about 3) of killing kunark dragons, king and queen in chardok ad nauseum, clearing everything we could find in Skyfire (Lots of GW action here) for 5 or 6 cleric epics, trak, so on and so forth, we finally got ONE copy to drop. Shame we have 4 or 5 other 60 plus shammies still waiting. (Oh, 3 copies of malo in this time as well)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bigcat Daddy-o</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just a quick thanks for the folks that responded to this thread. I picked up Mask of the Hunter last night, and it probably would have gone to a vendor had I not read this post. Instead, it will be sold to increase my MALO fund.... as if it were ever for sale.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I've solo'd him twice (a long time ago). You are right, the hardest part is when he tries to flee or gate. Best thing to do is fight him in the door way, when he get low on health load him up with dots and keep him perma rooted. He will not try to gate, and as long as you keep him rooted you should be ok. <br />
<br />
Just for kicks I'd like to try camping him solo again now that I'm 65, I'm thinking at 65 I could just single pull his guards then fight emp in his room which would be ideal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Torpor dropped nicely for my guild lately. Got a copy off Sev in EJ and guild held it for next 60 shaman (me and another shaman were at 58 almost 59). So I spent the next week exp-ing like mad. Half way through 59 we did a pick up on Telk(?) in skyfire and he dropped it. Me being the only shaman there, I got that one and other shaman got the banked copy. Still no Malo though (.  But keep pluggin away and you will get it (hopefully before EQ dies).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kunark dragons, uhm well besides gorenaire, are trivial for a 65 group of people. I've done a bunch of them with warrior cleric rogue shaman wizard enchanter. Get some resists and go kill em, takes about 15 mins for me and my friends to drop tal/sev. <br />
Just be aware malo's more rare than you would think =p<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I got avatar on my 3rd emp kill. I happened to get malo on a sev raid, and bought torpor after camping it forever for 40k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Cateye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Torpor drops from Kunark dragons, and yes they are easy for 1 or 2 really strong groups. But it most frequently drops in Veeshan's Peak which indeed requires quite a nice raid force (better a strong guild). And even though I know that it is an ultra rare spell, I think the drop rate increase was pretty remarkable as we had 3 copys of it in the bank when i was 59, when i turned 60 there was only 1 left there waiting for me as it sells pretty high, but it is possible to get it! However I wouldn't wanna try to get it without a good guild, sounds like a big waste of time to me...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Dankonia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I got  Malo 2 days ago, and Torpor yesterday =p only a 55 shaman atm, guess I got really lucky.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Korlace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Level 65 here, went to go do emp.  Beware that even at 65, if you try to clear guards, single pulling is still not easy if at all possible.  I haven't been able to so far.</div></div><hr />

I have seen it for 100979 usually for some reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Any advice on how to pull him?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">you say you did the emperor with a shaman and a necro? how did you even get to him? there is first the crypt door then there is another door at the emperor room that needs to be lock-picked, am i missing something or is the only way to do him with a rogue?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>hdaana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">you coattail down on another group or pay a rogue to let you in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Targuran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Seeing as how our pets no longer agro nearby mobs, has anyone ever tried sending in pet first (let pet tank) and fighting Emp at his spawn point?  As long as you don't do anything to agro the other mobs around him (no AEs), and as long as you don't get agro over your pet (and get summoned), shouldn't you be able to fight him solo the whole time?<br />
<br />
I would even venture to say that he may not run at low health due to surrounding mobs, but I could be totally wrong about all of this.<br />
<br />
Just an idea... Anyone know whether this would or wouldn't work? I honestly have no clue, as I have only ever fought him once and that was with a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Artistikone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Wouldn't work, because once your pet attacks a mob, it gains aggro. He would then get social aggro from near by mobs. It would be like you yourself attacking the mob. Pets are only indifferent by default, but KOS once engaged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Avangion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Artistikone is right about this since the skeles are probably high enough level to agro your pet. Hes wrong about when he says its as if you were attacking the mob. Take your truespirit pet, run around the disco area or upper zone out and sic him on a set of spawns. Unless they are particulary high lvl, your pet can kill them one at a time as the rest won't agro. Try doing that yourself and see what happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">After watching prices on Saryn, Malo is quickly becoming a non-issue.  Why buy Malo for 60k when you can buy Malos for 65k?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Targuran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Ahh ok I wasn't aware of the level factor. I just noticed that while in Sebilis my pet (True Spirit) could attack the entry mobs who stand side-by-side and they never assisted each other except for heals and buffs.  It was probably the fact that they are much lower level than the guards around the emp.</div></div><hr />
