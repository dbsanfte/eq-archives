<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>CelEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I read on the forums the &quot;minibosses&quot; in PoFire and PoWater would have been adjusted to make the difficulty match the reward again.<br />
<br />
(for those who arent familiar with them : PoFire has 10, and PoWater has 4 minibosses who each usually drop 2 loot pieces -commonly molds for elemental armor-. These mobs may be really hard, like Blazzax who hits for 3k and has an unresistable  PB AE DD for 2k. But a well organized guild, as all should be who make it to PoFire, should be able to clear all of them in about 2 hours per plane maximum, so its not THAT hard once you work out a strategy for each of them)<br />
<br />
Since i play on the frenchy Sebilis server, our bosses have not been patched yet... we always slack 1 week behind lol.<br />
<br />
But from what i heard most of these bosses have (besides some other tweaking) just been made uslowable.<br />
<br />
I find this really annoying. Till now most bosses in Fire and Water just mitigated the slow, most of them even heavily.<br />
<br />
By shutting out a whole aspect of a fight (the debuffing) just makes the fight morge Zergish. If they really want the mob to hit faster, have him mitigate more.... even if it mitigate for 90% i'd still try to land that Turgurs.<br />
<br />
Besides that.. i'm a happy shaman who just got all her spells and a couple of pieces of Rosrak's  :p <br />
<br />
also, dont underestimate Combat Agility - Lightning Reflexes. It will keep you alive ALOT</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">most of these mobs already mitigated their maximum values pre-patch? (ie. slightly slowed)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">*edit* yea, I see what you mean now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I didn't try water mini yet (I was sleeping when guild went for them)<br />
But, for fire mini, they now have roughly have 5 times more hp, their AoE were upgraded (from resistable, 100ish range to almost unresistable 300+ range), some mini's DPS buffed and the most st00pid is ... they now resist Cold based spell pretty well (nice to have fire mob resisting cold....) and magic resistance were buffed also (we had trouble to land sinia after Malos/tash wich wasn't the case pre patch).<br />
Beside that, they still very doable just need to tune tactic.<br />
Sad thing is that they now harder than Fennin hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">KtM + Magmaton is now unslowable. All other slow mitigation is the same.<br />
<br />
The changes in ae's etc is great imo, makes the fight much more interesting.</div></div><hr />
