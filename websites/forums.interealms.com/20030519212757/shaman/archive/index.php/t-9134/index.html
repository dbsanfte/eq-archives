<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>n0id</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well for 10 levels or so i had been trying to save up enough for a REIF ( im 46 now)  got to 46 and had 2500p so i bought a black acrylia spear instead. (REIF goes for 5k on my server)<br />
<br />
Well last night one dropped in our faction group in kael and i got it by default NBG :)<br />
<br />
So now im torn between the 2...they are almost identical in dmg/delay...one has wis/mana stats and a dd proc, other has new luclin graphic and 45hp lifetap.<br />
<br />
Stats are below....should i use both? is there certain situations where one is better than the other?  or sell one and buy something with the money?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sanosake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They are not close in damage. I'd use the Rune Etched Icewurm Fang, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bozarkia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd use reif most often.  Since my spells are and always will be more effective than my melee damage, I go for stats first.  (assuming you're at least over 30 if you're ina kael group)<br />
<br />
I wouldn't ditch the lifetap one =) I'd use it while soloing probably, since my solo style is to tank while dots work and pet does damage from the rear.  Lifetap is crazy fun too use too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slargg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">depends on your level, and if you have a jbb. Also, with a horse you will be avoiding melee, as your mana regen will do more damage than the melee that you can do. Consider these things also, maybe you will want to ditch both for a primary hand item that has some hps. Also, how far from epic are you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have the REIF, and I love it.  I am not sure if the proc arte is jacked, or I have just had extraordinary luck since it started proccing, but I average 2 procs per fight, after I have done all my shaman mojo to the mob.  I like the proc, since my melee damage is not enough to get me by (maxed weapon skills though), so free damage is free damage.  If the proc rate is similar on the lifetap spear, it would be a really tough hoice.  Stats on the REIF might be the extra edge to choose that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've meleed with both while soloing; epic hits harder, but I truly love the lifetap proc, and I get a few more attempts to hit with the Black Acrylia.<br />
<br />
Both REIF and BA proc like nobody's business buffed and Raged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Not factoring in the procs, the REIF will do ~39% more damage than the BA Spear.</div></div><hr />
