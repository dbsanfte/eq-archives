<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My wifes wizard and another friends mage is approaching lvl to be able to do adventures with my two 65's and my friends two. Now ive been told its lvl 57-65 is the lvl range. My question is if you lose 57 while mid mission will it mess anything up like losing 46 while in hate? We dont run much with rez ability and we do adventures seems on certain days and i'm willing to bet one or the other will be barely lvl 57 when we go next so figured i'd make sure instead of having someone be locked from corpse for an hr+. I dont worry about losing anything or being locked out from it since dungeons will boot. I'm just been curious if anyone has seen anything like that.</div></div><hr />

Duno about the corpse theng, but 58 is the minimum level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As stated, your friends would need to be 58 to group with you as the level range limit is 7.<br />
<br />
I haven't encountered or heard of the level loss thing...you should think positively anyways!  :P  I would think that it wouldn't be a problem because LDoN seems to lock in your group once you've received an adventure.  Folks can relog, LD, or whatnot and rejoin the adventure.  So it seems to be tied to an adventure rather than the zone.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Cool thanks. <br />
<br />
   I wasnt overly worried about it was more a curiosity. Dont die that much in adventures but also have the luck of if i 100% dont want someone or me to die than will happen lol. <br />
  Now i need to figure out where i got 57 as the level. Gonna get smacked when i tell wife she has one more lvl to go lol.</div></div><hr />
