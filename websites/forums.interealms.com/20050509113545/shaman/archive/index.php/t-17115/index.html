<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hissik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since the last patch, I have managed to open 3 chests (out of at least a couple dozen that weren't cursed).  Inside were decent stat augments. One was a +6 WIS, one was +6 STA, and one was +12HP (the first +HP item I have seen from an adventure), all were all/all any slot.<br />
<br />
I don't feel so bad now after spending all those points on our LDoN greater chest opening spells.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Got only a few chests opened since patch.<br />
<br />
1 stat augment and 2 illusion potions (not exciting, but still besser than 5p i guess).<br />
<br />
It seems, they improved chest loot at least a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Imo, not sure the potions are any better than getting nothing was and seen quite a few of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Chests are so crap. I opened one and it had a 15 dex/15 sta potion in it, wow well worth the 10pp of the reagent I paid for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Saw my first chest last night (3rd adventure).  No one in the group could sense, disarm or anything.  We bashed it, got a Blue Diamond, a little vendor statuette and 1pp or so. =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">so far i'm out 60p and have received 2 disease awareness I potions .. utter crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">They are putting alchemaical potions in chests? Bah!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ulver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes, alchemical potions that only work on level 20 or lower spells on hard adventures for groups of level 65 players</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">... and they are NO DROP  /smack SoE</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Augments are rotting already so they give us more?? :p<br />
<br />
When they said loot in chests had been improved I had hoped something truly interesting would drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Quit whining about reagent costs by not using them.  Just open the chest without disarming and cure the dot or whatever.   Was simple before they gimpified them, and super simple now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not always a dot, sometimes it debuffs 5-6 buffs from everyone in the group, wanna hear a pissed off cleric and groans of KEI dropping from everyone then not disarming would be fine. <br />
<br />
6 peridots=60 plat and change vs a greater scrying stone for 17 plat. You be the judge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Graal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If only one cast of the Disarm Traps spell would do the trick.  I finally disarmed one after 5 casts.  I was SOOOO excited with the 10pp I looted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hmm have I misunderstood them? I thought you had to disarm them to open them?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you wait until after you've completed your adventure to open all the chests, it won't matter if you lose all your buffs.</div></div><hr />
