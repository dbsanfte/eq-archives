<br />
Then it Hits me I know what I am here for!!!!<br />
<br />
ENTERTAINMENT!!<br />
<br />
The other classes are soooo busy doing stuff they don’t have time for jokes or quips about who's got the biggest hitty stick. At last I have found my roll, I am the Jester I am the one with time on his hands who can tell stories, make jokes and keep peoples spirits up. We can all relax and not worry about class balance for I at last have found us a roll....</div></div><hr />

Seriously playing a bard alt and doing groups and ldon, it lets me appreciate my shaman soo much more. On my bard i can't get a single sentence out without a song dropping. On shaman i can talk all i want and still easily get done what i can. Now all i need is to get people to laugh with me and not at me.... :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have come to figure out somewhere during my 138 wins in ldon that aside from FA, buffs, slows, heal over times, and sometimes a regular heal here and there I have no true power in Ldon.  No great dps.  I have learned though many dps people on my shard swear by the shaman slow (and you can tell when multiple mobs have been slowed, thank you cycle target button) and they have come to depend on me when I am grouped with them.  Anyway the point of my post is I like to make jokes and have fun when grouped.  I have learned overtime when its cool to let the fun flow and when its good to shut up.  I very much enjoy ldon and if I don't get at least 1 ldon adventure a day I feel like I didn't get my fix for the day.  Its sad that Shaman have been reduced to the 'jester' type class yet I find certain people on my server look for me for ldons when I am on and at least feel somewhat wanted.  I have had ldon since its release but did not start doing ldon until the last week of April.  I wish I had started sooner but being a solo/stubborn shaman does that to you.</div></div><hr />

Tell your Cleric to do DPS for a change, you can handle heals.<br />

I try to keep the damage-dealers in camp. Toss Q on MA when last mob is at 20 and go pull another few.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">In LDoN normals, a shaman not only can replace a cleric, they should.  There is no reason to bring a cleric really in a normal LDoN.  LDoN hard on the other hand is a totally different animal, boot the shaman, grab the cleric.  Shaman shine in trivial content, anyone who considers this an endorsement of current shaman class balance really needs their head examined or another coffee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have been a main healer in normal Ldon about 5 to 10 times.  A lot of melee will complain if a shaman is main healer although I have had very few problems.  Now if you would like to see something funny how about a tank that refuses to pull.  I decided to try and get him to pull by saying I would be main puller thinking there is no way they would let me do it.  WRONG, I was main puller and overall nobody was bored and we did not have an enchanter nor did I have VP at the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">One way you can pull is to use the old SK pet pull trick.<br />
<br />
Grab a pet that will con green to the MOBS.  Toss on a Shrew &amp; a Q and /pet attack then spam a macro that does /pet back off and /pet follow as soon as he taps the mob.<br />
<br />
Green con to the mob means that only the mob he hits will aggro.  Using a combination of /pet back off and /pet follow will get your pet out of the way more quickly.  /pet back off has the pet walk to you . . . /pet follow and the pet runs to you.<br />
<br />
There are reports that some changes were made to pet pulling . . . you might want to test this in a more forgiving environment before taking it to LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Bah. Pull three or four by slowing one; run back and wedge in a corner and cycle through the mobs until they're all slowed. Q on MA as needed; the 40 HP regen will get the rest back up soon enough if any of them happend to get agro. Keep regen, focus, str on the pets, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">To each their own.  I prefer chained singles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You can root-pull very easily in LDoN,  find 2 mobs root one run back to camp with the other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I love pulling in LDON and generally try to make it what I do there.  My DPS and heals stink, so I try to have it so the DPS barely has to move to hit another mob I tank or root nearby.<br />
<br />
Running around a lot looking for mobs and getting them all slowed and arranged as close to the camp as possible without hitting people, and still finding time to canni, gives me plenty to do and makes me very useful.  <br />
<br />
Sometimes I get too many, like when you walk in a door and get four mobs jumping you, but rooting and slowing helps make that less dangerous, and often others can help with CC too - mezzing, rooting, offtanking, whatever.<br />
<br />
Not always the best for me to pull, but considering how much other people can do, I'm often the most useless one there, so my maximum value often comes from just letting them stay where they are as much as possible and do their stuff while I present them a nice row of slowed and rooted mobs one after the other.<br />
<br />
The rooting often helps resolve questions of initial aggro, too.</div></div><hr />

Being the &quot;keeper of stories&quot; is an incredibly important role; think of the rest of it as your group members &quot;earning the stories&quot; ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Bah i hate single pulls, pull no less then 4 and AE slow them then rain works like a charm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Minitiki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">pffst shammy are very nice in LDoN.. with the proper group.  Proper group for me is my two box SK, my shammy and any 4 others.. so long as they aren't 4 clerics... need at least 2 dps classes.  Some of my best groups are me, sk/shammy and shammy war ranger druid or 4 melee or something silly. The other shaman i usually group with is a guildie and we both rain and bane like crazy.. probably doing the most dps in our group.. one malos on pull the other slow... then rain.... very fun very nice dps.. very good group.<br />
<br />
My sk does usually MT and has all his crit aa's for lifetaps.. and 7200hp buffed.. rarely needs heals and holds agro.. like a true hybrid.. so it helps a ton.. but i'm by far not uber, it just takes teamwork, and when the MT and the shammy are in the same head.. they usually work as a team.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Bear Jumping... That's almost as funny as shaman hockey and skunk battles. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">i've only got 34 aa, and i've slowed and main healed at same time on more than one occasion. one of my friends has taken to talking me into an ldon, then grabbing himself (bst) and four other dps to go around me. <br />
<br />
insanity ensues, and points come fast.<br />
<br />
we own ldons :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>icebain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yeah to be honest LDoN normals are great for Shaman. <br />
When it comes down to it someone has to do the DPS and someone has to support those people. I concider myself a support class I improve the DPS of everyone hitting the mob (Keeping 4 tanks FA'ed is easy with some creative use of chat windows I have a chat channel called iceFA and the FA macro button sends a %T done to that window to keep check on who was done last)<br />
I can handle healing IF the Tank is a good one AND I can pull although I need lots of suger to do that if I am also 2 boxing the Warroir, hehe. Adds are Rooted and pulled away by me and I generaly keep the party alive.<br />
<br />
Thing is though folks never comment if your doing a good job , only when you screw up (which of corse i never do cos I am a shaman)</div></div><hr />

There are reports that some changes were made to pet pulling . . . you might want to test this in a more forgiving environment before taking it to LDoN.<br />
To quick add to this- ideally you want to buff your pet to the gills w/ as many hp buffs as the party has.  Tough splits you want to rune the pet as well.  In LDoN hards w/ a tough room to break w/ hasted mobs, the key if you're pulling as an sk is to pull while feigned if you're afraid the pet will die.  If the pet dies on the pull, all aggro will immediately chain to all mobs in range and transfer to the pet's owner- learned this the hard way after wiping the group several times.<br />
<br />
Pull while feigned on the tough splits and just have the cleric nail the pet with supernal remedy on the way out and supernal light on inc to save on the bone chips.  This is the poor man's way of successfully breaking rooms in LDoN hards if you can't handle 1+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Yep, I know all about the aggro transfer on pet death, though I didn't know about the SK using FD, thats a great tip, thanks.<br />
<br />
I typically don't expect a pet to survive more than a couple pulls, thus I don't bother with all the HP buffs, though I bet a SK with their highest level pet could probably make it work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Okay, now I really did it - whipped through an ldon with two warriors and three rogues. Only downside is that they paid someone to HoV us first, or it would have been only my buffs. Whee!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">how do u cycle through mobs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I have the &quot;target nearest npc&quot; key and the &quot;cycle through npcs&quot; key both mapped to the same key. It's an option under options, keyboard (I think).</div></div><hr />
