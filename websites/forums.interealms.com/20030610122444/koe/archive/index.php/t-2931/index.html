<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aranuil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The barbarians will learn what America's all about<br />
By Leonard Pitts Jr.<br />
Syndicated columnist<br />
<br />
They pay me to tease shades of meaning from social and cultural issues, to provide words that help make sense of that which troubles the American soul. But in this moment of airless shock when hot tears sting disbelieving eyes, the only thing I can find to say, the only words that seem to fit, must be addressed to the unknown author of this suffering.<br />
<br />
You monster. You beast. You unspeakable bastard.<br />
<br />
What lesson did you hope to teach us by your coward's attack on our World Trade Center, our Pentagon, us? What was it you hoped we would learn? Whatever it was, please know that you failed.<br />
<br />
Did you want us to respect your cause? You just damned your cause.<br />
<br />
Did you want to make us fear? You just steeled our resolve.<br />
<br />
Did you want to tear us apart? You just brought us together.<br />
<br />
Let me tell you about my people. We are a vast and quarrelsome family, a family rent by racial, cultural, political and class division, but a family nonetheless. We're frivolous, yes, capable of expending tremendous emotional energy on pop cultural minutiae, a singer's revealing dress, a ball team's misfortune, a cartoon mouse.<br />
<br />
We're wealthy, too, spoiled by the ready availability of trinkets and material goods, and maybe because of that, we walk through life with a certain sense of blithe entitlement. We are fundamentally decent, though peace-loving and compassionate. We struggle to know the right thing and to do it. And we are, the overwhelming majority of us, people of faith, believers in a just and loving God.<br />
<br />
Some people-you, perhaps-think that any or all of this makes us weak.  You're mistaken. We are not weak. Indeed, we are strong in ways that cannot be measured by arsenals.<br />
<br />
Yes, we're in pain now. We are in mourning and we are in shock. We're still grappling with the unreality of the awful thing you did, still working to make ourselves understand that this isn't a special effect from some Hollywood blockbuster, isn't the plot development from a Tom Clancy novel.<br />
<br />
Both in terms of the awful scope of its ambition and the probable final death toll, your attacks are likely to go down as the worst acts of terrorism in the history of the United States and, indeed, the history of the world. You've bloodied us as we have never been bloodied before.<br />
<br />
But there's a gulf of difference between making us bloody and making us fall. This is the lesson Japan was taught to its bitter sorrow the last time anyone hit us this hard, the last time anyone brought us such abrupt and monumental pain. When roused, we are righteous in our outrage, terrible in our force. When provoked by this level of barbarism, we will bear any suffering, pay any cost, go to any length, in the pursuit of justice.<br />
<br />
I tell you this without fear of contradiction. I know my people, as you, I think, do not. What I know reassures me. It also causes me to tremble with dread of the future.<br />
<br />
In days to come, there will be recrimination and accusation, fingers pointing to determine whose failure allowed this to happen and what can be done to prevent it from happening again. There will be heightened security, misguided talk of revoking basic freedoms. We'll go forward from this moment sobered, chastened, sad. But determined, too. Unimaginably determined.<br />
<br />
You see, there is steel beneath this velvet. That aspect of our character is seldom understood by people who don't know us well. On this day, the family's bickering is put on hold. As Americans we will weep, as Americans we will mourn, and as Americans, we will rise in defense of all that we cherish.<br />
<br />
Still, I keep wondering what it was you hoped to teach us. It occurs to me that maybe you just wanted us to know the depths of your hatred.<br />
<br />
If that's the case, consider the message received. And take this message in exchange: You don't know my people. You don't know what we're about. You don't know what you just started.<br />
<br />
But you're about to learn.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Saw this in Flame Vault.. thanks for duplicating it here Aran..<br />
<br />
Good to see you post here bro, even if the circumstances are less than ideal..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Falamil Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well written.<br />

I do hope those in power will consider the nature of the enemy before they respond.  We are dealing with religious zealots here, and as good as it might feel to turn a few countries into a parking lot, we would end up with more trouble than we have now.<br />
<br />
<br />
A response that will change things is going to take a long, sustained effort from us, the American people.  Are we ready for that?  Or is this anger another flash in the pan, and next week it's back to normal and &quot;Dang, that was a real shame what happened in New York&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Action, yes.  Decisive, conclusive action, but not before we know the nature of our enemy.  Blowing people away without a plan will only make things worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sinsemsinfutura</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think the terrorists main thing they accomplished is showing the world they are not scared of the United States of America. They know how advance US is. They know how strong US military is. They know how big our army is. <br />
<br />
Now they see how fragile we are. With 8-10 people the destroy a HUGE section of NYC and killed thousands of people. They know how to plot against US without US knowing about it.<br />
<br />
However in the near future this could erupt into a War World 3. Hopefully we can strike them hard without getting other nations upset or involved.<br />
<br />
If they want a Holy War, it seem they going have it. <br />
God save us all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Canelek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Religion.  Well, I am not at all religious.  Perhaps, that was born from being raised catholic.  Do I think religion is silly?  Sometimes.  Do I look down upon people with faith and beliefs?  NEVER.  Do I have faith?  Absolutely.  Faith in my family,my friends.  I guess you can call that my religion.  I do not look down on those who believe in something that I do not.  Faith is what keeps us going, faith is what keeps us strong.  Faith in mankind is what keeps us from doing what these monsters have done.  There is nothing holy or righteous about killing to gain favor in the afterlife as some extremists believe.  I will never truly understand why they did what they did, nor would I like to attempt to understand.  I do know this—they will pay for their crimes, and not swiftly.  No snipers, no poisons, no easy death is in the future of the perpetrators.  God save their souls because we shall not.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't matter what you believe, reigiously speaking.  What matters in terms of our response is what our enemy believes.  make no mistake, this is a psychological war as much as a physical one.  Let's make full use of the only thing that seems to scare these folks.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Obscure, unnoted, unmeaningful death.</div></div><hr />
