<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Buxtor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all<br />
<br />
I bought the evolution set about a year and a half ago played my 30 days free. Didnt have a credit card and couldnt find the pre-paid cards.<br />
<br />
So I went back to the good old D2 and started a ladder char and then the new season for ladder came around now I am back to where i was 1.5 yrs ago. Bored of playing diablo its been a little over 9 yrs except that 1 month. <br />
<br />
So hear I am thursday I will get my pre-paid card and am going to re-install the evolution set. Now when I was on before I had a lvl 14 human necro which after 20 days I learned I messed the char all up then started a Barb Shaman but he didnt get to far<br />
<br />
So was thinking about making another shaman so here are my questions:<br />
<br />
1: Are Barb's a good choice in being a shaman?<br />
<br />
2: Where do you put the starting points ?<br />
<br />
3: Any starter guides I might be able to read to learn a little more ?<br />
<br />
4: Will I be ok with the evolution set ?<br />
<br />
Thanks for all of the help for whom ever post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1. Play whatever shaman race looks interesting to you - they are all comparable at the high levels<br />
<br />
a. Barbs - night blind, have slam, good looking<br />
b. Trolls - night vision, innate regen, have slam, newbie quest for short duration snare necklace<br />
c. Ogres - night vision, unstunnable from the front, have slam<br />
d. Iksar - night vision, innate regen, can't wear some Kunark era plate armor, harsh exp penalty, swimming bonus (I think)<br />
c. Vah Shir - night vision, sneak ability (huge for questing, shopping at pissy merchants), safe fall (I think?), can't wear fungi tunic <br />
e. Froglok - smallest shaman race, cute spell casting animations, immediately dates you to other people as a &quot;new shaman&quot;, ultravision (I think)<br />
<br />
2. With the nice amount of wisdom gear available, I would make sure your character hits 75 agility unbuffed, put points into sta and wis <br />

1st the evolution has:<br />
classic, kunark, velious, luclin, PoP and ykesha<br />
<br />
2nd so all newbie's play froglok is that what you are trying to say ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No, I'm trying to say that Frogloks are the most recent race to be made available. Barbs, Ogres and Trolls were the original three shaman options at release. Iksars were added a year later with Kunark, followed by Vah Shir with the release of Luclin. <br />
<br />
If you're playing a froglok, your character can't be any older than a year. Not that it's a huge deal or should stop you from playing a shaman if you want, but you're immediately labeling yourself a twink or a newbie. (Not that there's anything wrong with either).<br />
<br />
Since GoD is a higher level expansion, you will be fine without it. Supposedly, OoW has a nifty task system that begins at level 5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wazbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just pick whichever race you want and put your points in +25wis/+5sta.  Unless your character starts with below 85 AGI which means you should pump that up to 85, then put the rest in Wisdom.<br />
<br />
And also, DOWN WITH FROGLOKS! WE TROLLS NEED TO SAVE GROBB!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The &quot;Platinum&quot; edition includes all expansions, even GoD, for under $40.</div></div><hr />

Adorable sig pic, btw.<br />
<br />
It's only necessary to bump agility to 75 really. It's an agility under 75 which has a nasty penalty. I still remember the brutal combo of fungi tunic + Lodi dropping me below 75....<br />
<br />
I would still suggest a more even distribution of wis/sta - I maxxed wisdom much much earlier than I maxxed stamina. Not to mention, more stamina = more hitpoints, which equals more mana yadda yadda.</div></div><hr />

Read this thread http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=16123<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd choose Ogre if I had to do it again (frontal stun immunity).  I'm a troll now, and the regen and see in the dark was nice early on, but hardly noticeable now.  <br />
<br />
2: Where do you put the starting points ?<br />
<br />
Visit http://eq.castersrealm.com and view their starting guide for shaman. It gives you a good overview of the races and where to put your initial points.  <br />
<br />
3: Any starter guides I might be able to read to learn a little more ?<br />
<br />
Look through the lniks here: http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/forumdisplay.php?forumid=25 especially the sticky threads.  Everything from alchemy to raiding.<br />
<br />
4: Will I be ok with the evolution set ?<br />
<br />
classic, kunark, velious, luclin, PoP and ykesha should take you many months to get through.  And you'l get the vast majority of the add on features that people find useful.</div></div><hr />

Thanks :D, Don Hertzfeldt is the man, I dont even remember where I found the original picture of the guy eatting the baby :p.  I just changed him green and added troll ears :p<br />
<br />
Ah sorry, I thought of the wrong number, but yeah get your AGI to 75.<br />
<br />
Though, I would still put high wisdom if you are going to play a lower starting wisdom shaman, such as a troll or ogre.  With a barbarian this will not be as big of a problem, and you can put a more balanced STA/WIS combo.</div></div><hr />

OMG what did I ever do to you? You forgot the, or it means you went to the newbie server, but are not actually a newbie option. I flip when I cast spells, WHAT DO YOU DO?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Buxtor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well after reading the links that Ungkor has posted it seems that the top 3 would be: Ogre / Froglok / Barbs<br />
<br />
Alot to think about now. I never played a ogre I know they are KoS also and insight if a pick a ogre where to lvl at ?<br />
<br />
Also what weapons should I train in 1h 2h blunt ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">frog = newbie, get over it rtugok :p</div></div><hr />

8((((</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">about weapons: you will have enough time and possibilities to train every weaponskill you can master, i personally would try to raise piercing, 1hb and 2hb equally every level (maxed 2hb with 60, is boring to do like no dps with a good weapon just to train the skill:) ) but perferably stick with piercing and 1hb imo.<br />
<br />
@races: imo ignore the racial experience malus, play the race you like most. Sure, 20% less exp is something to swallow, but still, its a game, it should not be aim of the game to be max level with max AA's fastest but to have fun. (and iksar look cooles imo, and like everyone out there plays a barb shaman :P)<br />
The only ones really having something from their race in the post 55 game are definitely ogres with ther frontal stun immunity ... but who wants to play a big blob without hair anyway?  :D</div></div><hr />

You forgot that they are ugly. I found that to be a positive trait when making my SK, so if you wanna be a down and dirty tribal shaman, the troll path works well.<br />
<br />
<br />
I prefer sexy though for my shaman, hence the barb ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
My arse! Trolls are da segsyest!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Scarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I tried Barbarian and Ogre before settling on a race (back before Luclin so no cats or frogs, and Trolls have always looked like arse).  While I like the unstunability of Ogres, the chain look of Barbarians, and the slam they both share, in the end I went with Iksar.  Why?  Because despite faction issues (the old world thinks we smell of wee) and a deep fear of that 20% XP penalty they... spoke to me.<br />
<br />
I love the lore, atmosphere and look of Kunark, I like the idea of a strong, noble civilisation that was brought low, but is now poised to rise from the ruins of its cities and reclaim a fallen empire.<br />
And let's face it, reptilian argonath are just plain cool.<br />
<br />
I put 25 points into STA, 5 into WIS (more hit points to cannibalise into mana, and we get strength buffs from the go so 70 STR doesn't hurt as much as you might think) and haven't regretted it.<br />
As for the XP penalty, while I can't say I have never thought &quot;I'd have levelled already if I were a Barb&quot; it certainly hasn't hurt me.  I'd say the regen, especially for a shaman without any real twinking, balances it out once you get canni.</div></div><hr />

they may be ugly, but you cant beat the &quot;old model waddle&quot;  :D</div></div><hr />
