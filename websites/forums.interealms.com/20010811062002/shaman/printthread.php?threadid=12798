<p>Hey,<br>
<br>
I just got level 39 and heard my new Group-Str buff is off Gorou in Iceclad.<br>
<br>
Can you guys offer any hints or strategies?  Spawn times? ....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

<p><b><img src="images/icons/icon6.gif" alt="Cool" width="15" height="15" border="0"> Also on the Guardian wurms</b></p>

<p>Garou is, I believe, a rare spawn.<br>
<br>
If I've got the right Garou, He also drops a hide which is part of a quest for a pretty good 1hb with nice wisdom stats.  I have been intending to do this quest for 10 levels, and have yet to find him.  (Although it goes without saying that I have not been camping him for 10 levels.  I just periodically duck into Ice Clad with a tracker and check around.)<br>
<br>
All is not lost, the spell also drops off the Guardian Wurms in Great Divide.  (In the caves just downstream from the Thurgadin waterfall.)  The wurms have a lot of hit points, so take a good group with you.  They are fun battles though.  It takes some strategy to take them down.<br>
<br>
Luck to you,<br>

<p>I'd not rely on trying to get Garou yourself, he can drop that druid firey wotsit spell so the moment he does show up theres a gang of druids after him.<br>
<br>
Might be less annoying to buy/trade for it.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p><b> Yup</b></p>

<p>That's true.  And Tumultuous Strength will ONLY drop from Garou.  <br>
<br>
I paid 500pp for mine and waited quite a while before I found someone with it.<br>
<br>
Good luck<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p>Thanks for the feedback.<br>
<br>
My guild buds and i will be camping it this Sunday.  34-41 group.  I hope we can take him.<br>
<br>
He spawns by the Shaman camp by that Tower of Frozen Shadow in Iceclad?  Anyone know exactly where??<br>
<br>
<br>
thx<br>

<p><b><img src="images/icons/icon5.gif" alt="Question" width="15" height="15" border="0"> Only drops from Garou?</b></p>

<p>Voocha - what is the basis for your claim that the spell only drops off Garou?  The spell location list states that it also drops off Guardian Wurms in GD, and one other mob besides Garou.  This would seem to suggest that at least some shaman have found the spell on other mobs.  I cannot speak for myself on this issue because I also purchased mine.<br>
<br>
I did spend several days camping for Garou, for a few hours at a time.  We never even saw him, and we had a tracker on board.  We killed cougars and snow dervishes, but never did discover what his place holder was.  Of course, mileage may vary.<br>
<br>
Your group would do well in GD.  You may want to consider moving them there if you go a few and do not spot the elusive Garou.<br>

<p>Our group of upper 30's camped Gorou tonight for 4 hours but no sightings :-(<br>
<br>
The Cougars were also low-blue to green making experience poor, not a very fun camp.  Any ideas on how to trigger this spawn?<br>

<p>I personally looted Tumultuous Strength in Skyshrine, so the assertion that it only drops from the Garou is incorrect.<br>
<br>
I couldn't tell you now exactly what dropped it.  I *think* that it was one of the drakes that spawns in the room with the portal to CS in the fountain.<br>
<br>
Admittedly, this was not very long after Velious was released, and I suppose it is possible that the spell was removed from Skyshrine's drop table.  /shrug<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p><b><img src="images/icons/Dizzy_Face.gif" alt="" width="15" height="15" border="0"> Drops from Flying Monkies in WL</b></p>

<p>Looted my copy on our very first Flying Monkey kill - lucky bastard that I am.  <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br>
<br>
Bring a group of 50+ there to help with the break and camp 'em all day long for every level 39 spell.  (Yes -EVERY.)  Trouble is the cave is bugged and they fall below the world so be prepared to get a total wipeout on break - and have to petition to get those monkies killed by a GM.  (We had a full group of 55+ wiped out in 30 seconds.  10+ simultaneous rains will do that to you...)<br>

<p><b> Garou Spawn</b></p>

<p>I killed Garou at lvl43 solo.  Very tough fight.  If I had not stuck slow on him I would have been dead.  He hits hard and casts.  I had my pet on him too.  I got the Tumultous Strength spell and the Skin of Garou (nice club).<br>
<br>
His spawn is on an anti-camp timer.  Basically, his PH has to stay ALIVE for roughly 8 hours (not sure on exact timing).  If the PH is still alive after that time, then it will despawn and Garou will spawn.<br>
<br>
My tactic for finding him was to pop into Iceclad early in the morning, before groups were there to camp the cougars.<br>
<br>
He wanders in an area just East of the Tower of Frozen Shadow, in the trees with the other snow cougar spawns.  He has SoW and is very fast.  He looks like a white Drolvarg.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps and good luck to you!<br>
