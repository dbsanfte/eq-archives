<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stronglikeox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know I saw something about this once but can't find it now.<br />
<br />
When I go into Greater Bear Form my head is brown so I look like I've literally had my head up my arse instead of just figuratively.<br />
<br />
Wearing a Crown of the Goblin Nobles as my head item (no graphic in skirt form).<br />
<br />
Is there a way to fix this or am I doomed to look like this?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It has something to do with texture files and there is indeed a way to fix it.  Used to happen to me with bear and wolf forms.  However, I have no idea what it is that I did to fix it :(  Have hope, though, there is a way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Try deleting any texture cache files. They end with the extension .TXC.<br />
<br />
Anytime I start seeing graphic anomalies that's the first thing I do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Stronglikeox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks, I'll try deleting them when I get home.<br />

If I could wear a saddle, Tonto could ride me into battle next to the Lone Ranger</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">wasn't this supposed to be cause by the barbarian wode? Try changing to a wodeless face.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kyrial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yep, just switch faces... worked for me a while back.  I think it's only the one face that has a problem.  Make sure to /feedback it, maybe they'll fix it one day...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Stronglikeox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">That would make sense, I did change wodes not wong ago ( couldn't resist)<br />
<br />
To bad, I wuv my new wode.  (somebody STOP ME!)<br />

/wave Harwel!  Can you believe I hit 65?   :D</div></div><hr />
