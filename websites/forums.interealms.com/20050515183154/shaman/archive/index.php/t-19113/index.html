<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ggrowler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im a L62 Shaman that is PLing a L55 SK friend of mine.  Im using a lower level poison DOT and sending in the pet at about 60% to do as much damage as I can without getting the xp.<br />
<br />
Question is:  Does the pet take any of the xp from the SK even tho the SK is getting the xp message?<br />
<br />
I remember SOE nerfing pet xp in a patch some time ago, but not sure of the details.<br />
<br />
Seems like having the pet help is a good way to make the PLing go faster, but maybe not if the pet takes some of the xp.... heh<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As far as grouping goes:<br />
<br />
As long as one party member does at least one point of damage to the target mob the pet takes no exp.  Pets from Dire Charm will still take exp, though since I'm not a DC capable class I never paid attention to the percentages.  <br />
<br />
Now, as you are not grouping with the SK, you need to make sure that the SK does more damage than you.  If he does 51% you are good.  Be carefull with burst damage at the end of a kill though: on more than one occasion I nuked a mob at 20% health and the person I was PLing got no exp, even though they did 80% of the damage.  I think its a problems with the server mechanics (read lag and latency in reporting totals) that screw it up, so Im always carefull not to do that too often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In the scenario you provided either the pets gonna steal all the xp or non. Doubtful dog dog is gonna KS a 55 Sk unless hes a total gimp. You can probably send it in right away with no worries.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When I was PL'ing my baby SK (sadly extinct through losing job and therefore account number 2) I seem to remember somewhere around low 40's he could outdamage dogdog even if I set the dog in at 100%.<br />
<br />
He wasn't heavily twinked either, had a black acrylia halberd 40/48 (+4 magic damage).Probably had the SK hasted and not doggie tho, certainly by level 50 the sk should be completely outdamaging doggie.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Webber</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I PL'd a monk friend of mine from 45 to 52. I never used dog dog. I did my damage with either JBB and/or epic. Dulak seemd to be the best spot, boat 3 or 4 worked fine if your subject is around 52. Using dog dog is less work but the jbb/epic is more exact. Once you get it down, your subject will fly through the xp.<br />
<br />
One more thing, if you decide to use dulak as your PLing grounds, (I know there is better but I thought I'd add this), don't go into the caves until around 57+, mabey lower. Go to the second to last room. As you enter the room, go to the far right corner, that is the safe spot. The mobs in this room have aprox 5k hp's but they don't cast. At 60, 2 kills = 1% reg xp, 1 kill = 1% aa. It's slow but doable but it's the best xp in dulak at that level.<br />
<br />
Good hunting...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My dual weilding pet couldn't steal exp from my 51+ ranger. I probabaly could have used pet before 51, but didnt think about it.<br />
<br />
I couldn't, however, cast any(or many) dots/rains/DD or I'd steal the exp.<br />
I'd always send in the pet at about 90%, which is pretty much after a few hits.<br />
<br />
Just play around and see how much damage you can do before you take exp.<br />
<br />
I know you didn't ask, but I'll include where I PLed my ranger<br />
5-16 PC<br />
16-30 Sol A<br />
30-44 -varied- Gunthak beach mostly<br />
44-51 CoM<br />
51-55 Nurga (i chose here because of bazaar sellables)<br />
53+ Droga (i chose here because of bazaar sellables)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah, Our pet's CRANK out like 35dps... even an untwinked SK should be able to out do that at 55.<br />
<br />
55 I would assume you are going to PoD or PoN in which case Poochers shouldn't even factor into the equation.  Pull with slow, let the SK go to town and throw a heal after the fight.  If it's too bad dont forget cripple works wonders.  My bard tanks in PoN at 55 like this... Full Crafted so no good gear.</div></div><hr />
