<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xani Crimsonheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">2 questions...<br />
<br />
Where are all the locations you get snake scales for the Scale Skin buff?<br />
<br />
Are they used up, or do they stick around like a Fire Beetle Eye does?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
Xani</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Kill snakes.  There are a lot in front of qeynos/freeport, don't know about any newbie zones.  They are like level 1-3 i think.  Easy to slaughter. <br />
<br />
Yes, they stack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you are Iksar there are no snakes nearby to kill, but you can buy the skins from vendors in the ruined buildings in zones outside Cabilis - FoB, WW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sengal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">To answer your second question - the snake scales are consumed when you cast the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, one part of me found this spell extremely annoying due to the Snake Skin component, but at the same time I wonder if there might have been a positive impact on the economy by having more spells require components that could be harvested by newbies (currently it's just Bone Chips and, in a distant second place, Bat Wings).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xani Crimsonheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thank you for the advice :)<br />

<br />
You missed fish scales, btw.<br />
<br />
I haven't harvested a bat wing or fish scale since I discovered the vendor in the mage guild in Freeport who carries both.  Woo hoo!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>QueenGoddess</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I just get my fish scales/bat wings/etc off of newbies...zone in, auction  WTB Stack of (insert kind) here...paying (xpp) for the first 2 stacks...<br />
<br />
Same thing with HQ/MQ pelts <br />
<br />
Of course, with my low chars, I just sell 'em to people like me..:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wolfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I just swing by the last Inn in East Commons every now and then. One merchant sell to evils one to Good, they have most of the common spell components on them. <br />
 Merchant in the Bazaar sells all  but Fish Scales, those can be got from one of the merchants in the Dwarf area of Shadow Haven.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>JoarAddam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You can also buy spell components in the Bazaar, 1st or 2nd guy on the left in the 1st merchant building from Nexus zone in.</div></div><hr />
