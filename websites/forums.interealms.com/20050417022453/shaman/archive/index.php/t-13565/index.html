<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Linanae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hi,<br />
I am a 42 shaman with 39 pet (cleric bot buffed me and the pet he was 56) had to go to the left of the zone of KC because of the adds and wanderers near the zone. Invis (as you know) does not work the majority of the time.  <br />
<br />
With all that said he is what you will see:<br />
<br />
2 static drovlargs guarding the door<br />
-sub note if you are to close to the edge inside they attack through the walls like in unrest<br />
2 wandering drovlargs at front pilars<br />
1 wandering cockatrice <br />
2 wandering drachs (recluse is the common one a ranger class with poison dots)<br />
standard 6 minute spawn time<br />
<br />
I have seen a level 56 mage earth pet with lava shield get torn up with adds here.<br />
Kilvas potion is nice here put not worth it below forty. SO make sure to donate for thorns (it helps) as well as the higher level of spitual line from beast lord.<br />
<br />
6 kills yeilds about<br />
30 plat <br />
<br />
items <br />
bronze large (various pieces)<br />
bronze weapons (various)<br />
Rusty weapons<br />
silks<br />
drach silks<br />
venom sacks<br />
web sac<br />
cockatrice beaks<br />
hides (brutes)<br />
if you pull giants standard loot from them<br />
<br />
<br />
At 42 every thing is blue yeilding about 1/4 blue to 3/4's pending on the pull. At level 30 everything should be red doing about half a yellow if they can handle it. Since the level difference of the mob verse pc is so great a damage shield would be advised and possibly BOA.<br />
<br />
Middle or North ruins is a safer spot for boxing for PL'ing <br />
<br />
Another sugestion is DSP Mushroom sanctuary 10 spawns (20% chance for sk mushroom). Easy to monitor your characters health and just stand back and buff occasionally.(cash loot is real slim but item loot is off the chart)<br />
<br />
*-Hope this helps a little</div></div><hr />
