<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vectors</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Have been hunting in JP for about two weeks now.  It is so easy that I feel like it is cheating.<br />
<br />
I have killed dozens and dozens of griffons, yet to get the eye or ear ring, but I have yet to hit a damn griffon with an arrow.<br />
<br />
I am level 51, my archery is about 180 or so.  I have shot hundreds of arrows, but have never hit.<br />
<br />
My arrows are vendor purchased, the cheap ones.  I don't have a lot of time to play, nor much plat.<br />
<br />
So, do I just suck at archery, or are others also having a tough time hitting griffons n JP?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grogz Swiftfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Noticed this also, then just assumed it is because they &quot;magic&quot; creatures and arrows not magic till silver tipped... stopped trying. dont know if this is fact but..... my 2cp worth <br />
<br />
So little play time can't even be bothered to check  =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vectors</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In the old days, it gave you a message saying something like &quot;You need a magical weapon.&quot; or something.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>pelloquin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes, you need magic arrows to hit the Griffs in Jagged Pine.<br />
<br />
Had some left over Raid Arrows (AKA Silver Max Damage/Range) and tested this out...<br />
<br />
Bear in mind the griffs seem to path to the nearest possible tree just to blow your LOS/height... Griffs just don't make for good Bow Kiting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Raltar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you have your misses turned off, you won't get the message that they are immune to normal weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Arath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok not wanting to sound stupid but what eye and what earring?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Karloss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You should get a message sayiung that your target is INVULERABLE....and the invulerable bit is in caps....but as said above I think it doesn't show with misses disabled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>fandain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">griffon earring (6ac 3agi 10hp ear) and griffon aye (N20cha 10wis 20hp range), drop rarely of griffons, i solod griffons for about 2-3 lvls so that should be atleast 500kills, gotten 3 earring, 6 eyes. great xp till 53, at 54 it became alot less</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tyrolene</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">6 eyes!?  I've gotten one each, eye and earring.  About 750 griffon kills according to my log parser.<br />
<br />
Stupid random number generator.   :p<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>hebuorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">yea FEAR the Vi random generator ;)  he will get rid of our mind soon ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Talyena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm having the same luck in Jagged Pine ( /rude to RNG). One level earned here, maybe 100 Griffon kills (also killed Griffawns when they were blue) and I've seen one earring and zero eyes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Archyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Duoed with a druidess I know that was wanting some help getting griff meat for baking (evidently griff melt or griff patty melt or whatever trivials at 250 and is a hot item for those working trades) we killed for probably 10 hours straight, netting about 60 griff meats, 1 eye (gave to her even though she insisted on rolling since we both shared the risk) and no earrings....got numerous bloods (used for???) and wings (used for???) we also tagged the infrequent anaconda netting the occasional meat and coin, but I have yet to loot the snake fang they drop.....<br />
Exp was very nice at 47 and was very nice at my current level as well (48) its soloable, but hard since the griffs do hit for around 100 from time to time and I wouldnt even think of tagging a anaconda at my level solo.....will return when I am in my early 50s and wear the place out.<br />
As for arrows and griffins, I use the summoned type, but I am pretty sure that even if you have hits turned off that you get the message they are immune to non magical attacks.....havent checked this for certain but am pretty sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Daerian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You dont need magic tipped arrows to hit the griffs in this zone, i use my tolans bracer arrows and they hit fine, although i do miss about 2/3 with a skill of 164</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rainingdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Arent Summoned arrows (mage or Tolan's) considered magic arrows anyway?<br />
<br />
Happy Hunting</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Penvaran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">yes, i am almost sure that Tolan's arrows are magic.  I've only killed about a dozen griffs JP, guess I got luck to get an earing.<br />
<br />
Penvaran 53 ranger on Xegony</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Summoned arrows are considered magic, yes.<br />
<br />
Grifenne (sp) blood is used to make the royal temper for Qeynos smithing.  The griff feathers you should know about, they are part of the recipe for the best quiver around, the fleeting quiver.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Brannuer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Here's a tip on fear kiting the griffs that I find works pretty consistently for me. Note that I fear kite mainly in a large open valley South East of the Fort, directly West of the 'good' gnolls tunnel (don't remember their names atm), and right beside a  ridge which, if I run East over it, gets me to the poacher camp and then the river. Sorry I don't have the loc. I hunt here because there is a wide open grassy bowl with no trees and few rocks. Easy on lag and the feet too.<br />
<br />
I pull with snare/ensnare back to the back of the valley, which is the South wall of the zone. What I've noticed is that there is a centerline of the valley, as well as two other, umm, 'boundary lines we'll call them, that seem to be near the base of each of the ridges that seem to decide where your griff will go.<br />
Essentially I think these are mob pathing lines, but I'm just guessing. When you hit a griff with Panic Animal, he'll turn in the direction the line closest to him and keep going that direction until(if) you attack. <br />
<br />
So to steer him, I let him path to me (he's aggro'ed with snare, so he'll follow you) until he's closest to the line I want him to go along, Panic to get him directly towards the line, then attack when I've got a clear path North. It will always, immediately turn North and fly North when I attack.<br />
<br />
When fear wears off I path him back to the start if I'm feeling neat and tidy, or just keep fearing him along. I have a contest with myself now to see how short a distance I have to kite him go before he dies, since it is always straight north.<br />
<br />
This is what I've found in the spot I'm most familiar with, and seem like it works in other areas, though you'll have to find the magic tracks in whatever area you choose to camp. I've also found this to work the same with anaconda's with the added benefit that I don't have to have magic arrows to hit them )</div></div><hr />
