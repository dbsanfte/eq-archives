<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Orecets Ellrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok so I JUST NOW dinged 45, I tried a few pulls with the JBB and holy crap does it make soloing quick.<br />
<br />
My question is how do you guys use your Jbbs at this level? Let the pet tank and chain cast? Stand in and tank while casting? Do you still dot?<br />
<br />
What works best for YOU?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I got my JBB at 46, and to pay off lones, Gornit was #1 enemy. I would just pull with slow, dot, root, blast away, down very quick, and i used like crappy slow just so i could get a quick root when it broke, and i think Envenomed breath to save mana. In groups if im not main healer, JBB 24/7 get in like 3 blasts before the mob goes down, and when i was healer, or had to slow, i would get one in once in awhile.<br />
<br />
At 48, i would take down skeles in DL, i would pull with JBB, root, JBB and root when nescary</div></div><hr />
