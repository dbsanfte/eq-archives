<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ginch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">alright i play on stromm.. put over 80k into my char now and im 57... not missing any of my spells up to level 58 except torpor... but who even cares..<br />
<br />
why are beastlords so overpowered... im 57 all tae armow soulstripper earing of soulstice dragmoor and i still suck max defense max 1hb nearly all max skills yet beastlords will rippp through mobs so much faster then me and my pet.. our spells cost way to much mana.. was in dulak and a 50 beastlord was killing the boat beside me while sitting on his ass im pressing canni every 3 seconds just to get enough mana to keep going but he was killing faster sitting on his ass then i was doing every spell and tactic i can think of.<br />
<br />
so tonight i decide ill group in ldon again.. got invite into a high level group all 60 - 62 maby little high for me but i join group and start buffing they say im on DPS i said i cant really put out much but ill use my rain spellsn useless pet. 540DD x 3 IF im damn lucky. so i start buffing the 2 beasty's start laughing dont need to buff us we can do it ourself... spent only 5k on infution of spirit yet they have the spell? ***<br />
<br />
so we get inside they are the onse slowing they do double my dps they got all my buffs what am i usefull for? the chanter said oh we have a shammy what are they for? really regretting i ever spent so much time on this char when i had a 40 alt beast and remade him into a shammy what a waste of time recommend all low level shammys make beast cause you can tank better. do double the dps get waaay better AA and spells like group mana regen/health regen..<br />
<br />
the beast was casting paragon or something regened my mana and hp fast... like ***..<br />
<br />
i got my useless green pet which cost me 5500pp a level 55 pet that is no differnt then my level 49 or whatever useless other one. my WAAAY to costly mana spells i felt so useless i dont feel like playing my char anymore.<br />
<br />
just felt like venting does it get any better? i was excited to get my 7500pp canni 4 spell that  got scammed on i wanted it so bad havent seen it in 2 weeks so i bought it.. but if this is how good we get im going to play my beast... proc with 2 weps for 300dd each wep.. lol my dd isnt even that much and im oom or canni spamming in everonse face i feel embarresed casting it so much causing lag and spam.</div></div><hr />

Well theres your first probllem. You need to learn what spells you get at what levels.<br />
<br />
spent only 5k on infution of spirit yet they have the spell? *** <br />
<br />
Well seeing how it is a Bst spell and not a shm spell. And BTW not worth 5K imo.<br />
<br />
Really Bst are not over powerd. Odds are the one on the next boat was also higher lv then you and or had better gear. And lets not forget that theres a good chance he was on a easier boat.<br />
<br />
Come on instead of whineing about Bst. Why not try to find out where your going wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/shrug..i love my shaman.  Sure theres a lot of classes that can do so much more than us, but at the end of a HUGE pull, after parking mobs, slowing, dotting, playing back up healer, keeping up the buffs as needed and im at 60% mana and everyone else is OOM, broken, battered and bruised, I love me even more.  If you want to be a speed kill freak then youve go tthe wrong class, personally I enjoy the slow agonizing death a mob takes..makes it more personal :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">First off, its very hard to read through a post as badly written as that. Sometimes I wonder if grammer is still being taught in public schools.<br />
<br />
Our slow is the best in the game, about twice as effective as a Beastlords. Beastlords don't get a haste until very high level, and then it is a version you have long since buried in the back of your spell book. <br />
As far a buffs, they do not have anything that compares to ours for groups. Not sure what they can do for themselves, but I always include them in my buffing rotation and have never heard one say that he could do better for himself. Of course they do better DPS, that is the whole point to their class.<br />
Sounds to me like you do not clearly understand the importance of your own class to the game. <br />
As for the group you joined, it was a pickup group. Never know what your gonna get in a pickup group. If they already have a chanter for haste and have decided (for some reason) to let one of the beastlords do slowing for the group, there was no need to add a shaman to the mix. DPS is not our strong point.<br />
Spend some more time playing the game, get a better understanding or every classes strengths and weaknesses, and see if you feel the same later on. Oh, and try to group with better quality people, it makes a world of difference.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if shammy slow was double as good as beastlords we would have a 100%plus slow :P<br />
<br />
as far as grammar if you cant read it then maby you need to go to school.<br />
<br />
ive played all my 8 slots the only char i have not played yet to level 35 and ive deleted and remade a few has been a wizard and a cleric and i can tell you shammy is no where near the bottom of the classes. but the only real need for a shaman is when your raiding dragons and high end mobs nothing really more is needed..<br />
<br />
in a typical ldon group pickup or not i've seen pickup groups play very well in under 40 mins finished missions. <br />
<br />
but no one really takes any damage at all.. so why waste that BIG slow for a mob that drops in less than 20 seconds takes me 10 seconds to cast my weak DD that a cleric can cast.. i just see alot more strengths in the beastlord class. when i was low level we had our place, now that we are high level somehow beastlords are only 8 levels behind on our spells/buffs PLUS extra buffs. they should'nt even get them. its like a paladin getting temp or pally getting cheal or other good cleric buffs. or other hybrids getting the spells that the main class got plus they can melee 5x as well.<br />
<br />
mainly what do we do better then the beastlord class that is significant in 99% of our gameplay time... everyone stats are maxed by level 65 specially with just beastlord buffs. so what significant role do we play when our slow is only a Wee bit slower then theres.<br />
<br />
no need to delete chars or break my cd's. just posting my opinion. <br />
<br />
and as far as money goes for spells i dont really care about that but the gameplay of the chars. beast does 100% better then us in most situations yet there a HYBRID of us.</div></div><hr />

oh no call the cops :P <br />

i was to concentrated on getting canni 4 and torpor my mistake.<br />
dont think i will need it anymore after reading beastlord board the worste complaints they can throw out is... why dont we get a group IOS spell or why no AGI spell... sounds like a hard life as a beastlord.<br />

Nah, don't think he's a troll.  He does need to work on grammar and spelling though.<br />
<br />
I think he's just got the wrong idea about what shamans are good for.   like being a shaman because I am an enabler.  I allow the group to do things they couldn't do without a shaman and I like that.  Soloing bores the ever-loving **** out of me.  Shamans are a great, and highly sought-after, grouping class.  If that's not your play-style, I'd switch to your beastlord.  Or buy another computer and PL a monk (or whatever DPS class you choose) up to the 50s and have the best of both worlds.<br />
<br />
As for LDoN, I spent 90 minutes on my 53 warrior looking for an adventure.  I gave up and switched to my 61 shaman.  I had 4 tells for groups, ranging from Tier 2 to LDoN, within 3 minutes.  Folks pretty much universally love a shaman in their group.  I'm not sure where you get your information on people not taking damage in LDoN, but most mobs I've encountered hit for substantial damage and we usually have 2-4 at a time.  The recast on Turgur's is a pain, but I can usually have everything under control before the first mob hits the deck and without me, the group is in a world of hurt as we typically don't have an enchanter or other form of CC.  <br />
<br />
I lifted this from the monkly-business boards (here (http://pub147.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=42221.topic), 6th post down): <br />
<br />
&quot;Shaman - can solo anything. Not quickly, come back in half an hour.&quot; <br />
<br />
BLs do substantially more DPS than us.  That's what they do.  That's not what we do.  We make groups collosally more effective.  We can solo very effectively, but not very quickly.  At least not relative to some classes.<br />
<br />
as a final aside, Infusion runs 3-4k on Prexus, but it'll probably never go into my book.  There are many other things out there I'd rather spend that platinum on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">1) At level 57, 62 Beastlords have similar buffs. Your buffs will become better at 60 once and for all and at 65 they will be demanded.<br />
<br />
2) Paragon of Spirit is a buttload of AAs with a 15 minute refresh. It's good, but it's not all that and a bag of chips.<br />
<br />
3) Your slow is still superior even if you cannot cast as fast as Beastlords can, and you can keep up mana to slow indefinetely on your own thanks to Cannabalize. Beastlords will run oom in short order if they have to slow constantly without KEI. The Spiritual series helps but it's not enough.<br />
<br />
4) Beastlords cannot heal worth a crap in a group. You can. Very, very efficiently later in the game.<br />
<br />
5) You get Malo(s). You cannot possibly understand how crucial this spell is until you raid.<br />
<br />
6) You get Torpor in three levels. It will completely change how you play the game, I promise you. Your staying power will be second to none until you hit PoP, and even then it will be enough to gain solo XP tanking in the face in Tier 1 zones.<br />
<br />
7) SHAMANS ARE PRIEST. They are not melees, and they are not a pet class. Until you get Torpor you shouldn't be tanking in teh face unless the mobs are total wimps. Your pet will never be a tank and it will never do significant DPS. However dogdog is still the most efficient use of mana in a group for DPS over a span of more than a couple minutes.<br />
<br />
8) Shaman DPS sucks. Accept it and move on. If you want to nuke, play a wizard. Your job is to boost the efficiency of everyone around you. You slow and crowd control to make the Cleric's heals go further. You buff to increase the DPS of the melees. Again, Avatar goes a long way to making this happen, something you don't have yet. Ferine Avatar can boost melee DPS to ridiculous levels. And you have the mana to do all of this without requiring KEI, because you can gnaw on your own arm for mana at will.<br />
<br />
If you group with people five levels higher than you, of course they are going to show you up. In five levels you will have come to power and I hope you view Shamans differently.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Infusion of Spirit is a 49 shaman spell, unless they changed it recently...but since its a 61 Bst spell you can only get it by turn in eth parchments to Bst trainer in pok library. Regardless, 5k is an absurd price for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>ginch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">i wont sit and fight over what class is better i just feel shamans should be more powerful then the beastlord. shaman is no where near the bottom of classes. <br />
  Lately ive heard alot of people asking whats the use of shaman when people shout 34 shaman lfg and such in BB. 2 beastlords will rip through mobs literally. there slow is a wee bit less then ours with the same recast on it. and most ldon groups ive been in on my beastlord dont even use slow.  there pet makes up for them not getting haste spell. the wepons available for them with procs that are doing 300dd is enough to make our 10 second cast on DD a joke. I use the rain spell and its resisted 1/3 - 2/3 rarely get all 3 off. with ldon DPS is king forsure. ive only played on stromm so i have no idea of the other servers. Tried one but everyone was to uber to even group.. <br />
<br />
  Ill keep my shammy only for doing raids if my guild ever gets high enough. other then that hes getting retired. beast may not get the buffs we do at low level but by the time there high level they got as good as us buffs plus the dps, stats are capped by level 50 anyways with IOS on most people they would say my wow my stats are capped... ill just have to wait 10 levels extra on my beast to do that but its worth it.  <br />
<br />
<br />
now go at it grammAr police lol<br />
<br />
Edit: my main is a shaman dont need to flame me cause im cutting my own class down im just disapointed in how much time and effort i put into this char seeing high nukes at lower levels and decent dots and now no dps at high levels.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>zymar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">BSTS and shamans are totally different.<br />
<br />
personally, a BST can do more damage faster than I can and yeah they have some buffs that keep them very similar to us but uhm... <br />
<br />
I almost never say &quot;oom&quot; or if i do, its for about 10 canni's  then im good again.<br />
<br />
why would you waste time casting a big slow? coz it doesn't use much mana and casts in 3 seconds?<br />
<br />
Obviously you want to do DPS, then play a bst.<br />
<br />
Shaman are buffers/debuffers/ghetto healers.<br />
<br />
<br />
And bsts dont get malo, they don't get focus, they don't get disease slow to my knowledge, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">BST = slower + dps<br />
SHM = debuffer + healer + CC<br />
Why are you even comparing the 2 of them?<br />
BST can't play main healers in xp groups.<br />
BST can't deal with 4+ mobs on a pull since they don't have root.<br />
BST can slow multiple adds, then get to sit on their ass and forget about adding real dps since they need to actually med to get mana back.<br />
It's like comparing the power of being a main healer for a group between a druid and a shaman.  The druid is flat out a better healer, but that doesn't matter because we don't try to be better healers.<br />

<br />
Have a 52 kitty beasty as well. Only play when I can not get a group in the first five minutes on my shm. Very seldom. But he was even more fun to play before they nerfed his CH...Oh boy those were fun times.<br />
<br />
Warriors are another awesome class that do need a better aggro system. I was grouped with a 65 war and he was a kitty. Thought for sure I would be stealing aggro but it only happend a few times and I was trying with Malo, Slow, Pox, Bane, and some dd. But only a few hits where dished out on me by the mobs (PoV inner). Usually I can steal mad aggro from most tanks I have grouped with. Warriors do need to get some boosts some way.</div></div><hr />

To the original post:<br />
<br />
Noone forced you to spend 80K (80k for a lvl 57 char?? ***?). Yes spell prices suck, but maybe you were a bit too impatient here /shrug.<br />
<br />
And complaining about a group with chanter and beast, where you as lower level shammie don't find a good role in group - that really made me laughing. What did you expect? You group with 2 classes and higher level ones at that, that share some of your core abilities (haste, slow) and surprise, surprise, some of your efficiency for group gets lost.<br />
<br />
When that happens and group members doesn't stack perfectly, just try to live through it as best as you can.<br />
<br />
As a final note - never ever let someone else in group 'dictate' your role. Sure discuss the roles in group, but when you feel, it isn't going to work, better leave upfront.</div></div><hr />

You grouped with higher level characters in a situation-specific environment - you didn't expect them to be as powerful or moreso than you?? Level to level, beasties and shaman compliment each other well. CanniV and Paragon alone will have you at more mana than you can get rid of in most situations. Remember, the glass is half full...<br />

Good god man, i would love it my group told me i was on DPS, i would be raining tears of sarynn and casting blood of sarynn with velium strike up the arse.

At 58 and LDoN you have a ver useful set of spells, you have AE slow - BAM incoming 3 all slowed.  you have rains if you dont have CC, you have dogdog.  you have dots, you have nukes, you can canni.  <br />
<br />
Just cause you have 80K and a full spell book dont make you smart.  Read what the spells do, play around with them figure out how to make the most effective shaman you can.<br />
<br />
Last night i switched up a few of my spells, took out root for CC (don't really use it that much put in AE slow for the multiples), took out breath of ultor (no sense double doting) and put in a rain spell.  We were ripping through adventures like mad and I finally got my incorpreal chains last night WOOOOOOOO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Shaman DPS really isn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be. Bane is really an awesome spell.<br />
<br />
The last fight I parsed was TVX in VT (gimp I know~). This is how it played out. We had like 30 people there so it was extreme overkill but there just wasn't anything else up to kill.<br />
<br />
Wizard 59k - 157dps<br />
Wizard 52k - 139dps<br />
Rogue 50k (sux daggers) - 135dps<br />
Monk 49k (17/19 + 17/20) - 130dps<br />
Wizard 45k (botting a bard) - 119dps<br />
Enc 44k - 116dps<br />
Ranger 42k (walled) - 115dps<br />
Me 42k - 112dps<br />
<br />
So Ranger Melee + Nukes == Shaman DPS unless your melee have Elemental weapons or something.<br />
<br />
I don't exactly thing it's right for a pure Melee in pure damage mode to only be out-damaging a support class by about 15-20% either.</div></div><hr />

Im having trouble seeing where we disagree or where im wrong. I never said we are a direct replacement for anything. I figured a lil common sense would be used when reading that, since we are all shaman. But many times a wrong choice to assume everyone will get your words cause they arent in your head. Let me try to clear up...<br />
<br />
All i know is how i play. If a tank goes down i can take the hits to keep the group alive and continue pulling till warrior runs back to LDoN or gets rez in exp group. If there is no enchanter, with VP and root i can more then handle  CC.  If we dont have someone to Lull or Pac i can step in the room of a LDoN adventure i root 1 and let the 2 beat on me till the tank pulls one off then VP/slow/root the one on me and viola, we have 3-4 mobs split. I have been the main healer in BoT groups and LDoN adventures. Also when the group is going well and i can start hitting my rains ad nukes, im not a wizard, but im definetly adding a noticable DPS boost.<br />
<br />
I dunno man, maybe we just play differently or something, i just know what i have done myself. /shrug<br />
<br />
So no i cant be a equal replacement for every class out there, but if i work hard i can fill there spot pretty effectivly in MOST cases. <br />
<br />
I hope that states my opinion more clearly.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Gagner67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">First Giac is pro Beastlord anyway you dice it.<br />
<br />
Ginch is brand new to the shaman boards.  And has admitted from the start of his level 40 BST he really has been bent on BST from the start.<br />
<br />
What Giac and Ginch don't know:<br />
<br />
1.  The popular public still picks and looks for Shamans for high level exp start up groups.  Why?  <br />
<br />
Simply because they have been told themselves since level 1 shamans give the best stat buffs and further help the group with the best slow.<br />
<br />
(Its all about what betters another that ppl really care about!  After all, it is human nature.)<br />
<br />
<br />
2.  Focus of Soul + Strength of Diaku from shamans &gt;  Infusion from Beastlords<br />
<br />
<br />
3.  Beastlords whine the most out of any class I have been grouped with for buffs from a shaman.  <br />
a.  Beastlords have asked me to FoS and Diaku for their pets so they proc more.<br />
b.  Beastlords ask for FoS and Diaku for themselves, for procs.<br />
c.  Beastlords whine the most about getting FA cast on them by a shaman.<br />
d.  When without an enchanter a Beastlords whines for Swift like the Wind from a shaman.  <br />
<br />
<br />
4.  Shamans handle Crowd control &gt; Beastlords<br />
<br />
<br />
5.  Admittedly, beastlords are ment for a DPS slot in the group.  But beastlords are second best at constant DPS.<br />
<br />
In a group when some one says we need DPS first thing that comes to mind of the group is look for a MAGE.  <br />
a. Mage's rain damage &gt; Beastlord melee<br />
b. Mage's pet &gt; Beastlord pet<br />
c. Mages offer summoned toys for the group (Beastlord DOESN'T)<br />
<br />
(Note:  As stated a Shaman's poison RAIN spells back to back, Bane DOT, and pet isn't to far from the DPS of a beastlord &amp; pet.)  <br />
<br />
*** But honestly our class is 'not' picked up for the DPS slot but for a &quot;utility slot.&quot;  Primarily for slow inwhich SHAMANS are second to NONE.<br />
<br />
<br />
6.  Shamans cast Malo and it is the best resistence debuff which allows other classes to land their spells.  <br />
Beastlords DON'T get this.  <br />
INFACT, Beastlords don't help the group in this area at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
7.  Shaman slow is &gt; beastlord slow.  <br />
(If a group is relying on a Beastlord's slow then that group's tank is taking 40% MORE damage.)  <br />
<br />
<br />
8.  Shamans heals &gt; beastlord heals<br />
(Note:  I think it is hilarious, that due to repostes beastlords take more damage in solo situations by their method of meleeing a mob.) <br />
<br />
<br />
9.  On that note, Shamans solo BIGGER mobs better than beastloards<br />
<br />
<br />
10.  And Shamans have more options when soloing than beastlords.  Often allowing Shamans to take two or more mobs at a time while taking NO DAMAGE.  {*hug* Root Rot!}<br />
<br />
<br />
Ginch and Giac, Why would I want to be a beastlord where I then am only SECOND best to a shaman?</div></div><hr />

<br />
oh cool.  you're in the elemental planes.  *twirls his fingers* woo hoo.<br />
<br />
who cares.  knowing the shaman class is mutually exclusive to having EP access.  will EP access change your strategies? undoubtedly.  are all other non-EP shamans stumbling around in the dark? no.<br />
<br />
everything he said was true.  the fact that other classes are better at their specialty is irrelevant to his assertions.  may as well add warriors are better tanks than shamans to your post.  it's equally irrelevant.<br />
<br />
shamans are very versatile.  undisputable fact.<br />
<br />
are they the best at everything?  no.<br />
<br />
are they a very desireable class for a group? yes, despite the fact you don't like/prefer them.  I get tells for groups all the time, LFG or not, for LDoN and PoP from people I've never grouped with.  It's anecdotal, sure, but I suspect most people feel the same way.<br />
<br />
finally... trivial vs. non-trivial?  that's way too fluid a distinction to base an argument on.  what makes something non-trivial?  i'd bet a PoTime-farming guild would consider LDoN hard adventures (or your elemental planes) trivial, whereas my guild wouldn't (or couldn't) set foot in one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>howie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">So much hate, where's all the LOVE.  I love beast's, have a lvl 20 that don't get played much.  As an elemental shaman though I get 5 tells within 5 mins of loggin on for groups everywhere.  I can solo in fire, heal in earth with a 3 man group while still slowing and dotting.  All of this takes a longer time ofcourse, but it can be done.  If you give up on your shaman now you'll never know what you're missing on the higher lvl shaman.  Can a beast out melee me?  Yeah most of the time, but I DON'T envy them.  Like was stated in previous post, if a beast's buffs were = to yours, then more than likey he was 10+ levels above you.  Beast buff spells are about 13 levels behind a shaman.  I think if you're not enjoying the class or it's not what you expected then maybe it's time for you to move on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I dunno, I always thought it was the non-trivial where Shamans shined, and we lost something in the trivial. When you have stuff hitting hard and fast, groups want the best slow and backup heals from a Shaman plus some CCing ability. When the mobs damage output becomes trivial and it's all about DPS is where we seem to fall behind a little.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">While I almosty completely agree with Gagner67 here (most of his examples have been the case in groups I've been in) I think we're comparing apples and oranges here.<br />
<br />
My regular group is mostly DPS and junk teir 2 and 3 mobs generally last 10-20 seconds in camp before coughing up exp.  If I miss on the first slow (ie: resist) then the second slow is trivial as it covers all of 2-12 seconds of the fight (approx).  I can fix the damage with a Q before the mob dies and the SK (MA and puller roles) is healed before the next mob arrives in camp.  I basically only need to slow on nameds and in cases where the necro doesn't get a great pet (ie: BoT).  In ideal situations I'm not needed at all aside from my buffs (haste, focus, FA, diaku, *cough* agil *cough* placebo *cough*, Stam, shrink/grow).  When you have 3 party members who crank out 800-1000 dps without breaking a sweat or pulling aggro off of the SK, then any damage I can do is largely marginal.  In THEORY, I offer almost NOTHING to the group aside from being a buff bot.  In practice, my group would have wiped tons of times if not for me.  My contribution isn't DPS, but if I got a brain in my head I can make the group live.<br />
<br />
What I'm trying to say here is that in a pure DPS group, our slows, our damage, it's next to frigging useless.  That said I play a key role in my group and I get a hell of a workout everynight.  On multi pulls I off tank and CC adds with slow and root.  When the necro's pet breaks charm, I slow and malosinia the pet for the necro (I've saved him a few times when he can't channel a mez or fd), then usually Q him.  The cleric is usually a bot so I generally keep everyone but the MA healed and with adds I keep the mobs off of the cleric.  While a chanter might be better in some of these roles, he can't do it all.  A shaman can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">i know yer pain, but i honeslty doubt you are cut out for the shaman life. i played on stromm as well, with a beastlord guildleader in an up and coming guild, who has since moved on since i left and killed emp, fairly well seeing as i was there from about naggy-aow. hehe. great guild, but it frustrated me to no end sometimes, cuz i was sitting at lvl 55 as the premier shaman, but the guildleader bst was 65, and kragg + ios was better than anything i could dish out (this was like first 3 months of stromm, IoS wasn't available to me)<br />
<br />
so me as the main buffer, wasn't allowed to buff the MA. frustrated me to no end. <br />
<br />
then i hit 62. focus of soul + str of diaku. oops. i'm better. period.<br />
<br />
<br />
shrug. you're lower than everyone you're playing with. don't expect the same power. get lvl 62 where they are...and just maybe you'll be better, if your dumb twinked ass can find a way there. you whine and bitch about paying 80k and so much for your spells on stromm. i have to say youre an idiot there. i got can4 when i was 62....AFTER i got torpor. picked it up for 2k after watching the baz. you obviously will just go after the first spell you see. ios can still be picked up on stromm for like 400pp.<br />
<br />
so, to sum up my post.<br />
<br />
<br />
1. You're comparing yourself to people 5 lvls higher, at a point in the game where every lvl is a huge power jump.<br />
<br />
2. You are comparing a priest class to a dps class. go ask a lvl 60 bst to solo AEing dragons in WW, and deal with 2-3 adds while they do it. you can at 60, they can't. power is relative. get a ****ing group and learn to play a shaman properly.<br />
<br />
3. You're a spoiled twink who doesn't bother to find decent prices then bitches about high prices.<br />
<br />
go roll a bst, the shaman community will be better off.<br />

OMG I can't out-mitigate plate melee?<br />
<br />
Wow...shaman class must suck....now back to reality.<br />
<br />
I get more groups than necros, and I am more valued in groups.<br />
I mitigate as much damage from a hard-hitting mob as the average DPS class will do during a fight.  If I am not the main healer, that means the main healer is ready to heal for more mobs, faster.<br />
My heals only have to be 25% as efficient as a cleric's a lot of times if I am the healer (thanks built-in slow).<br />
My pet does not require a componant, is not green at 65, dual wields, double-attacks, shields me, enrages, and most importantly can bash-interrupt.<br />
My haste is good enough to bring a melee with a good haste item to 100%, my roots are reasonable CC in a pinch, and I can do damage to a rooted mob while it waits it's turn to die.<br />
If a warrior were to pull a dark blue mob to a corner and start tanking it, alone, he would probably die.  If a shaman slow-pulls a dark-blue mob to a corner and tanks it (with torpor) alone, we will usually win.  Assuming the warrior wins the fight, he will be waiting a long time to heal.  Shaman are ready to pull again in a few seconds (thanks superior mana regen).<br />
<br />
Yes, we are slow.  We do slow DPS, we do slow heals, we solo slower than the 'solo classes' but over time especially in the end-game we are clearly one of the most powerful and most versatile classes in the game.<br />
<br />
I am not going to say the game is balanced, but I have seen shaman worse off than we are now, and as it stands we are not doing bad at all.  Sure there are a couple things that could use tweaking, but we can't point at any one class-defining ability and call it &quot;broken&quot; (see: warriors and monks). <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Honestly, i feel i might just look at the game in a different way. I am not saying my way is the only way one should look at the game. In fact, if you enjoy playing a Shaman, that's fine.<br />
<br />
The way i look at the game is from a high end point of view(no elitist attitude or some crap). The harder the environment the more often you have to rely on specialists. And the Shaman isn't a specialist, nor can he replace one in a &quot;non-trivial&quot; environment.<br />
So in a group of specialists, the Shaman doesn't bring enough to the table. <br />
Before the Slow Mitigation the Shaman somewhat had legitimation to be in that group. After the Slow mitigation, he just does not. <br />
<br />
Let's analyze this: <br />
<br />
I hope we all agree on one thing. Groups primarily want a Shaman for his ability to slow the attack speed of a mob.<br />
That said, let's compare other classes, who can slow to the Shaman in a non-trivial scenario.<br />
After the Slow mitigation implementation my slow is still the best, but does it make a difference? <br />
<br />
Bard:<br />
Wouldn't a bard with a lurish slow, who brings so much more to the table, be more effective? <br />
The bard will make pulling a breeze, he gives mana to he casters, extra haste that exceeds the haste cap to the melees, on top of ATK, DD/DoT foci and most importantly, he will be able to Slow the mob before it actually hits the tank.<br />
<br />
Enchanter:<br />
As much as people want to believe the contrary, the highend Enchanter will be tanking just as good if not better than any Shaman. <br />
His Runes will give him an extra 2300 HP buffer, on top of that, the runes will make interrupting him *really* hard. <br />
The instant Rune AA every 11 minutes is valuable as well. The Enchanter will be contributing around 500 dps with a charmed pet and provide mana regen in form of the best mana regen buff in game.<br />
&quot;Boggle&quot; lowers his hate by 500 per cast, he can stun mob's up to level 65 and actually off them reliably. Did i mention that he can slow virtually as well as a Shaman?<br />
<br />
Beastlord:<br />
The Beastlord provides the fastest casting slow in game and he can actually offtank. He will be adding more HPs than a Shaman, unless you have a Paladin in the group(highend players are supposed to have their Stamina maxed obviously). <br />
The Beast's DPS at the higher spectrum of the game surpasses Monk's. On top of that, he provides the best ATK buff in game, the 2nd best Mana regen buff and a mana heal over time with a recast time of 11 minutes.<br />
<br />
The Shaman:<br />
The Shaman does what he was hired for. He slows the mob better than any other class. Nowadays, the difference is just marginal though. The Shaman adds 543 HPs to the max hitpoints of his groupmembers and can &quot;patch heal&quot; if needed. The Shaman can reliably land slow, due to his ability to debuff, notr as reliable or fast as the bard can though. At the same time, he is arguably the weakest of the slowing classes, when it comes to taking damage and especially dropping aggro. <br />
He adds the 2nd best ATK buff to a melee and can haste anyone by 60%.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let's assume your group setup looks like this and you are exping in a zone where mobs hit for 1k with the occasional named being a little tougher:<br />
<br />
1.Cleric, 2.Warrior, 3.Rogue, 4.Wizard<br />
<br />
Which classes would you fill the group with from the above described classes if you wanted to maximize your effectivness?<br />
<br />
I know i would pick Enchanter and Beastlord/Bard depending on how trivial pulling is. You might have a different preferance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Thlexian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Good grief.  He obviously values fast DPS and melee skills above the inherent superior support abilities that shamans have in abundance.  That's not wrong or bad; it's just not the mindset to play a shaman.  If a beastlord is more appealing to him, he should play a beastlord.  More power to ya, hon, go with our blessings.<br />
<br />
All of the classes have valuable characteristics that appeal differently to different people.  I've not found any class that cannot contribute significantly to a group; you simply adjust the way you play for the mix of classes you have.  Fortunately there are people who find the right mix of skills and capabilities in each of those classes to fit their personal concept of how they want to play.  Let's support those who have been playing the wrong class in finding the right one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">High end game represents a completely different level than where most people play.  <br />
I don't play in areas where mobs hit for 1k.  I wouldn't want to.  It's not my playstyle.<br />
What may be trivial to some is hardly trivial to others.  Content you mastered three expansions ago is still challenging to those of us who can't spend 40 hours a week playing.<br />
Well, it's challenging to some of us, anyway.<br />
Does that mean my opinion doesn't count anymore because I've stayed as far away from PoP as I possibly could?  No, I'm still a shaman, and I still know what we're capable of.<br />
Can I solo a dragon?  Sure.  Can other classes solo it too?  Yeah.  Am I still proud as hell of it?  You betcha! :)<br />
A wise shaman whose name I can't recall referred to himself as the grease that keeps the group running smoothly.  That's what we do.  We can do a little bit of just about everything.  Are we the best at anything?  Stat buffs and slows comes to mind.<br />
We might not be the best choice for any specific situation (other than buffs &amp; slows) but we can fill several other roles as well.  We're not the best at it, but we can do a decent job.<br />
Heck, I amazed a group my first time in PoV.  I was main healer when the cleric dropped group.  They wanted to hold pulls until we could find another cleric, but I loaded up Kragg's and convinced them to try it once, and I was buying rezes if we wiped.  I picked up 3 AA that night :)<br />
<br />
We may not be the best at anything but our buffs and slows, but we can do so much more as well :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">5) You get Malo(s). You cannot possibly understand how crucial this spell is until you raid. <br />
<br />
.... that is soooo true when i apped to Blades i had no malo(s)  and i felt really useless since i couldnt debuff mobs or hell even slow them.  so i did other things like nukeing or healing etc.. etc .. etc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">There are few classes you want for EVERY concievable group, and some groups/camps are not great for shaman.  That said, let me kick the dead horse and address your class info.<br />
<br />
I hope we all agree on one thing. Groups primarily want a Shaman for his ability to slow the attack speed of a mob.<br />
Not entirely true.  Our ability to ghetto CC and heal is good enough to earn us a spot in SOME groups.  It's just some people who look for a shaman don't know any better.<br />
<br />
Before the Slow Mitigation the Shaman somewhat had legitimation to be in that group. After the Slow mitigation, he just does not. <br />
Not true.  The only way a shaman's slow doesn't matter is on fights that are too short for the mana spent to pay off (varies by mob DPS).  Even with mitigation shaman slows are more effective, although marginally so.  If the mob is being kited or root/rotted then the shaman slow isn't needed and it's time to find a new role.  If you're tanking a mob that has, lets say, over 500 DPS unslowed, that shaman slow becomes even more effective as the mobs damage gets ramped up.<br />
<br />
Bard,<br />
All you said was true.  Bards are an amazing and versitile class, but they should be pulling and their haste is short duration which can wear out.  It isn't terribly uncommon to go unhasted for early parts of the fight.  Lastly, I'd take a shaman slow over a bard slow any day of the week on a named or high DPS mob.  Their slow is fine for trivial situations, but when it all hits the fan, give me a shaman slow.  Shaman slow has a base duartion of 5 minutes for those times you have mobs stacked deep, bard slow is considerably shorter.<br />
<br />
Chanter,<br />
OK, I know a well played enchanter is VERY durable, but their slow is a 6.4 second cast and it has to stick because a chanter will lose that 2300hp faster than we will.  2300hp will go FAST if the mob is hitting for 1k and hits often when unslowed.  Most chanters prefer me to slow, even well geared skilled chanters.  That way they can charm a pet and count on me to help em out when things go south.  Despite popular belief, most chanters die and die often when they try to charm high level mobs and generally prefer to do it when they are in a good group that can save their backside.  Their slow is just as mitigated as ours is and has just as much a chance to land.<br />
<br />
BL, awesome class.  I love BLs.  In trivial situations their slows are better because they can cast faster and more often and the % difference isn't as noticable on soft mobs.  That said, they can't cc as well, and can't heal nearly anywhere as well as a shaman.  Paragon is a great ability, but give me Q while the BL is waiting on his ability to refresh.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but I laughed when I saw your group layout.  I can pick a group that better utilises other classes as well.  The situation you picked is so specific it's laughable.  All you need to do is claim the exact camp and you have one example.  I can name a ton where I'd pick a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Bladez Darkwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">You know, honestly, I can see where people get frustrated with their shamans in the 50's.  I was one of the first 50 shaman on Povar back in the day, but shortly after Kunark, I got to 52 and decided that the shaman just wasn't in my cards for the game.  <br />
<br />
     Yeah yeah, I played a monk for three years, but the whole time, I had the yearning to play my shaman again, just didn't have it in me to fight through those years I felt were a pain in the ass, and underpowering.  I mean let's face it, untill higher, you really are nothing more than a slower, your healing power even sucks then, lol.<br />
<br />
     But I'll say this, a few months ago, I decided to say fubar to the monk, take the time to work my shaman up, and now he's to the point of 65, 36AA's(nothing special), some decent gear but nothing special again, and almost a full spellbook.  Honestly, there isn't another class I'd want to play now.  I have a full new respect for the shaman way of life, and know that there are alot of situations where I not only get to sit and debuff, but given our higher level DoT's, I can pour on some damage too.  Find a mage to summon you some pet gear, buff dog dog up, and you can deal out some dps.  If your not a DPS kinda guy, like I'm not, you can sit back, toss some Q's on your tank to save mana for your Main healer, toss some nice regen on the group, and sit back and watch as the true dps classes rape mobs.<br />
<br />
     Personally, there is nothing more fun.  I'm never OOM, and like someone said in here, if I am, it's not for long, ESPECIALLY with cann 5.  So I guess it really depends on your choice of class, do you crave to see that massive DPS?  Enjoy tanking mobs face to face?  Wanna be a main healer?  Choose what you want, and play what is most fun for you.  Best advice anyone could give you, and you'll enjoy the game MUCH more if you do.  Toiling over other classes will do nothing more than drive you insane :P<br />

I love my shammy and feel that I play him well.  I always feel like I contribute to the success of my group (mostly by slowing but also by doing may subtle little things that keep things rolling).<br />

Is Tae armor twink? lol it goes for 11k for the chest 9k for the shield compare that to other servers thats garbage gear.<br />
<br />
but i wanted a main char so i went with the shaman thinking i could see all high end content. but really when im level 65 and my dps is really low and no one needs my buffs because most people will already be capped..if not very close to the caps they only need a little boost when i just wanna sit down and get 50 AA's i think beastlord will be more suited for it. and i want to play high end game. <br />
<br />
There is really no groups a beastlord isnt suited for.<br />
you can stack up 2 3 4 even 5 beastlords in 1 group and not complain but you cant stack up on shammys. with and enchanter beastlord cleric and a tank you can throw ANYTHING else in the mix you dont NEED the shaman. Specifically in ldon. mobs drop so fast that if i miss my 1st slow the mob is already at 50% life and if i throw in my dps Its laughable. the cleric is always full on mana thats why he is meleeing. <br />
<br />
no need to get all jelious on me cause i put time into my char and made money without skipping all my spells at apropriate levels. hes no twink ive made all that cash with him. go lookup IOS again on stromm and get back to me if you think prices are crazy thats if you can even find it for sale...yes canni 3 goes for 100pp - 300pp. but any dropped spell everyone needs it there not common so prices are probably double or tripple other servers that goes for equiptment as well. ALL the haste items are going for 6k plus.<br />

Second, IOS is hardly a needed spell.  If the casters can't handle HoS, they can deal.  I don't put up with whiny casters.<br />
<br />
Third, have you ever SEEN a group of 6 shammies?  Pull with resist debuff, mob's slowed and crippled by the time it's in camp, the DoTs and dogs start flying... it's beautiful :)<br />
<br />
To be honest, a shaman truly shines when things start to go wrong.  Oh no, 6 mobs in camp?  one's dog-parked, and slowly but surely the rest are peeled off and parked.  Yes, the cleric had to work for a minute, but nobody dies and everything's beautiful.  That's what being a shammy is all about.</div></div><hr />

No, you won't get invited to a group for your ability to ghetto CC or patch heal in a non-trivial environment. And by saying that it earns us a spot in *some* groups arent you agreeing upon what i stated?(i.e., that we are *primarily* desired for our ability to slow, even more so if the content isn't trivial)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Bamana DeMoro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">Your &quot;specialist only&quot; theory's a bit off.  Most intelligent group designers will put in a tad of redundancy just in case things go to hell fast.  <br />
<br />
Shamen are the jacks of all trades and thus provide excellent redundancy while still contributing meaninfully to a group.  <br />
<br />
Sure, you could just go with a cleric, but a cleric and shaman in the group is much safer/more efficient.<br />
Sure you could go with just a beastlord for slows, but a shaman and beastlord handle debuffing much faster.  <br />
Sure you could go with just an enchanter for CC, but an an enchanter and shaman together provide excellent CC.<br />
<br />
Nothing ever goes perfectly in EQ.  Bad pulls, LD's, and deaths happen.  Having a shaman in your group increases your chances of surviving each of these.   Smart group designers know this, and include shammies for that very reason.  Play TheoryQuest all you want, the numbers are in your favor as far as &quot;ideal groups&quot; are concerned, but EverQuest is a much different game.  We're one of the most sought-after grouping classes at all levels of the game.  There's a good reason for that.  <br />

<br />
I think I understand your point better.  For any given specific situation, there will be a more ideal set of classes.  I absolutely agree.  <br />
<br />
Shamans, despite what a few people are saying, are in a group for slows primarily.  LDoN groups look for: tank, healer, slower, dps.  Shamans fall in the healer or slower category, generally the latter before the former, though a pair of shamans works exceedingly well to cover both vacancies, at least in normal LDoN runs.  <br />
<br />
In a situation where differing spell slow percentages are largely irrelevant due to mitigation or resists, shamans do have other tricks up their sleeves, but those tricks are generally more effectively performed by another class (CC, DPS, heal).  So I do agree with your point to that extent.  That said, I think the versatility shamans bring is desirable for a variety of reasons: pulls gone bad being a big one.  Specialists are great when everything is going according to plan.  They're not good when taken out of their specialty, obviously.  In those circumstances, give me a shaman any day of the week.<br />
<br />
Shamans are not only the oil for the gears, but they are also an effective safety valve.<br />
<br />
On a side not, I am in total agreement with whoever pointed out the problems with bards slowing: I'd much rather have a mob with a slow spell than a slow song.  If the bard is suddenly unable to perform his duties, guess who's suddenly not slow any more.  I adore grouping with bards, but their big weakness is their song duration, especially for critical functions, like slowing or hasting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Phatcow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">why do you keep talking about DPS .. thats like a cleric talking about DPS ... Lets get one thing straight . all the priest out there who say they can melee this or that are all full of poop.  Our skills are capped so were really not fighting but acting like our pet .. a long duration dot.  AND if you do a good amount melee your a shaman in the top 5 guilds on your server &lt; meaning you have awsome gear.  So you all can go buy your soulstripper's and your procing spears (my vendor thanks you for believing in the hipe about your melee abilities) but lets face it uless you have some sweet azz gear your melee isnt gonna amount to diddly.  This of course is my belief and i'm sticking to it =)<br />
<br />
Besides that the shaman class is amazing and has been the most enjoyable class yet that I have leveled.  Another big point about shaman is that as a group goes 99% of you are all very nice people, I have never meet a shaman I didn't like, well except the frog ones.  BL on the other hand are all twinks and should be treated like twinks.  Do I envy BL's?  Not for one minute because they are just another light tank with some nifty spells.  I seriously have never meet a BL I liked as a player.  I know a few who are good people but for the most part are pretty stupid class.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">Do you see what i mean?<br />
No.<br />
<br />
I get all sorts of invites, even when I'm already in a group.  If I go LFG with my flags advertised, I get invites for any content I'm looking for.  I can walk into a zone, go LFG (maybe shout a couple times) and bang, I'll get a group in 15 minutes or less more often than not.  There are shaman out there doing elemental content that are even more ghetto than I am.  The bottom line is the ONLY reason you might not get to where you want to go, is because practically every Tom, Dick and Mary has a freaking shaman twink.  When I started with this class, we were far and few between and now it seems everyone wants to play one.  We were, and may still be, the flavour of the month.  Usually, the flavour of the month class has a something decent to make people think the grass is greener.<br />
<br />
Giac, you've made a couple of arguable points, but I can manipulate facts as well to make unfounded points.  Yes, we blow in SOME pure DPS groups (but DPS groups have flaws of their own), yes, our slow isn't needed in some TRIVIAL encounters, but when the bear hits the fan, in many groups shaman are practically irreplaceable.<br />
<br />
Show me a group in the elemental planes that isn't kiting, rot/rotting, or (charmed) pet tanking that doesn't prefer a shaman over a BL for the slow spot.  More often than not, we get the spot.<br />
<br />
Let's change that group you posted a little bit.  Drop the wizzie and add a necro, or a chanter.  Suddenly you'll see some very sick DPS poured out that suddenly turns on your cloth caster.  Some charmed chanter pets turn out enough DPS to take down those runes in under 6 seconds.  A chanter can mez or stun (chanter slow takes too long to cast), but a second slow/cc class is a safe buffer to keep your main DPS class alive and happy.  Together you debuff the MR of the mob and you've also slowed the other mobs in camp while the chanter was busy trying to stay alive.  In these situations the shaman has brought additional MR debuffing to keep the pet charmed longer, he's got a faster more effective slow, he's got BU heals, root and can add a few more HP to everyone.  I fail to see why this shaman isn't playing every bit as important a role as anyone else.  Shamans just don't do much for wizards other than debuff resists (which isn't needed most times due to effective lures).<br />
<br />
I've got a few friends in raiding guilds on BB, they tell me that shamans are the class of choice for many groups.  They are not necessary for some camps (but still desired for many camps where other classes can fill in), but they are for others.  If I grouped with 5 guys who were well geared and were 5 levels higher than me (assuming there was a lvl 70 ;)) I'd be feeling pretty useless as well.  Back in the SoV expansion on my first Kael raid, I was lvl 42 and feeling pretty gimpy.  That said, I pulled out my spell book and found ways to make a difference (bind sight, fleeting fury (laugh now, but back then, it made a noticeable difference in melee damage) and even greater heal).  It wasn't a big difference by any stretch, but I shouldn't expect to make a whole hell of a lot of difference when people around me were 10-18 levels higher.  If I did, I'd pray for a nerf.</div></div><hr />

I think that Shaman are still looked for when a group is being formed in most situations, or if the &quot;slower&quot; is leaving, but we are not group breaking. I don't see groups sitting around with 5 folks lamenting on the lack of Shaman around. I play a 65 shaman and sometimes pop into BoT if I have some spare time to see if any grind groups are looking for folks. <br />
<br />
Normally it doesn't take long to get picked up, or if a group is forming in the safe room I will be grabbed.<br />
<br />
More frequently lately I have put a call out and garnered no response. A quick look has shown &gt;40 people grinding. An invis tour of the zone shows several groups grinding away happily with no need for extra people.<br />
<br />
/w shaman<br />
<br />
count &lt;=3.<br />
<br />
Shows that there are situations where we are not needed, which is fine by me, however there is always something to do, or I can go and solo while I wait. Many other classes lack the zone availablity that we do in terms of sustained grinding.<br />
<br />
It all comes down to what makes you happy. If playing a beastlord makes you happy then good luck to you. There is nothing wrong with that. I am not sure I see the point in coming to the Shaman board angrily complaining that Shaman suck compared to class &quot;X&quot;. <br />

Level 50 is so far removed in terms of ability from 65 that I can see why you might get frustrated Ginch. If you grind through the rough patch you will hopefully enjoy your abilities when you hit 65. If you don't want to go through the pain, then don't. Really, it should be a choice based on what you enjoy, not how badly Shaman suck.<br />
<br />
Giac, you raise some interesting points. If your perfect group doesn't include a Shaman no one here can argue if your group will be successful or not. <br />
<br />
Bottom line is I don't see the need to defend the Shaman class, and I am surprised to see so many Shaman arguing with you. Your posts might be better received on other class message boards where you can all pat each other on the back and say how wonderful you are. In the mean time, I will go get a group, or form a group, or solo something.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">Its not always just whether or not a class is good or bad, its whether or not it 'fits' the player.  Beastlords are a much faster, frenzied type class to play.  This fits nicely with how many people want to play.  Shaman is *all* about slow.  We do it all.....slowly.  Its just that slowly isnt for everyone.<br />
A beastlord can kill massive numbers of blue cons one after another, when a shaman is left in the dust.  A shaman is much more likely to make that one, satisfying, BIG kill.  Choose what you like, and enjoy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Bilgoba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">Not soloing.  I was killing mobs a lot faster than a BL with blood/breath/bane.  Just in groups they do more damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Mamluke256</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">First off, its very hard to read through a post as badly written as that. Sometimes I wonder if grammer is still being taught in public schools.<br />
<br />
According to the kid across the street from me it is not.  He wrote a letter to the english department at his school about the lack of grammer lessons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Mathi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">Maybe is it just my server, and maybe it is my memory, but I don't recall going LFG much at all.  <br />
<br />
If I want a group it is pretty simple...type /gu &quot;starting a group, who wants in?&quot; then I pick who I want, and if it is slow I hit / all friends and finish it out.  From what I have seen far too many people are too lazy to start a group and will spend hours LFG with 20 other people LFG nearby hoping someone takes the initiative and invites them into a group.<br />
<br />
Also, some people need to get out of the asinine cleric-warrior-chanter framed group mindset.  Shaman, enchanters, and bards are the ultimate utility classes.   Each is better than the other 2 in different situations, but overall, a shaman can make almost any group composition work.<br />
<br />
The issue at least one of you seems to be having is that you are never the only choice.  You are not &quot;group breaking&quot;.  Again, boo-f*ing-hoo.  Other classes get the all-mighty slow, we don't have a monopoly, so if a group can't find a shaman they have other options.  Shaman bitching about other classes being able to slow is like clerics bitching about other classes being able to heal or wizards bitching about druids being able to evac.<br />
<br />
I have to agree with all the people who say that if you don't like being a shaman, then go away and find the class you like.<br />
<br />
For the people who wil appreciate it, I once had a compliment from a respected enchanter in my first raid guild shortly after I joined.  He said &quot;I may not see you join the raid, but I can tell when you are here.  Everything just goes smoother&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Not once has a BL ever been chosen over me.<br />
<br />
ONLY once has a BL ever replaced me in a group, and it was my idea, AND the goup was NOT happy about it. (I think Shaman are the only ones that really know what a BL can do, so slap on hand for me repping myself with one)<br />
<br />
BL are rare.<br />
<br />
Shaman 60-65 buffs are a staple!, BL buffs are cream,  find me a Tank that prefers BL buffs to shaman buffs. As you said in your post the BL's did not want buffs, fine, bully for them, I bet the Tanks and everyone else wanted your buffs.<br />
<br />
I like shaman, I dont nkow much about BL and I could care less about them, people flock to my groups cause they know I can do nearly anything needed.<br />
<br />
All I need now is Harmo/Lull/Pacify (I know I can SC/root/VP pulll, but its just not the same) and then I'd be unstoppable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">i wont sit and fight over what class is better i just feel shamans should be more powerful then the beastlord.<br />
<br />
There's your biggest problem.  I wouldn't be surprised that no matter what class you choose to play you will always be disappointed and find the grass greener somewhere else.<br />
<br />
Edit: my main is a shaman dont need to flame me cause im cutting my own class down im just disapointed in how much time and effort i put into this char seeing high nukes at lower levels and decent dots and now no dps at high levels.<br />
<br />
Everybody does pretty good damagea at lower levels.  It is pretty funny though that even Shaman do nearly the damage that Wizards can do with nukes at lower levels.  Shaman are a grouping class up until about 51 when you get turgurs.  I hated every second I tried soloing up until then (except for the super low levels of course, but say starting around level 15 or so).  We get crap dots, no pet worth mentioning, no snare, fear, big nukes, low melee, etc and our mana regen hasn't cought up to our spell ineffeciency yet.<br />
<br />
I found it difficult and frustrating to solo, but if I put that same effort into grouping then I made groups rock.  More than once fighting in my regular spots, particularly in old CT, the locals would tell me they felt safer with me there or were glad I was there to get the killing going faster.  Many times even with an Enchanter in the group as well.  At least in your 50's, with the right toys, you have the choice of grouping.<br />
<br />
It's too bad that you aren't willing to wait until you get torpor, canni5, quiessence or ferine avatar.  You may have read on here sometime that a Shaman is reborn when he achieves torpor, then again with canni5, then again at 65 with Q.  What a bummer to have put all that effort in and then hang up the towel right when it's about to get good :)<br />
<br />
I love the Shaman class.  Litgruv sums up my playstyle pretty well.  I can't quad, I can't give you mana, I can't port ya, but damn I can do a whole lot of other things.  The Shaman class can adapt, specialize, or even juggle roles, letting you get whatever out of the class you are willing to put in.<br />
<br />
Slow is just about the last thing on my mind now when I play.  I'm a shaman, I slow, so my presence assumes I'm slowing.  Since that is such a small aspect of the fight, I try to make good use out of the time that I'm not slowing - *insert senseless plug for more spell gem slots here* :)<br />
<br />
I'd like to think that my 1200+ mana per mob does as much good as any other class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">Infusion of Spirit is a 49 shaman spell, unless they changed it recently...but since its a 61 Bst spell you can only get it by turn in eth parchments to Bst trainer in pok library. Regardless, 5k is an absurd price for it.<br />
<br />
What I was saying is that. IOS is a Bst spell that we are allowed to use. Not the other way around. So when the origenal poster was crying that the BST had IOS. Its like well gess what goober they are sapost to its thire spell. Not that it really matter since IOS is very limmited in use to a shaman. And yea in my book a Shaman would be a fool to pay 5k for IOS on any server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>Shamus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">This is REALLY sad. You obviously have shown your inability to understand your class. LDoN is NOT EQ. In fact it's probably the worst thing they could have ever come up with.  Those mobs you drop in LDoN are absolutely no contest for a mob in Planes of Power.  I dare your tank to fight say a Kriger unslowed.<br />
Beastlords get a nice slow at 65 but it's extremely hard to get as a turn in and they have to be 65 as well.  At 57 you're WAY behind the curve of a group of 60's as well.<br />
I really tire of hearing people whine about BL's.  So a BL can walk into a room of greens and rip through them in no time.  Who cares?  I want to see that same BL walk into a room of DB con's and start killing them for exp in a timely fashion.  The BL will get OWNED so bad it's hardly worth mentioning.  Bl's are just another form of DPS who have some moderate &quot;Tanking&quot; abilities.  In a group situation if you are pulling and gets adds a shaman will easily off tank and crowd control the adds.  There's not much the BL can do, other then keep swinging and hope they get healed.  I don't see too many BL's soloing in Bastion of Thunder.  I on the otherhand solo there quite often.<br />
When you get to be 61+ you will find out quickly Almost ALL of your memmed spells will be 61+ because they add THAT much more power to your class.  I personally NEVER have problems getting groups.  Quite the opposite, i have to continually turn down groups even when i am grouped.<br />
Oh by the way i DO play on Stromm and i am a 65 shaman.  You paid WAY too much for some pretty useless spells.  In your defense though prices on Stromm as of recently have become absurd.  The main problem with that is that there are less people farming items and the &quot;Ting's&quot; and their like are flooding PA with so much plat it's just scary.  It's better to just Power to 61+ and just grab up EP's and SP's in BoT.  They drop like candy in there.</div></div><hr />

As someone else stated this guy is expecting more out of the class then will ever be put into it. We not the best at anything we are less a jack of all trades than even a Bard, but what spells we do posses last a heck of a lot longer than songs. We can surely cast more spells and have them sustained than he can twist songs. <br />
<br />
I cant say about anything higher in the end game, im not there yet, but i sure dont feel unwelcome or worthless. Frankly  I get asked to join groups all the time, either as healer or slower, played main heal for PoV group for 4 hours, on top of buffs, didn't really cinch my belt for mana till KEI ran out. Even then pulling barely slowed down. The reason I see that shaman are such a desireable class and do get as much groupage as they do is, <br />
1. Our versatility.<br />
2. Slows<br />
3. Hard time finding specialists in other catagories because sitting on butt healing, charming, is boring, hence reason 1 again.<br />
<br />
Well as far as grammer goes, i type too fast and hardly use a spellchecker, in game as well as internet, most people who tend to go overboard picking on a persons typing skills should really get over their hang ups.<br />
<br />

Now for as bad as the last retyping of that paragraph is Im sure its still very readable because your mind can decypher the scramble easily.<br />

<br />
<br />
I have NEVER EVER been in a group where ppl said no thanks i would rather have BST buffs..  Shaman Buffs are the BEST in the game as far as Melee boosting goes.  Shaman slow is the BEST in the game.  We have the BEST debuffs that i know of..<br />
<br />
<br />
We are NOT a DPS class but i have been ldon missions where i was a dps'r.  We can put out some dps if you know how to play your class.  Dogdog can put out about 30+dps IF you have him equiped with mage weps AND hasted.  On regular ldon mobs i can do about 4-5k dmg myself.  Tears of saryne is a good spell sure it will miss every now and then but even if hit 2/3 that is still 1300pts of dmg.  And it is AE so if you play with the right ppl they will have your mobs stacked for you and that is alot of dmg.<br />
<br />
Comparing Shaman to beast is just plain stupid.  <br />
<br />
<br />
I think if you actually learnd how to play your shaman you would enjoy it.<br />

did they change beastlords in the last day?  As of two days ago a beastlord could effectively solo Dk Blue conning mobs in a lot of zones for experience.  Sure they wont have it too easy in tier3+ planes, but anything under that...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>Wisey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">Shaman low DPS?  Hmm...yesterday I just soloed a few PoV golems with Bane, Blood, Breath, Ancient:SoN and killed them fast before they even got any chance of hitting me.  I understand more uber shamans even soloed guards in PoF c3.  I wondered if beastlords could solo one of those guards.<br />
<br />
And if my DPS is low, why warriors, pallies, SKs couldn't remove aggro from me when I was in their group?  With a few DoTs, I am damaging mobs like &gt;1000 HP per tick.<br />
<br />
With VoQ, horse, affliction efficiency 4 focus, one golem took about 25% of my mana and with well-timed Canni5, my mana was above 60% at any one time.<br />
<br />
Sometimes in a raid, I really wish the raidforce of 50 + would bug our beastlords for buffs rather than me.  But no such luck. Even the beastlords bugged me for buffs )<br />
<br />
I am not even going to explain to a low level shaman about our healing power at lvl 65 and with the healing AAs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">Shaman direct damage is sub par.  A lot of the shaman effectiveness, though, is vicarious.  For those in public school, that means that shaman do a lot of damage by increasing the DPS of others in the group.<br />
<br />
Your typical group consists of at least one tank and one pet (your dog).  Both of those are going to be significantly enhanced by your buffs and debuffs.<br />
<br />
One specific example - you directly add hitpoints and AC to the tank and slow a mob, which makes the healer of the group more efficient.  This often allows clerics the time and mana to whip out their hammer pet, nukes, or proc hammer.  The cleric DPS in this case wouldn't have been done at all if it weren't for the shaman's addition to the group.  As a shaman, you get to claim your DPS plus that of the cleric... :)<br />
<br />
In the case of being a lowbie in the group, every class sucks there, except Cleric.  Clerics get a CH at level 30 something that allows them to hang with just about any level group as long as their mana pool can stand it.  The rest of the classes will have reduced effectiveness due to the fact they can't hit the mob with spells or melee due to the level difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u96"><b>Cateye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p96">Dunno if it has been mentioned before since I do not have the time to read all of this long post, but it was said that our slow is only a wee bit better than that of a BL or a chanty.<br />
<br />
This is simply not true.<br />
<br />
Slow is not a linear function, it is determined in a progressive way... so 75% slow is not 5% more than 70%, it is much much more.<br />
I cannot find the formula atm but will post it if i manage to dig it out. Actually everyone who has tanked a raid target yet knows the difference between a 70% and a 75% slow... it is huge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>Vulash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">Ok I'm going to talk only LDoN since you don't dispute shaman are great for raiding.<br />
<br />
I'm one of those people that rip out 40 minutes wins, and that is with a group of friends in very humble gear.  When we (and almost anyone I&quot;ve seen) start a LDoN group, here is what we get, assuming we aren't adding friends and accepting strange group make ups.<br />
<br />
Main healer:  Druid/Cleric<br />
Tank: Pal/SK/War<br />
Slower: Shaman/Enchanter<br />
DD<br />
DD<br />
DD<br />
<br />
So yes, DD is king.  We try to make sure one of those classes can pull.  Normally we have the same cleric all the time, and she is an amazing puller.  Now here is where the beastlord fails.  Yes a bst can slow 65% if they happen to have that level 65 (hard to get) spell.  If they don't they still can 50%, but 50% is further back for LDoN then you think.  We never pick a beast for the slow spot. (also because I'm a shaman =p)<br />
<br />
Now we want DD.  Do we get bsts?  Not as first options, not as second options, and not as third option.  Normally we get rogues, rangers, or mages.  I pick a beastlord as a last option for DD.  I'll even take a well played bard if I see one before I see a bst.<br />
<br />
I guess my point is, on paper Bsts sounds insane, but they have no area that they dominate at that I typically get one in a group.  If anything Enchanters are your bigger group competition spot, unless your group picks both.  I think you should play the shaman to 60, and work towards Canni 5...then decide ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
Disclaimer:  I am NOT one of those people that must have a perfect group make up.  I will do adventures with almost any makeup if its with friends I trust, and we still win.  Then again I guess my versatility show there also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>Ginslunger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">I've played both classes post 60 and find them both to be very enjoyable and not unbalanced at all.

Disgruntled Shaman says:<br />
Wish my pet put out as much DPS as a BST's<br />
Wish I could melee like a BST<br />
Why do BSTs get to slow<br />
Wish I got a mana regen buff like a BST<br />
Wish I could put out as much DPS as a BST<br />

Wish I could wear chain like a SHM<br />
Wish I could cannibalize like a SHM<br />
Wish I could root like a SHM<br />
Wish my dots were as good as a SHM<br />
Wish I got Torpor<br />
<br />
Of course Shaman can't put out the DPS of a BST.  They're not supposed to!  Come on now Ginch, pick out what role you want to fill in the game and pick a class that can do it.  <br />
<br />
If you want to solo quickly, have subpar debuffs and a good pet and in general put out DPS, then roll a BST.  If you want to be able to solo for exp adequately and solo well on tougher mobs, have great buffs and debuffs, heal and in general be very flexible is being at least adequate in whatever a group wants you to do, keep playing the shaman.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u99"><b>Nikatjef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p99">Greetings,<br />
<br />
   I am a 65 Beastlord, main character, and I thought I would comment on some of the things here.<br />
<br />
   Slows:  I have every one of the Beastlord slows, and frankly, I will take a level 58 Shaman's slows over mine any day.  Why?  Because they are that damn good.<br />
<br />
   Buffs:  I have every one of the Beastlord buffs and again, I will take a level 60 Shaman's buffs over mine any day.  Yes, they are that good as well.<br />
<br />
   Debuffs:   Wow, again, I have every one and guess what, unless I am tanking, I will take every one a 55 Shaman has.  Tanking is different as I use my lower efficiency debuffs to maintain agro.<br />
<br />
   Crowd Control:  No contest.  I can at most TM 2 DB mobs, whereas I have seen 55 Shaman control upwards of 5 mobs that were DB to me.<br />
<br />
   Healing:  WOOHOO.  I can heal for a whole 450ish points, fear my heal.  Literally.   Gimme a Shaman any day.<br />
<br />
   DPS:  Here is a fun one.  In a normal situation, I will easily out DPS a comparable level and geared Shaman, however, that is not always the case.   Depending on the situation, it is not uncommon for a Shaman to out DPS me as well.  Especially on higher HP / AC mobs as their DoT's and nukes are far superior to mine.<br />
<br />
   Now as for group dynamics, it will really depend on the situation.  In LDoN, I usually prefer another Beastlord instead of a Shaman.  The reason for this is speed.  A Shaman can and will allow me to finish a mission fast, but then so will a Beastlord.  The trick is that LDoN mobs are gimped on HP / AC, as such the Beastlord will have the superior DPS.  But note, that I will still try to get Shaman buffs over my own.<br />
<br />
   In PoP, however, I will always take a Shaman over another Beastlord and not just for slows either.<br />
<br />
   Finally, I want to comment on something that was stated on one of the previous pages.  Shaman are enablers.  A Shaman will allow me to take bigger and better things than a Beastlord generally would.   At the same time though, if you have a Shaman and a Beastlord who both know how to play their characters, they compliment each other so well, that you can have fun with different group rolls.  For example a Shaman nuker can do some amazing things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm gonna assume you're talking about Hard missions.  When playing my bard his 30% slows are more than adequate for Normal.  50% is great, 75% is overkill.  I'm not talking about Time or Elemental equipped groups of ubers who beat normal missions in 30 minutes with their hands tied behind their backs pushing buttons with their noses.... just regular casual peeps with crappy bazaar loot and maybe some Ssra-level or Ornate.<br />

I think that everyone will agree this. How many times groups asked me to buff them for donations at a LDoN camp with a beast with them but didn't invite me for the group? Way to much :)<br />
<br />
I will speak about LDoN groups<br />
Fact is people usually prefer enc/beast instead of  shaman/DPS.<br />
This way they have great CC and beast slow is enough for adventures + DPS. Each enchanter can CC, it isn't the case of shamans ( I mean some shamans just think they only have to slow ), so now, if I get invited, it is mostly by people who already grouped with me and saw that I was doing nice pulls and parks, it isn't from the major part of players. But in PoP, this is another story, but I don't know if it is the same on your servers, but PoP groups moved a lot to LDoN, so now it takes more than 5 minutes to get an invite while LFG, too bad :(</div></div><hr />

When ya get 64+ and if you have a co-level beastlord, or one that has the 65% slow, hell let em slow.  They take the beating better anyway.  When I run my shaman thru LDoN with my beastlord, or another beastlord, I usually DONT slow.  Tears &amp; Torrent baby - let the bst take the slow agro, save my hitpoints i.e. my mana.<br />
<br />
Plus if you have a stout dps group of 5 looking for healer, they are not gonna take a beastlord.  A shaman can take that slot, heal, slow and still pitch in DPS.  <br />

A *well played* shaman is still a monster - a damned versitile monster at that -  as is a beastlord, but they are very very different, even if the do a share similar spells.<br />

<br />
What, exactly, does a Beastlord specialize at?<br />
<br />
EQ is a game where versatility shines, in any and all situations. Specialists are used for specialized encounters, that's it. While specialized classes are necessary for about 1% of exp group encounters, it is the classes with high versatility that shines in all situations.<br />
<br />
A beastlord brings dps and slow to a group, while a shaman brings dps, slow, CC, and healing. Beastlords are great fillins for shamans in trivial conditions. However, when things get tough a beastlord falls way behind a shaman in terms of desirability.<br />

I cannot find the formula atm but will post it if i manage to dig it out. Actually everyone who has tanked a raid target yet knows the difference between a 70% and a 75% slow... it is huge. <br />
Ummm...NO. parse it. A partially mitigating mob will swing the exact same number of times in a 1 minute period with a shaman or enchanter slow. Beast only adds 1 extra attack into the mix. It's almost negligible.</div></div><hr />

As far as being skrewd i dont think so sure we dont have the uber pet that the bl has but who cares? i can slow a mob to 75% debuff him til he cant hit for crap. As far as being just a trivial part of a group im not so sure i can solo in most non elemental planes BoT, PoV, HoH, PoT and the rest of the open to the newbs planes. Ive played healer/slower/debuffer in PoE many times no big deal if you know what   your doing. I really think that you may just need to go back and see what you need to put into your shaman to get out your desired results the fact is that a shaman can solo most mobs we may not have the Uber pet as a Bl but we still can hold our own fine.<br />

If he wanted DPS, he should have made a wizzy.  If he wanted to compare a BL, he should have either compared a BL to a ranger, or even BL to mage.<br />
<br />
It's interesting to read how everyone has responded here, and it really highlights how versatile shamans are.  A good shaman can adapt to any group, and will be able to enhance the whole group's perfomance.  Someone hit the nail on the head in a previous post.  Shaman's are enablers.  <br />
<br />
I have nothing against BLs.  My regular group is SK, BL, BL, CLR, ENC, SHM, all level 65.  We never run out of mana (KEI, canni, SD, paragon), never run out of heals (tap, paragon, cleric heals, quies), never have to worry about buffs when we wipe (virt, kei, fo7), which very seldom happens.<br />
<br />
I guess the main gripe is how ppl get into pickup groups, and how they are able to adapt to the group, and vice versa.<br />

Not really true. As a 65 Beastlord and a 65 Shaman I have found that my Beast gets invited to groups faster and more often. <br />
<br />
Personally I love both classes as they both have unique roles in groups and raids. Yes the Beastlord is a shaman hybrid but a Beastlord wasn't made to be a buffer or part time healer. The class is for DPS with a little utility on the side. Shaman weren't meant to be a dps class. They are the king of buffs/debuffs  with a dash of healer built-in. Quit trying to directly compare two classes that have so little in common, you can't and when you do you make yourself look foolish.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't agree.  And believe that you maybe infact playing your new beastlord class, so much so, that it appears that way.<br />
<br />
Shamans are selected for PoP and Luclin more often for obvious reasons such as a mob's heavy damage capabilities and length of the fight due to the mob's high HP.  Beastlord slow is not idealized in theses scenarios.  Infact, so much so, that if a shaman can not be found an enchanter is sought after may times.<br />
<br />
In LDoN, I find that many after selecting a 'slower' and 'crowd' controller (Enchanter or Necro) if their is a need for more DPS the group looks for a mage or necro before a beastlord.  <br />
<br />
Worst examples are the Oasis and Butchblock adventures inwhich Mages and Necros are highly prized over a Beastlord for DPS.  Coupled by the fact that necro's provide a 70% slow and mez for Butchblock adventures.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Feel free to not agree but it is true. I two box my two toons and so both are online together normally. So I see how often I get invites for each toon. I'd venture to guess I get two invotes for my BL for every one for my shaman. And your view of what is needed for LDON adventures sounds much like the old holy trinity decree. Guess what SOE has blurred the lines and you don't need a particular class to perform cc anymore. Lots of classes can do that as long as the player of the toon understands their class.  Personally I do fairly well with CC and it isn't uncommon for my BL to tie up 3 mobs while we try to get things under control.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u116"><b>Mathi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p116">You do realize that part of the reason for that is likely the fact that your BL Bukar is very well known.  Having been (afaik) the first BL on Lanys with epic and to get to 65....<br />
<br />
I have similar experience in reverse.  I will 2-box my roommate's BL &quot;Piksel&quot; on occasion.  She gets asked for buffs, I get asked for groups.  Hmm...wonder why.  Is it because shaman are more wanted for groups? Or is it that I am also very well known on server?  We are both 65, both have Elder title and same guild tag.<br />
<br />
Class is only one factor when it comes time to choose a slower for your group, and if I have a well-known BL vs. an unknown shaman I would pick the BL as well.  Same goes in reverse.  AA exp is also a factor.  Why pick a 65 BL with Baron or something in title when there is a shaman with Elder also sitting there lfg?  Why pick a venerable no-guild shaman when an Elder popular-guild BL is available?<br />
<br />
Reputation, guild, and aa-exp are all factors I look at when I make a group.  Even before class itself a lot of times.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If anyone were to ask me what my title was and how many AA's I have I would simply and politely turn the group down. People have different styles of play and if they know their class well and are competent in what they are doing, they are just as effectives as someone who decided to spend their xp on AA's.<br />
<br />
Raidng however is a different story. But then I wouldnt be LFG...<br />

In the actual game its often skill level, gear, and effort that makes a more direct impact on an individual's contribution to a single group environment.<br />
<br />
Give me group members with a clue and who try hard.<br />
<br />
If I was a tank the level of slow on the mob would be the last thing on my mind if the slower was afk half the time, just slowed and didn't contribute to DPS at all, was slow on buffs, didn't have a clue about CC, etc, etc, etc, etc.<br />
<br />
It takes me about 0.5 seconds to find a group when I want to xp (toot toot).  People that have problems finding groups are... well... see above imho.<br />
<br />
Ideally?  Beastlord slow is less than shaman slow.  Is this an issue?  Is the cleric going oom because the mob isn't slowed that extra little bit?  Are people dying?<br />

<br />
The original poster sounds eerily similar to the froglok shaman we invited (level, race, class all identical, as is group make up.)  The story-behind-the-story goes like this:<br />
<br />
I log in late and calculate I have enough time to do a single LDoN adventure.  I am a level 62 beastlord with paragon and all but one level 62 spell (Talisman of Shadoo.)  <br />
<br />
I check my friends list and find a 56 cleric LFG, so I ask if he wants to start a group and he agrees.  This cleric has SCM3 and HG3 and is in the process of working up HA as well.<br />
<br />
Cleric and 1 DPS out of the way, an enchanter guildmate of mine becomes available so I invite her and she comes along as well.  She is level 61 with KEI and is one of the best pulling/cc enchanters I've ever had the pleasure of working with.<br />
<br />
Cleric (healing), Enchanter (KEI, CC, Haste/Slows), and 1 DPS out of the way.  Looking around I find another 62 beastlord LFG and invite him as well.  We also find a 57 paladin to act as main tank since our cleric wanted a plate tank in the group.<br />
<br />
Ok....its late and we'd like one more DPS person.  I check the LFG tool and the only person LFG that could function in a DPS role was a certain froglok shaman.  So I send a tell asking if they mind playing DPS in an LDoN group since thats what we really needed.  He agrees.<br />
<br />
Now, as much as I hate to break the news to some of yall, but on normal setting LDoN runs, the 50% slow is honestly plenty for most situations I've found, so I told the shaman he didn't need to worry about slowing, just unleash the never-ending supply of dots and such.  We almost never had adds, and when we did, our enchanter had them locked down faster than I could notice sometimes.<br />
<br />
Was I wrong to invite a shaman as DPS?  Maybe.  But with a cleric who's healing power was substantially augmented via AAs, and stacked mana regen from paragon, SP, and KEI, mana was really never an issue.  With mobs dying in 30-45 seconds and nearly always single, the stronger slow was probably not the best use of mana from the shaman.<br />
<br />
I don't know, I kind of always figured that a shaman might enjoy a change of pace to be DPS, and were pretty good DPS overall anyway.  Then again, maybe I'm just that big a newb.  Who knows?</div></div><hr />

Thats what I used to think.  I went head to head with a necro on a tug o'war for aggro (we were competeing for aggro, not for the kill as we were in the same party).  The mob was a valorian guardian in NW crypt in HoH.  He pulled and snared (an advantage for him as he gets a head start on the aggro list), So I slow, BoN, Bane, Ebolt, VoS (no ASoN or BoS yet) ... I got like 5 seconds of aggro, so I keep chaining slow ... nada.  Refresh poisen dots ... nada.  Necros can dish out the aggro, only way I could get it was sit.<br />

Also, don't forget the chanters.  They can dish or drop aggro easily.</div></div><hr />

This is so true.  Myself and my regular cleric partner LOVE having a beastlord in our group.  Spiritual Dominion is just awesome!  Paragon is awesome too but you really see the gains from that with 2-3 bst's all paragon equipped :):)<br />
<br />
Just a quick question though, why is it that beastlord players seem to insist on offtanking rather than letting the cc's do cc? :)  I swear the bst's I play with just can't resist sending the pet to offtank an already parked mob hehe.<br />

<br />
You are reacting to a really bad comparison though.  Beastlords seem to have about as much the same similarity in roles to shaman as rangers do to druids.  We have slow and some buffs in common, thats about all we share.  Unfortunately, it seems that while many shaman are upset because beastlords slow nearly as well as they do, the beastlords still prefer the shaman slow...  :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
I wouldnt expect a beastlord to replace what I do in a group because, well, a beastlord doesnt do what I do.  Ferocity and spiritual vigor are not replacements for ferine avatar.  Paragon is not a replacement for quiescence.  Melee and pet are not replacements for dots, nukes, and rains, what about direct heals, haste, debuffs, etc.  On the other hand, I have no melee, decent pet, or group mana regen capabilities so I wont be replacing what a beastlord does either.<br />
<br />
People get caught up in a dps versus utility versus necessity conversation and easily forget that all three types of character traits depend on the group makeup, where the group is, who the group is fighting, etc.  Theres a world of difference between melee dps, direct damage dps, dot dps, and indirect dps (through buffs).<br />

Hehe, if you think your primary role in a group is to bring SD and Atk buffs, you seriously need to rethink your priorities.<br />
<br />
People don't invite bst to groups for 9ptmana/hp regen, and they certainly don't invite beastlords for Atk buffs. You are invited in place of a shaman when your slow would suffice and your dps would be a more welcome addition than CC or spot heal. In other words, in groups where any 6 people can get exp while half asleep.<br />

There are bst in my guild with 8k hps... and yes, they can only replace a shaman in agroup in trivial conditions. What's trivial you ask? Mindless Fire groups, normal LDoN groups, etc. As soon as you bring a bst to say, hard Deep Guk (even with single pulls), or to camp sharks in Water, you start to see why they aren't even close to being able to replace a shaman.<br />

I'm very well aware of what a bst is capable of doing, hence the last part of my post. A lazy beastlord will outshine a lazy shaman any day. If you can't distinguish between raid desirability and group desirability, I'm not sure what more I can say to show you the difference.<br />
<br />
There IS a harmony between bst and shamans. People don't seem to realize, or don't seem to be able to overlook that fact that the only primary role we share in a group is Slow.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u130"><b>Rastik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p130">FWIW Flash of Light, coincidentally the only form of crowd control beastlords get, is terrific aggro for very low mana cost. Works for paladins, too.<br />
<br />
Skills, as someone pointed out, are a major point. Given a group without a slower, and given a choice of an unguilded BST I've never head about, and an unguilded shaman I've never heard about, I'd pretty certainly choose the shaman. Most (twink) beastlords never group until high level 50s or low 60s (as people play them for the solo abilities), so given their very low experience with spells, aggro and pet control in group conditions, they really can suck. Good 65 beastlords are really few and far in between, fEx on my server I could count them on my fingers (and I'm still really just learning, too ;) ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u131"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p131">I think someone just learned the basics of classes a bit too late:<br />
<br />
Shaman is not a beastlord; Beastlord is not a shaman.<br />
<br />
Incase you haven't tried these other classes here are more clues:<br />
<br />
Cleric is not a palidin; Palidin is not a cleric.<br />
<br />
Ranger is not a druid; Druid is not a ranger.<br />
<br />
Necromancer is not a shadowknight; Shadowknight is not a necromancer.<br />
<br />
They share class elements and similarities but one has absolutely nothing to do with the other.<br />
<br />
LDoN is about dps because of the time constraints on the adventures ... but I would jump to say that in normal solo xp, the shaman far outweighs the beastlord in kills over time. This is my perspective mid-50s, so take it with a grain of salt.<br />
<br />
When it comes to what mobs can be soloed there is no comparison - shaman can and do kill bigger badder mobs solo while beastlords dream they can get into a group to kill the same things.<br />
<br />
DPS - yes, beastlords win in the short run. Much like wizards are wonderful for the 'gotta kill it now' situations. For the long haul, shaman can put out consistant damage non-stop.<br />
<br />
It still comes down to preference and the original posters preference is obviously instant gratification.</div></div><hr />

The point of my post was to educate an obvious noob.  It was not to start a debate over which class owns aggro.  I simply wanted to show him that with a few spell casts he could do more damage than he thought was possible with a sham.  In fact the damage aggro from the spells would often times earn him enough aggro to disrupt regular group flow which may result in his own death.<br />

If this was a debate over owning aggro you think I would have started things off with 2 poison dots and a rain spell? Please....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u135"><b>chmodux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p135">Well having grouped with a bstlord for well almost all my lvls in game (65 with 81 aa), and getting the opportunity to dual box him when he's not on i fell i can shed some light on a few misconceptions most of which have been at least touched on.  Not to mention that bstlord is one of the few lvl 65's on my server and has 158 aa (last i looked), he's pretty much &quot;filled the class out&quot;.<br />
<br />
1) bstlords have expensive ass spells too, sha's advantage (65 slow) as one example is not cheap.<br />
<br />
2)  Shaman vary greatly in power based on lvls and spells, just to state this again GREATLY.  There is this period if your a non-twink in particular (late 40's to late 50's) where frankly you suck, your more a less a specialist (slow) that has weak generalist capability, and that has mana regen that doesnt really adequately touch your requirements.  Most of your buffs are single target, your dots are too damned expensive to be that useful (disease is ok but slow ass dps, but ebolt on the poison side was ok for downing lb mobs), your craptacular haste sucks mana with its short duration (raise your hand if you hate alacrity), your heals are garbage for the common content your grouping in and also suck mana like mad (chloro.....hate so much hate), mal line of spells love to bounce alot.  Suddenly you get insane mana regen with canIV, you are able to spell a cleric for brief periods with getto CH, then you wake up and have torpor (well once you can buy it got mine in dokb), you get group buffs that people WANT, (now with ldon dots that have dps!!! without agro from hell). This continues till you get Q, and aa to maximize it, and foci to mitigate cost of spells, can5, aa root, sc, buff extension.  I went from a massive hatred of a class to loving it all in about 7 lvls, and now after 80 aa or so i cant wait to play him more.  Why because ALL of the gripes the author of this thread brings up go away.<br />
<br />
<br />
3) All classes can be effective the player behind the toon matters, being resourceful is an underated skill in EQ.<br />
<br />
4) bstlords do not in anyway suck they compliment a shaman nicely, well ungodly.  <br />
<br />
5)  Have to compare lvl for lvl, 57 shaman 57 bstlord do you really want bstlord slowing mobs at that lvl with 35% slow when you could drop a 72% one on them (excuse me if math is off here on turgurs for the lvl).<br />
<br />
6) bstlords with all their spells/aa and proper gear are extremly nice tanks, that can back off and become a cleric for his pet (5500hp unbuffed pet mind you that quads and procs a dd), they can slow adds WITH YOU as opposed to the against you mentality that seems to pervade in this game, much as they are better at tanking than shaman and dps they are equally limited in healing of other group members and themselves this compliments the shaman nicely IMHO. <br />
 <br />
In summary a lvl 65 shaman is a very much different character than a lvl 57 one.  At lvl 65 with enough aa you can solo about anywhere that any class can solo, you can pour out dps in a group or otherwise (while soloing in seb without dog i can usually keep up 110 dps or so dog depending on what i have available to give him adds 30 or so, but in tactics i do even more since the whole freaking point is stacking as many dots as i can, havent parsed there yet though.  In groups eh depends entirely on what the group makeup is), you never ever NEED kei, and your still desirable for raids.  But it all comes at a cost you have to use this capability much like a bard, the true abilities in a shaman depend on YOUR tactics planing and hell every once in a while hand/eye cordination.  I really dont think shamans suck and i know bstlords do not as well, but i will agree the path is not a smooth linear one for a shaman, and finally class envy BAD!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u136"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p136">Honestly Chmodux, i can't get myself to read your post since you started by saying something ignorant like Sha's Advantage(65 slow) being expensive.<br />
First, their 65 slow is called Sha's Revenge(Advantage is level 60) and second, it's 150 mana. Turgur's costs 250 mana for a comparison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u137"><b>Jagra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p137">Let me say a few things from a 65 BL perspective...<br />
<br />
BL when they hit 60+ really gain some power and it really starts to pick even more at each level after that.<br />
<br />
I can at level 65 buff better than any Focus spell. The drawback? its single target and I have to use 5 spells where as focus is 1 slots and also a group buff. That saves a lot of time and mana. I will buff the group if there is not a shaman present and keep them going if I have to but a shaman saves my mana to do other things.<br />
<br />
I can slow 65%, no its not the best but it sure as hell will land me in groups when Shaman are not in plentiful supply because its good enough. But again if there is a shaman in the group it saves my mana for other things.<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as Shaman taking on mobs that BL could dream on taking... I disagree there. It Depends what and how many AA the BL has. It also depends on your goals as well. In certain places i can rip through 4 mobs and make more xp than the shaman taking on uber mob 001. I am not trying tosay we are better, I am trying to say BL and Shamans are both bad ass but we just have different ways of shredding through mobs.<br />
<br />
You have to remember BL pets have 5500 HP (unbuffed, we can hit 6k buffing them) and we can pet cleric pretty damn good. The key is if the mob is slowable or not (if its a big mob) in addition there are various other ways for BL to take on big mobs. Shamans get gate if things go wrong, BL have to run like hell. But I can tell you I wont ever solo a mob I couldnt get away from on a regular basis.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now having said all that, do i think we are better than shamans or vice versa... My answer is yes... to both... Both classes have points where they shine. But speaking on a BL perspective I know that we can fill in for a shaman pretty good with exception to being a back up healer or using the Malo line of spells. Shamans excel in this aspect wtih the buff lines they get and being a healer if the cleric goes down on some mishap and I owe my life to more than one excellent shaman that knew their que to become the healer.<br />
<br />
To people talking about BL having it easy... its not exactly true... There is a point ( I forget the exact point since it has been so long) where the BL pet starts to lack and it takes a bunch of will and concentration for a BL to solo. I beleive it is from 36 to 44, something in that area.<br />
<br />
<br />
But to the original poster about being out classed by BL that are 60 and 62... Its gonna happen when your 57....<br />
<br />
About BL spells. The only spells that are expensive are Sha's Revenge (a 65% slow) and Ferocity (Stat and ATK buff) which are both 65. The other spells from 61 to 65 are not expensive really and we can pretty much buy all our spells up to level 60 from vendors. A couple of excpetions that are quest spells or turn ins...<br />
<br />
<br />
So the final point.... Shamans and Beastlords are Apples and oranges but we are both tasty!!!!<br />
<br />
Enjoy EQ!!!!  Caio</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u138"><b>Mishkel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p138">Greets,<br />
<br />
I've haunted the world of EverQuest from as far back as Beta 3.<br />
<br />
I've played most every class and only played on two servers.  For the first few years I was an exclusive test center junky.  Then just before Luclin came out I moved to Tunare.<br />
<br />
I actually had quit the game but I wanted to try a beastlord.  Because in the pre luclin picture I saw... There was a Cat Beastlord with a Wolf Warder by him.  Well that wasn't exactly right obviously but on with the post.<br />
<br />
Beastlord was kinda interesting at first.  Back in the day you had a button to call your warder.  You had to cast like 15 spells (less but hey) to get him/her near your level.  But they would travel from zone to zone with you.  People that started after the one beastlord change can be interesting to meet.<br />
<br />
I had a cleric once tell me he would own me in a duel after he dispelled my warder.  That was a good laugh and a fun fight for a very short amount of time.  Difference in &quot;pet&quot; types and all that... if you don't know what I'm talking about (you're not a bst) you can't at least then dispel a warder.  I've been away for about 6 months and just came back for LDoN.<br />
<br />
Anyway on to the beastlord.<br />
<br />
I hated to group as I was coming up in levels.  It was always more entertaining on my own... or grouped with another pet class.<br />
<br />
Healers can be rare to find... and people with thousands of hp, asking me to heal them with a 33 point heal or whatever I had then.. just doesn't cut it.<br />
<br />
At level 61 I think I'm up to Greater Heal maybe I have one better.  But beastlord heals suck.  I for one have always been more of a pet cleric.  Tho when I would join raid groups I always melee'd.  My gear sucks, I don't have 80,000 laying around.  I have some ok pieces but nothing great.  Tho I have some decent weapons.<br />
<br />
I managed to keep my weapon skills maxed even tho I was mostly a pet healer.  So I'm one of those that gets experience while sitting down a lot.<br />
<br />
Every class has their place.  Common group I traveled with had a Warrior, Cleric, Shaman, Ranger, Beast (me) and sometimes a druid.  If we got too many people from our &quot;group&quot; we'd make a raid group.<br />
<br />
I never thought anyone didn't pull their end off.  I never thought I was better than the shaman at stuff they excelled at.  Ya I don't have 200 aa points either but everyone seemed happy with what I added.<br />
<br />
Maybe your main problem is people you group with don't understand your roll.  I was taken when I was around 58'ish into the PoP zones.  The shaman went LD and they asked me to slow.  The damage the &quot;tanks&quot; were taking went up drasticly (my lvl was low too but... the shaman added to the group is my point).<br />
<br />
As a beast when I first started entering PoP zones.  The hardest point I had to try and make... So I ended up just getting a consistent group of people to group with because they understood after a while.  <br />
<br />
I found one of the best things my warder could do at that level... If we got an add I put my warder on it.  Basicly I can complete heal him... but I cannot heal another player worth a darn.<br />
<br />
So when tanks pull off onto an add it makes whatever healer there is have a much tougher job.<br />
<br />
I know you don't care about that ramble... but my point is... every class in this game can add to a group.  It all comes down to the player knowing what they can add and the group understanding what they can add.<br />
<br />
When kills are coming very very fast... its a waste of time to dot and things like that.<br />
<br />
Mishkel... my beastlord is one of my favorite characters I've ever played.  Yes I can solo some places now that would be a challenge for some classes.  But I play other characters as well.<br />
<br />
And I'm not co ordinated enough to dual box.<br />
<br />
I just try and have fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
FWIW beastlord warders can only get close to 5500 HP using a focus item from Plane of Time or a Time level LDON raid. Regular level 64 warder has like 4400 hp, a couple of hundred more with LDON AP bought pet focus. Noone would use pet clericing to take down uber mobs; the pets have low AC, so fighting alongside the pet and Chloroblasting oneself up when beaten down bad would give pretty much the same healing efficiency, while doing lot more DPS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Erm - no, we can't.  In fact, if the base stamina of the person we're buffing is anywhere near max (not unlikely at 65) Focus of Souls gives more hp as well.  The only stats that the combination of IoS, Kragg, Dexterity, Furious Strength and Stamina buff higher than Focus and Talisman of the Boar are dex, stamina and strength - at 65 with half decent gear, all three stats are quite likely to be at or near max with Focus/boar anyway.<br />
<br />
You have to remember BL pets have 5500 HP (unbuffed, we can hit 6k buffing them)<br />
<br />
Base hp for the 64 warder is 4200.  With the augments available in Time and LDoN time-level raids, that increases to about 5100.  Max self-buffed hp on an unfocused warder is about 4700 hp. (with Kragg/Spiritual Strength)<br />
<br />
There is a point ( I forget the exact point since it has been so long) where the BL pet starts to lack and it takes a bunch of will and concentration for a BL to solo. I beleive it is from 36 to 44, something in that area.<br />
I still wish I could forget levels 35-38 and 45-48 even though they were a year and a half ago.  They're a pain in the neck.<br />
<br />
About BL spells. The only spells that are expensive are Sha's Revenge (a 65% slow) and Ferocity (Stat and ATK buff) which are both 65. The other spells from 61 to 65 are not expensive really and we can pretty much buy all our spells up to level 60 from vendors.<br />
<br />
Spirit of Snow and Spirit of Flame are both fairly rare pre-60 unless you're in a guild that farms Ssra frequently.  They're not expensive in Shaman terms (5-15k on most servers) but most Beastlords won't have them until quite a bit after they could have used them. (at which point they're only a minor situational upgrade and not worth the price.)  63 and 64 spells were expensive when I bought them, but Spectral parchments are so common now they're easy to get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u143"><b>Jagra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p143">Your right, my brain was in left field... its 4500 HP for the 64 pet... with Kragg and Spirtual Strength we can give them another 500 HP... with Virtue or Faith they can hit over 6k in HP... With Mage Belt of Magi'Kot they can hit 6.5K, and if they do the PoT9 and Symbol on my pet I think he can hit 7K ( I might missing a buff for the 7k one) Of course I am basing this off the Pet stats from EQ Beastlords... I didnt know about Pet foci items though. I been kinda not playing and focusing on school...<br />
<br />
<br />
I dunno about you but I can cap my strength and Dex self buffing my self, can get Stam pretty high self buffing my self but thats about as far as I get...I dont have time gear... nor have I played much in LDON since I started back to college...<br />

What do u expect to have 2k nukes &amp; 100 dmg quading pet in addition to that ? We're a friggin support not a dps class. <br />

<br />
  Agreed!  I've played both classes and heres something for you to think about, a Beastlord is a combination of a Shaman and a Monk so how can you say he's better then your shaman?  Obviously the Shaman is a PURE class while the BL is a hybrid.  <br />
  I duo with a good beastlord friend of mine and granted his pet is much better then ours, but other then that I've got him beat hands down!<br />
 Oh and by the way, I think the only way they resemble the monk is the fact that they can't wear anything but leather, and they can duel weild.<br />
But you should know all this since you supposedly leveled one to 40. <br />
   Me thinks you are just starting a flame fest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u146"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p146">I think the phrase &quot;nearly as well as we do&quot; is the issue. Shaman are basically a one trick pony once the fighting starts. The malo and slow and possibly stack some incidental Dots. Beast slow is close enough to replace shaman slows for most situations and in LDoN normal missions beast &gt; shaman. <br />
<br />
That said, there are a boatload of slowers in the game now, and if that is to be a shaman's bread and butter, I would like to see it expanded some: for example a 50% melee/casting curse. I would also like to see more advantage taken of curse fastdots, debuff/dots, etc. Say a 40% slow 1000dmg level 54 curse, or a cripple + curse 30sec dot. (all of which should be magic based and use alteration 'natch).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u147"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p147">Shaman are basically a one trick pony once the fighting starts.<br />
<br />
Sorry you feel that way.  Shaman are much more than one-trick ponies, they're one of the more versatile classes in the game.  I love when I get to be on crowd control (you can assist others in this even if your not the primary CC), among other things.  You can also provide some burst DPS (not awesome but noticeable) if needed via the higher level nukes and rains, and create sustained DPS longer than most other classes (not a factor in LDON Normal 30-second long fights, but oh well).<br />
<br />
Anyway, the two classes have totally different roles.  I can't understand all the class envy.  Worried a BST will get a tell over you for a pickup group?  Pick up some LFGs yourself, a shaman can make any group work.  I don't think the same is necessarily true for a BST.  I've been primary crowd control (VP = teh pwn), main healer, and buffer / haster / slower for more groups than I care to think about, all while adding some DPS via pet and DOTs or DDs (depending on mob HP).  No one-trick pony here. :p</div></div><hr />

Shaman are basically a one trick pony once the fighting starts. The malo and slow and possibly stack some incidental Dots. Beast slow is close enough to replace shaman slows for most situations and in LDoN normal missions beast &gt; shaman. <br />
<br />
That said, there are a boatload of slowers in the game now, and if that is to be a shaman's bread and butter, I would like to see it expanded some: for example a 50% melee/casting curse. I would also like to see more advantage taken of curse fastdots, debuff/dots, etc. Say a 40% slow 1000dmg level 54 curse, or a cripple + curse 30sec dot. (all of which should be magic based and use alteration 'natch).<br />
<br />
<br />
Well after lvl 65 and with enough aa's this argument becomes mute IMHO.  I think the classes diverge a bit.  Shaman decidedly get better at healing (while a bstlord really gets no usuable advantages there), and bstlords add more to dps.  Shaman i'd argue do get to be more of a jack of all trades as you get higher and can do the job good enough. Because of mana regen, aa and of course Q, I can slow heal and cc, bstlords can add mad dps slow and do limited cc.  With paragon they can also keep things moving at a more rapid pace and also give the group some &quot;get out of jail free&quot; cards if a big pull comes.  I just really dont buy into the argument shamans are a eh at everything and their slow isnt a big enough advantage.  Honsetly shamans are about the best balanced class i can think of (at lvl 65 with enough aa), not overpowered, not weak in any one area, and can fufill many different roles in a group well ,at least my group seemed to think so one of the last times i've ever stepped foot in bot. While i'm buffing up the puller leaves despite my pleas and brings three mobs to camp right away promptly kills the war, chanter and cleric (no one was paying attention at this point to be honest and i have no idea how the chanter bit it without mezzing something first), leaving me a monk and a ranger by the time i've unmemmed all my buffs and starting memming usefull things like slow and malos.....we didnt lose anyone else after i got my spells memmed and we held camp.  A bstlord couldnt have done that, of course i'm sure they'd have had the mobs slowed sooner LOL.</div></div><hr />

This is my pet peeve in LDoN.  Give me 60 seconds to summon and buff my pet and remem my combat spells, for god's sake!  We finish every adventure in under 45 minutes, it's not like that 60 seconds is going to make a difference...  :mad:</div></div><hr />

He is probably thinking along the lines of bst. vs. monk mitigation? Still doesnt add up to 110 percent with the lacking skills and skill caps.</div></div><hr />

Given similar caliber equipment, a bst will usually outdamage a monk.  Not by melee alone, of course, but given their pet and nukes.  FD does NOT make up for this, I'm sorry.  I was there, 60, Brother, when our testicles were excised prior to the PoP release, and was told by many a braindead idiot that the nerf was ok &quot;because you still have FD&quot;.  To add insult to injury, FD was then nerfed and now monks aren't even pullers anymore, except in rare circumstances.  SOE even admitted the nerf was overdone by (over a year after the fact) returning a small amount of mitigation to the class.  Their mitigation, while not quite on par with monks', is close enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u156"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p156">I don't really understand how people can still say Shamans are balanced..<br />
<br />
Compare the Shaman to the Druid(or any other healing class for that matter) for just a second.<br />
<br />
The Luclin Shaman was slowing mobs for 75% and had a mini CH for 1950.<br />
The PoP Shaman got his main ability crippled by the Slow mitigation, he received a fast heal upgrade for 1300(all healing classes received this upgrade and all of them were more substantial than ours) and a convenient upgrade to Torpor(Q didn't raise the HP/second healed nor the efficiency) and no upgrade to the mini CH.<br />
<br />
So basically, the gap to the Druid in terms of healing widened and the ability to mitigate damage through Slow declined.<br />
<br />
Did we get an offensive upgrade relative to other classes? Hell no<br />
Did we get an upgrade to our mana regen? Hell no<br />
Did we get a new miraculous buff relative to other buff classes? Hell no<br />
<br />
The only thing the Shaman really got, was VP.<br />
<br />
Face it, it's the same old story. Nerfing by neglecting. That's how nerfing works nowadays, you just don't get a power upgrade in comparison to other classes.<br />

That has nothing to do with Beastlord balance, that's a problem with pure melee balance.  And yes, I agree - a hybrid class with more versatility shouldn't be outdamaging/outtanking the pure melee class it's based on.  Would Monks suddenly be balanced if Beastlord damage was nerfed?  Don't make me laugh. Monks need some upgrades at the moment (except at the very high end) - somehow I doubt they'd be happy if all classes were gimped to match.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u158"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p158">Oh I'm not saying BSTs do too much damage, just that they can and often do outdamage similarly geared monks, and that in tandem with their very useful lineup of spells this isn't right, IMO.  Actually though I don't feel their dps should be nerfed, I do think their slow should be more like 50% than the current 65%.<br />
<br />
I won't get into whether or not it's lure, as that's more controversial than abortion..  but I will say that someone pointed out to me a very valid point; according to Lucy, our epic's effect, Curse of the Spirits (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1932), has the same resist check (magic) and resist adjust (none) as Turgur's Insects (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1588&amp;source=Live) - yet we can land our epic on mobs considered to be unslowable by magic slow, such as (I'm told) the last giant in the Kael Plate cycle house and (tested this one) the giant capain in WW for the benevolence quests.  I didn't believe it when I heard it, but after testing it in WW I'm inclined to believe that Lucy doesn't know all there is to know.  FYI after malos I only got one resist on epic on this guy, out of probably 5-6 casts.  Beastlord slow could very well indeed have a resist adjustment, perhaps to compensate for BSTs' lack of a MR debuff, which Lucy isn't aware of.<br />
<br />
At any rate, I also don't think BSTs should have a buff better than FA... granted they stack, but who's the king of buffs here and who's the melee hybrid capable of 200+ sustained DPS?  Paragon, while powerful, is ok with me due to its reuse time.  I'm not sure what to think of SD.. on the one hand Narandi's crown goes for 150k+ on my server because other hybrids need the FT.. but on the other hand, rangers do have some very limited mana regen, 3/tick I believe, and SKs have a proc buff that taps mob hp and converts to SK mana, and with 4+ hour KEI available in PoK 24/7 it's not too imbalancing.. If they shaved KEI's duration to base 35 minutes like otehr clarities (/em prays) then SD might bear taking a look at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u159"><b>Eatbugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p159">Can't be bothered getting into Sha's Revenge vs Turgur's resists here - that's been covered over and over by people who've played both classes extensively at 65.<br />
<br />
At any rate, I also don't think BSTs should have a buff better than FA.<br />
<br />
FA is 140 base atk and 140 to agi, str and dex, for 350 mana with a one minute recast.  Ferocity is 150 base atk, 40 sta and 65 to all resists for 600 mana with a two minute recast.  It's a bit debatable which is a better buff and under what circumstances - suffice it to say that I want both if they're available.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know how anyone could not see this.<br />
<br />
Simple your making the assumption that classes started balanced or your just assuming that those things wouldnt make us overpowered.  Now i'm not going to totally disagree with the statement with pop some classes got flat out overpowered. Chanter for example, when pop came out (pre charm nerf) the chanter was able to get a mob that quaded (well after two rusty weapons had been handed to him) 500's and then haste him, sure risk reward but even still the polished chanter was able to rack up insane aa in zones with giant xp bonuses and even with deaths from said charmed pet was able to make impressive aa/xp.  <br />
<br />
Frankly the whole concept of balance is generally hard to pin down (do you define it as ability to solo, ability to overpower a group which in of itself would be the opposite of balance but i've seen this one used that everyone should overpower their group, that has a viable role in raids, etc) .  I should have clarified out of all classes shaman is probably positioned in about the right spot for soloing, grouping and raiding.  A chanter when pop came out after a month was a nearly unmatched soloist, strenghted their ability to completely change a group with charm, let alone &quot;raid&quot; (depending on how you define raid but lets say something that required more than 2 groups) encounters that could be done with two charmed pets and full group.  Bard likewise was able to take advantage of some zones almost designed for them to solo in (read HOH pre bard ae nerf), and of course on some raids the provided resists made those ecounters trivial.<br />
<br />
Shaman are capable soloers but it takes work (canning root rotting a mob for extended periods of time certainly taxes the hands and wrist, and requires you to actually pay attention well at least me), grouping of course i've mentioned i've taken on many roles in an xp group and been successful i very much doubt i'm the only shaman to do so and certainly no where near the best at healing, cc'ing, slowing etc. and of course on raiding we're still a center piece, even unslowable mobs we still have utility in curing, healing, keeping FA on all those tanks for the important dps increase of a raid.<br />
<br />
Most other classes frankly cant compare on that balance sheet, chanters/bards share the trait of being able to solo, group and extremely useful on raids, but have been considered overpowered for some time.  Wizzards you could make the case are in a similar boat now as chanters bards. Most classes fufill two of three at best and in case of warrior probably 1.  <br />
<br />
PS I would like upgrades you've listed if they could be implemented in a way that doesnt skew things to greatly hell just add to our same spell set a bit, but i hardly think my melee friends or most int casters would listen ot me long if i told them how weak shaman were with our poor vp3, sc3, can5, Q, hps, mitigation, hp buffs, and useful if weak pet...oh yeah and the malos and slow things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u163"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p163">So who exactly says Shamans were not balanced pre PoP and why are they now?<br />
The Shaman class lost more power than any other classes with PoP simply because not only were we neglected upgrades to our crucial spells(Slow, Canni), but our main ability was lost a lot of importance due to the implementation of slow mitigation and the upgrade to bard's and beasts' slow lines.<br />
<br />
Hell for a good 3 1/2 years Shamans and Druids shared the same heals, Shamans, being the primative cleric substitution they are, actually had Torpor since Kunark, we had Slows since the game went live, why the **** did this not work anymore suddenly?<br />
<br />
Other classes have their strengths as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u164"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p164">I disagree with something I have been reading.<br />
<br />
People say our main ability lost importance in PoP.<br />
<br />
I feel this is widly inaccurate. The importance of slowing is and will always be HUGE. What our main ability lost was effectivnes. And when you look at it it was a nerf to every class in the game that can slow. <br />
<br />
It just impacted us the most because not only was that our main ability and the linchpin of our group and raid role. But also we recived pretty crappy upgrades in spells and many Aa choices. <br />
<br />
Shamans relitive power has been neglected since the days of old world. While others have risen to far exceed us in many places. <br />
<br />
Yet we are not underpowered at all I think. I do not mind that some people will say take the beastlord he has more DPS. Or they say take the enchanter she can slow and we can get clarity. Or someone takes the bard because they say they make the best pullers.<br />
<br />
Cause how many times have you gotten a tell saying hey we could really use yah in (Insert place here). Or got a invite out the blue. Or left a group only to hear tomorrow how the replacement just didnt measure up. <br />
<br />
Sure Sony hasnt given us any lovings. But considering how much they tend to beat on thier partners whent hey pay attention to them I am almost sometimes grateful. Sony is a lumbering multiheaded wifebeater wearing lummox as far as I am concerned. They have no singular idea for what and how the game should look and they are run by commitie. <br />
<br />
All that allows is little domains and pet classes and wildly varying patches of importance nerfs and upgrades.<br />
<br />
I mean in the end. Shaman (In my opinion) are doing okay. But the warriors and Monk need some serious work. <br />
<br />
But then again what do I know. I am just a simple shaman. Who still gets in the face of the critters and really really wants to just have fun again.<br />

<br />
What clued them in you think?  <br />
Was it before the expansion PoP, the fact that level 60 shamans were glouting about the fact they were able to solo all dragons but three in Western Wasteland?  <br />
That they thought to themselves hey slow is a powerful thing maybe it should be better controlled rather than regulating it with the standard immune to slow message.<br />
<br />

The Shaman class did not lose more power than any other class you.   <br />
<br />
Why don't you look around I will give you hint pure melees are pissed right now.<br />
<br />
The upgrade to bard and beastlord slow is laughable.<br />
Tanks take 40% more damage when using a beastlord's 65th level Rune slow spell over a shaman's 51st level vendor bought slow.  <br />
<br />
Personally, for a group in PoP if I could not get a shaman I would get an enchanter WAY before getting a beastlord for slow.<br />
<br />
Hell for a good 3 1/2 years Shamans and Druids shared the same heals, Shamans, being the primative cleric substitution they are, actually had Torpor since Kunark, we had Slows since the game went live, why the **** did this not work anymore suddenly?<br />
<br />
They were going to give us and even better heals for PoP than Kragg's Mending but it didn't make it past beta.  So the company did have it planned to give shamans a sweet heal.<br />
  <br />
Reason they didn't was because they realized our slow during beta was still very powerful.  Personally, I still believe it is.  <br />
<br />
Shamans in PoP beta were damn good healers.  There was a point in beta where there was no mitgation of slow and a sweet 3000+ heal.  <br />
<br />
Other classes have their strengths as well.<br />
<br />
Maybe we don't have charm or swarm kite.  <br />
<br />
But shamans can still root rot bigger mobs than beastlords can melee.  And Shamans can take more mobs by root rotting than beastlords.<br />
And finally Shamans can do this while taking nearly no damage compared to a beastlord meleeing.<br />
<br />
Nothing like taking two mobs that a beastlord can't melee and doing it without taking any damage.  <br />
<br />
Its good to be a shaman over a beastlord.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u166"><b>Gawkmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p166">Early on in PoP beta shaman got an upgrade to Turgurs to the tune of 80% slow. Problem is everyone across the board seemed to want that deleted. They kept saying 70% was fine and anything better would trivialize too much content. Hard to disagree with them when you sit down and actually think about it. But when they took it away they didn't return anything in exchange. <br />
<br />
That all being said I think alot of you are way off the mark when you say the shaman class lost power. The class is as it always has been a very strong and balanced class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u167"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p167">Gonna give up, really. I know how Shamans used to be in the PoP beta, what does that have to do with what we are now?<br />
<br />
Saying we didnt lose power, when you just said they implemented Slow mitigation and removed our 3k+ heal while giving us nothing in exchange is a contradiction, isn't it?<br />
<br />

Dont really see what your saying here for sure, i think you may be talking about slow mitigation where we still have the advantage just dimished, mob mitigates 50% our slow would slow that 75% bstlord 65% and so on (our slow would end up doing 37.5% bstlord slow would do 32.5%)<br />

<br />
One term here ...Mana regeneration. Least for me at lvl 52 i found my mana regen didnt keep up with my spells very well, I couldnt provide crap for dps dots were too expensive if i was using slowing with my crappy resistable mal spell (LOL what was that malaisement?) i'd eat up my mana as is, heal spells are atrocious cost for the benefit, let alone all those nice short duration single cast buffs. Get lvl 65 get all your spells, get some of the nicer class defining aa then come back to me and tell me how much things have changed, you will have 10 times the mana regen from a practical standpoint, your dots wont break root,  your heals no longer drain your whole mana bar and will actually keep your tank up, your mal line is a one cast deal instead of a spam fest, your buffs last forever and are all group (ergo cost less mana on a staggering scale) .  YOU DO go from a one trick pony that can do somethings in a pinch to being able to fill multiple group slots EASILY, let alone soloing becomes so much more viable.  Although the difficulty shaman have at lower lvls i would like looked at, I got through it now and IMHO it made me alot better player for when the good stuff came.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd like to see some more curse based DoTs that are fast acting and possibly have a debuff component. I'd like to see some spell casting slows or mixed 50% melee/casting slow spells for shaman.

<br />
<br />
Actually all decent enough ideas at first but i sure as hell dont want to be the next class on the nerf target list, we do have a ways to go and alot of classes to leapfrog first so there is some possibly good ideas there. The slow for spell casting, i've considered that myself would probably trivialize way to much content depends on how it was implemented.<br />
<br />
<br />
I guess all i'm saying is this plain and simple, we can do alot of things, we can be useful in a wide variety of situations, and if we'd take the list of complaints to a warrior, monk, mage, even rogue forums and they'd laugh us off.  I'm sure alot of other classes probably have shaman envy as well.  <br />
<br />
Btw giac bro if you hate the class so much honestly why do you think so many of us are happy with it, we're just sheep?  I'm probably the quickest person i've met in my life to bitch about something I dont like, hell i consider it a weakness, I certainly dont have a history of keeping my mouth shut even when it benefits me.  May want to look in the mirror abit not that your complaints may or may not be valid just using logic why are shaman relatively satisfied with the actual class, maybe not spell cost/rarity or all aspects of the class but generally I think this board has proven time and time again the class is rewarding to play.</div></div><hr />
