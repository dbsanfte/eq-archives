<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Laranu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yesterday and today I've not been able to use my right mouse key for bringing up menus on either my chat boxes or my spell bar. I checked already to make sure its activated and have tried switching back to a default UI thinking that was the problem. I've tried everything I can think of, hoping maybe I can get some more ideas. Any help you can give is appreciated. thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Is stupid question I know but does your Right click work like it should in windows?  Them stupid buttons do break some times and require the replacement of the cute fluffy mouse.  Might try using a different mouse if you have not tried that yet.  If that works then would put mister fluffy mouse int the round file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Laranu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye, it works just fine in all other functions, including other characters on the same account, using the same computer. Its just while on my shaman that it doesn't work :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Narcleus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">by activated you mean that 'Allow context menus' is on correct? just curious because i had the same problem other day and didn't realize I accidentally toggled it off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Laranu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmm, reread what I wrote originally and I have no clue what I meant by activated. But I just checked my options and it was toggled off so THANK YOU! I can now use my right click menus again hehe</div></div><hr />
