<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rabidferret</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Forgive me if I put this thread in the wrong forum ... first time poster.  I just wanted to know if I'm headed in the right direction in my equipment selection.  I have around 1.5k to spend.  I know that AC/HP are very important, but going that route (with lots of Totemic :)) I only have 128 Wis including a 7 Wis ring (ugh, I know).  My Magelo profile is in my sig, but I probably screwed that up.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
EDIT - Woot, sig is working.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah, you're definitely headed in the right direction.  The gear you have is a nice combination of AC, HP, and Wisdom.  :)<br />
<br />
If you're looking for cheap upgrades, here's what I'd recommend.<br />
<br />
Ears: Imbued Golden Ivory Earring (cheap- under 100 pp, maybe much less if you provide the ivories- and a great combination of AC and WIS.)<br />
<br />
Neck: Ry'gorr is great (what I wore, well... not at your level, but when I got a little higher) - an alternative is the Black Alloy Medallion - stats are pretty good (ac 6, +5 wis), it's cheap (couple hundred PP- maybe an even swap for the Ry'gorr), and it will make every spell you cast under level 44 cost 10% less mana (it has the focus effect &quot;Mana preservation II&quot;). That's a good thing! <br />
<br />
Face: Arctic Wyvern Mask. You get a nice balance of AC and WIS with the mask, for just a few hundred pp (or less- I see these in the bazaar for 50 pp sometimes.)<br />
<br />
Head:  Ry'gorr is fine, JB is your next upgrade.<br />
<br />
Wrist: If you DoT much, you might want to swap out one of the totemic bracers for a Chipped Bone Bracelet (CBB) (with the CBB you get &quot;Affliction Efficiency II&quot; - which will cause all DoTs under level 45 to cost 25% less mana to cast. Again, this should just cost a few hundred PP- probably an even swap for the totemic) <br />
<br />
Arms: JB is your next upgrade, but you've got time to look for a bargain, or just wait... totemic is fine.  :)<br />
<br />
Hands: See Arms<br />
<br />
Shoulder: Tattered mantle (100 pp or so, maybe less.) <br />
<br />
Chest: I'd stick with the totemic for awhile.  Decent AC and a nice focus effect (I remember the short duration of buffs at low levels drove me NUTS!)<br />
<br />
Back: You're fine here.  Until recently there werent many reasonable upgrade options at all.  Even now there isn't anything much better available for around the same plat.)<br />
<br />
Waist: Spider fur belt (50-100 pp) is a nice alternative belt- lose a little wisdom, gain some AC/HP (it's AC 10, +40 hp, +5 agi and dex), and probably make a little money on the deal.<br />
<br />
Legs: Your legs are fine- this is a tough spot to upgrade, especially on a budget. <br />
<br />
Boots: See Arms<br />
<br />
I wouldn't stress over upgrades that are going to cost you much- you're in good shape right now.  I'd definitely upgrade the earrings (just because those earrings are such a great deal for a barbarian) and any slots you can upgrade for little or no cost.<br />
<br />
You want to start saving your money for the true upgrades- those few game-changing items that will truly help you down the line.  Those items (iksar BP, fungi staff, horse, JBB, fungi tunic) aren't cheap... so start saving now!  :)<br />
<br />
Happy hunting!<br />
<br />
P.S.  Don't stress out over your wisdom.  At 51 I had around 120 wisdom and it didn't hurt me a bit.</div></div><hr />
