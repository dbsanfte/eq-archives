<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Talsondar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all:<br />
<br />
Saw some old posts on pricing for this stuff, what are current rates on various servers?  I only ask because my jaw nearly dropped this weekend when I saw a Artificers BP for 5k, 2 of em actually, on the same vendor.  Needless to say, with some scrambling (actually had to sell my JB arms and boots and my Black Sapp Elec earings to vendor to raise the last 1k) I jumped all over this.<br />
<br />
Too lazy to post a link to the BP but it is 30ac 40hp 40mana 10wis and 5sta.  Damn nice piece.  Anyone else see good deals on some of the other pieces lately?  This just a fluke or a trend?<br />
<br />
BTW, it is BAR Tribunal only...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">By the Tribunal, let it be a trend...<br />
<br />
Not seen on BristleBane for anywhere cheap, tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>hdaana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">been quoted 8k for small pieces on 7th hammer.didnt even dare ask about a BP or legs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Taldur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">never once did i see any of it for sale on BB, would really like some it , cool look</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I paid 20K and 3 Blue Diamonds for Legs and Belt about a month ago.<br />
<br />
The Tunic still goes for about 20K on AB. I've been thinking about getting it to replace my Fungi, but I'll think I'll wait and see if it gets any cheaper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">On Bristlebane I know Tulkor was making some of this stuff.  He was pretty reasonable, but I don't know if he's still making it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Aye... hoping to make some myself.  Smithing 210 and (slowly!) counting...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Shandy, post your prices somewhere when you feel confident making this stuff.  If you need some smithing skill modifying item (hammer from ME or tinkered one) let me know, I can help you get one.   I heard a rumour that Tulkor might not be doing this anymore and I'm thinking about the waist item ... the ... erm Artificer's skirt ... it's a kilt, not a frigging skirt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm 0 for 7 on the darned bracer.  /sigh.<br />
<br />
Expect me to spend downtime farming more howling/shrieking substances and swirling shadows.<br />
<br />
If/when I ever get to where I can make these things, I'll let folks know!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">/smack self. <br />
<br />
Got a Geerlok Hammer (5%) that I use when trying stuff &quot;for real&quot; as opposed to for skill.  Just that the RNG hates me when I do SoW potions and smithing.  I can do higher-end potions fine, but SoW potions?  Feh.</div></div><hr />
