Just interesting to see with the recent talks that have been going on here lately.<br />
<br />
Doesn't sound like a Cleric ability though Call of the Wild sounds like Call of the Hero. Knowing SoE's logic they're probably giving Mages a rez ability. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Call of the Wild definitely sounds like a druid rez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm seriously starting to think SoE wants the Shaman class to just go away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">&quot;starting?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Call of the Wild definitely sounds like a druid rez.<br />
<br />
Actually, I was thinking Beastlord. Wouldn't put it past SoE to give Beasties a rez heh... although the description makes it sound shamanistic.  Betcha we don't get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The only possible reason to give it to beastlords would be to destroy the spirit of all shaman... so I guess it's possible :)<br />
<br />
But I would think almost certainly druid, and druid only at that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well a 1% resurrection is better than no res I guess ;)<br />
Although I'd question the wording &quot;Revives a slain ally, restoring a &lt;B&gt;great&lt;/B&gt; amount of their lost experience.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Agrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Wether its druid only or not It better be 80+ or its a waste of time... palys have had 90% res forever.. and to wait till lvl 65+ and spending AA it better not be 25% or some crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Interesting.  <br />
<br />
I like the 2000 hp group HoT; having endurance regen on top of it is just gravy. I wonder, because its an AA, if we will be able to MGB it.<br />
<br />
And yes, Call of the Wild sounds like a druid rez to me.  Yay druids.  As for beastlords getting rez while I wouldnt put it past SOE to do that just for kicks, I consider it kinda unlikely.  Perhaps.  I hope.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Achzizra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Looks like an upgrade to the ward AA - I noticed that both clerics and druids get upgraded wards too, think cleric gets two more levels than druid/shaman but I'm in a hurry and can't re-check.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">To be honest, I'm more concerned about seeing Advanced Dire Charm than for the lack of shaman spells.  Wonder if we'll soon be seeing enchanters safely soloing current raid mobs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">JD - figure &quot;Advanced&quot; DC goes to level 50 or so.  So Enchanters can &quot;safely&quot; solo in Sol B.<br />
<br />
Oops they already do.<br />
<br />
Best use of DC is in Kael Arena. Faction, drops, questable 4 expansion old stuff for the alts / twinks. It's great for grabbing an over-con green MOB and doing Epic (FoB) or faction (Mistmoore) work.  But vis-a-vis non-trivial stuff? C.O.D. &gt; DC<br />
<br />
Just for persepctive, as somebody much wiser than me once said:<br />
<br />
&quot;DC is for the lazy Enchanter.&quot;</div></div><hr />

And even though it's not definite, why are we being overlooked on the rez thing?  I mean, I'm not in favor of us just getting rez, but if they're going to farm out the ability to 2/3rds of the priest class, we might as well get some lovin' too.<br />

Wow... stunned... ASSUMING it's an Endurance regen spell...<br />
<br />
compare the beastlord's Perfection of spirit (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5852&amp;source=Test) with our Ancestral aid (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5935&amp;source=Test).<br />

<br />
Easy.  Shaman is an Endurance Regen AA, Beastlord is a HP/Mana Regen AA.  Comparison complete :)<br />
<br />
As long as BST aren't given a version of our (assuming we recieve one) targettable endurance regen, I'll be happy.<br />
<br />
Got to keep in mind that most of these, namely almost all that were linked other than the first, are very sketchy and probably only sitting there as PH's they didn't delete, or some intern's summer school project, or whatever.  I stopped placing faith in Lucy when it changed the 700/tick DoT to 400 something.  As if in a world with 5kplus ancient nukes, a 700/tick DoT would be imbalancing... good thing they took off that extra 250-300 damage a tick before release, cuz I woulda soloed Time with it.</div></div><hr />

Not only could you have soloed time, but you could maybe on a good day solo Emp Crush!</div></div><hr />

Guessing the endurance regen is 140 per tick. (There are lower level versions that appear to regen 100, 120 endurance per tick)<br />
<br />
<br />
Shaman:<br />
5 ticks (400 hp/140 End) = 2000 HPs,  700 End<br />
<br />
Beastlord:<br />
6 ticks (350 hp/140 mana) = 2100 HPs, 840 Mana<br />
<br />
<br />
Unless I was in an endurance heavy group (what classes use a bunch of endurace?  Zerkers and who?  I honestly don't know, probably Warriors? ) I would prefer the Beastlords' buff.<br />
<br />
Would it kill them to make them both 6 ticks?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Our (assuming it is)  Group hot would end up lasting longer normally just due to the extra buff duration sham have from SCRM (Do BL's get SCR?).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">BLs get SCR3 but no SCRM. ours would end up lasting longer, at least 9 ticks with SCRM and a bert ring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">If you had to pick one, which would you pick...hp+mana/tick or hp+endurance/tick??  Doesn't seem like too difficult a choice for me.<br />
<br />
The fact of the matter is this.  Endurance regen should be on Focus or Ferine Avatar.  It should not be found exclusively this ability.  If you had endurance regen on Focus and FA, this new AA would be used only because it's a group HoT, not for the additional effects.  And if that was the case, 99% of you would choose our HYBRID's aa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Ebonfang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Our role as buffers has always been one of mainly augmenting melee based abilities.  Why should our AA group regens reflect anything other than that?<br />
I'm certain that OOW is going to bring plenty of new endurance based, melee abilities.  The caster classes may not give a hoot, but the melee in our raid situations are going to absolutly love our endurence regens.</div></div><hr />
