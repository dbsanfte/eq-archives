<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bloogbloog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How many bone chips do you need to turn in to get enough faction to bank in cabilis?<br />
<br />
Thanks..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It depends on your starting faction, but I think the number that was calculated last time this came up was around 8000.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Troll on CT faction is little more than 2K...not really worth it IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Krodah Dirtnappah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">to bank you need dubious <br />
<br />
All the numbers are from memory, cause I used to just refer to the threads here and on the sk boards, but if your not a CT worshipper then you start around -2000 faction.  0 is indifferent.<br />
<br />
every 4 bone chips is 1 faction point so 8k = indifferent<br />
<br />
if dubious is around neg750 (my best guess from memory) you need to turn in 1250*4 = 5k bone chips <br />
<br />
that fits with my experience, it took me forever to get dubious.<br />
<br />
good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bloogbloog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thats a lot of damn bone chips...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lemiak Purdyun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">SoV added more to the scrowls range so its way more then that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was actually going to ask the same question.<br />
<br />
As a Troll Worshipping Innoruuk how many chips do I need to turn in the start the Cudgel Quest?<br />
<br />
Also who do I give the Bone chips too and such, I know nothing about raising faction for cabilis except to kill Sarnaks and killed many of those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Boraman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm a Barbie  and I have gotten the MAX faction message after my last Trak kill. <br />
<br />
Anyone know what the will put me at as far as Troopers go?  I'm assuming thats was only faction that came up, I cant rightly remember.<br />
<br />
Would my next step be to start handing in bone chips and is there anything else I can kill to faction up more?<br />
<br />
Are any barbs able to walk freely in Cabilis?</div></div><hr />

<br />
not really you still start out with neg2000 faction based on your race not being Iksar (neg1000) and not worshippig CT (neg1000)  supposedly Inny worshippers get a smaller penalty.<br />
<br />
so it still takes 8000 chips to reach indiff to most factions.<br />
<br />
and to answer the other questions afaik, killing can only improve 2 factions (Legion of Cabilis, and the Necro faction)<br />
<br />
the other factions (Shaman, Citizens, Monk, etc..) all have to be raised by questing.  The easiest (hehe) way to do this is with bonechips.<br />
<br />
LOTS of bonechips :D <br />
<br />
as far as the quest faction you need, I have no idea.  It could just require apprehensive all the way through or it could be like the epic quest where the earliest steps require low faction and the last step requires high ally faction.  /shrug<br />
<br />
I'm ally right now (Troll Inny Worshipper) and as I do the quest if I run into any roadblocks I'll let everyone know.</div></div><hr />

Indifferent to Troopers.  Still KOS to crusaders and everyone else.<br />
<br />
My friend is doing bonechips to do the monk WF quests and I think the number of bonechips she is estimating she will have to turn in is 8000.   Plus then do newbie quests and such to raise for specific factions within the city.. and slaughter bandits and a ton of other stuff.<br />
<br />
I thought about doing bonechips a long time ago, but then decided it was way too much work.  I would rather faction chardok.  /sigh.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nothenon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Krodah's numbers are right on, as far as barbs are concerned.  I've maxed all 6 Cabilis factions, and am indifferent to all.  You can turn in bone chips to Trooper Mozo once you're dubious.<br />
<br />
I killed 2000 iksar bandit types to raise faction with Legions of Cabilis(troopers) and Brood of Kotiz(necros), then the 8000 bone chips took care of the rest.<br />
<br />
If you just want to bank, you can skip the necro faction, and just turn in enough bone chips to get to dubious with the crusaders.  FYI, con BOTH of the crusaders in FoB.  One of them is on scaled mystic(shaman) faction, and you'll be dubious with them sooner than the other factions in the city. As a shaman, you get a small bonus with the scaled mystics.<br />
<br />
If you skip the necro faction, watch out for Grype in east Cabilis.  He's the only NPC in E. Cab. that is on Brood of Kotiz faction.  He spawns upstairs in the Tink &amp; Babble at night in game.<br />
<br />
I did this all before Luclin came out because i wanted another place to train, and buy spells/alchemy ingredients.  Not sure if I'd do it now. :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lemiak Purdyun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">So barbys and Ogres max out at indiff the only two races that can do the shaman weapon quests are iksars and trolls well thats nice :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gothmog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If you are going to go the bonechip route, try to locate a necromancer with the meat-&gt;bonechip AA ability.  You can fill up a bunch of packs full of bonechips easily that way.</div></div><hr />
