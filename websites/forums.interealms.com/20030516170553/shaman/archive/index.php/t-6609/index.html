<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>oomba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Dinged to 43 in a very short time killing ulthorks and walruses near the single tree...troll loves to melee with pet, while dot wears down the mob....only problem was near the end when not one but two druids decided to quad kite the area, leaving troll with only every ninth mob...<br />
<br />
by the way, if you are Kael bound (cause who like them dirty little dwarves anyway) another quick easy exp is grouping with the faction gatherers along the river in GD....for an occasional sow and chloro, and dropping a five damage level 1 burn spell on the mob to ensure faction, the otherwise wasted exp comes rolling in, and it is a rare night when there arent at least two level sixties running around trying to gather heads so they can turn in their kael armor quests...<br />
<br />
exp is not as good as soloing the ulthorks, but it is a great place to hang during guild chat time or when it is time to run upstairs for a bowl of ice cream....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">ahh good idea about gd faction hunters!<br />
<br />
my fav spot for the 40 60 faction grp is kinda redundant atmo<br />
<br />
Droga for chadok faction is nerfed atmo with all the 60+ folk in POP.<br />
<br />
ohh well  guess ill go to velious instead then!  tho i guess this place will also be abandoned to a lesser extent by pop too.</div></div><hr />
