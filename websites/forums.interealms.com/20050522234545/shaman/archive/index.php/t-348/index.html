<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Geldarea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">WOW i finally dinged 34 last night and got all my new awesome shammy spells.  Boy do they rock.  After making some SOW potions and heading to WC, i decided to test my new puppy out on a WC local dark elf named Kizdean Gix(because i owed the little rat)  I summoned my puppy, cast Haste on him, and ordered him to attack. I quickly memmed  Scourge and Winters Roar to help in the battle, but before i knew it my puppy had begun chasing the fleeing Kizdean Gix, he didnt need any help from me lol!  i was laughing so hard it was great.  Thanks for everyones support to encourage me to get to 34. I can plainly see it was well worth the wait.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Zilkoril - hunting at 30, if you have Luclin, you may want to check out either Marus Seru or Dawnshroud Peaks. Marus would be a bit better choice at 30, then I'd recommend Dawnshroud at about 32. This is if soloing. If grouping, then either would be great. The loot is nonexistant, not even coin, but the I went from 30 to 32 in Marus Seru, then 32 to 34 in Dawnshroud, solo all the way. Another advantage is the zones are rarely busy. I've never seen more than 20 people in either zone at any given time. Try these out and let us know how it goes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sengal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've got to agree with ShadoWynd - Marus Seru is the place. I moved there last night and gained nearly 2 and half gold bubbles of XP at level 25 in about three hours. The mobs are plentiful and most of them were conning yellow to red at 25 - so you should find plenty to hunt at 30 (most of the people there were high twenties, low thirties). There were anywhere from 5 to 10 people in the zone so if you find a mob, it is most likely yours.<br />
<br />
Be careful, the mobs will gang-up but only similiar types (at least in my experience). The Zelniaks are highly agresssive with a huge aggro radius, but everything else is pretty tame. I was easily soloing with minimal downtime. If I got an add, the zone to Netherbian Lair is close by. The guards will help with the Zelniaks, but not with the rockhoppers.</div></div><hr />
