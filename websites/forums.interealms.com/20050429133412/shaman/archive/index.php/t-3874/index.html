<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tarnil MacDuff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here is what I have scrounged together so far, I think I like it the best of what I have seen.  <br />
If you want to use it go ahead.  I have yet to find a better spell gem arrangment so until I do I am keeping it as the default.  <br />
The pet window has been replaced with the stat window to make a smaller inventory.<br />
Chat text goes into the window on the right, and everything else on the left.<br />
<br />
One of the major things I did was flatten most of the buttons, I think it looks nicer this way.<br />

<br />
Edited to a smaller file:<br />
<br />
  To install, just make a new directory under uifiles, copy all the files from the default directory, and overwrite with the files from the zip.  Use /loadskin to load it in-game.<br />
<br />
Hope you'll enjoy it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>fethanin-eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thats what mine is like pretty much, except my spell gem slots are combine with the pe winow, which I think is pretty neat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sendadar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have tried to download this file 5 times and it stops at various %'s during download...<br />
<br />
Any possibility to break this file into 2 or 3 smaller files for download?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tarnil MacDuff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That's strange, it stop halfway?<br />
<br />
Ok, going to do it a different way, copy everything from your default folder to a new window, then overwrite the files with what is in the zip file.  It is much smaller now.<br />
<br />
Much better. Click here! (http://members.shaw.ca/Silverhand/EQSkin.zip) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zilansis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">tried this out tonight and gotta say it works great for me.<br />
only strange things is when buffs fade the slot it was in now says &quot;Unkown spell&quot; kinda thrrew me off at first but no big deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tarnil MacDuff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah, that is a known bug with UI editing, either there is a way around it, and someone will find it, or VI will likely give us a way.  It's still a beta test.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Byakko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks Tarnil MacDuff<br />
<br />
Been using your UI for a couple of days now and its been helping me canni alot better than what I used to but I was wondering how do I add the stamina bar back in other than that great UI</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Koraden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Great interface tarnil, but i have a few questions..<br />
<br />
I love the flattened buttons, how did you do this? Also, the buff window is great, but how did you shrink the icons, and does a worn off buff still come up with &quot;unknown spell&quot;?<br />
<br />
cheers,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kraum Ravensbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Rag.. Hey man how did you get that buff window to work in Quartz UI? I spent 4 hrs yesterday trying to get that buff window to work with his UI and it was a no go.  Also have you run into any problems with the UI? Such as looting your corpse?  For some reason I couldnt right click my gear to auto equip and thats a pain in the ass when you get rezzed in ring of Vulak eheh<br />
Please post what you did or maybe just zip it for me?<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Thinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I made a copy of the default folder and extracted the files in the zip to the default copied directory... and get a load error when trying it.<br />

[Wed Jul 31 21:28:21 2002] Error loading skin: loading default skin instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tarnil MacDuff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ok, the last patch broke it, uploaded a new file, just have to do all the install steps again.  I also noticed the weight indicator doesn't always update, I have no idea why, sometimes it will be red like I am encumbered when I'm not.<br />
<br />
The buff window I borrowed from another mod, I think I found it on eqskins.com<br />
<br />
The flattened buttons were made with photoshop, I selected the inside part of the button, without the edges, copied it, pasted into a new image, resized slightly larger then put them back into the outline.<br />
<br />
Also with the last patch, the Unkown Spell error seems to be gone.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Thinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">a lil question... What does a &quot;QuantityWnd&quot; do? there was a duplicate the XML said, so i just removed it from the textentrywnd and it seemed to work heh... i got leet skeelz! =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tarnil MacDuff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Um, no clue, wouldn't that be something to select the cash or an amount of items from a stack?  I never got that error though, so I don't know.  Maybe you should try grabbing cash or items and see if it still works.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Zilansis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">i've been using this and really like it, but one problem still, every time i type /bazaar using this skin i crash right to the desktop.  i can use /bazaar just fine using the default skin. Any idea how to fix this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">the buff window is causing your error.  you need to find the new version of it and replace it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Copy the EQUI_Animations.xml file from the default directory to the custom directory.<br />
<br />
That should fix your crashing problem.</div></div><hr />
