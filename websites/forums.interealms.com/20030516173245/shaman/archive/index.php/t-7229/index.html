<br />
Basically it is a Physics effect that few scientists have known or really put serious study into, and noone has developed.<br />
<br />
The flying crafts are know as &quot;lifters&quot; check this website out for some realplayer videos in action, and alot of documentation of by other people showing it as no hoax (actually the NASA patent on the effect tells you it is no hoax).<br />
<br />
Check it out and tell me what you think.<br />
<br />
I think it is so cool as a proof of concept.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>robert135</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I figure I will give you a summary of what is going on, to make it a bit easier to understand.<br />
<br />
The effect is called the Biefeld-Brown effect (discovered in the 1920's-30's by Townsend Brown). What it is is basically when HIGH voltage goes through a capasitor, and if the capasitor is light, IT WILL FLOAT. As in fly.<br />
<br />
The object you see is made of balsa wood, aluminum foil, and a small amount of copper wire. The copper wire around the top is connected to an outside powersource (for now), and when the powersource comes on, it will make the object fly. (So it is flying without any moving parts)<br />
<br />
The amount of force that the capasitor is able to generate so far is small, just able to float about 90grams max so far from amature experimenters. However, the amount of charge on these capasitors are recieving is the same charge that is from a computer monitor about, so this is a small charge. <br />
<br />
Drop a nuclear reactor on this technology (think nuclear sub) and stick it in space without any atmosphere (zero resistance), and you basically have a precursor to the star ship Enterprise.<br />
<br />
This really is cool. BTW, check out the experiment where they stick the capasitor in mineral oil, to see if it worked outside of air - it does work.</div></div><hr />

Read some of that stuff, very interesting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here is a prelimiary report given by the Army Research Laboratory discussing the effect as of Sept 27, 2002</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tragik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Several years ago I used to read book after book about possible propulsion systems for space and atmospheric flight (and all manner of things, actually) but had fallen out of it recently due to other commitments.  This is definantely exciting to see progress like this being made.<br />

Looked over this myself, looks fairly simple if you're comfortable with working with high voltages. A friend of mine and I are going to give one a try in the next couple of weeks when we have a bit of time, I'll let ya' all know how it turns out.</div></div><hr />

Did you ever find a power supply Tuga? <br />
<br />
I had my lifter built a long time ago, but couldn't figure out a power supply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Been following this for awhile.  Very cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Been working 7 days a week since the last post, just haven't had the time to play with this yet. We intend to use an old computer monitor for a power supply since we have a bunch of them laying around at this point and the voltages/ amperage is prety close to what is required. If you want to use a monitor stick to an old CGA monitor or a very early VGA type. The old green screens look like they'll be just a bit too low wattage and the newer VGA monitors are a bit too high. Be shure to only use one you are willing to sacrafice, since this looks like a easy way to short one out if things go wrong. Good luck. :)</div></div><hr />
