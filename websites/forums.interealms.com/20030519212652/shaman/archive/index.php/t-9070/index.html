<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jenamor61</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Went to Fear the other night with my guild to get the elusive tear from one of the Golems. Due to time i was unable to stay to get it.  However the next day when i logged to my guilds website i saw a post that one of the other epic shaman in my guild had looted the tear and said they would MQ it with me.<br />
<br />
My question to you all is can this be done? Can i skip the second to last battle with Neh'ashiir if i do the RM part of the epic over a few times? or would it just be easier to keep following the epic quest the way it is to be done?<br />
<br />
Please let me know as i would like to get a CoM raid going this weekend to get closser on the completion of my epic.  Thanks.<br />

Ask them to do a shield turn in or two to make sure they're maxxed for security's sake if you're worried about it (never know when ya might take a hit to True Spirit Faction after all).<br />
<br />
And yes you can still skip the Neh part as long as your faction is high enough.  <br />
<br />
Whether it's &quot;easier&quot; or not is relative... if you can get a group together to do Rak you can probably do Neh well enough on the same trip as long as you can handle pulling the upstairs reavers (and generally you can find a few druids and rangers around that still need their reavers anyway to make it worth getting a bunch of folks together for the whole thing).  <br />
<br />
Just do the trip up but don't mess with Rak when he spawns and once Neh is down, get your groups to move and start buffing up for Rak while you run and do your turn in.  They should be all ready to go when you zone back in.</div></div><hr />
