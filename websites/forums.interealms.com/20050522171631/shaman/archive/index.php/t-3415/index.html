<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sanosake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Most of my stuff were just slapped on my shaman with armor I already had. I'm willing to replace them with stuff you guys think better. So if ya guys don't mind, point out the stupid equipment I gave my Shaman that could be better.<br />
<br />
Velious quest armor is not an option btw.<br />
<br />
How much I got? Not really much left. Looking for ways to sell some of my armor and buy replacements for slightly more cash or less. Just upgrades =)<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Tips? =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Athame</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Take it you chose that belt to keep some wis? Otherwise maybe spider fur.. Bandit ring is always nice. All in all pretty nice gear considering they're (almost) all tradables. Once you get your epic your resists and wis should suffer a bit less from all your hp choices (but I wouldn't worry about that). Looks good, well done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Pretty well equiped with tradable gear there.<br />
