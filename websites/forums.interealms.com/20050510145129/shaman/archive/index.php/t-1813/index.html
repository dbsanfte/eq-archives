<br />
The differences in gear between a druid and shaman usually have to do with the fact that a shaman wants to balance WIS with AC and HP.  As we progress through out career, shaman end up taking more and more hits, so AC/HP gear becomes increasingly important.  Also, because HP can be converted into mana (through the cannibalize line of spells) HP also serve as a mana reserve.  <br />
<br />
For example, at 34 you'll find the pet is a godsend... but that it can't take a hit.  You will need to tank for it if it's going to stay alive- and that means you'll need to be able to take a punch.  Later on, when grouped you'll find that slow is a big taunt- and you'll often get pounded on in appreciation for your efforts.<br />
<br />
How to balance WIS, AC, and HP has been the subject of much debate around here so I won't rehash (use the Search function if you want to read the debates) but everyone seems to agree that for a shaman, AC, HP, and WIS are all very very important.  With that, here are my gear recommendations:<br />
<br />
Ears:  Sell both earrings (vendor will pay 250+ for forest loop, not sure what players are paying for hp/mana ring) and get a couple Imbued Golden Ivory Earrings (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4930) (ac 3, +4 wis, +4 vs cold) - they're jewelcrafted and sell for 100 pp each or less.<br />
<br />
Neck:  The cheap alternative is a Ry'Gorr Chain Collar (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=3826) (ac 9, +10 mana, +4 sta, +4 vs magic) which sells for 100-150 pp.  Next step up is a Ivory Imbued Collar (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=1257) (ac 8, +5 wis, +10 mana, +10 vs poison and disease, +2 vs all else) - these tend to sell for 500-1000 pp.  Of only the HP/MANA necklace had some AC to it.... :)<br />
<br />
Face:  The acrylia mask is a good one- probably no change needed here.  Another popular choice is the Arctic Wyvern Mask (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=5289) which sells for surprisingly little (200-500 pp) since tailors make them to get their skills up.<br />
<br />
Head:  The JB helm is a good one- no need to change anything.  I still wear one at 51.<br />
<br />
Fingers:  No need to change anything here- 6/65 rings are great.<br />
<br />
Wrists:  You might want to consider changing the runed mithril to something with a little more AC- for example Totemic (ac 9, +5 dex) for around 100 pp, Ry'gorr (ac 9, +5 hp, +2 str, +2 cha) for a little more, Sentry (ac 9, +2 wis/int, +15 hp/mana, +5 disease/poison, +2 magic, +3 dex) for a little more still.  This isn't a critical change, though.<br />
<br />
Note:  Soon you might want to think about saving for The Bracer.  The Jaundiced Bone Bracer (JBB) has a right-click 263 damage ice nuke, takes 8 seconds to cast, and has limitless charges.  This is one of the most powerful items a shaman can have (along with the fungi tunic and the epic.)  The nuke starts working at level 45, and the bracer generally costs around 10-15k (depending on server, etc.)<br />
<br />
Arms:  Get JB arms (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=2424).  They're cheap (few hundred PP), provide great AC, and a a right-click STR buff once you hit 45.<br />
<br />
Gloves:  Get JB gloves (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=1619) - again, cheap, great AC, a right-click buff (DEX this time).   A more expensive choice- probably 2k or so- are Coldain skin gloves (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4686) (ac 12, +6 wis/int, +20 hp.mana, +9 sta), or for a little more than that, CC gloves (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=3799) (ac 20, +35 mana, +10 str).  Definitely upgrade this slot- as the gnome skin gloves stink for a shaman.<br />
<br />
Shoulders:  The <br />
tattered mantle (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=1063) (ac 12, +20 hp, +10 vs disease) is a nice upgrade for only 100-200 pp.  More expensive alternatives include Chokidai hide spaulders (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6812) (ac 6, +8 wis, +5 poison/disease/magic) for around 1k or the Elder wolf hide (ac 10, +4 wis/int/str, +30 hp) for around 1k.<br />
<br />
Chest:  Ry'gorr is a nice BP- no dire need to upgrade here.  One alternative is the Treeweave (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=2045) (ac 25, +10 str) for around 1k.<br />
<br />
Note:  Just as mana-free damage (the Jaundiced Bone Bracer) is one of the most powerful things a shaman can have, mana free healing/regen is another.  You might want to start saving for a regen BP- you'll find it really makes a huge difference in your overall power.  An iksar regen BP (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=2025) will give you an additional 3000 HP per hour to convert into mana, or just use as free self-healing- price depends on server... around 5-6k on Karana.  The fungi (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=11737) gives 9000 hp/hour, but costs a lot more.<br />
<br />
Back:  Oracle cloak is nice, probably no need to upgrade right away.  The acrylia cloaks (player made) are coming down in price- might be worth it to just wait for the best one (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=8158) to get low enough and snag it.  The next upgrade ac/hp wise is the seahorse cloak (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4714) (probably around 3-4k).<br />
<br />
Belt:  Crystalline belt is good, no need to upgrade for now.  Alternatives include a spider fur (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=3891) belt (couple hundred pp), flayed flayed turmoilskin (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=987) belt (around 1k), or smiters girdle  (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7489) (just under 1k) <br />
<br />
Legs:  This is a particularly tough spot to upgrade.  Common choices are totemic (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=1332) or ry'gorr (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=3893).  The next upgrade is generally jarsath (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=1350) (a hassle because they're NO DROP and drop pretty far into Karnor's Castle) or planar.  Dragonleg (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/adv_search.html?stn=dragonleg) legs are starting to come down in price, but they're still a little pricey for you (around 5k for the cheaper ones.)<br />
<br />
Boots:  Okay, you need to get rid of the GEBs!  :)  Get some JB boots (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=1809) for a few hundred pp... great AC, right-click AGI buff at 45, and no one will make fun of you for looking like a druid.  :)  You should also pocket some nice plat on the deal.  If you can't bear to be without some wisdom in that slot, get some tribal war boots (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6820) instead (nice combination of stats and ac, for around 1-1.5k.)<br />
<br />
Your weapons and shield are great- no need to change anything.  Your next weapon upgrade would be a REIF (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=3969) but that is a little pricey for now (4-5k probably) and wouldn't provide the power increase an iksar regen BP or the JBB would.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I failed to see what's wrong with his necklace.<br />
<br />
And to a certain extent, what's wrong  with his GEB and gloves (sheesh guys, it's lvl29, I was wearing banded.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Moogalak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Her neck slot is probably the best piece of armor on her :p<br />
<br />
65 hp/mana is HUGE at level 30.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I say keep the necklace til around 45...then if you have any 60 shaman friends talk them into going to WW with ya and killing Yeld a few times hehe (kinda long spawn though...like 45 mins, but talise seems to be like 1 in 3 and is pretty nice cause it had a little bit of everything). Would be nice to try to find some group killing out there that will let ya loot a great dragon head (yep, those actually rot sometimes, I have looted 3 from just being out there, or helping kill a dragon and it dropped and getting offered it), you can turn that in in kael for barbed dragonhide boots, 19 ac and has some sta \ hps, though you need like kindly or so to zek to turn this in (turn it in to a guy in tormax room, not dlammaz), and dubious to tormax so you arent killed on sight in his room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">AvalanchW/Moogalak,<br />
<br />
The one problem with the necklace is that it provides zero AC.  Until the soft cap is reached, AC is pretty important.  At 51 with 980 AC self-buffed, I still get the tar slapped out of me on dark blues if slow resists.<br />
<br />
Well, the AC and the fact that +mana items are said to scale with level (I believe it was Abashi that first threw this out there when asked why dark mail gauntlets with +50 mana didn't double the mana pool of a ranger at level nine)... so while a +65 hp designation will always give 65 extra hp, a +65 mana item will give varying amount of actual mana dependant on level.  I have never seen experiments on this, so I can only speak of it second-hand.  If mana scales anything like the mana/wisdom ratio, the ivory collar (+5 wis, +10 mana) gives very similar total mana to the necklace.  In any case, it will give very similar mana in a few levels even if the scaling did not exist.<br />
<br />
So then it just becomes a tradeoff of 65 HP vs 8 AC, +10 disease/poison, +2 fire/magic/cold.  Generally, I've seen the basis for comparison when thinking about items to be 1 AC = 10 HP.  Throw the saves in and I think a good case can be made that the collar is a better investment in the short term and long term.<br />
<br />
One more consideration- jewelry depreciates like crazy (even faster than other items generally do.)  I remember when +65 HP/mana necklaces went for 10k, now they're 1k.  Their value recently took another hit when the cap for int/wis was raised to <br />
255.<br />
<br />
I read the original question to be:  &quot;I have these druid items and this much money- how can I rearrange it to better equip my wife's shaman?&quot;  I'm definitely not saying GEBs or the necklace are crap (I'd've killed for them at 30- I vaguely remember kobold boots and a black iron medallion- ack !!) but in comparison to the 4k in cash those spots represent; the ivory collar, JB boots, and 2500 extra pp are (imho) a better value.<br />
<br />
Not trying to offend anyone.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Biggus, just wondering but would you take the HP/Mana necklace or a spiderfur collar at around the 30's.  Just wondering cause i currently use the necklace, but have the ability to get ahold of the collar for a very lowered price =-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The spider fur is AC 10, +7 str, +7 vs cold/poison.  Hmmmm... if they were priced the same I'd take the HP/Mana necklace (str is basically worthless, and the saves don't help you much in the 30's) - but since the spider fur is likely a lot cheaper it becomes a matter of economics.  If you could get 1k for the necklace and pick up the spider fur for 200, it's a no brainer- get the spider fur and spend the rest upgrading some other gear.  If it's 800 for the necklace, 600 for the collar... it's probably not worth it since the necklace is a little better.<br />
<br />
I'd be tempted to take a ry'gorr collar over a spider fur collar (ry'gorr is one less AC, +10 mana, +4 sta- that's around +8 hp, different saves, and maybe even cheaper than the spider fur.)  Also, if you can get around 1k for the necklace, you're looking at Ivory Imbued Collar territory.  :)<br />
<br />
One of these days I'm going to make a slot by slot shaman equipment guide.  Was thinking about it this weekend, but my brother's main finally got married today and I was best man.  Wow Katta is far from everything!  :)<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

<br />
a) Virtual Weddings are goofy.  But I've already been to one so I can't say anything. :)<br />
<br />
b) Got married in Katta?  Very, very cool - much better than the windmill in LOIO.<br />
<br />
c) Katta is a great place.  check the local tourism dept while you are there.  I spent a lot of time in Tenebrous Mtns.</div></div><hr />

<br />
well, since I AM in the middle of an equip revamp (my twinker seemed to think shadr00ds where AWESOME, sigh*):<br />
<br />
are plat(or even gold if im low on cash) weddin rings worth it? or should i save the extra pp for vel?<br />
<br />
lookin at prices it seems plat fire rings are about 200pp less, and gold can be gotten for under 100.  This WOULD save me alot of cash, but is it even worth getting?  <br />
<br />
-<br />
Coming to a critical point in my developping shammy life(pet in 2 levels), i am revampin my equip situation to include more ac then wis, since now tanking is(or will be) far more viable then before.</div></div><hr />
