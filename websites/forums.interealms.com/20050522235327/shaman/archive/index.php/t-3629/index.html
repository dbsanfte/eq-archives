<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kailyn of Povar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I have a wee tiny shaman alt who is a long way from 60, much less AA's but I did not see any threads on AAs here...<br />
<br />
So what would you recomend for a raiding shaman in a 3rd or 2nd tier uber guild (our goal is to clear NToV by 1/1/03).<br />
<br />
I would assume regen 1,  2, and 3--particularly as I am a troll and I understand that I get 2 for one on these...<br />
<br />
then Run 3 (reverse of almost every other class in the game...HP for mana conversion first, then move speed)<br />
<br />
But from there the way seems signivicantly less clear...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Actually the two points of AA regen per AA point for Trolls and Iksars was removed.  You get the same AA regen as any other race.  The most common AA path taken seems to be..<br />
Run3<br />
regen3<br />
MC3<br />
can5<br />
then whatever you want, id say MGB if you are in raiding guild</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The 2-for-1 on AA regen for Trolls and Iksar was nerfed a few months ago (same patch where they nerfed the Fungi Staff stacking bug).<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course, Run and Regen are the only two General's that are really worth buying.<br />
<br />
Other than those, level 60 is far more important than any AAs.<br />
<br />
Once you finally get 60th, THEN you start worrying about AAs. Assuming you want to maximize your effectiveness as quickly as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>FilurGlamrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The 18 points i have so far, I have spent like this:<br />
<br />
Regen 3<br />
Runspeed 3<br />
MC 3<br />
<br />
This seems to be a pretty standard way to go<br />
<br />
Filur</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Damman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">but I did not see any threads on AAs here...  <br />
haha. <br />
<br />
The default tree *most* follow is indeed<br />
Run3 -&gt; Regen3 -&gt; Mental Clarity3 -&gt; Cann5.<br />
<br />
After that, each skill provides little to no ESSENTIAL qualities, however, I'll state what I feel is the best route. (opinion)<br />
<br />
Cannibalize V (Cann5) This is our ESSENTIAL skill. 1974 HP for ~1100 mana (someone will know the exact amount) is amazing. With a refresh rate of 3minutes, and when used in conjunction with torpor, is about 300 totally free mana per minute. per MINUTE. Yes, I know I'm assuming you HAVE torpor and over 2,000 hp unbuffed. Grab a cleric, make him your symbol and CE bitch if necessary. This skill is simply that amazing. <br />
<br />
Mass Group Buff (MGB) at 9 points is a good way to expand Class skills. If you raid, this becomes a worthwhile skill if only to get back into a raid after a wipe in good time, also the *fun factor* of seeing Focus go off on 3 pages of names gives me a warm fuzzy. For a shaman who doesn't raid, this effect is near worthless, and the points better used on quick buff 3. This is one of the better skills to get right after Cann5 based on the fact that its 9 points towards ELDER title, and saving for 9 points early on is easier than waiting after 60 points spent.<br />
<br />
Rabid Bear (RB) at 5 points still doesn't justify the melee bonus. The DPS with a 20-25 damage weap is roughly equal to chain JBB. Rabid bear does NOT stack with VoB or Avatar, but the duration can be increased with spell casting re-inforcement. (SCRM = 7.5min, rather than 5.0min) Yet, this is a HUGE *fun factor* ability, one used mostly whenever you have a really high Damage weapon (50+ damage and the melee becomes somewhat noticeable). The proc is also a MAJOR taunt, and can quickly get you aggro over Bloodfrenzy, Blade of Carnage, and SoDs. Also, shaman melee is so far below even bards in melee terms, with an attack of 1450 you will still see many misses.<br />
<br />
Quick Buff (QB) at 3 and 6 points are worth the time. both level 1 and 2 quick buff stack with similar focus items to a max of 50% casting time reduction, or 3.0seconds, whichever is faster. Quick Buff at level 3 is NOT worth the 9 points, as with a focus item you can reach the 50% cap, and all this 9 points can get you is 1.5 seconds off torpor. Granted, 3.0 second torpor is valuable, but the difference is not going to increase the odds of channeling to any noticeable factor. These last 9 points are better spent on SCR to increase the duration of torpor, as this will have a more quatifiable effect long term.<br />
<br />
Alchemy Mastery (AM) at 3 points for first level, this might actually be worth getting if you actually make potions above the 198 skill level. (Max Alchemy +10% stone) At 6 or 9 points, this is truely useless. This is also an easy way of spending low points to achieve ELDER title, but in 99% of all cases, I would not get any level of AM.<br />
<br />
Pet Hold at 6 points, I cannot justify these 6 points for pet work arounds. I can make a hot key with /pet back off or any number of work arounds to make this ability near useless. Also, since I rarely have a pet in a bad spot anymore at level 60, this will come after I get innate CHA. (read: never.)<br />
<br />
Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery at 8 points I will cover in Arch.<br />
<br />
for Class skills, to achieve ELDER title right away I would recommend<br />
Cann5 (5) MGB (9) QB2 (9) + Rabid bear (5) or AM1 (3)<br />
-- the last choice merely to get ELDER asap. MGB can be substituted for QB3 as they are same value.<br />
<br />
ARCH Skills.<br />
Healing Gift. This increases the base value of your direct heals, which as I am primarily in raiding encounters, I only heal with torpor. Druids benefit more than Shaman from this, Clerics more still. I dont believe even 7% increase on chloroblast can justify the 12 points, and for me this will be another post Innate CHA skill at any level.<br />
<br />
Healing Adept. Crit heals are too random to rely on, thus this becomes a *fun factor* skill. The power of getting an extra 400 tops HP from chloro will never justify me spending 12 points. Also note, the crit value doubles the heal at every level, rather than CF, which is cumulative. Both of the Healing skills do NOT affect torpor. Another skill to get after Innate CHA.<br />
<br />
Mental Clarity. (MC) I don't care how worthless it seems, FT3 is noticable. While I cannot say it is worth 12 points, the fact this is REQUIRED for Cann5 means you need to get this ASAP. Cann5 is THAT powerful.<br />
<br />
Channeling Focus (CF) At this time, I have only gotten level 1 of CF and I do not notice any improvement in channeling at this time. This indicates to me it's either bugged, or useless, both indicate a post Innate CHA skill to me.<br />
<br />
Spell Casting Fury (SCF) Spell crits. This is a skill that's completely *fun factor*. Note, level 1 increases your damage by 33%, level 2 by 66% and level 3 by 100%. At 2 points it's easily worth it, as you may have just gotten MGB and spending only 2 points after saving 9 is a good way to make the hurt of xping go away for something you can see right away and go woot. This no longer works for JBB, but with focus items you can reach about 1050 crits at level 1 with Ice Strike. Certainly worth the *fun factor* at level 1. After that, I would recommend SCR or SCM before investing too many points.<br />
<br />
Spell Casting Mastery. (SCM) Simply put, this reduces the mana cost of all your spells. Several tests have been run and the value of SCM succeeds 99% of the time for the full reduction it would save. This also affects torpor and turgur, 2 of the 3 spells you will be casting 100times more than any other spell. Though I would wait to have SCR2 before getting SCM3, either path is worth the points spent. Once again, more mana you save, more mana you have to cast that last DoT or Nuke or even gate.<br />
<br />
Spell Casting Reinforcement (SCR) this increases your buff duration. At level 1 and 2 this falls into *fun factor* as the effect does not add any dependable value to torpor, which is really the main reason to get this. At 15% increase for level 2, the mana saved from rebuffing is unnoticeable. Once you're level 60, casting focus on a group over the course of a 5 hour xp camp still means casting it 4 times, either way. At level 3 and beyond however, this skill truely shines, as it makes the extra tick of torpor possible to a dependable amount, and having that extra tick of torpor means a much more efficent Cann5, as well as the savings in buff mana becomes noticeable over a 5 hour period. SCRM, the class ability for 8 points has an odd chance to give a 2nd extra tick of torpor, which again, is the only reason to get this.<br />
<br />
Combined, <br />
<br />
run3regen3 (6), MC3 (12), Cann5 (5), MGB (9), CF1 (2), QB2 (9), Rabid Bear (5)*yay Elder*,  SCR3 (12), SCM3(12), SCRM(8).<br />
<br />
That's how I'm spending my first 80 points (only 9 points left to finish my plan), and after that I'm probably going to start saving them for possible PoP skills should Verant add them. The major factor was a desire to get Elder title right away, else I might not have spent so much in Class so soon. Once again, this is purely MY opinion, and there should be many other shaman to say differently, as there are many different play styles that might find essential qualities in those I would deem useless. Doesn't mean I'm right or wrong, this is just how I see them.<br />
<br />
Edited spelling<br />
Edited tried to make SCM a little more clear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shaman AAXP is like looking forward to retirement in 30 years.  I want something to lust over greedily like Manaburn or Dire Charm.  Yeah, yeah, I know we are the perfect class -- but I'm bored and except for Cann 5, that all looks like timesink fluff to me.<br />
<br />
I want something wicked like Mass Contagion; the next dot you cast is AE. <br />

<br />
What does this mean:<br />
&quot;Spell Casting Mastery. (SCM) Simply put, this reduces the mana cost of all your spells. Several tests have been run and the value of SCM is 99% for full reduction.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I went Run 3, Regen 3, MC 3, Canni 5, MGB, QB 1, QB 2. I am currently working towards QB 3 since I do not want to have my equipment choices limited by effects upon them. If i can get that 3 second torpor without it requiring me to wear some particular piece of gear, that is a win in my opinion. Some might not agree, but for me it is worth it. After QB 3 will be going for SCM 1-3, then SCR 1-3. I am doing all of my 9 pointers now because like someone else said, it is MUCH better to get those out of the way early (when you arent as sick of exp grinding) than it is to do it later. <br />
<br />
Hehe and on my warrior got ND 3 day before yesterday and am currently 2 points from AE taunt omg!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I did them in this order: <br />

Cannibalization<br />
Spell Casting Reinforcement 3<br />
Casting Fury 1 (waste of 2 points)<br />
Healing Gift 3<br />
Quick Buff 1<br />
<br />
Just last night I buffed our entire raid after a wipe without MGB and was FM before our cleric that MGB'd us was FM. I was the only shaman, with about 6 groups of people. This is why I rank MGB on the low end of desired skills. This depends on your raiding situation, some people find MGB more useful than others. Look at how many shamans you have on raids, and how often you wipe and decide for yourself. Even if you are the only shaman though, MGB is not necessary.<br />
<br />
My plan is to get Quick Buff 2 (my Essence Lens will cap my casting haste I think, so I don't need QB 3) then I'm gonna max Healing Adept, and maybe try to find a Healing Enhancement focus item for some bigger heals.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Damman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">What I meant in SCM was. If you look at the text its says:<br />
<br />
This ability gives you an increased &quot;chance&quot; of making your specialization checks. It also reduces your &quot;chance&quot;to fizzle and increases the &quot;chance&quot; to lower the mana cost for the spell.<br />
<br />
When it says chance, the percentage takes full effect 99% of the time. Which is different from say mana reducing focus items, which can be anywhere from 1% to current value%<br />
<br />
For example, cause I know thats still rather unclear. Say you have SCM2, which is 15% in value. If you cast a 300 mana spell, you will save the full amount of 45mana per cast (full 15% SCMvalue) about 99% of the time.</div></div><hr />

If that was the case MGB would be unusable for most clerics since you'd have to have 4k mana to cast it. It works the opposite way. You have to have 1250 mana to cast the spell just like normal but the MGB effect drains upto another 1250 mana from you just like succor drains mana.</div></div><hr />
