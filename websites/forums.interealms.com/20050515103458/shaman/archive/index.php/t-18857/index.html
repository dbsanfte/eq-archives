<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I don't solo much but I do read tales of soloing there that seem pretty crazy to me...like soloing in elemental planes, BoT, and the like.  And most of the folks that tell these tales make it seem pretty trivial and routine.<br />
<br />
So, my question is, how many other classes can pull this off solo?<br />
<br />
Usually the folks that can solo like this have LOTS of AA and great EP gear...and maybe they grab a Virtue for more hps and a KEI for less downtime.  So, how many other classes using only those buffs can solo the same type of content?<br />
<br />
People have tales of so-and-so class soloing so-and-so critter but I'm talking about on a day-to-day routine basis using only one's own gear, spells, and abilities with maybe Virtue and KEI (which are trivially common).<br />
<br />
The reason I'm curious is because I see a lot of posts here about how we always get the shaft when it comes to class boosting via patches or expansions.  I'm thinking that one reason we don't get many boosts is because our class has the potential to solo some very high level content, and it's tough to boost a class such that it gains significantly (to enhance groups, for example) without making it stronger solo.  Not everyone solos, but since the potential is there I think it weighs into the 'are shaman balanced' equation.<br />
<br />
As a side note, I feel sorry for the EQ devs even though they've kind of brought this upon themselves.  I think that EQ is somewhat out of control with the power it offers to characters via AA and gear and it makes it hard for the devs to come out with new abilities and/or loot that can appeal to everyone without further distorting the balance of the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
65 shaman, 200 AA, roughly, EP level gear. So, thats 7200 HP fully raid buffed (which I usually am, as our guild folks are good about drive-by buffing if we find time to solo), mana is over 7k, AC 1502.<br />
<br />
Anything I can root, and that doesn't summon, I can solo, is pretty much what it boils down to. Soloing in any Teir 1 plane is easy, and downtime isn't much. I routinely solo in either PoN or PoD or PoI, using a 2-box to level my lower level alts (its soloing because the alt does nothing, just stands on the hill and soaks up the exp).<br />
<br />
Soloing in Teir 2 isn't as easy, but HoH is quite doable, Tactics also doable if you choose the right mobs, I avoid BoT like the plague because its newb heaven, and the exp sucks in Storms too much to bother with that zone.<br />
<br />
Teir 3 (Elementals) I can solo the &quot;table&quot; mobs in Fire well enough, though there is some downtime involved between them. Its basically &quot;pull with Malicious Decay, throw Virulent Paralysis, dot the hell out of mob, Root just in case VP breaks early, then throw VP again, dot again, etc.) As I said, some downtime, but then, you get something like 14% of an AA per mob, so it only takes 8 of them per AA. Soloing zone-in mobs in Fire is also pretty easy, though the exp isn't as good in Field 1 as over at tables, but tables is usually camped. I can also solo some Earth ZI mobs, but its not a fun thing to do. Haven't tried in Air or Water due to the layout of the ZIs--its just too dangerous for my taste.<br />
<br />
Several dragons in WW are easy now. I can duo Gorenaire with a paladin. Lots of other stuff, etc etc.<br />
<br />
So yes, shaman can solo hard stuff. But the reason we still get our feathers up is that we think we've been &quot;punished&quot; for that soloing ability, plus our Slowing ability, whereas being able to solo mobs that drop squat isn't really a useful thing to be able to do, compared to the sort of mass soloing for exp that druids or necros or some other classes can do. We can be flashy and show off how tough we are on some nasty critters, but when push comes to shove, its just flashy showoff, its not &quot;productive&quot; in any long-term sense.<br />

<br />
Tier 1 = PoN/D/J/I<br />
Tier 2 = PoV/S<br />
Tier 3 = BoT/HoH/Tactics<br />
Tier 4 = EP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aye, I thought about that later, but I avoid PoV just as much as Storm and BoT (and for the same reasons--newb hell), so I don't really think of PoV and Storm much, just kinda gloss over them.<br />
<br />
But yeah, my numbering was off :lol<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yah, with good gear we can solo some tough mobs. We can't output anywhere near the exp ratios that wizzies and druids can. Before LDoN came out one of the druids in my guild was easily knocking down an AA every 45 min in PoStorms. I think the wizzies come pretty close to that. If I truly tried to solo a full AA it'd probably take me about 2 hours in tactics. <br />
<br />
After the cleric and tank went down in an LDoN hard the other night and the rouges bolted for zone I rot rotted 2 mobs to death. Took about 7-10 minutes too. Would I really want to do that again? Hell no. Rot rotting is pretty good for rotting your sanity too. I'd say its also more dangerous for us too. Root break on the wrong time, a stun, and a lucky quad and we can be pretty toasted. Druids and wizzies have snare + instaevac if something does go wrong. <br />
<br />
Solo tough mobs? Yes. Soloing worthwhile for a shaman? Maybe if you're in EP/Time gear and can solo SolRo or Fire.</div></div><hr />
