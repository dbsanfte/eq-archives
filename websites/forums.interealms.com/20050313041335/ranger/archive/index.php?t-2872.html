<br />
If not soloable, whats best partner to bring.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hajime Saito</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 02:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldnt imagine them being soloable at 50. Not with out alot of arrows and time. I would bring a cleric and a tank. You use track to find them and pull them. They are fairly easy but i wouldnt suggest solo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
another question...<br />
<br />
Whats the respawn time on these guys?  Easy for me to get Cleric and Warrior friend to go but we'll all need the drops?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anteil</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">they are instant respawn, when you kill one, either a new hunter/forager will spawn, or one of the rares in the cycle.<br />
I think that's right anyhow</div></div><hr />

Last time I did it was something like 51 Cleric (me), 59 Shaman, 50 Ranger.  With the shammy slowing that Ranger was fine.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cosimo</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 07:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I solo'd the hunter at 54.  It left me lom and low on hp though, not sure if you could do it at your level.<br />
<br />
I did need c3 or I'd have run oom halfway through the fight (I know, 83 wis doesn't give me much mana...).  I rooted, nuked, and dot'd it to half health before jumping in with melee.  Even then I needed to root and step back to heal some near the end.<br />
<br />
Shaman would make a good partner for slows and heals if you're looking for 1 person, I'd bring a small group for more company though.  Any class could contribute something, and you pull.<br />

<br />
Run out and pull it towards one towards the wall.  Snare (which sticks) but root doesn't seem to last long (usually how I kill with my druid, root/dotting).  So I snare, run and nuke.  Its usually pretty close with my old school equipted 55 druid at the end of the fight.  Once its dead, I log out and log in with the char I want to get the key for.   Loot the corpse, and do the second frog.  Turn in the parts for the key.  Works slick. <br />
<br />
I got my seb key for my warrior when he was around 35 just to have it.  My Ranger I just recently ended up doing the quest, only because I know so few people that go there and to an extent rather be guildless.  So I had no real need.  I ended up getting it when a friend who's a level 60 shaman wanted to duo in the guard area.  Which works great.  Any ranger can tank a mob thats slowed by a lvl 60 shaman.  My gear when starting was really bad.  Now its just bad.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fufinski</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not too bad, I have soloed them at 55 while helping pull them for some friends.  I got bored always pulling them back to camp and would just kill the occasional one.  Watch out for some of the named as several area casters.  I think one may even harm touch  although I don't remember if that was definitly the case.<br />
<br />
Make sure tracksort is set to normal.  You should find that within seconds of killing the spawn, a new one pops at the top of your tracking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Solo'd them both, at 46.  Yep.  And I probably woulda lost my level if I'd died.  It's a proud accomplishment.<br />
<br />
But on that note, *don't do it*.  That was the longest two-and-a-half hours of my life.  And it really made me cringe the couple times each they resisted Stinging Swarm.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mileron</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 05:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Both the froglok forager and hunter are level 45.  They've got around 5k HP and hit a ton (117 roughly).  But then, almost all the mobs in TT hit like that.<br />
<br />
Anteil is correct:  they either instantly respawn, or in their place will spawn a rare on the cycle, elsewhere in the zone.  When that rare is killed, the froglok respawns.<br />
<br />
As my Bard (51), I was able to work the frogloks with a 46 chanter and a 59 druid (root-dotting), then came back the week after with a 41 cleric, and duo'ed them.  (Granted, Bards have more options for DoTs.)<br />
<br />
If you're planning on soloing these as a Ranger (Which I've seen my brother's 46 Ranger do a couple times)... a couple things to keep in mind.<br />
<br />
If they pass a froglok shaman, they'll get buffed.  (*cough* sow *cough*).<br />
When pulling, you'll most likely get adds.  The only ones that will be 'easy' to take care of are the tigers and birds.  Fear should stick easily.  (Except on the nameds.)<br />
Try to be 45+ with a Tolan's Bracer, and have a full quiver+ of arrows at the ready.  Of course, this means you'll have to be a bit closer to hit them, as the summoned arrows are only 50 range.<br />
DoTs will take a while as well.  Try to have Tolan's Arms to reduce mana expenditures.  Also, try to root as opposed to snare - this way the 30% decrease on DoT effectiveness while moving doesn't take effect.<br />
Other than that, melee when they start to run, you'll feel better beating the heck out of them ;)<br />
<br />

<br />
If someone is doing the cycle -- they should let you loot the keys because they will rot otherwise.<br />
<br />
Best partner for TT is someone who can fear.  You track, pull, and snare and let them fear.  The named mobs might be tough to pull (because some of them cast), but you shouldn't have much of a problem with the foragers and hunters.  You do get adds sometimes, but usually they are much weaker and can easily be root parked.</div></div><hr />
