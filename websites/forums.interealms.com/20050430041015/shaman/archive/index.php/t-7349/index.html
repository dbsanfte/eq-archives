<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nustrimus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all-<br />
I'm lvl 26 now and I'm looking for a good place to hunt solo. I've been grouped for a while (mostly healer as you probably know) and just whizzed through 20-26 in Pal Caverns in no time.  Right now I'm camped in High Keep and it's so crowded that it's hard to get anything done.  I know in High Keep I'll have to continue grouping but I'd like to get my defense up, so I'm looking for a good place to solo, preferrably on the moon. <br />
If anyone can send suggestions my way, I'd appreciate it.  Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Huurgh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I suggest hunting at the mammyruins in EF. I started there at lvl 24. Tag a mammoth with your DOT, and run at SOW speed over to the Icy Orc temple, kiting the mammoth behind you. When the DOT runs out, stop, hit the hotbutton till its activates, renew the dot and start running again.<br />
<br />
A mammoth takes about 3 DOTS till its turns to flee, then pounce it, and melee it till dead.<br />
<br />
Rewards are good XP, and mammoth tusks, which you carry in a spirit pouch till you sell them to Starn Bearjumper. Max Price being 10 PP (at ally status and CHA 110+) and some change.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Huurgh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sorry EF = Everfrost Peaks, the zone outside Halas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nustrimus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Where are the mammy ruins?  Ive thought about hunting the mammoths but ive run all over the zone looking for them and it takes too much time!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>irishh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Where I am, is at DSP soloing shroom's who con dark blue to red to me so I usually ust take the dark lue and white one's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>teccumseh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Im soloing gnolls at the spires around paw in South Karana.  Whites and reds fall easily, although I recomend a KEI, and the fine steel weapons bring a fair price (4-7pp each) when sold.  I found tagging with a monk the best way to do it.  no, it's not a solo, but we were killing gnolls so fast it hardly mattered.  In no time I'd picked up half the exp to make lvl 26 and a nice amount of cash as well.  There is no bank near, so I gated to nexus, sold, banked, then took the portal back to karana and started over again.  I preferred this zone to HHK even with the banking advantage HHK has.  What I dont recomend is letting someone take you into Echo caverns.  I did it, and wont do it again anytime soon.</div></div><hr />
