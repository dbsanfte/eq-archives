<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bakkura</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When you get an offer to sit 'outside' a group and FA them(not actually in the group cause they had chanter and beast for slow),it's time to consider exactally why i'm wasting my time as a Shaman.Been told to make a&quot;useful class&quot;,be a Druid,Bard or Beast,i was told....i honestly don't want to play any other class,and why should i have to to be competitive?There are the &quot;pity&quot;invites from friends whom i've been attatched to at the hip for 60 levels,and it's much appreciated ,but i;d like to do more than watch others kill the mob before i can get a nuke off(trying to dot is useless,mob is dead before 2 tics kick in and heals are not enough to make a difference/shrug).Don't get me wrong,up until level 65 i loved playing my class and was useful in groups,i had a ball,but now there is no use for me,expecially into Elementals and up.Is sad to see such a great class become phased.I don't think SOE is going to change the class to become useful and from what i've read they pretty much said so at fan faire.I have a few months left before my subscription runs out ,unfortunately it will not be renewed.I'm just tired of the fight in a game that's supposed to be fun.Biding my time til WoW is released,happy journeys and luck to all,thanks=).</div></div><hr />
