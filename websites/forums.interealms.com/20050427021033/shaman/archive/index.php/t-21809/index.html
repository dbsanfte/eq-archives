<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Solusek.Spirituous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im 65 with 183 aa's....im fully ep flagged...3.6k hp unbuffed, around 6k mana....where would be the best place for me to solo?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For pure xp you can't beat the tables at Fennin Ro prep area of the second castle in fire. There are posts here on how to do it, but you should have no issues, and it will be trivial if you have virulent paralysis 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Solusek.Spirituous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">only VP1.....and it seems to get resisted alot unless i malo...im wondering can anyone here tell me how to get to tables? only times i been to pofire i was either at c1 grouped or coth'd to fenninro/charm birds/druav etc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">vp has nothing to do with malo, that may be one of your problems<br />
<br />
use your lvl 63 desease debuff</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Solusek.Spirituous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">anyways...to get to tables i go on the hill with lev....run to the building...and i dont know where to go from there...are the tables inside the castle?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">yes, as you stand on the rock facing the castle you enter and head diagonally to the left. You have done FR so you should know this area. You cannot be coth'd to the tables as far as I know so you must have done this run at some point. Take a look at the map on eqatlas to figure out your route.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">prolly coh'd to charm birds and ran to tables.<br />
<br />
anyways, zone in, levi, invis, hug right and levi across into the 1st castle.  go down to the middle of the hall, down the steps and to the middle of the hall again to another set of stairs going down.  Facing directly across should be a doorway.  Outside that doorway is the charm bird spot.  You should know the way to 2nd castle.  (Hug right to 2nd castle)  Yes, there are tables at the table spot in c2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Solusek.Spirituous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">okay thanks a ton...the thing that pisses me off though is how they are always camped...and 1 group sometimes even 1 person will claim the whole camp as theirs and not want to share....any better places in other eps or something? i can solo single mobs in srt it just takes a really long time so that exp is crap</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">At least on my server, the nameless, tables isn't really a camp, and all the mobs are FFA, because once you learn what you are doing you can pull singles from the entire castle.  As a soloing sham the casters are a pain because they will break VP sooner. <br />
<br />
Also, malos has nothing to do w VP getting resisted.  What i do is pull with MD, then VP immeadiately.  Using VP3 i've never had it break early, except when someone else nukes my mob.</div></div><hr />
