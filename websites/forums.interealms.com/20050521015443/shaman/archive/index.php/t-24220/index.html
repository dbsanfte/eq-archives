<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kellz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok....  So a pali in my guild finished his epic last night before raid.  Comes a time where he's off-tanking and does the right click effect.  <br />
<br />
This was some of the result.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
...the 14k crit was a druid, btw.<br />
<br />
<br />
I was using the new 68 heal.   (Previous high crit was around 5100)<br />
I have up to AHA3 and Marr's Blessing Focus.<br />
<br />
<br />
So like I said... Bug or Feature?<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I couldn't stop laughing crit-ing that high, but do have a slight tinge of &quot;boy that's overpowered&quot;....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i think the pally epic is meant to double the ammount that they are healed for.  So it should double the ammount you crit for also.  <br />
<br />
I've heard of a pally getting crit chealed for 54K...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The pally epic has a focus effect that increases heals on them and the clicky buff that does the same thing. Wanna say the total is something like 50% more healing or something like that but yeah pally epic is suppose to make heals land for more on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What I want to know is how I get my chat screen to report what spell NPC's are casting.  Wow, just noticed that it tells what spell other players are casting too!  I definitely want to know how to make that work :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thats the leadership aa spell awareness, 2nd best only to hott.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Dang, after I posted that, I just knew someone was going to tell me it was a Leadership thing :(  I lead groups all of the time, but I don't have Gates of Discord...so I guess I'm just out of luck.</div></div><hr />
