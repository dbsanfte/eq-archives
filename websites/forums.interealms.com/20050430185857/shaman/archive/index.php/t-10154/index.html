<br />
I keep seeing this expression on threads on different message boards. thread hijack this thread hijack that . My question is what does this mean. I know what hijacking means (i.e. terrorists hijacking a plane) but i don't see how that would apply to a thread.<br />
Can somebody clear this up please?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

1 cup white sugar <br />
2 eggs <br />
1 teaspoon vanilla <br />
1 1/2 cups pumpkin <br />

1/2 teaspoon salt <br />
3/4 teaspoon ginger <br />
1 teaspoon cinnamon <br />

Preheat oven to 350 deg. F. Cream margarine with brown and white sugar. Beat in the eggs and vanilla. Add pumpkin, flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, ginger, and cinnamon. Mix well.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Anwariad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Wendy's hamburgers taste like stewed beef to me.  Hamburgers should be grilled.  Fried is second best.  Whatever Wendy's does to the meat to make it taste stewed should be stopped.  It just not right that a cow gave its life to become a Wendy's hamburger.<br />

I like the chicken sandwich, fries, and frosties though.</div></div><hr />

You know that yummy chilli?<br />
Well here is how they make it.<br />
The meat that is burned or well they liek to call it &quot;overcooked&quot; is then put into bags and frozen for next day when it is boiled and ground into powder.<br />
Then they add onions and nice chili powder and water and weeee fresh chili.<br />
Bon Apetit.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Wendy's Chili ROCKS.  Holy crap, they can make it however they want if they keep doing it.  Not to mention have you looked at the nutrition info on their website?  200 calories for a bowl of chili!  For crap's sake you can't find a teenie-weenie sized candy bar under 200 calories.  If you are watching your weight Wendy's Chili is your best friend.  With 2 packages of crackers it is still only 250.  You just can't beat that for a decent meal, especially considering it is a only $1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Thanks for da recipe.  I figured they used da leftover burger meat (da lil square bites wuz a big hint).<br />
<br />
Da best parts of lotsa recipes is da burnt parts of da meat.  In KC alla da BBQ places serve &quot;burnt ends&quot; which are a big seller.  Dey started out as da small end of a brisket, which got overcooked in da time it took ta get the udder end done.  chunk up da overcooked meat, voila, burnt ends.<br />
<br />
My most favorite taste in da whole world (RL, not Norrath, so gnome crunchies don't count) is da greasy, crispy exterior of a well done pork roast.  Da drool is running down me jowls as I type!!<br />
<br />
and da chili is wunna dem thingies dats gets better wit age.  like curry.  not like sushi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Thantu calories are NOT everything.<br />
There are foods that &quot;sabotage&quot; weight loss so to speak.<br />
The lima beans and Kidney beans slow down the function of the thyroid (not sure that is how it's spelled but it is that part of your brain that affects your metabolic rate).<br />
So while u are eating less calories u are also burning less and storing more :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Another example would be those dumb ppl that go and work their asses off in a gym for 2 hours. then go and have nice big icecream.<br />
That icecream that took 5 minutes to eat just killed off 2 hours of workout cause now the body is usin ght e sugar that is going in your blood as opposed to tapping into the fat already in your system.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also find out your blood type and look up on the net what each bloodtype can and cannot handle. I am type A and lima and kidney are very very bad for me moreso than others but the effect on the other blood types is similar.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">That's interesting about the bloodtypes; first time I've heard that mentioned, I'll look into it.  As for the weight loss, the chili makes a nice treat for my wife once or twice a week so she can get some &quot;real food&quot; in her, heh.  Also an intersting point regarding the beans, as Hypo-Thyroidism runs in her family down the female side.  Me, I sit on my butt all day long, eat what I want, and ride the excersize bike once a day for 1/2 an hour (I added that two weeks ago to help work off the 8 pounds of jellybeans I ate at Christmas [not kidding]).  Thank you fast metabolism.</div></div><hr />
