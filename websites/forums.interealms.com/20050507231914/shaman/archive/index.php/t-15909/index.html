<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hmm chromatic might be a combination of all the resists? just a wild guess</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm thinking random resist check each cast?  Or as a nasty mob AE, one that checks against your weakest resist?  (Doubtful, and overkill with the -200 resist check)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">-200 only means you still have 300 points of resist to go!! :)  <br />
<br />
Chromatic = relating to color or colors, so my guess is going to be that it is an average of all our resist flavors or they just have not decided what resist to lump it under yet.<br />
<br />
There would not be much point in introducing a totally novel resist anyhoo.  That would be like adding a new form of Cha.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm guessing all those players with terrible taste in dye colors are going to anihilated by this spell. At least I'm hoping so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">and imo adding a new flavor of resist would be a) a techincal imposiblity for SOE b) just to much of a pain in the butt cause have to add the resist to all kinds of older gear etc etc etc.  But the biggest factor is that SOE cant program its way out of a glass house</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">it wouldn't be that hard to have a spell call for all 5 resist values and average them before doing the resist check.  I think SOE might even be able to program that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I doubt it is a new type of resist, more likely it just works against the sum or average of your existing resists.  The name &quot;chromatic&quot; suggests that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Togh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I was browsing through the spell changes on test and I found this.<br />

So the interesting part is &quot;Resist: Chromatic&quot;. Has anyone see this before? Is it new?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grubnuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Chromatic typically means using all colors in the chromatic scale.<br />
<br />
This may mean that Chromatic resist checks somehow check against all resists, not just a single category.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Here's all the spells with &quot;Resist: Chromatic&quot; on Test Server as of today. They are all new spells (for LDoN?) and they all have a large Resist Adjust. The corresponding Live Server spells have a blank Resist field.<br />
<br />
Aura of the Synarcana (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=4116&amp;source=Test)<br />
Flames of the Fiend (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=4117&amp;source=Test)<br />
Dark Mass (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=4120&amp;source=Test)<br />

Cast on other: Someone begins to dance. Badly. :D<br />
Curse of Kel'Novar (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=4199&amp;source=Test)<br />
<br />
Interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If they put PC spells in with Chromatic resist checks, that will make the MALx line of spells a LOT more powerful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thats the problem so far. Mobs get this, we dont. And the spells based on Chomatic are downright NASTY!<br />
<br />
Blurring Focus<br />
1: 	Decrease Spell Haste by 50%<br />
2: 	Decrease ATK by 200<br />
3: 	Cancel Magic(9)<br />
4: 	Cancel Magic(9)<br />
Target Type:  	Unknown(33)<br />
<br />
Make spells take 50% longer to cast, reduce the ATK by 200, and dispell 18 slots! Ouch!<br />
<br />
Target type is also some new ****, and Lucy doesnt know what it means. So we dont know if this is some AE or single target stuff.<br />
<br />
Dispell by itself is highly annoying. Complete dispell (ala Terris Thule) is fooking stupid. And here we go again.<br />
<br />
Spell haste slow... Well, I will paraphrase one of our clerics who encountered this vs an elemental God recently. &quot;I went to cast remedy on the MT, and for all intents and purposes, I might as well have been silenced. He was going to be dead long before it landed.&quot;<br />
<br />
And we pay these people to do this crap to us?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Delightful Dance is nasty can you imagine your whole raid turning into Halflings? :eek:<br />
<br />
Interesting to see what they do with this so far Ldon is looking very promising</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Interesting...very interesting :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I kinda like the increased casting time idea. Adds a level of variance to the game, and a heck of alot better an option than TT's mass dispell. Spell effects like the Silence(PoTorment ravens) make the game interesting and keeps people on their toes.<br />
<br />
Wastrel da Leezurd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">neat.<br />
like others i am going to guess that it is checked on the average of your resists, or a random  resist</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">3: 	Cancel Magic(9)<br />
4: 	Cancel Magic(9)<br />
<br />
Make spells take 50% longer to cast, reduce the ATK by 200, and dispell 18 slots! Ouch!<br />
<br />
At the most that would be 2 slots dispelled, not 18.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If I had to guess I'd say that delightful dance is the new bristlebane ae..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I should think it's one of two things:<br />
1) checks vs. all your resists individually . . . can't buff just one or two resists and be good . . gotta have them ALL high or no go.  <br />
2) checks vs. the composite totals (perhaps with adjustment factor) of all your resists.   <br />
<br />
Of the two, i'm leaning towards number 1.</div></div><hr />
