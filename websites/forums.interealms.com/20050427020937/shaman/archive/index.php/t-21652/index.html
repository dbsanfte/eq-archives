<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">semi retired 61 shaman trying to solo the east wing to finaly finish the master key quest.<br />
<br />
just wondering if its remotly possible at this level, Ive been trying off and on for awhile, its just hard as hell. its even iffy if I can break the 4 mobs in the room past the entrance to the wing.<br />
<br />
wondering if I could get some advice on how to do this. I have malo/torpor. canni 5 and SP1.<br />
<br />
what tends to work best for me is to root one in a corner. and have 2-3 mobs run out and deal with them using spirit call and lots of rooting. if there arent any HT mobs in the group I should be somewhat ok. 1 or 2 and its a lost battle right there. with virtue and self buffs I have a little over 4.1K hp (not too great, I know)<br />
<br />
am I pretty much screwed unless I bring someone else with me? (not likely, ever)</div></div><hr />

Think you will have a very hard time with this.  The area where the last component spawns for the key has about 6 mobs in it.  Never tried to invis past them since they are generally a mix of live/undead.<br />
<br />
I hunted a lot on HS in my 60s with my monk alt.  Was a good place to explore, XP was decent and some of the drops from south could go for 10k.  At 65 the place still has appeal, but I'm loathe to go back because of 1 thing:  horrid corpse runs.<br />
<br />
Having died in the south wing once due to a mistimed spawn of a named it took 4 hours to get a team down there to help with the CR.  We then finished up the key quests for everyone, but haven't been back since.<br />
<br />
Your best bet to do this solo is to get to 65, get VP and your ornate pants.  Not to say you absolutely can't do this now, but I think it will be extremely hard.<br />
<br />
Peace,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mgbaron2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Would it be possible to simulate the old run to PoM??  (don't know if this is possible or not - pure speculation here).<br />
<br />
Get yourself a Rune, Divine Aura item (or can clerics project this now?) or just buff your hp as much as possible and try to bull rush your way to the last item.  Pick it up and have an insta-gate potion hot-keyed and ready to chug as soon as you grab it.<br />
<br />
I don't know if this would be possible or not, I'm just tossing out ideas...  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>spiritsofding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">thers a route u can take thro east wing that could get u to outside dusillas room with IVU on. Small chance of a spermthingy en route, but with luck the spawns woould be mostly undead.<br />
click divine aura and enter room.......<br />
<br />
well in theory this could work........but ud have to be lucky!!<br />
<br />
If u have spent time in hstones surely u have seen other hs regualrs in there?  wont hurt u to try and make friends....<br />
<br />
try and find bored necro with direcharm to come with ya.<br />
<br />
/w 64 65 necro all.  just send tells.<br />
<br />
persistence and courage are useful traits!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I highly doubt you could solo to Drusella's room at level 61,  maybe at 65 in planar gear but definitely not at 61.  I tried this many times and eventually just gave up,  but a few weeks ago a necro friend of mine said he would help and boy did he ever.  All I can say is never underestimate a good necro =P<br />
<br />
What I would do is wait until you find someone who wants to go kill Drusella and then team up with them.  They get the Urn (or Mirror or whatever they are after) and you get the key!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
still works<br />
<br />
looks like the answer is no. thanks for the advise though. I can stop having those close calls now =P hs is probbaly about 99% empty on my server, so finding someone there to help is pretty slim.<br />
<br />
thanks for the info. might have to grab a shiny brass idol =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I go clear Drusilla and her room every few weeks if she's up. I'm 65 and have pretty good gear and it's still pretty challenging. I probably have to gate 1 out of 5 times due to resisted slows or too many interrupts.<br />
<br />
Yes you can still lev across from the firepots on North side.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tsuyoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Decided to try this yesterday since I wanted a drop from DS anyway.  Found that at 65 everything up to the south wing is easy.  At the south wing I was glad to have my monk along since in some cases even with him I was only able to get pairs of mobs.  Didn't try the lev run from the north wing to the east but will do so on my next opportunity.<br />
<br />
I did find that the break-in at the east wing was the most difficult encounter on the way to DS.  The room has 4 dark blue mobs and several wanderers.  Because of pathing the monk generally would get all 4 mobs if he pulled.  Thinking that the dog-dog pull along with the monk pacify is the only safe way to get clean pulls from this room.  The limited space available makes FD splitting tough.<br />
<br />
I found in my 2 attempts that I could duo 5 mobs at once but it was tight.  Had 2 wanderers come in late in my 2nd attempt and the HTs did my monk in.  Had to get a guild necro a key in order to get rezzed.  Not sure how you would invis past these since they have overlapping agro ranges and are a mix of live/undead.<br />
<br />
As an FYI, hunting is good in the south wing.  In my 3 hours in the zone I got 1.5k in cash, 8k in spells, 15k in bazaar loot and .75 of an AA for each (at 90% towards AA).  I also turned in a bunch of stuff for tribute and ended up with about 10k worth.<br />
<br />
Peace,<br />

<br />
Tried this again last night.  Wasn't able to make it from the north fire pots over to the East platform.  Always fell just a bit short.  Did a bit of research and found that this is highly dependant on your lag and video card.  In order to make the run you need to do the following:<br />
<br />
<br />
 Go into options and turn off all video affects that might add lag<br />
 Make sure you have a SOW effect on (best to do outside of zone)<br />
 Make sure you have a lev effect on (SoE preferable for both SOW and Lev)<br />
 Kill mobs at either north or south wing entrance<br />
 Backup to get on top of a firepot so that you can turn and face the east platform<br />
 Face 100% up<br />
 Time your run to coincide with the &quot;up&quot; part of your lev bounce<br />
 If you have a 2nd person, have them stand on the platform with you but between you and the east platform.  They will give you a little boost.<br />
 Run to the east platform and kill the mobs there<br />
 Reset your video preferences to what you prefer<br />
 <br />
<br />
In some cases you will never be able to do this run it seems.  Reviewers of the strategy have noted that on one machine that they can always make the run and on a lesser machine they never can.  I may fit into that second category unfortunately.  :(  Guess I'll find out tonight.<br />
<br />
For the 2nd night in a row I got overwhelmed when I did a bad pull and ended up leaving my monk's corpse laying there.  Definitely helps to have a few necro friends to help with the CR/Rez here.<br />
<br />
From my recent experiences I'd say that doing the key quest solo before 65 would be extremely difficult.  Even at 65 it would be very touchy.<br />
<br />
Peace,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">another tip for getting across to the east wing. if you run at an angle, like hitting foward and right and using mouse look to point your self straight at the ledge as you move (kind of hard to explain) you'll move a tiny bit faster. I can make it evertime with only run 3 as long as I do that.</div></div><hr />
