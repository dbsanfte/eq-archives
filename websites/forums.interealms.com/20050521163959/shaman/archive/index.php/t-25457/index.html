Monk and I are in a time guild, we have no qvic gear or anything. He's about 8k unbuffed, Epic 1.5 and despair offhand. Fight was prolly like half an hour. Robe, Eye, and Shoulder loots.<br />
<br />
Was a lot easier than I thought it would be. I tanked rampage the whole fight. All you need is Serenity, Yoppa's, good flowing thought, and a knowledge of AEs and positioning. Let the farming commence! ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, and someone to clear the rest of the plane for you.<br />
<br />
Grats on the kill though, that's impressive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Why do you need to clear the plane? He doesn't summon the rest of the zone like Tunare. The two of us cleared and killed draco, then terror, then pulled/killed CT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">He DOES summon the zone, they just have to run to get there.  They don't appear the way the golems do.<br />
<br />
We once cleared a large space, then downed CT quickly.  The mobs from other parts of the zone had just started arriving when we killed him, because they had to run a pretty far piece to reach us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, that contradicts what Grizlor is saying, then, because there's no way it would take over 30 minutes for the mobs to get to him if CT did summon them to his aid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>GrishMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">He certainly used to summon the whole zone.  Maybe he is bugged or was recently changed.<br />
<br />
What did you do with the Golems to avoid the DT when duoing?  They aren't hard but losing one of two at the beginning would suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We cleared Fear single group a few weeks back (don't ask, my friends do this kind of stooge stuff), and wiped first time to CT because he did summon the whole zone, we had about 60 mobs in various states of CC when it all got too much  ;)<br />
<br />
So we rezzed, cleared the rest of the zone and killed him.<br />
<br />
But yeah, grats on sham monk uber duo ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ospri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">He said they killed Terror, who doesn't DT.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Awesome Grizlor.<br />
<br />
Did you resist the knockbacks? If not, did CT summoning take care of that for you? How large of an area were you playing in? (ie. temple? nsew?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">damn.. what the frick griz</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Big grats, although CT is more of a wimp then not these days, a few friends of mine who never were in a raiding guild 1 grouped CT few months ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Griz, I like your UI. Where can I get that at?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Didnt they recently change the amount of damage done by a DT because there were some warriors surviving FULL DT's? LOL, cracks me up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>eci_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hey Grizlor, <br />
<br />
First congratz on the kill.<br />
<br />
I was looking at your screen shot and REALLY like your UI layout.  It looks like you run at 1024x768?  I was trying to find a decent UI that can run at that &quot;lower&quot; resolution than most people run at.<br />
<br />
If you would be willing to zip up your UI directory and send it to me, I would greatly appreciate it.  ag_323@yahoo.com<br />
<br />
Thanks, and again, congratulations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Why do you need to clear the plane? He doesn't summon the rest of the zone like Tunare. The two of us cleared and killed draco, then terror, then pulled/killed CT.<br />
<br />
That's incorrect.<br />
<br />
I remember trying CT a very long time ago without clearing the whole zone.<br />
<br />
What a mistake that was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Ok, here's the beef.<br />
<br />
CT doesn't call the whole zone. We pulled him to the northwest corner of the zone. The monk kept CT facing the zone wall until 96%, then  it didn't matter because he kept getting summoned from the knockback. Kept serenity on the whole fight, he didn't really need too much healage. Horse without KEI was plenty.<br />
<br />
Regarding my UI, it started out as a modded T-King and I sort of messed with it some. There's a bar over both chat boxes which serves as the pet window, and has a transparent section for the target window. That bar you see over my hit points is Health of Target's Target, which I never really did incorporate, and is just sort of an afterthought. I usually leave it over my hit points/mana so I can see who I'm casting on and compare it to my status.<br />
<br />
Right chat window is all the chat, left chat window is all melee/spell spam, rampage messages, deaths, etcetera.<br />
<br />
If you'd like a copy, PM me with your email address and I'll see if I can hook you up. Most likely I'll have to throw in my Charactername_Servername.ini as the window layout is all messed up otherwise. It's about 2.5 megs, I think hotmail allows that now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I too remember CT calling the whole zone, but if you could avoid that somehow, I am sure he could be solo'd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Avoid = exploit ?<br />
<br />
Or avoid as in &quot;Well I guess we got lucky because he didn't summon the whole zone for some reason...&quot; ?</div></div><hr />
