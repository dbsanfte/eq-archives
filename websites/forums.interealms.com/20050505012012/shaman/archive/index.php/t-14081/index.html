<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Recently we had a discussion in our guild about cheating and using 3th party programs. (for the record I myself am against the use of spawn trackers and packet sniflers)<br />
One of the more interesting facts that came up during this is that we all cheat and that one can even argue that SoE forces us to cheat. <br />
When you start to think about it you will soon find out that a lot of crucial information is missing inside the game.<br />
Think about information what a spell actually does, information on what focus effect do but also information about game progress.<br />
<br />
In a game where everything is made easier each patch for the starting player I still find it funny that we have to rely on web based information for some of our core abilities.<br />
<br />
I can understand some mystery has to be kept to make things more fun but aint it about time that this issue is addressed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if: Speeding and murder are illegal<br />
and: most people speed<br />
then: most people are as bad as murderers<br />
<br />
This is a logical falacy.  Shining a light into the mystery of the game is one thing, outright cheating is completely different.  When you go to a site that gives you spoiler info, you know that you are getting data in a way different from how the programmers intended.  This is needed, if you want to stay competative all the other players who are going to those sites.<br />
<br />
Contrast that to people running third-party programs that give you an alarm when a mob spawns and tells you his loot, allows you to see in the dark or gave you the cartography system 2 years ago.  Now THOSE are cheats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Amen Stygiana, well said.<br />
<br />
The argument, that not knowing the mechanics of the game (in some way the mechanics ARE the rules of this game) adds a sense of wonder is somewhere between lame and laughable.<br />
<br />
Not perfect analogy, but when you think about 'old' pen and paper roleplaying games, you knew exactly, how your abilities, the monsters and the fights were calculated. Does this hurt the fun of playing? I think not.<br />
<br />
Hint to developers: if you really want to save some sense of wonder, go for<br />
- logical, well constructed storylines<br />
- changing and challenging more flexible content<br />
- in my opinion stop adding more meaningless pseudo zones (aka PoP) and try to get some more 'depth' and gameplay fun in existing zones.<br />
<br />
Lame restrictive information policy != sense of wonder.<br />
<br />
Here is a quick list of game information, i would like to see 'officially':<br />
- detailed (and this time maybe correct) explanation of basic player stats<br />
- general explanation about basic game concepts like<br />
  - aggro, mob assisting and /con system<br />
  - line of sight<br />
  - calculating of hits and misses (the general method, not all maths).<br />
  - spell effects (OK kinda in work´at the moment)<br />
  - casting system in general<br />
  - races and classes and their abilities - strengths/weaknesses<br />
    (is CHA still a secondary stat for shaman creation? lol, what a joke)<br />
- mana in numbers<br />
<br />
Sometimes a VI employee goes out a bit (usually at a FF) and explains some details, but<br />
that is far from a reliable source of information. The other source is what players 'think', game mechanics are in their experience. To put it blunt rumours, even if the players try hard and do as much research as they can.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, i don't want to see every bit of their code and understand every detail of game system. What i would love to have is a general, but founded understanding of the game mechanics and rules, so i can strive to improve my gameplay and optimize my character development.<br />
<br />
When you talk about 'cheating' in terms of using other programs to gain an unfair, in the 'normal' game impossible advantage (like spawn detections or similar things, is this possible?) - i am all for an immediate BAN without suspension for every gimp, that does it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have to disagree, no one forces you to do anything in this life. No matter how you angle it, try to deny it or dont want it to be true, it is you that makes each choice. There is no need in this game for packet sniffers, EQW, mob trackers or things like EQshow. none of that stuff needs to be there to enjoy the game. Its the choice of the individual that feels the challange is to great or its simply too much of a pain to do it the way the game is designed.<br />
<br />
Now &quot;spoiler info&quot; i dont find to be cheating, cause this is research by people who have killed mobs and done encounters. Thats just sharing knowledge of the experince IMHO. No one said you had to get every bit of info without help from friends and other people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The line I draw between the two is simple:  if what you're doing defeats the reward for risk system and/or gives you an unfair advantage over your PC competition, it's cheating.<br />
<br />
Packet sniffers, item duplication methods and pathing exploits (such as the use of wall fearing) are cheating.  Spoiler info and tactics sharing are not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Imagine this: you are a young shaman wanting to go out into the world for adventure.  What would you do?<br />
<br />
Well I suggest that you WOULDNT just blunder out into a dangerous situation without maps, without any knowledge of monsters, without any knowledge of your spells.<br />
<br />
You'd go into a bar in Halas and you'd buy drinks for the grizzled veterans and learn every last detail you could, scrawl maps on beer mats, listen to stories about the biggest mob that got away, before you went out and risked your neck.<br />
<br />
Now unfortunately conversations with NPCs in EQ can't give you that information.  But reading up on websites is a reasonable and valid substitute.  So I don't consider it cheating.<br />
<br />
BUT the young shaman cannot buy a radar set to show him where mobs are.  He cannot buy xray goggles to see through walls so he can tell what mobs are carrying.  So thats cheating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So which is worse, the person breaking the law speeding that gets caught and gets a ticket, or the person who doesn't get caught?<br />
<br />
Obviously its the one who gets caught, just ask the insurance companies.<br />
<br />
Now ask the same question concerning murder.  Just doesnt work, does it?<br />
<br />
As far as looking up spell info goes, like using lucy.  I would not consider that cheating.  As a master of the arcane of any sort, you would damn sure know what exactly the spell does.  We just have to learn it through other means.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I don't even know why I'm replying to Litgruv, other than to point out he's wrong I guess.  <br />
<br />
Using EQw is not cheating, and it has never been cheating.  It DOES NOT MODIFY GAMEPLAY and therefore is not in violation of the rules or EULA.  God forbid I can actually have some sort of interaction with the real world while I play EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Its cheating if SOE says it cheating, thats about it.  It would be nice if they defined cheating so you would know for sure if you were, but they don't.  Usually its only cheating after you get caught.</div></div><hr />

Speeding is hardly a felony.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Worse in what way?  Morally?<br />
<br />
Obviously its the one who gets caught, just ask the insurance companies.<br />
<br />
So you mean worse financially?  Ok, that is obvious--just ask the guy getting the ticket which is worse.  I'm sure he'll agree.  If you mean something other than financially, i.e. morally, then you're making insurance companies the moral arbiters of society.<br />
<br />
Now ask the same question concerning murder.  Just doesnt work, does it?<br />
<br />
Because insurance companies don't care about murder?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Back a little bit, I got accused of cheating, to the point of couple folks on the public PoG raid, called for a GM and the like. I was able to call out the Pog spawns right as they pop'd every time consistantly.<br />
<br />
I started getting tells asking how I was doing it and the like, and I just kept responding that I had my methods. Was asked if using ShowEQ and such. My bad was I treated it like a game and kept dancing around giving a straight answer.<br />
<br />
GM shows up and started giving me grief. Finally got a word in edge wise, suggesting the GM go look at the spawn point. To my amazement, the GM did, to find my second account's druid, sitting on the spawn point (being run from the second computer, out of 3).<br />
<br />
Sometimes, people cry out exploit a little too quickly, without thinking out other possibilities.<br />
<br />
I know some folks used to be in amazement, that I'd be in camp instead of out pulling again, right as the mobs respawned in the front area of HoT....I really miss my timer that I used to have next to my computer...<br />

<br />
I guess this is true if you assume that violating one of SOE's &quot;rules&quot;--whether express, implied, or made up after the fact--is the same thing as cheating.  <br />
<br />
Cheating, however, has a certain moral connotation.  I don't think that Sony has the qualifications to pass final judgment on questions of morality.  What is or is not moral behavior is usually commonly agreed  upon by the community which cares about such things (or disagreed upon given the responses to this thread).  <br />
<br />
Why this community is concerned about whether using widely available information on the web is cheating or not escapes me, though.<br />
<br />
Do we just not have anthing better to gripe about?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You loss control of yourself.<br />
<br />
I never understood why they would consider using walls and corners, to controll the path of your mob after its been feared, an exploit.<br />
<br />
If you can walk off a cliff or into a pit of lava while feared by a mob, then why is it not fair to postion a mob to get feared into a wall or corner.  When fighting mobs that have knock back spells, I make damn sure I am not in a position where that effect damages me any more then it should...or is that an exploit too?  The point of the game is to kill mobs and the intent of the spell isnt to give mobs a chance to get away.  The point of the spell is to give you the advantage over a mob not in controll of itself.<br />
<br />
Calling &quot;wall fearing&quot; and exploit is silly imo.</div></div><hr />

Startling insight!  But examine your words my friend.  What finaljustice was attempting to say is it's the DEGREE of cheating that matters in game, as it's the degree of breaking the law that matters in RL.  <br />
Your comment only furthered his point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its really a shame that you have to be so pretentious. Your no better then i am. But if thats how you desire it, its your lose.<br />
<br />
To rebutle your comment, i never said EQW was cheating. It was only grouped with the other things cause they are all &quot;3rd party&quot; programs. I simply said they werent needed to enjoy the game. I have nothing against EQW at all, ive used it, im sure most people on this forum used it. But i believe the comment in the original post was something along the lines of &quot;SoE even forces us to use them&quot;, THAT was the comment i was debating, not wether you want to surf web pages or whatever you like to do in the real world. Besides, you can put EQ in window mode without EQW so really thats a invalid argument.<br />
<br />
Anyway, im sure you will prove me wrong in the near future since you seem to be poised to reply to my comments in such a manner and nothing else. I hope your triumphet victory over me gives you as great a measure of joy as the measure of how little i will care about it.<br />

Actually, there's a RL equivilant.  The Plains Indians wouldn't hunt buffalo like you see in Dances Like Wolves and Remington paintings, unless they absolutely had to.  Instead, an approved way of hunting was to stampede a herd over a cliff.  However, the U.S. Cavalry caught them doing this and they got banned for 7 days (DAMN the flame boards were active after that!)<br />
<br />
And Hrothgar, have you ever speeded in the Deep South with California tags on your car?  You might get a different opinion  ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry FJ, but, I have to disagree with you on this one.  <br />
<br />
Cheating is cheating.  <br />
<br />
By your own definition, any time you perform an action that gives you an unfair advantage over someone else, you're cheating.  That means that all of us that read these boards are cheating.  Simply by reading these boards, we are gaining knowledge about quests/items/spells/mobs that gives us an in-game advantage over any player that doesn't read these boards.<br />
<br />
I also don't buy your justification that reading spoiler information isn't cheating because it's not as bad as using a packet sniffer.  That's like saying that if a murderer only kills one person, it's not illegal because it's not as bad as if he had killed twenty people. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Ok, this has become and apples and oranges situation, attempting to compare 2 things that are SO completely unrelateable.<br />
<br />
Cheating in a game in no way could EVER compare to taking the life of another human being. Save that kind of dramatics for the stage performances and day time soaps.<br />
<br />
Compare it to like Sosa and the corked bat, cheating on taxes or spouse/significant other or something not nearly as over the top.<br />
<br />
Welcome to one of my biggest pet peeves. No you don't suffer from angst, no you don't love an item, no you wouldn't sell your soul. Get back to reality with it, and take off the damn crown, drama queen.<br />
<br />
Back on topic finally :)<br />
<br />
If people cheat, fine. They are the ones that burn out sooner, and will be gone by the time I get there. If/when they get caught, they have no one to blame but themselves. If that capture is helped along, oh well.<br />
<br />
Some people say that by playing 3 accounts at once, I'm cheating. I say, I'm keeping myself out of trouble, by keeping myself busy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Personally, I think everyone needs to go back and read Crusty's post. By far the most relevant.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Using &quot;spoiler&quot; information is not cheating.  Why? because the game was designed to be discovered thru exploration AND thru cooperation with fellow players.  Having someone tell you that the item you are seeking is behind door number 3 is not cheating.  <br />
<br />
From the beginning of your characters career, the advice given to you is to ask your fellow players for information.  I logged in a new character last night, and the first tip that popped up on my screen said not to petition for hints, but to ask my fellow adventurers :)  I dont see the difference in asking them in game vs asking them on a chat board, or asking them at the coffee shop after work.  Is it the level of detail that is given?  That seems more a limitation of the medium - (for example)you cant in game draw me a map to where I am going, but your character certainly could were he actualy face to face with mine.<br />
<br />
Parsing the SPDAT file does seem a bit extreme, but the information is something that the character should know -what does my spell do?  They are actualy changing the code to give us this information IN GAME now.</div></div><hr />

Coming here to the Crucible is -not- going to alert you that Mob_X has spawned at Neg1200, Pos 506 with Weapon_006...theres a HUGE difference there imo....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Log into the test server &amp; right click on a spell.   All the info on the spell is now available within the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>rufus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Bah, I wasn't trying to stir up drama over this.  :p My point was simply to say that as a group, we all know a lot more about this game than we would if we relied only on information gained from in-game experience.  Sure, we can try and justify it as the equivalent of swapping war stories over a bottle of ale in Halas one night, but, drunken war stories are hardly ever as accurate as the information that can be obtained from this (and other) sites.<br />
<br />
The problem comes from asking the question 'Where did all of this detailed information come from in the first place?'  Look at these examples:<br />
<br />
How big is the resist modifier on Petrifying Earth?<br />
What is the cap on Flowing Thought items?<br />
How much mana do you get for each point of Wisdom over 255?<br />
Where is the spawn point for the injured Coldain in Eastern Wastes?<br />
<br />
These are questions that we all know the answer to, yet, none of them can be established by the tools given to us in-game.  Yes, I'm sure that a group of experienced adventurers could probably come up with rough estimates for SOME of these.  However, we know ALL of this information and we know that this information is 100% accurate.  <br />
<br />
As much as we may put down the &quot;real&quot; cheaters (ie: people using packet sniffers, emulators, hacks, etc), they are the ones that originally supplied us with most of this detailed information to begin with.  So, does it really make us any less guilty of cheating because we're just relaying the stolen information instead of stealing it firsthand?<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, the fact still remains that we know a lot more about this game than we should.  This extra knowledge gives us a HUGE advantage over people that only rely on what they do in-game.  <br />
<br />
Rufus<br />
<br />
P.S.  I'm not trying to put down anyone on this board.  I have learned a lot from reading EQ boards over the years and as far as I'm concerned, there SHOULD be a way for all of this information to be available in-game.  My point is simple that we need to be careful who we are calling cheaters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Any ranger can alert me that Mob_X is up on track just by zoning in.  On the otherhand, coming here is going to tell me that:<br />
<br />
Mob_X spawns at Neg1200, Pos506 every 72 hours<br />
Mob_X drops Weapon_006 about 20% of the time<br />
Mob_X drops Item_007 about 50% of the time<br />
Mob_X drops Item_009 the other 30% of the time<br />
Mob_X quads for X points of melee damage<br />
Mob_X procs AESpell_42 that does X points of damage<br />
Mob_X can not be slowed by TI<br />
Mob_X can be slowed by CoG<br />
Mob_X is very magic resistant but has low fire resists<br />
etc...<br />
<br />
It's also going to tell me that:<br />
<br />
AESpell_42 can be resisted by increasing your MR<br />
Item_007 can be used for Quest_123 to obtain UberItem_456<br />
Quest_123 also involves Mob_Y and Mob_Z<br />
Mob_Y spawns in Zone_9 at Pos500, Neg300 every 6 hours<br />
etc...<br />
<br />
So, you now have the guy that knows that Mob_X is up vs. everybody else that knows every little detail about Mob_X. <br />
<br />
Who has the bigger advantage?</div></div><hr />

While I actually agree with alot of your post before this one...I'd say the reply above is kind of stretching it, to prove your point.....wouldnt you??<br />
<br />
<br />
I can say this though....I might not have -wanted- to see the info that 'we shouldnt know', but I did and cant take it back or forget....but I sure as hell wouldnt have cheated(used packet sniffer ect) to get that info myself. Point being that cheater have made public knowledge more so than it should be, but once its out there...its out there.....I hardly see your point in that we're just as guilty as they though...to each his own I guess. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Jedediah Bloodmoor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">As much as we may put down the &quot;real&quot; cheaters (ie: people using packet sniffers, emulators, hacks, etc), they are the ones that originally supplied us with most of this detailed information to begin with. So, does it really make us any less guilty of cheating because we're just relaying the stolen information instead of stealing it firsthand? <br />
<br />
This is exactly what kept popping into my mind as I was reading this thread.  Of course the &quot;anti-cheater&quot; will say he has no first hand knowledge of this information being obtained via illegal methods and is unable to distinguish between legal and illegally gained information and therefore can use any and all information at will with a clear concious .  (makes me think of a pawn shop owner for some reason)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Rufus,<br />
<br />
i have to side FJ here, where the line between cheating and no-cheating is.<br />
<br />
Spoilers and tactic info do NOT give me an unfair advantage above other players, for the simple reason that most of this information is public information accessible by all players interested in this information. Crusty had a good analogy, the player in question just prepares his fights better and this gives him an advantage over the unprepared. How is that unfair?<br />
<br />
When you use spoilers extensive, you only hurt yourself, because you are killing the last bit of fun in this game for you. That is each players own decision. (Such 'ethical' discussions for a game are still fun  :D).<br />
<br />
Has VI intended for us to play EQ with or without spoilers and such?<br />
As i can't read their minds, i could care less and do what I feel appropriate for my standards. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Crusty put it perfectly. <br />
<br />
Getting information that could not be obtained from within the boundaries of the game and could not be gained from the characters point of view is cheating.<br />
<br />
For every tracking mule there is an in-game risk involved. Trackers must be levelled, they have to be moved to the right spots, can be killed by their environment. They have a place within the boundaries of the game. Even if that place is the idiot cousin who sits in one place for months and only gets to talk with his family when they need him to check on something.<br />
<br />
Comparing packet sniffers with Trackers is a somewhat dubious tactic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Any ranger can alert me that Mob_X is up on track just by zoning in.  On the otherhand, coming here is going to tell me that:<br />
<br />
Mob_X spawns at Neg1200, Pos506 every 72 hours<br />
Mob_X drops Weapon_006 about 20% of the time<br />
Mob_X drops Item_007 about 50% of the time<br />
Mob_X drops Item_009 the other 30% of the time<br />
Mob_X quads for X points of melee damage<br />
Mob_X procs AESpell_42 that does X points of damage<br />
Mob_X can not be slowed by TI<br />
Mob_X can be slowed by CoG<br />
Mob_X is very magic resistant but has low fire resists<br />
etc...<br />
<br />
It's also going to tell me that:<br />
<br />
AESpell_42 can be resisted by increasing your MR<br />
Item_007 can be used for Quest_123 to obtain UberItem_456<br />
Quest_123 also involves Mob_Y and Mob_Z<br />
Mob_Y spawns in Zone_9 at Pos500, Neg300 every 6 hours<br />
etc...<br />
<br />
So, you now have the guy that knows that Mob_X is up vs. everybody else that knows every little detail about Mob_X. <br />
<br />
Who has the bigger advantage?<br />
<br />
<br />
One other point I forgot to mention last night is that, if you look carefully at all this info you have listed, most if not all could be gained through time and simple trial and error. You wouldn't necessarily need any type of packet sniffer to obtain any of this info.....as said though, everyone has their own opinion I guess /shrug.<br />
<br />
I still stand by my position that theres a huge difference in spoiler info on the web and people who use -real time- 3rd party programs to gain -real time- advantages while logged into the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Eilderts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Can we all just agree that the way this game is designed has driven people to cheat? It was designed with EXTREME class inequality. Also, every single one of you has talked to an oblivious newbie. I met one yesterday; HE WAS LVL 20! He was almost a 1/3 through the game and he didn't know what a &quot;camp&quot; was or a &quot;mob&quot;. He wasn't stupid, because as soon as I told him he was kill stealing and explained what i meant, he moved to another site, laughed and said he had only had the game for 4 days. <br />
<br />
Honestly, how many other games are this damn frustrating? I mean, even the simplest things such as haste and damage have complex formulas behind them. To learn them, one must go to a web site such as this.<br />
<br />
As for the real hackers, they can burn in hell. I played Diablo II. That game was the ****z for PvP until new duping methods and a new bot that camped the highest lvl mob in the game repeatedly RUINED it. Things worth 7 SOJs (currency, dont ask) were soon worth less than a single SOJ. <br />

Yes, Really!  Think about it.  SoE wants this to be a &quot;group&quot; oriented game, right?  Well, why does the &quot;vision&quot; stop in-game?  It doesn't.  Having class boards, server boards, TNZ, etc. is all working even better than they could have planned.  Why give you something we you can research it (spending your time) and thereby giving you a higher level of &quot;need&quot; to accomplish something.<br />

Packet sniffers are useful, because when a mob spawns, the server notifies all clients in the zone.  It also tells you the loot the mob has, in case some of it requires a graphic produced (a sword or such).  Packet sniffers hijack the data destined for your client and decode the info to let you know where the mob spawned and what he has on him.  Remember TCP/IP packets travelling through a LAN segment are visible to all network appliances in that segment.  The only way for SOE to fix this would be to encrypt the packets (the packets would still be visible, but unintelligible), which would require too much overhead, with the amount of packets they normally send.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">.... you put it between mob trackers and packet sniffers.... it would appear to me that you lump them together<br />
<br />
then thats my bad for which i humbly ask your forgivness for not being clear enough ( no sarcasim ).<br />
<br />
I truly do not view EQW as cheating to be clear. Though it does blur the line on what SoE considers 3rd party software they dont want you using. I think its one of those things, you know, if you asked SoE directly, they would say we dont want you using it, but in the same respect its not that big a deal so they dont really persure its use heavily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I disagree that sharing information on the 'net is &quot;cheating&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Using a third-party spawn tracker is against the EULA.  Sharing information on a website is not.<br />
<br />
Sure, your EQ gaming experience would be different if you didn't read the boards.  Maybe better, maybe worse, depending on you and your preferences.  But it's not &quot;cheating&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">The problem comes from asking the question 'Where did all of this detailed information come from in the first place?'  Look at these examples:<br />
<br />
How big is the resist modifier on Petrifying Earth?<br />
What is the cap on Flowing Thought items?<br />
How much mana do you get for each point of Wisdom over 255?<br />
Where is the spawn point for the injured Coldain in Eastern Wastes?<br />
<br />
These are questions that we all know the answer to, yet, none of them can be established by the tools given to us in-game.  Yes, I'm sure that a group of experienced adventurers could probably come up with rough estimates for SOME of these.  However, we know ALL of this information and we know that this information is 100% accurate.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Every one of those questions can and has been answered by in-game means alone, to some degree.  <br />
<br />
Resist modifiers weren't known as exact numbers always, but parsing did give people a pretty good idea of what resists you needed to reliably resist a mobs AE before lucy and such were being used to pull exact numbers from the spdat.<br />
<br />
I could swear that the FT cap, just like the ATK cap, was discovered by in game testing.  Casting to OOM then timing how long to recover that mana with various FT combinations will work.  Similar testing is how the amount of mana per wis/int was originally discovered and was relatively accurate.<br />
<br />
Exact spawn points are quite easy to discover in game with a tracker and some patience.<br />
<br />
Sharing the information you gather in-game is not cheating IMO.  I think it's more fun to find out certain things for yourself, but scouring the web for basic zone info before entering a new place is hardly something I'd consider cheating.  Using ShowEQ to track zonewide, speed hacks, dupes... Yeah, I don't think anyone can argue that these are cheats.  Using spoilers may be considered gimpy, but it's far different than cheating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">discussion in our guild about cheating and using 3th party programs <br />
<br />
3rd party programs are not limited just to packet sniffers.  There are 3rd party programs for Trade Skills, Bard Twisting, and Other Skills like swimming, etc.  Many of these 3rd party programs have been designed around poor game and interface designs.   SoE currently is correcting some of these by charging ... AKA LoY and upcoming Lost Dungeons of Norrath patch/expansions.  <br />
<br />
In general, SoE wants to control every piece of information flow in and out of the game.   They understand that once information hits the public domain it is hard to put the &quot;genie back in the bottle&quot;.  Nevertheless, whenever possible they will resort to Legal, Coding, and other barriers to limit the playbase to the inside workings of Everquest.  What we are calling content ... they call Intellectual Property.     <br />
<br />
However, this is a tired old debate really.  People used to discuss whether EQAltas style maps were exploits and cheats.  Muse had problems at first and still has been treated as a pariah all the while SoE produces the same spoiler content via official channels (Eq Altas - after years of the same named information publicly available on Muse's site).  Sony is into this for the bucks ... quite frankly if they could make more money selling packet sniffers as a add on application they would be announcing it as the &quot;next greatest improvement in the Everquest saga&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Not true.<br />
<br />
Most of my game knowledge has come from debate with other players who have done in game tests, spending hours or days comparing and researching them.  Some of it has come from nights spent drinking with the developers and testers.<br />
<br />
Some information has come from showeq, like the downloadable maps for the mapping tool with leagacy of ykesha -but before those maps existed, there were better maps made by a guy patiently exploring zone after zone and taking notes (eqatlas).  Most showeq information that has been leaked has been researched carefully in game by players as well.  Showeq is not the primary source of game information for me.</div></div><hr />

Well one of the funny little twists in this discussion is that parsing programs are also 3th party software and thus a form of cheating.<br />
<br />
There was even a time when using winamp was considered cheating by SoE (yes and what a fun we had about that statement).<br />
<br />
And do not forget that ShowEQ did prove SoE/VI wrong on a lot of statements that where changed only after being published.<br />
<br />
I guess it is all up to your personal definition about what cheating is but for the EULA it is a simple black/white world and SoE seems to really enjoy to keep the playerbase in the dark.<br />
<br />
During the PoP explorations I have found so many things I could only solve because someone else knew the answer and when asking they got it from someone else but there was never an ingame source to be found for that information. just think to yourself how you got to know your info and where you can find it ingame.<br />
For instance we still do not know how the slow mitigation really works, if Beastlord slow really lands easier, etc (and that are just 2 topics that a lot of people debated about so if that info was to be found I am sure someone would have posted it, all we have are assumptions and speculations)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>rufus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Packet sniffers are useful, because when a mob spawns, the server notifies all clients in the zone.  It also tells you the loot the mob has, in case some of it requires a graphic produced (a sword or such).<br />
<br />
Almost, but, not quite.  The server does NOT send out a packet containing &quot;the loot the mob has&quot; until after said mob is dead and you loot the corpse.  The only exception to this (as you noted above) is if the mob is using a visable weapon and/or a light source.  If the mob is using a visable weapon, a packet sniffer would only be able to detect that &quot;Mob_01 is carrying an item that uses WeaponGraphic_04&quot;.  It still won't tell you what that item is and it's up to you to check a spoiler site to find out for sure.<br />
<br />
With the amount of features that have been added in-game over the last year, the only real advantage that can still be achieved from using a packet sniffer is to get give tracking to classes that don't have it naturally or to increase the range of track for those classes that do.</div></div><hr />

You've outdone yourself.  This is even dumber than the first statement.  Parsing with a abacus or slide rule, I assume, are ok but a calculator is a program.  Next time you post I want you to send the packets of data yourself since using IE or whatever is a program too.</div></div><hr />

Hi, next time read the EULA and blame SoE for dumb stuff in there not me.<br />
If you click on yes you agree to not use any 3th party programs.<br />
and yes this does include the build in calculator from Windows.<br />

<br />
Sorry, but this is going towards the Alfalfa and it's time to put my 2cp back in :)<br />
<br />
I reread the EULA and it doesn't say anything like this.  It specifies thrid party software that, &quot;changes gameplay.&quot;  Utilizing third-party software to parse data that the program provides to you CERTAINLY doesn't violate this stipulation.  <br />
<br />
Packet sniffers are different.  The data they gather hasn't been released by Sony.  They snatch data by listening to broadcast messages and change gameplay by giving you unfair knowlege of what's going on in the zone, RIGHT THEN.  Mob location, when it's spawn point shifts or when it's a wandering monster, is a significant  and unfair advantage.<br />
<br />
Contrast that to parsing data that Sony provides to you.  Granted, Verant didn't expect parsing of its logs, which were intended soley to gather bug and violation information, but they allowed timing and hit information in the log, so now it belongs to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>rufus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Actually, the complete quote from EULA is:<br />
<br />
&quot;You may not use any third party software to modify the Software to change Game play.&quot;<br />
<br />
This statement alone wouldn't exclude you from running a log parser.  It also wouldn't exclude you from running a packet sniffer either because you're not modifying the EQ client software by running it.  The only thing this statement does exclude are any type of hacks/emulators/macros that people may use.<br />
<br />
On another note, I noticed something else while looking this up.  The EULA also states that:<br />
<br />
&quot;You may not copy (except to make one necessary back-up copy), distribute, sell, auction, rent, lease, loan, modify or create derivative works, adapt, translate, perform, display, sublicense or transfer all or any portion of the Software.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is the statement that would most likely exclude the use of these programs since the basic purpose of both log parsers and packet sniffers is to translate and display portions of the Software.  The interesting part is that this statement would also make spoiler/fan sites a violation of the EULA.  Afterall, the whole point of creating these sites is to display/distribute derivative works based on portions of the Software.  :p<br />

   Anything that can save me from some of the time sinks is the game than so be it if i choose to come look for it. Once this board hands me actual loot that i dont have to kill a mob for or epics there might be a problem. You can usually just find little bit of info or find a complete walkthrough of a quest and i feel thats your choice. <br />

  I mean we read news papers and get info we wouldnt normally have , watch tv shows on &quot;how to&quot; in place of that in eq we have message boards. Think thats a big difference between that and using a program that will watch for a mob popping and telling you when it does.</div></div><hr />
