<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dassi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have recently took over a friends account with a 65 shaman. I have had several characters into the 30's and have a 40 bard, so have experience with EQ, just not much with this Shaman. I understand all of her spells, but am not comfortable joining with a 65 group right now, as I might get them killed for a simple mistake or something. I was wondering where I could go to solo for for xp with as little danger to myself as possible. Even if the xp is low. Also, a spot for cash. Again, even if it is a little lower than an experienced 65 would get in a tougher spot. Actually, I have died a couple times, so I lost a level and am currently 64, almost 65. Thanks for the help</div></div><hr />

Best bet is to go to Nadox.  The mobs are high enough to give you xp, and low enough that you can make a decision to run if you get in trouble (assuming you are near a zone line). It's easy to get to and you should be able to send the pet in, slow, root, dot, melee, whatever you want to do while you get the hang of your spells, and abilities. you want to head to Nadox via the Gunthak entrance, way up at the top of the zone, where you go inside a castle/fort and head to the back room. <br />
<br />
Create a magelo, including spells you have. It will help figure out other places.</div></div><hr />

<br />
www.magelo.com<br />
<br />
It's free, you can create a replica of your character, including starting stats, equipment, aa, spells, flags..... then post the link up for others to view. look at some magelo's created by other people (usually in their signatures as clickable links).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd recommend the guards in PoJ.  Run down to near the trial area and kill those goalers.  Those should be dark blue.  They dont hit very hard, so you can tank them, while keeping yourself up with Q/Torpor.  I usually leave the rats alone, they run too fast and they like to assist each other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">droga</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Droga is a fun spot for me as well.  I take my rogue down there to duo a lot.  He is currently 56, and he just rips through those mobs like warm butter.<br />
<br />
You might want to try the flies in PoD.  From ZI, go left and follow the lake until you get to a rock.  Straight ahead of the rock are the flies - they are low level, 46/47-ish.  You have to be careful because sometimes rats/flies hide in the water and may pull adds.  The xp will be crap, but it will give you a chance to practice.<br />
<br />
Also, the exit in PoJ is another nice spot for you as someone suggested.  You can pull the mobs from the cells - these are 46/47-ish as well if I recall.  There are also rats and guards that wander.  Xp will be slow here.<br />
<br />
The yard trash in PoN may give you problems since they can add on you.  Plus, they tend to hit hard here - depending on your gear of course.<br />
<br />
PoI is decent.  Just start on one side and work your way around.  It is a circle, and you will come back to where you started.  I suggest you do not camp ZI/ZO since people have the tendency to train it.<br />
<br />
Personally, I would try to group, with friends if possible, and see how you do.  Soloing, to me, is vastly different than being in a group.  Try a HoH or BoT group.  For the most part, all you will be doing is slowing, with the occassional healing - granted, depends on what type of group you have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Nadox at temple entrance would be great for learning your shaman.  Easy to zone if in trouble and a steady stream of mobs to kill.  As you get more experience you can move deaper into Nadox or try things like PoN where mobs hit harder.<br />
<br />
Thumbs Up to you for taking the time to learn your class before grouping. <br />
<br />
You will need to group to learn shamans functions in group, and raiding is yet again different.<br />
<br />
Good Luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Where you can viably solo is very much dependent on your armor and your AA abilities. It will help a lot if you make a Magelo profile and post it here so that we can see &quot;where you are at&quot;.<br />
<br />
Possible solo spots at 65 include:<br />
Droga<br />
Veksar<br />
SolC<br />
Charasis<br />
Plane of Mischief<br />
Plane of Hate<br />
Dulak's Harbor (on pretty mcuh any LoY zone)<br />
Natimbi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i think old sebilis is a great zone to learn the ropes of the shaman class.<br />
<br />
the loot's almost always solid, and the occasional random drop can make it fantastically rewarding, risk vs. reward.  it's about 85 expansions old, so you won't be fighting over camps.  the exp's not great, but it's a good place to learn about controlling adds and runners, how to handle different kinds of caster mobs, the strengths and weaknesses of our pets, and so on.  pick up some nice twink gear or cash drops, gems and the like.<br />
<br />
i guess the downside is you could get a bunch of adds and die, and depending on where you went in the zone you might need to buy off some bored rogue or necro to bail you out.  but what fun is a game without some element of risk, eh?<br />
<br />
anyway check it out, i can think of half a dozen fun camps with cool potential loots off the top of my head.  if you want specifics i'll post 'em later</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Blakcat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Dassi, I commend you for asking for guidance. You can learn alot about the Shaman class by soloing, but soloing and grouping are vastly different. There are alot of posts on this board on how to group/solo as a Shaman. Also there have been many posts in this thread about places to solo. Make sure you check them out. One major difference between Soloing and Grouping that will upset the group cohesion quicker then anthing: Aggro Management.<br />
<br />
You said you have experience playing other classes, but Slow is an aggro king. Debuff, slow, and a few DoTs and we can easily keep aggro from just about any other class through an entire fight (or until we get &quot;Loading please wait...&quot;). I won't say I'm an expert by any means. But grouping or maybe duoing is about the only way to learn aggro management. Now don't get me wrong with a very good tank, especially a Paladin, you can drop a slow and DoT on incomming and the Mob won't even jerk in your direction. But most of the time you will need to wait at least a few seconds to cast slow, usually the time it takes you to debuff. Either way, to avoid any hassle and make it easier for the tank to regain aggro, make sure you stand next to the tank when you slow. Again the only way to learn this is to group. <br />
<br />
There are alot more aspects to playing a shaman, but IMHO the quickest way to not get an invite back to a group is not be able to control your trigger finger. Do your research, explain to the group ahead of time that you are learning, and have fun. And before you know it you will be playing your shaman as a seasoned pro. Good luck.</div></div><hr />

Veksar - Make sure you have an EB item and IVU potions.<br />
Hate requires a wizard to port you up. <br />
Droga is very good, just control the runners.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hate doesn't require a wizard to port you up any longer.  There's an npc somewhere that you can hand a soulstone to, to be Translocated up to hate where you can then compete with all the epic hunting soloers :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i don't think god is really a good place for a likely bazaar-geared shaman who hasn't played the class before to start learning how to kill things alone.<br />
<br />
nor veksar for that matter, go somewhere the mobs hit for less than 200, but act exactly the same as mobs in other zones that may hit for 2000.  once you learn the general principles of mob behavior and how to handle different situations, you can take that basic knowledge and extend it with confidence to more risky situations like veksar, gates content and the like.</div></div><hr />
