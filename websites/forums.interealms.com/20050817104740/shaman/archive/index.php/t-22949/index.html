<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Spikehammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How much extra firepower do you think the lvl increase will be.<br />
Say random PoP flag mob takes 50(total random guess there) lvl 65's from a proper raid guild how many lvls 70's in a casual guild would you think it would take?<br />
Just wondering if I will ever get Time flagged and I don't want to jump guilds or will the drops in OoW just make Time a zone that you can miss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Honestly, it's too hard to say yet, spike.  It also depends on the mob.  Things like prismatic or chromatic resist AEs require more dps or more healing, and the increased levels probably aren't as likely help us resist those.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the spell data isn't out yet.<br />
<br />
Are we talking a CH-chain encounter?  Or a spam heal encounter?  Are we talking outfitted in OoW gear (ie, probably add about 20hp per item over GoD)?  And fully focused with level 70 focus items?  (probably 45%)<br />
<br />
With all of the above, I'd ballpark the estimate to be about a 20% reduction in manpower, most of which will be coming from classes other than the healers.  OoM isn't usually a problem on most of those fights anyway, it's just number of healers with recast time, and needed healing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">actually, i'd anticipate the reduction in the number of healers decreasing as well--as mana pools increase, fewer healers are needed much of the time. additionally, the size of the heals themselves will increase in some cases (splash heals), and because of aa and focus effects working on multipliers, the healing 'firepower' willl scale accordingly, i think. <br />
<br />
a good example is this--Avatar of War usually takes a few people to knock out. well...a guild on my server goes at him with 8 ppl and has almost done it with six. they are all 65s with heavy aa numbers and full Time and GoD gear.<br />
<br />
another thing that may reduce the number of healers needed for standard PoP mobs is the increase in tank abilities. more mitigation, avoidance, etc equates to less dmg intake, and less healing required to keep tank afloat. part of the reason those guys are able to do AoW with those low numbers is the fact that they're tanking a guy with 14k (buffed--not sure if it's exaggeration or not, but a cleric friend in the guild told me the guy was 1500ish over cap, and would be 15500ish if they moved cap up) hps and retarded ac.<br />

curious to see how the whole thing plays out for your more casual player.</div></div><hr />

Yep to me this is the only relevant question. SOE will make sure the raiders get content tuned to be doable (even if near impossible). The question remains will OoW tune the casual/non-hardcore raider game sufficient for most to enjoy the 4 most recent major expansions appropriately beyond where we are today (PoP/LDoN/GoD/OoW). In short:<br />
<br />
1) will it open up PoP for easier raiding due to higher levels, etc. for those that may be close but having tough time or may need to do with less but more skill<br />
2) will LDoNs be scaled to 70 with the appropriate stuff new harder content there might imply<br />
3) will people feel better going to GoD at 70 when they are not willing at 65 and will they tune the xp to the encounters (Ferubi xp sucks compared to PoV for the time/risk involved for example)<br />
4) will OoW have anything useful for the 70%+ that will never see the end-game content of the 3 top end recent expansions (i.e. Time, KT and higher, and high-end OoW).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The only question that burns in my mind, is...<br />
<br />
Will OOW trivialize Focus IV effect bearing Ornate armor, or the LDoN purchasable Focus IV augs?<br />
<br />
The answer, weeks away from release?  &quot;We don't know, it's all subject to change.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
i thought Gloriana raised the question at the player summit a few weeks ago, and got positive confirmation that focus IV items would affect level 70 spells, but they would degrade somewhat.  so your 15% mana pres would be 10% for lvl 70, or along those lines.<br />
<br />
so good but not great.  better than i had expected, honestly.</div></div><hr />

As it is if you have a job it's way way hard to find him up and get over to him since he can be done with a single group.</div></div><hr />
