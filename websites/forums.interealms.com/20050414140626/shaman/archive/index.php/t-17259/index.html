<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It seems that people who use AOL have a lot of problems with online games.  In my (limited) experience with AOL, I've found their connection services to be very very poor.  I'd recommend swiching from AOL if at all possible.  You can definitely connect to EQ (and other online games) with a modem.</div></div><hr />
