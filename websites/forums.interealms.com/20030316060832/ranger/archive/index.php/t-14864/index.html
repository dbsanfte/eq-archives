<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Iweil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all...<br />
I did some searching through the forum, but I didn't find a complete list of what spells stack with which.  I was wondering if anyone had a good list on which spells stack with which others and what the best combo is.  I have the 8th ring too and I saw the thread on that further down.  I recently turned 60 so I'm still trying to pin down which spells I should be buffing myself and my groups with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Benaveriel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, here's my take on it. I hope this isn't too confusing, this is actually the first time I've examined the exact numbers. :)<br />
<br />
Warder's Protection (WP) doesn't stack with the following:<br />
Call of Earth (CoE), Strength of Nature (SoN), Call of the Predator (CoP), Shield of Spikes (SoS). It also doesn't stack with druid/mage damage shields.<br />
<br />
Force of Nature (FoN) doesn't stack with CoE (but does stack with WP).<br />
<br />
FoN doesn't stack with Greater Wolf Form (GWF)<br />
<br />
Nature's Precision (NP) doesn't stack with SoN (but does stack with WP).<br />
<br />
Thorncoat stacks with everything. As does Storm Strength, Skin Like Nature, Resist Cold/Fire, Eagle Eye and probably others I'm forgetting - so I'll leave these all out of it for now.<br />
<br />
My usual choice for level 60 is:<br />
Indoors: WP, FoN, NP<br />
Outdoors: WP, GWF, NP<br />
<br />
Section with the actual numbers, skip if you're not interested<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
WP gives 21 DS, 70 ATK, 13 AC, 75 HP<br />
CoE = 25 AC, 4 DS<br />
SoN = 75 HP, 25 ATK<br />
FoN = 3 DS, 15 ATK, 3 regen<br />
SoS = 17 DS<br />
CoP = 40 ATK<br />
GWF gives 40 ATK<br />
NP = 15 ATK<br />
<br />
So, available combinations:<br />
Outdoors only:<br />
CoE+SoN+CoP+SoS+GWF = 25 AC, 75 HP, 105 ATK, 19 DS.<br />
WP+GWF+NP = 13 AC, 75 HP, 125 ATK, 21DS<br />
Anywhere:<br />
CoE+SoN+CoP+SoS = 25 AC, 75 HP, 65 ATK, 19 DS<br />
FoN+SoN+CoP+SoS = 0 AC, 75 HP, 80 ATK, 18 DS, 3 regen<br />
WP+FoN+NP = 13 AC, 75 HP, 100 ATK, 24 DS, 3 regen<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
Remember, on top of these you can have Skin Like Nature, Thorncoat, Chloroplast, Storm Strength, etc.<br />
<br />
So, unless you really need the AC from CoE, or really want a druid/mage damage shield, I'd recommend using WP - it's much easier, lasts ages, takes fewer buff slots, and has superior ATK. Use it with NP, and FoN indoors, GWF outdoors.<br />
<br />
Edit: Forgot that NP didn't stack with SoN.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>grinrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Does MoP stack?  And why did VI design it so our best 60 lvl spell does not stack with our BP castable spell?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Benaveriel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">MoP is a lower level version of CoP, and as such I ignored it. It doesn't stack with CoP or WP.<br />
<br />
CoE (on Velious BPs) is a Velious expansion spell, WP is a Luclin spell, and a very nice one at that. WP came after CoE was already on our BPs, and I for one don't have a problem with that, especially since I still cast CoE on other people a lot - it still saves mana if you have a Velious BP.</div></div><hr />
