<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Any one done the bubble fight in Qinimi?  We did it last week and if you didnt know you have 30 seconds to loot the mob after winning (corpse still says 30 minutes or what ever) before it kicks you out.<br />
<br />
Now we all thought this had to be a bug... so we petitioned and let me just post what the response from our ever loving CS crew at SOE had to say:<br />
<br />
**************************<br />
Greetings (Chick that petitioned),<br />
<br />
This is Lead GM Exitsan. I’ve reviewed the screenshots you’ve given and my GM’s logs and have found his investigation and resolution to be within our policies. The 18 person event in Qinimi (Dome event I believe it is called) is on a specific timer and if the event is not finished within the allotted time the raid is removed from the instance, items which are not looted within this time are not able to be reimbursed as they were not lost due to a bug. Due to the hastened nature of this event I suggest that you determine loot before engaging so as to minimize losses if you are not able to complete the event in the allotted amount of time. <br />
<br />
Thank you for your time emailing me, I wish yourself and raid luck on continuing thru this epic of quests.<br />
<br />
Lead GM Exitsan - CS Supervisor<br />

Okay ... so let me get this straight.  You are supposed to decide loot on something you have never won before hand to beat a timer that you don't know about, and that is never shared?<br />
<br />
I dont have the log but the time was right around 30 seconds.  Others have said that the time to loot and get ready to get ported out was 5 minutes.  But we linked the loot.  Had a few folks say WHOAH NICE (It was the Haste of Mithanial Ear from that event.) and it said something along the lines of &quot;A mystical voice says 'you have been here too long finish what you must do before I get you out myself' &quot;  Something like that anyway.  After hearing that we had enough time to type &quot;Hurry guys we are going to get ported out soon I guess&quot;  *loading please wait*<br />
<br />
It was honestly the next tick that we got ported out.  This is crap.  What kind of event kicks you after you win like that?  And we were supposed to know about this time limit how? With the 6 seconds notice it gave?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Id say /bug it, /feedback it a few times and make sure you post this on Sony's boards.  Dont cross post it; Write (or copy) the post as it is here.  That will make more people from Sony, the ones that are in charge of customer relations (brenlo), read it, and something might get said to devs.<br />
<br />
Sorry to hear about that though;  It sucks pretty bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The only leg that SOE might have to stand on is if the timer is set up so that killing the mob doesn't stop the timer.<br />
<br />
So the quicker you kill, the longer you have to loot.  Not saying I agree with it, but that's probably the interpretation they are using. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Did this a few weeks ago with some guildies, the faster you kill you really do have more time to loot as well, the fights arent all that difficult, but you do have unmezzable mobs (stun works ok though, we used a kiter). We didnt have trouble with the timer on the loots, but we did have trouble with the named, a druid/shaman combo didnt cut it (big surprise). I know its an 18 person event but we did it just fine with 2 groups, one for the tank, one for a DPS bunch and it wasnt even a full group.  /shrug.<br />
It does suck that you didnt get the loot, and given that its a relatively new event that not many people have tried (AFAIK on Karana its usually a wasteland) it would seem that some feedback would be in order. Figuring out loot before hand (how exactly was this supposed to be handled the first time someone looted these mobs hmm?) was a pretty craptacualr statement from your lead GM. Just give them a trad bit of heck with Feedbacks daily, /bug reports, etc.  It wont help recover what you lost, but it may help people in the future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah.... OH one other thing that was absolute crap.  I know this isnt a spoiler site but hope I can help folks out with this part.  The second to last thing to do is to blast down on one of 4 snakes.  Pick the right one.  The first time we did it when we won we walked up to the snake and bitch slapped her np. (well other than when they turned agro they instantly killed two clerics and both tanks....)  But the second time we got to the snake portoin they were AEing the CRAP out of us.  Mean mean dots.  So I guess it matters which snake you kill.  Anyone done this and figure out what cardinal direction snake is the easiest?<br />
<br />
OH and I'm sure you are right on the overall time thing.  When we won we lost our two clerics and two warriors instantly.  Then we had to have our cleric Rez up the others while the two sham kept the SK up.  We are just now EP flagged but have yet to get onepiece of EP loot so we are pretty undergeared.<br />
<br />
I agree it's a piece of cake to get to the last folks.  The mobs dont hit hard at all and have 1/10th the hp of anything we are used to.  So it really was the last fight that went on like 10 minutes due to all the deaths and no DPS classes :/ <br />
<br />
Group was something like:<br />
2 Clerics<br />
2 SK<br />
1 Paly<br />
1 Rogue<br />
2 Warriors<br />
2 Shaman<br />
1 Ranger<br />
1 Druid<br />
1 Necro<br />
1 Wiz<br />
<br />
Gah dont remember everyone but that is about it.... had jack for Rogues, Rangers, Wiz DPS classes.  And after the insta gank of folks we figured to slow the fight down and let folks get agro set up and play it safe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Gorgos:  this is a timed encounter, if you had 30 seconds to loot it's probably because that's all you had left period.  the timer seems to be roughly 26 minutes or so.  better dps/kill faster and you will be sitting around waiting for the port out which happens when time on the encounter is up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yep, this whole event is timed.  That means that it doesn't matter if you finish in 20min or 26 min.. you will have whatever time remaining to loot quickly and sit there if you have any time remaining.  I imagine what the gm was saying was this... although you don't know what the other loot the mob will drop is, the most important reason for doing this event is to get the BiC pieces that drop from the final guy.  Determine who needs/wants those pieces beforehand so that they can be looted quickly and instantly.  Oh, and dont' forget that if you are in the raid, they will have to have looting rights before the final guy is dead or they will have to wait the full 2 min before they can loot.<br />
<br />
A reminder also that if someone goes LD while in the bubble, they will be out of the fight the rest of the way.  once they come back they will be transported to the zone in (unless they fixed this).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What do you mean &quot;fixed&quot;.  It should be like that.  Otherwise, you could exploit the raid by camping people out inside there in advance to get around the 3 person limit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">the same bug was in coirnav encounter in the beginning, you had 15 minutes to win sushi-script AND hail the PP and distribute the loot. And they changed it.<br />
<br />
this DEFINITELY is a bug, dont let that guy tell you thats working as intended, honestly.</div></div><hr />
