<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">with buying Words of Apparition off someone? He is selling 4 copies at 4k each. Now, I have never seen 73R, either drop or in Baz, would it be a waste of money in that I'll probably never see 73R? Also, right now, I'm 57, guild raids a little bit, but lesser targets like ToV, Kael, etc. Do I even need to worry about the spell just yet? Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
EDIT: In case it's not obvious, I'm referring to Remove Greater Curse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I hear that words of apparition are dropping very nicely in LDON dungeons.  I haven't seen it myself since my home internet connection is flaky right now and I won't do that to a group.<br />
<br />
If it was me, I'd gather the other components first.  If Words of App are really dropping as good as I've heard, then prices will be dropping quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I got two words of App in one MM dungeon so they are indead dropping like crazy now. If only 73R was too that would take care of two of our problem spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ya apparition drops like candy in MM, no way in hell is worth 4k, maybe 100pp at most</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>RangerKeaianea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Or you could save your cash and use adventure points to buy that spell.  It's 800 points at the North Ro wayfarer camp.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ceno,<br />
<br />
that gi joe thing is funny as hell bro...just had to tell you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for the replies everyone, if someone could answer the other question, if it's even necessary, given where my guild and myself are at now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It would be a heck of a boon to have it for some dungeons, because I'm sure it'd wipe out any curse you would be running across at your level. But, like Keaianea said, dont bother with the components unless you find them yourself (or people start selling them for what they're worth - cheap). Just do some dungeons and buy the spell for 800 points from the vendor. You'll have fun, probably find a lot of cool stuff, and by the time you get 800 points you'll be level 60 without even thinking about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">50+ research is dropping like mad all over LDoN.  I wouldn't pay over 100 pp for any research right now until I see if anything is actually still rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I still don't have RGC, but I wish I did.<br />
<br />
I've survived thus far with just remove curse, and you can certainly survive a good bit longer with just remove curse as well.  <br />
<br />
But clearly RGC is a better spell.  It will depend on what you raid as you go along.  Up through Tov and most of Ssra, Pop Tier 3, etc, you don't really need it - but I'm sure it's nice.  Remove Curse and Radiant Cure handle a lot of what ails you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Something about paying several thousand pp for an item that may not even net you a spell still bothers me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Radiant cure is CHEAP.  Try putting 2 aa into that before breaking the bank for RGC.  Prices on that will drop as people just buy it in LDoN anyway.<br />
<br />
And I've only ever had 2 occasions where I would've wanted that spell, just used RC and it was fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Words of apparition also drop VERY frequently in Rujarkian theme.<br />
<br />
<br />
  hopefully one theme has a decent pg. 73 droprate...  Maybe on hard settings?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Remove Greater Curse is a good spell to have if you're fighting mobs that curse. Some of the mobs I'm fighting cast curses with 18 counters, Radiant Cure 3 wouldn't remove that in one shot, and the 3 minute recast makes it not very practical.<br />
<br />
Words of Apparition are coming down in price, I saw several copies at 1000pp today. Yaeth 73r will be the bottleneck, so I wouldn't buy Apparition yet. By the time you get Yaeth 73r, you'll not have a problem with the words.<br />
<br />
As an aside, Remove Greater Curse was on sale in the Bazaar earlier. First time I've seen it for a long time, second time ever, but 500,000pp.... someone's taking the proverbial.</div></div><hr />
