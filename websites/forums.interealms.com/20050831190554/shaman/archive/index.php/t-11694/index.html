<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, I have a shaman that is 44 currently, I had a GF about a year ago, she wanted to play, so I bought her an account, I left her, and then had 2 accounts, I quit playing, and come to now, I decided to have 2 boxes. the warrior is currently at 20 and moving fast.<br />
<br />
my question is, at what point should I stop pling and expect momor to be a good tank for rjay?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Honestly depends on how your tank is equiped.<br />
<br />
Gear makes all the difference for warriors.  They dont have any spells to augment thier abilities.  (they can use spells from items, true, but nothing innate and Im not counting \disc here).  <br />
<br />
If hes in banded or fine steel you are gonna have to get him almost to your level before he can really start doing his job.  If you have him in some nice cultural (like Dwarven or Ogre..thats pretty inice stuff) then he can probably start making a difference at about 30 or so.  <br />
<br />
As far as weapons go..the better they are the easier everything will be.<br />
<br />
Considering your shamans level Im betting that you are not rolling in plat right now, so your best bet is to take your shaman somewhere where the cash is good and then hunt the bazaar like crazy.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, the best cash spot that I have found to date is Dulak.  While doing my Stoicism quest I was getting about 5 plat per kill, plus weapon (another 3 to 6 plat).  Gems dropped like crazy too (a blue diamond of a guardian of some sort made my day).  In the 5 hours that Iwas there I made close to 1.5K.  And most of this stuff was green or light blue to me.  Id recomend heading there is you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I had crafted from a different experience, so that should be OK, I think. I just recently picked up a wakizashi of the frozen skies for 200pp and a mithril 2 hander for 200pp as well. I am keeping my eye out for a ssoy for cheap, but I have no idea what is good these days, but I think I am on a good track for his level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hummm,<br />
<br />
The Warrior is only lvl 20 and that does not represent a large investment in time.  I would give deep consideration to scraping the warrior and starting another class that will be more usefull as a boxed character.<br />
<br />
Personly,  I would much rather have an SK or a Paladin or a Ranger then a Warrior.  I spent a lot of time plaing with a warrior that was a friend, and any of the hybred mele classes just bring a lot more utility to the combination.  My personal favorite would be an SK but all I would gladly take any of them over a warrior.<br />
<br />
Other players like to box with int casters but I personly like the mele better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree with Radag.  One of the big things shaman are missing is Snare, and the ability to split targets.  Rangers and SK fit the bill.  SK can take hits better but rangers can do more damage.<br />
<br />
I would personally go with SK</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>0791</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">At level 40 your warrior will get a big boost in hit points, etc.  You should be able to duo well with him once he gets there.  <br />
<br />
I would encourage you to continue with your warrior rather than start another class.  I have  a 50 shaman that I have recently been two boxing with a 45 warrior and I have been very pleased with his tanking abilities.  AC/HP gear for warriors is fairly cheap and he maintains agro very well.  I know there is a lot of talk about warriors having a difficult time holding agro but this has not been a problem for me.  He is also a very low maintenance character to two-box with, as you have probably already found out.<br />
<br />
Oh, BTW, I started this warrior because my 48 monk got hit hard with the recent mitigation nerf.  So. . . I would not recommend a monk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Shop for a reaver, 40/40, +12 all saves and now hits magic.  Excellent twink weapon because there is no level restriction.  I've seen them go for 4K on Saryrn.  Weighty Poleaxe is probably the best bang-for-the-buck weapon ever.  Something like 29/34 and sells for 150pp.  It does have a level restriction though.<br />
<br />
Both weapons I mention are 2HS because you'll want solid DPS in a two person group and trying to match that damage with one handers gets very pricey.</div></div><hr />
