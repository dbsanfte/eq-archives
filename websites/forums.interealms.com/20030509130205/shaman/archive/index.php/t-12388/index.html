<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I think I'm doing very well for my level, but I'm looking to the future.<br />
<br />
I'm very close to hitting lvl49, and the 50's right after that.<br />
<br />
My question is what lvl should I be to reliably slow a mob higher level then me.  Our guild always some casters (healers) to go to HoT before they are lvl55.  But would a shaman under level 55 really be USEFUL?  Could they be able to slow ANYTHING?<br />
<br />
Likewise, our guild is sometimes short slowers, if they deside to do a Tawro Raid in UP, would I be any use?  I'd hate to say, &quot;Yep, I'll go I'll be able to slow the mobs and Tawro&quot; only to go and completely wipe because I couldn't stick slow once.<br />
<br />
So is there a rule of thumb?  Something like; <br />
if a mob is under your level, 99.9% of the time Turgur's will stick,<br />
if a mob is 1-5 levels higher then you, after a Malosi 75% of the time Turgur's will stick,<br />
if a mob is 5-10 levels higher then you, after a Malosi less then 50% of the time Turgur's will stick, and <br />
if a mob is greater then 10 levels higher then you, run!<br />
<br />
Anyone know?  Just trying to be prepared.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can slow at 52/53 provided someone else in your guild can malo/mala + malosini, plus tash, and maybe OOS for you.  Before the mob is malosini'd and tashed, and preferably OOS'd too, I wouldn't count on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just FYI, I'm not asking could I slow anything in HoT at present (at lvl47).  But at say lvl52, could I?</div></div><hr />

j/k <br />

Seriously, your going to have a real tough time slowing HoT mobs. Especially w/o malo/mala/malosini/tash/oos. I remember having a real tough time at 60 w/o malo. <br />
<br />
An alternative is to use disease debuff and disease slow(50%)...these 2 spells are your friends. =)  You'll prolly have a better chance at slowing w/disease slow then regular slow in HoT.<br />
<br />
Oh, another alternative is to use the slow stick from chardok. I've heard it worked wonders for slowing mobs in HoT. Di'zok Oracle Shillelagh<br />

why not just cast the actual spell? =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The item proc was less resisted then the actually spell (go figure).<br />
<br />
And Tytann, I'm just doing my best impression of you and Dis - with less deaths!!!!<br />

<br />
Seriously?<br />
<br />
This seems to me to be quite an unreliable way to slow something in HoT. First you have to be actually hitting them to get it to proc and secondly you'd have to hope that it procs before the tank gets slaghtered from an unslowed MOB.<br />
<br />
But then again, I've never tried it, so I'm willing to listen to someone who has.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>KaisonIcebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">you could probly pull off some slows in  hot or at tarrow  if ya got lucky and ya have some brave debuffers(chanters mage not afrade to die to early debuff when nessecary) but wouldnt be able to pull the job off reliably till round lvl 55 before that your  more a liability then a help. <br />
<br />
abilty to slow  in tov wouldnt be your worry  draining your healers or dieing to aoe's would. at 47 even with  110+ to all resists unbuffed. you would take the  full  dmg of most aoe's<br />
<br />
on a side note our disease slows are 25% and 40%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Shandy's Rules of Spell sticking:<br />
<br />
Future Imperative Rule<br />
If it absolutely positively MUST, it will... next time.<br />
<br />
Assurance Clause<br />
If you didn't mal* or the enchanter didn't tash because &quot;these are wimpy,&quot;  it won't.<br />
<br />
Associative Property<br />
If you're raiding a mob with a higher level shaman, and it cons blue to him, red to you, his will bounce, yours will stick... but only after his bounced.<br />
<br />
Law of Diminishing Returns<br />
If you're raiding with a shaman of lower level, your spell won't stick until theirs has.<br />
<br />
Axiom of Primacy of Lesser Effect<br />
Grouped with somebody that can do what you can, only not as well?  Yours will bounce, theirs will stick... and then yours will stick.<br />
<br />
Advanced Tenet of Lesser Efficacy<br />
After tiring of having their slows, etc, overwritten by you, your companions will stop slowing, and debuffing.  Your next cast will then be resisted, causing you to be summoned and squooshed.<br />
<br />
I think those are the primary ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kromy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Lvl 50 + is ok in HoT.  It is not so much the level, it's really the debuffing that matters.  Even at lvl 65 and with malos (and sometimes tash), the turgur spell can be resisted at times in HoT.<br />
<br />
Some drakes also have high MR that can resist your MR turgur slow a few times and I usually have DR slow memmed as well.<br />
<br />
Was there to help out some friends recently and this is my findings.  Hope it helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'd agree with 55+ for HoT. If you have a 60 shaman to cast malo, and an enchanter to tash, you may be able to help with slows around 52-53. However, you'd get hit hard by AE and overall you'd probably be more hindrance than help.<br />
<br />
After 55 you'll have some chance, malosini will give you a boost once you get that. A lot also depends on who else is along - got a bard to sing resist songs and ooc? A mage to malosini? Chanter to tash? If so, then you will do much better and could maybe help sooner. If you have none of those you'll not be much use until 58 or so.<br />
<br />
60, malo, and torpor are the real breakthroughs for HoT. With malo slowing is sooo much easier, and with torpor you can keep yourself and the other casters alive from AE effects.</div></div><hr />
