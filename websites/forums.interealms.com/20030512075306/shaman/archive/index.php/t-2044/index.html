<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ridgey Didge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Now that I am up to the hole part, whats the best way to take this guy down?<br />
<br />
1) How many people do I need<br />
<br />
2) I recall passing him awhile ago doing an enchanters epic bit and recall a skelly on each side of him... are these automatically agro at me, or become agro when I hand in the icon. Just wondering if I should take these 2 out first and if I do it doesn't upset anything?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">One good group of mid- 50s is enough... basically, if you can make it to him, you can kill him :) Don't remember those skele's, but Kirn will not aggro you until you give him the icon... so if there are mobs around him, feel free to kill them.<br />
<br />
Best bet is to park your party in Kindles room (Chanter Epic mob) and kill the Reverent on the left hand side of the room. Kindle and the other Revrent won't aggro you. Hand in icon, and dash back to your party. Let the battle begin!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ridgey Didge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just did this part of the epic.... Went down with 3 good groups and found getting down to him harder than the actual fight. <br />
<br />
Funny thing was when I handed him the icon he agro'ed on someone else... I got through the fight without a single scratch.<br />
<br />
We did clear all the rooms with him left, before starting the hand-in so that helped with no adds.<br />
