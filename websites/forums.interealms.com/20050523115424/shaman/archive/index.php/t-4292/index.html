<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just finished stripping my necro and other twinks and I have around 48k.  Wanting to upgrade my shaman, but I honestly can't think of much that I could get him besides an ODS.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?  Thought about just saving the money and buying some of the expensive spells, but I still won't see 55+ for a while.  Perhaps I could use it to buy some of the Thurg armor(mq).  I'm in a relatively small guild so being able to go on Kael raids isn't really an option yet, and all the guilds I could join that do the raids require you to be 50+.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
**EDIT**<br />
<br />
Can't afford a fungi as they are in the 80 to 100k range on Tribunal(which I would like to add is freakin ridiculous)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jagara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i'd probably just save the rest for a fungi -<br />
<br />
but you could get:<br />
OOIV<br />
ikky regen BP<br />
any other hat - maybe a circlet of vallon?<br />
horse to match that JBB<br />
barbed ringmail gloves vs CC gaunts<br />
barbed ringmail boots</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ODS is way overpriced...<br />
<br />
Go get or find a Crystaline Torque and keep the neck for when you need the resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, ODS is still going for 15 to 17k on Tribunal.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I think we have the worst economy.<br />
<br />
Hiero cloaks are selling for 20k here too :/<br />
<br />
Thanks for the suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ziorina1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That Forest Loop makes me /cry.  At the very least, get an Electrum Black Sapphire Earring.  Even better would be to do the Protection of the Cabbage quest and get an Earring of the Solstice.  Prices of the components vary widely from server to server, but should run you 10-15k.<br />
<br />
Overall your gear looks really good.  Some other ideas:<br />
<br />
Elder Wolf Hide (shoulders)<br />
Ancient Seahorse Hide Cloak (back)<br />
Iksar regen BP (mentioned above)<br />
<br />
