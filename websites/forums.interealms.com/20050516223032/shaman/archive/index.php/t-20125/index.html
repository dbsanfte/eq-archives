the bosses have some fairly ridiculous DPS right now<br />
<br />
it's possible you could do it cleric/shaman, but you'd need a pretty beefy tank IMO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">tried our best cleric and me (i have the best focus/mana pool of any of my guilds shamans) but was with our worst hp/ac tank, and best we were able to do was keep up the warrior till 50%.  That was with a wiz and mage for dps too.  Most of the trials that I've done have been with a druid/cleric combo. <br />
<br />
I did do and complete one with a cleric and 2 shaman.  It was the second one, and the other shaman and I using tnarg's on the tank, while the cleric CHed.  In between casts I also doted the mob, and it went smooth and easy.  Wasn't with one of our beefy tanks either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We haven't done the Destroyer (Trial of Singular Might) herself yet, but if the DD is similar in HP and dps to the Annihilator, then a cleric and a shaman with a Time warrior can do it (11khp+, 2100 AC).  I end the annihilator fight with 30m.  I have a ~6800 mana pool buffed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Malaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You need either 2 clerics, if you are in a guild like us that started farming quarm in the last month-2 month ago, or if you have GREAT tanks ( &gt;11k-11k5hp, &gt;2100AC), then you can do it with cleric-shaman.<br />
<br />
We have trouble doing it with 2 clerics at the moment. We do it, but it is hard. <br />
<br />
My biggest concern is the time it will take to flag the guild for these trials. Espacially when you are in a guild where most people are casual, and you need a roster of 90 to be sure to have 55-60 peeps every night.</div></div><hr />

How I understand the first three group trials need only be obtained by a single person in order to initiate an Ikkinz multiple-group raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Malaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yes but i think (well it seems that is the way we understood it) that you need all your guild flagged for further progression.</div></div><hr />

That's true, then you need to beat the more or less bugged raids to progress.</div></div><hr />
