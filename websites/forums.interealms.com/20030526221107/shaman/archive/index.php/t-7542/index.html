<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sinur McNight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was just wondering if the new spells are turning up in the Bazaar.  If so, what are they going for on your server?<br />
<br />
I found a copy of True Spirit for 8K this morning on Kane Bayle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Seen 2 Cloud of Grummus (on same trader) for 20k each.  Did not purchase, but someone did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have not seen any on Karana yet - keeping my eyes peeled and checkbook out!!<br />
<br />
:)&gt;&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sandrak Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">On Zebuxoruk I have purchased all but 1 of my 61 spells inthe bazaar.  Paid about 10k each for them mainly because I have been using all the parchments I could for my cleric.<br />
<br />
Seen a couple of people trying to sell level 62 shaman spells for 35k or so.  They were still trying to sell them last I saw and probably will be.<br />
<br />
I guess the thing for me is that there are not any shaman spells in the list that I look at and think &quot;OMG I HAVE TO HAVE THAT&quot; so I will just get them when I do.  Eventually there will be a glut of spells and prices will bottom out on the 61-64 spells.  Since it appears that you will have to be apart of a large and successful guild to get your 65 spells in anyway other than the bazaar, I expect the 65 spell prices, when sold, to be extremely high.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ive seen a couple, but none that interested me, were going anywhere from 5-10k each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">On Tribunal so far...<br />
<br />
Saw Breath of Ulthor (Level 64 DoT) a few days ago for 10k. Purchased it. Saw it again last nite for 25k....<br />
<br />
Picked up Truespirit for 15k (talked the guy down from 20k - still paid more than I wanted to pay but had read lots of good stuff about new doggie).<br />
<br />
Saw new Group Agi for 9k and thought &quot;F#@$ that for a joke&quot;.<br />
<br />
Similarly saw Tnarg's Mending for 20k and decided I'd just wait til I got some more parchments.<br />
<br />
So far handed in and got 2xGreater Immobalize, the new AC buff and improved group DR/PR.... now you see why I brought some :)<br />
(Though a guild shaman did give me an extra copy of the new DR slow last night! Woot!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">on AB someone was selling Agility of the Wrulan for 1k. Was tempted to buy &amp; resell for 5 times that. But then I thought. It's an agi spell, near useless</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sinjuneq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">On Torv.....Spear of Torment 10k, Talisman of Wrulan 15k, Petrifying Earth 10k</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sellers on Quellious are insane at best:<br />
<br />
Spear of Torment 15000<br />
<br />
Also saw Torpor for 75000 and Pox for 30000.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I found a few for 20K, the level 62 AC buff for 30K, and Petrifying Earth for no less than 1 million pp.  Most of the pricing is just carryover for people who are aware of the &quot;Instant Lotto Winner&quot; status of Malo and Torp.  Of course on Xeg it really is not too uncommon to find several items in a category priced well into the 300K range.<br />
<br />
I have a feeling that with the repeats in parchment turn-ins 6 months from now all L61-63 spells will be VERY attainable because, in theory, any parchment can result in any spell in the range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Agility of the Wrulan: 54321 !<br />
Could of Grummus: 54321<br />
Focus of Soul: 54321<br />
<br />
So do you believe me now that traders here are insane?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I saw Endurance of the Boar for 10k.<br />
<br />
Like I'm going to pay that ofr a stam buff that I will probably get anyway! (I want the pet. I really want the pet. I got agi. Auughhh).<br />
<br />
Malo for 55k, straight into my pocket. I am now broke. Broke broke broke.<br />
<br />
No sign of torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tinwe Ambersky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">On Karana I've seen so far:<br />
<br />
Focus of soul for 30K<br />
Agility of the Wrulan (2) 5K  -  got one<br />
Ancestral guard 5K - also got this one<br />
Cloud of Grummus 20k(1)/30K(1)<br />
<br />
Personnaly 5K is the max amount I'm willing to pay for a lvl 61-62 spell except the pet.<br />
<br />
Tinwe Ambersky, Karana</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Slissia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I sold two extras of cloud of grummus for 7500 apiece cause I'm trying to save the money for the 50K malo that's been taunting me all week on the Rathe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Saw a lot more on Rathe this weekend, anywhere from 3k to 8k for various PoP spells... Ancestral Guard, Cloud of Grummus, a number of Spear of Torments, some other stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sateeva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Got the new heal spell Tnarg`s Mending. Cloroblast replacement I think. 1300HP for 450mana in 3.8secs cast. I love it~!<br />
<br />
Also got  Talisman of the Wrulan (Worthless IMO) and Talisman of the Tribunal.<br />
<br />
Have yet to get a 61 level spell from turn ins yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Sigh. Ok, today we had the single target str, sta, and the higher malosixxx spell for sale in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
The prices were 29k for str, 10k for sta, 40k for malosixxx. <br />
<br />
WHAT CRACK ARE THESE GUYS SMOKING???<br />
<br />
Ok. First off 1) why would I pay for single target str or malosixxx when I have malo, and I never use a single target str over focus?<br />
<br />
Second, 2) Why would I pay hideously thousands of dollars when I have just as good a chance of getting this spell through randomness anyway, given long enough collecting parchments? The thrill of having it now aint worth the 30k shock when I get it on the next turn in AFTER buying it. <br />
<br />
3) Who in their right mind would buy ANY 61+ spell knowing the parchments are totally random, let alone for ANY exorbitant amount of money? 5k, maybe. But that is still 5k lost if I get that spell back on the next turn in!<br />
<br />
Maybe for the shadowy parchments, the Malos and Quintesence. But for Malosxxx and Single target Str and Sta, you have got to be smoking some crack. <br />
<br />
(Sta is good, but not 10k good!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I decided to go level my druid for a couple months and then come buy the spells.  Forking idoit wants 50kpp for new pet spell....errr I will get back to you on that!!<br />
<br />
:)&gt;&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Barelil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">When the PoP spells first started showing up in Bazaar on CT, they were going for 10k each.  Now some of them are as low as 4k.<br />
<br />
Spells in CT Bazaar atm:<br />
Greater Immobilize - 4k &amp; 10k<br />
Talisman of the Tribunal - 5k<br />
Talisman of the Wrulan - 6k</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>ryoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">tarew marr, tnargs mending 40k ya fek that<br />
gummus  25k<br />
tali wrulan 15k<br />
spear of something  25k<br />
<br />
oh and btw all of these were on a lvl 53 bard fully equiped so i doubt its a mule ....theiveing bastards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Shayne716</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Ryoz old buddy we need to start hunting together again.  In the past 3 days I have seen 12 parchments drop in my groups.  Knowing my lucky dice I only got one of them but still nice to see them after getting so frustrated for not seeing any the first few weeks.  Honestly its probably better to try trading spells than bazaaring for them.  Sit in PoK and people regularly WTT these spells.  As for prices its supply and demand at this point once more people start getting duplicates i'm sure prices will come down.  Unlike Kunark spells parchments drop approximately once an hour if you are fighting the lvl 60ish mobs.  So eventually prices will come down to more reasonable amounts whereas Kunark spells will not because they drop from rarer mobs less frequently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jonat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">im on the ayonae ro server and really only seen a few for sale<br />

talisman of the raptor 25k <br />
someone needs a clue</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Just be patient. These spells will be as common as water flasks. 63-65 will be harder, of course, and might require some spending. But those 61- 62 spells can be gotten by anyone.</div></div><hr />
