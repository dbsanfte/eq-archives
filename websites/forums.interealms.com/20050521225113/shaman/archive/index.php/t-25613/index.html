<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I just formed a new guild recently with a bunch of friends.  I'm setting up the forums and my friend can not access the member parts of  our board.  He can only see the Public and Recruiting forums (not the Officer or Member forum).<br />
<br />
He can post, but he's not posting as a member.  How can we get him set up as a member?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Has he logged out and back in to the board? I had that problem for a little while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The SOE sponsored crap is a LITTLE flaky.<br />
<br />
No, wait.<br />
<br />
It's a lot flaky.  If you have the ability to do your site elsewhere, do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The only problems we're having with their site at the moment is this registering issue and the load times of the pages.  Apart from that, it fits our needs.<br />
<br />
At the moment, as the forum admin, I'm the only person who can currently see the members only and officers section in the forum.  Everybody else can only see the public and recruiting section.  I don't know why others are having problems accessing the rest of the site, especially when those people are officers, who should by all rights have such access.<br />
<br />
Is there some section I can go on the forum where I am supposed to register people from the site?  ie, do I need to assign player X with member status so he can post on all the boards?</div></div><hr />
