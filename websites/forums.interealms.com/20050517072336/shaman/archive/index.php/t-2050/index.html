<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Reidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok..troll shaman here of the 9th level..or 10th..forgot..damn Troll Intelligence...anyway....<br />
<br />
I keep hearing that Paludal (?) Caverns on the moon is a nice place to visit...but Ive only been back to EQ for a few weeks after a 9month absence...and I don't know the best way to get there :(<br />
<br />
So, Im sure there is TP involved..so can anyone clue me in on something Im clueless on?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">goto Dreadlands, run to wizard spire.  Tell the Nexus Scion in say, 'Jorney to Luclin plz' and she will give you a gem.  Wait for the portal to become active and boom, your on the moon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>WM231NIKE</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Get a port or run to Dreadlands, Great Divide, North Karana, Toxillia Forest, or Greater Faydark.  Hail the nexus Scion there in the center of the wizard spires and say &quot;I will journey to Luclin.&quot;  She will give you a shard that you should keep in your inventory.  Now you wait up to 15 minutes for the spires to activate.<br />
<br />
The most safe spires for a troll at that level are Tox, Greater Fay, or Dreadlands because of guards or high level mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No one can teleport you to the moon.  You must travel to one of the Nexus Scion's at the wizards portals in GFay, Tox, North Karana, Great Divide, or Dreadlands.  Hail the Scion, follow his directions, and wait a few minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I went to the moon at level 15.  It's a great place.  At any of the large Spires (DL, GF, NK, Odus, GD) there is a white robed Scion that you can ask for the shard (&quot; I want to go to the moon&quot;).  Now which of the spires is best for a low level troll?  Well, there are two that can be gotten to relatively easy.  First choice is of course the one in DL.  Ask any Druid or Wiz to port you to DL.  Just don't forget to ask the druid to invis you before porting.  I had VERY limited funds, so TP was out.  I choose to run to the NK spires (with invis through HH). Unfortunately, there is a wandering guard that will path right throuhg the spires... they don't like Trollies.   So for about 3 minutes, i kited two guards around the spires.  No  fun.<br />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">ack double post :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Amusingly, the Nexus Scion's response will be triggered by the &quot;Mystic Voice&quot; that announces when the port will take place. So from time to time you see the scion say &quot;Take this shard, A Mystic Voice ...&quot;<br />
<br />
A guy in my guild has the surname &quot;of the Nexus&quot; and can port himself to the moon - which is pretty cool :)</div></div><hr />

That's hilarious Widda.  The same thing happened to me the other night.  I ran around for I know a good 2 or 3 minutes.  There were a ton of ppl sitting there laughing(bastards) :D ...until some nice enchanter mem blurred the guard for me.<br />
<br />
About ran my little troll legs off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">&quot;I would like to journey to luclin.  First class seat with complimentary alcoholic beverages and hottie flight attendents, please.&quot;<br />

And then I say &quot;Thanks&quot; when I get my shard.<br />
