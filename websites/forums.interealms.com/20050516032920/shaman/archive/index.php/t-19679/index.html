<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Metadone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I'm almost done with my toon. As a shaman at 65 I feel useless, ok I can do a buttload of damage but how many time does it take ? On a normal group, the time it takes me to slow something is so long that a &quot;normal&quot; mob will already be down to around 50% of his hp, then I land a dot and I consider myself lucky if it does more than 2 ticks of damages. Our blast have a way too long casting time (matches the longest casting time for wizard which are only on their very high damaging spells...).<br />
<br />
Now my last hope would be that Sony makes us again king of slowing. The new slow they propose us is utter crap but maybe if it ignores the mititgation (which I highly doubt but hey, I can dream, can't I ?). So my question is simple, for those of you who managed to get it, does this slow takes into account mitigation or not ?<br />
<br />
If not, I'm done with EQ as I don't want to go on others servers than mine (I like too much the general feeling on Firiona Vie, sorry, I like RP, problem is that we only can have one toon there), I don't have the heart to delete my ol' ogre and most of all, I don't think I'd have the courage to level another toon when I see the time it took me to reach 65.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">and it does get overrode by a beastlords slow.<br />
<br />
goodbye /wave</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Metadone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thnaks for your replys :) It's a sad day but I'm about to hit cancel account and uninstall EQ from my PC. I wish you all the most fun you can get :)<br />
<br />
See you,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">well i pretty much the same, though i going to get bored of pop first.<br />
<br />
but well this expansion seem to me like stop gap to the proper expanion.<br />
did any see the sneaky post in that tlak they did saying , did i hear you ask if level cp will be raise.. i cant say but stay tune!  type thing?<br />
<br />
dont buy god wait till the porper expasnion comes out, this is just a stop gap, and an aweful one at that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You drama queens kill me, lol.  If you feel you must quit the game because you no longer enjoy it, then do so.  That is what you should do with any game or other form of entertainment.  Sure, you probably wish the fun would last forever, but just like Las Vegas, eventually you run out of money or just get bored.  <br />
<br />
However, please spare me the good byes.  I really don't care if you play or not.  I enjoy the game and I enjoy playing a shaman.  I also play alts for when i just want to hit something or blow it up.  However, THE GAME is what you make of it.  Getting so wrapped up in a single character or class is a silly thing to do.  You end up missing a lot of the other fun stuff there is to do.  <br />
<br />
Bottom line, I've heard more than enough whining on this board lately.  If you want to go, then please, just leave quietly.  <br />
<br />
I, on the other hand, will enjoy the new content; zones, spells, aa's, loot, lore, mobs, berzerker, raids, casino, tribute system, alchemy potions, and interface improvements.  I also look forward to the coming graphics engine upgrade and more expansions.  It's all good, because it all adds to the fun.<br />
<br />
Oh, and btw, if the BST wants to slow, then let him, either overwrite his 65% with your 75% or do something else while he is casting.  No one says we always have to be the slower in the group.  Sometimes I heal even if there is a druid in the group.  Just work as a team, do what makes sense, and have fun.  Really pretty simple.<br />
<br />
Cya, take care,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">/agree Thunderwolf</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Agreed...<br />
<br />
I still enjoy playing my Shaman, have never felt useless.<br />
<br />
While I empathize with the situation, the only reason to post a goodbye message like this is to bring other people down to justify your decision.<br />
<br />
If you're no longer having fun - fine, thats a good reason to quit.  Just say so.  <br />
<br />
Good luck with whatever you decide to do from now, at any rate.<br />

Bingo... We have a winner.  Bottom line, if you are doing something for fun and it stops being fun, stop what you are doing.  Very simple process.</div></div><hr />
