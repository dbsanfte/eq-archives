<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Talamorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After many months of trying for the tear i finally got it a few nights back. Last night went to do Lord Rak and i handed in the tear. I died and we had 3 mage pets on him. Also had about 2 groups there. Apparently some people agroed Lord Rak and we wiped. When we went back he had despawned. Now he conned ally to me. My question is, must i go back to fear to obtain another tear or can he be attacked out right for the scale ? Thanks for any answers in advance.<br />

<br />
Let us know how that final fight goes, as it seems there may have been some further changes from what some people have been saying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Talamorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thx for the response. I will definetly post the outcome. Next time i go back will be with 5 mages and so much melee that Rak will beg for mercy. Back to chasing that damm golem in fear now :(<br />

You can MQ the tear now if another shammy has it, as you have the necessary faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The Rak that spawns from a reaver doesn't have a scale. Handing in the tear to Rak causes him to despawn, and a new Rak spawns in his place with a new loot list that includes the scale, and a new faction that is KoS. Just like High Scale Kirn. If you don't kill the Rak who has the scale, he despawns to prevent a future party from getting it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Despawns after 30 minutes, I hear, although the non-scale rak can stay up for 2 hours or more. <br />

To our annoyance while farming reavers :)</div></div><hr />
