I have about 50K to spend.  Thinking He needs a better belt, boots, gloves, and face.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appeaciated.  I 2 box him with my 65 Monk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Go Coldain Skin/Shissar Scaled Gloves, Girdle of Mithanial is nice, but goes for 25kish depending on server and is way overpriced IMHO, spider fur will do fine as will maybe a Flayed Turmoil Skin Belt, maybe Chitinous belt (nice ac, nice wis and some stamina and cheap). Also have a gander at Grey Flesh Sleeves, barbed Dragonscale booties, all of which have nice hit point bonuses.<br />
Face, hmm, I like Crystal Spider Eyes, Death mask of the Elysians and Veil of the Executioner (the last has a RL of 50 and the others will serve you better in terms of stats till then).<br />
Good luck and have fun, if you get any of the reccomendations I have listed it will likely cost you less than 10k depending on server....I would love a Girdle of Mithanial myself, but I dont do PoP (too many old world places I enjoy, I want PoP to remain fresh and new later) and I am too cheap :D</div></div><hr />
