<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zempten</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello my fello brothers and sisters of the glades. I have currently been trying to raise my fletching  but it just seems so impposible. Could someone please spare some ideas on how to get flethcing up asap? I would love to have the skill maxed out so I can begin to make bows for me and my guild mates. Thanks so much for any advice that you could spare<br />
<br />
<br />
p.s I know that these are one of the things not to ask in the above post , but that post was telling us how to get it above 202. I actually need to raise my fletching from 45 . So that is why I am posting this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>legalil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">go to www.eqtraders.com and ummm... find a fletching guide to follow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eorlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The best way to get fletching skill is by making arrows. Get a good list of the arrow component trivial levels, then make the most basic arrow you can (with all the 7 copper parts, that is) except for the one piece with the higher difficulty. Every arrow has the trivial level of the *most* difficult piece involved.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just change to the highlighted item when your skill no longer goes up. They have some basic info and so called rumors listed as well. Very worth your while to check it out.  GL :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mezumiiru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">And without adding a new post, may I also ask does DEX affect your fletching skill ups? And where can I get chunks of condensed ice/flame, and if I must buy them, how much should I offer? Thanks guys, this has been really helpful for me to read!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Eorlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would have linked to Aoenla's guide, but the link is too long for me to remember :p<br />
<br />
I distinctly remember something Verant said about fletching and dex... It either increases skill ups regardless of wis/int, or it only increases skill ups if you have less wis and int than you have dex.<br />
Looking around on the CR news archive, all I could find about dex was that it affects procs, crits and it affects archery like str affects melee damage.<br />
On the other hand, I did get one useful thing to know: &quot;Skill success rolls are skill-based and level-based, they are not stat-based. Skill increase rolls are stat-based.&quot; Basically, don't bother with dex if it would mean losing wis (or int if that is higher...), but otherwise knock yourself out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bindamel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Pretty  much what Eorlin said.<br />
<br />
Highest of Dex, Wis, and Int will determine your chance of getting a skill-up.<br />
<br />
Skill level and skill mods (Geerlok planing tool, for example)  increase your chance of success.<br />
<br />
Wis and Int are universal to tradeskills, so if you're planning on working on other tradeskills, a wisdom kit is a good idea.  When you're upping your wisdom or dexterity, don't forget about stat foods/drinks. (Justice Fruit Pies --&gt; 15 dex!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zempten</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Alrighty then. I have gotten my fletching from 0 to 202 now. I just wanted to ask wether I should make bows or arrows to raise it to 250? Thanks once again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Depends on how much cash and time you have to spend, really.<br />
<br />
Low on cash, but high on time?  Hunt acrylia and the condensed substances, and make acrylia arrows to 243.<br />
<br />
Low on time, but got a ton of cash?  Make darkwoods until 235 then shadewoods to 243.<br />
<br />
Wood elf?  Got some cash?  Make mithril arrows to 243.<br />
<br />
Mithril arrows (for a wood elf) take longer than simply camping a bow part vendor for skill; but takes less time than hunting the stuff for acrylia arrows.  Also, mithril arrows (at roughly 2k per 120 combines) are cheaper per combine than bows are; but a lot more expensive than the acrylia arrows.<br />
<br />
I say to take the skill to 243 for one main reason : whether you believe the geerlock's effective skill caps out at 252 or 255 at 243 you're there with a geerlock.  There is no reason, other than to say that you did it, to go beyond 243 if you've got a geerlock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zempten</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Is a geerlock the one where you have to make it and it comes with a modification to fletching and some stats that is put in range or ammo slot?<br />
<br />
I am a wood elf ranger , with little time and 3.1k. Does that count as got money or not? Sorry my english is still lacking some. Also with the gearlock thing does it help if I have fletching at 250 or at 243? I was told that it's modification doesn't work if you get to 250</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The Geerlock is an item made by a gnome tinker.  The Tradeskill Trophy (generic term) is the item that you craft with the tradeskill, in this case, the Grandmaster's Whittling Knife (or whatever it is called) is made by fletching.<br />
<br />
Both the Geerlock and the Grandmaster's Trophy have a plus 5 percent modification to a tradeskill.  <br />
<br />
I've heard two different things about the skill modifying items.  The first one (which I tend to believe myself) is that they can only raise the effective skill to 255.  The other thing I've heard is that they can only raise the effective skill to 252.  <br />
<br />
The difference in success rates between a 250 skill, a 252 effective skill, and a 255 effective skill are going to be minimal, however, unless the item has a very high trivial.   And yes, if you compare success rates, it is apparent that while the skill cannot go over 250 base, items can trivial well over 250.<br />
<br />
Oh, if you are wondering, the reason I use the term effective skill when I refer to the use of a skill modifying item, such as a Geerlock or a Trophy, it is because the item only modifies your skill for purposes of success (and, for some PoP recipes, whether you can attempt them at all!); it does not alter your real (base) skill at all.<br />
<br />
Zempten, as to your cash situation . . . I'm sorry, but I've got to say 'No' . . . I got my wood elf to 243 fletching before they nerfed the sellbacks and the skillups.  Back then, just to see what it was like, I did 40 mithril arrows (at 650ish plat for that set) at a skill of 202.  I gained 2 skillups; and counted myself lucky (got the second on the last combine I did that set).  I then took a gnome to 16 and trained him to tinker, to make cams for me, and got to 235 on the compound darkwoods, which also got me a nice profit.  Again, this was before the nerfs; you cannot make a profit this way anymore.  It took me between 240 and 280 combines to go from 235 to 243 skill, making the mithril arrows.  Thats an average of 1 skillup every 30 or 35 combines.  Since its been nerfed, with the skillup rate vastly reduced, I'd be suprised to see you get more than 6 skillups with all that cash you've got handy; as thats only enough for 4 and a part of the 120 combine sets I was doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zempten</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Oh I see. Did you do this with your Dex and Wis maxed out? I have recently heard that getting these two maxed out will definetly increase my chances of raising fletching. I also heard rumors that opening the fletching book will also help. Not sure if any of this is true but would be awesome to get some confirmation on these rumors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">No, neither were anywhere close to max.<br />
<br />
Occasionally my wood elf was able to get a buff, bringing dex (what I focussed on) higher, but usually the high stat was only 124 . . . it matters little which stat you bring up, as the game uses the highest (at least, as far as we can tell).</div></div><hr />
