<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i dunno if this is a good idea but i just thought if it. Here is a good way to get u in groups. like most high level people, they get better gear and closer to the cap. Our high level spells give tons of stats and probably uneeded since they have close to maxed out stats. Now the idea of getting into groups easier.. the buffs would actually exceed the cap (ex: someone has 305 str and has a 50 str buff put on them, their str is now 355) but it could be for all classes.. just a thought.. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">that's one of the ideas being considered for OoW shaman buffs. :)<br />
<br />
But yeah, it is a good idea to an extent, the problem being that alot of stats have been seen to have already diminuishing returns at near-cap levels</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">intelligence/wisdom + mana buff is always good</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It would be more exciting if the stats actually did anything useful; 100 Agi for 7 AC?<br />
<br />
This is why the combat % mods are so much more promising.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Foradce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">intelligence/wisdom + mana buff is always good <br />
<br />
They're also stats that we don't buff  ;) . Even Int/wis/sta have diminishing returns the higher you get. If stats were more useful it would be great to be able to buff past the stat cap, however at this time they don't add a whole lot. Unless they revamp stats we'll be much better off with the % mods.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vittra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I am all for combat % mods.<br />
Diminishing returns beyond max stats cap is really useless IMHO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Froggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think stat buffs are next to useless, the only one I normally bother casting is Stamina. Maybe primal essence. Other then that, I normally ignore stat buffs altogether. The % are much better. Hell, I dont even care about int/wis from voq/kei. I would rather just have pure mana and mana regen.<br />
<br />
Also, no offense to you sir, because, pretty much, im in the same boat, you and I are not at the level that changes for the shaman class are needed. Now, the difference between us, and why I feel better able to comment is, I am close to the level that they are at, and well, your shaman isnt level 20, as per your sig, and your main is a level 51 wizard. At level 51, stats mean something to you, all buyable cant max them id imagine. So, I know the class a bit better then you, and I know what the content they are facing is like for my class, being that I have some experience in GoD content. Just not stuff like Uqua.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think the %-effect buffs are better since everyone bounce against the cap sooner or later.<br />
<br />
Besides, you still have older stat buffs if you have yet to reach the cap with Avatar in some area...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kellenial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">On a slight tangent, does anyone know if SoE is planning to further raise the caps on stats, similar to the way PoP did from 61 to 65?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">On a slight tangent, does anyone know if SoE is planning to further raise the caps on stats, similar to the way PoP did from 61 to 65?<br />
<br />
Most probably they will, because everyone in the high end is grinding against the new cap as we speak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm sure the stat cap will increase, but frankly, the folks who are grinding against it now already realize how useless stats are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Rumor has it that caps are not being increased, but the spells we get are going to go over the cap--I think Rytan posted that somewhere.<br />
<br />
However, it's a bit of a moot point.  The returns diminish quickly past a certain level.  For instance, that nice parse on strength one of the members here provided showed that nothing over 280 str did anything.  Would anyone like to actually guess the liklihood of SoE finding and fixing the code so that our over-stat-cap str spell did something post 280?<br />
<br />
My guesstimate:  between slim and none--and slim went home.<br />
<br />
Stats do so little that even 100 in a stat is a negligable benefit once you're past 72 or whatever that low stat cap is.  They're not worth casting.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Warren Maguson Emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">And not to forget... you'll have to buy Omens of War to have buffs that are useful again.   If you're ok with that, fine but look at the situation with both eyes open and don't get blindsided that they broke the Shaman class in GoD and are patching some of our fixes in OoW.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I guess I'm kind of ok with buffs waiting until OoW to be improved.  No one really got a lot with GoD, so I suppose I understand.<br />
<br />
What I am not so much ok with is the general trend for our class to be further marginalized and trivialized with respect to their power to contribute.  I really don't think our stat buffs were ever a huge part of our contributions to a party.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">They just need a way to make buffing easier on the shaman.  I get enough tells as is, and I don't need to be switching out two or three times as many buffs.  If SOE allows stat buffs to go beyond the cap, I really hope they consider an easy way of doing so.  I want to play the game and know what's going on, not staring at my tell box buffing people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I used to have that problem.<br />
<br />
The way I do it now is this:<br />
<br />
At the start of the adventure / encounter / group / session I tell everyone that I am going to load my buff spell set and hit everyone with a full set of buffs.  I further tell them that if they want *me* to keep them buffed, they need to click off any Shaman buffs they currently have.<br />
<br />
I then proceed to use the group version, and only the group version, of every buff I cast.  Depending on the group, I might use Soul instead of Khuras.  Really not that much difference in the two.<br />
<br />
This allows me to actually participate in the killing of bad guys instead of waiting for the Ranger's Fo7 he got 90 minutes ago to wear off so I can stick my Focus on him.<br />
<br />
Yes, it might mean that I am not always using the absolute best buffs I have.  You know what?  I don't care.  I buff because I feel it's an important part of what my character brings to a group.  But watching buff timers is not what I consider &quot;fun&quot; . . . so I don't do it.  Yes, I'll use Avatar (no FA yet) on a tank if I know we are about to hit a difficult mob, but I won't maintain it for general progression.<br />
<br />
Either way, you are the one who is playing Shaman, you need to set the rules in your groups as to how you are going to handle buffs.  Set the rules, stick to them, and most of all, don't let any aspect of your duties get in the way of having fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Unfortunately, that doesn't work well in raids.  People always dying or just showing up needing buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Oh, well raiding, what else are you gonna do?<br />
<br />
Our ability to contribute on a raid is quite limited.  I'd go so far as to say we really aren't needed.<br />
<br />
Sure, that needs to change, but that's where are right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">i havent been able to play a pc for almost 2-3 weeks and wont be able to for a week thats why my chars r lower =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">what is combat % mods ??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Combat % mods are direct changes to different combat abilities.  Perhaps the easiest to explain is avoidance.<br />
<br />
If I cast a buff that adds a 7% Avoidance mod (as our new AGI buff is rumored to do) what I have done is given that character a flat 7% chance to avoid an incoming blow.<br />
<br />
That is a combat % mod.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">7) Meaningful buffs, with either skill mods (% adds to 1h slash, Dual Wield, Defense, etc.) or combat effects (strikethrough, combat effects, avoidance, etc.). Up the HPs on the new Focus, too. (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showpost.php?postid=258125&amp;postcount=17)<br />
