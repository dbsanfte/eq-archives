<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When (if) the servers ever come back up, what is the process for putting your own skins into the new interface?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Basically:<br />
<br />
1) Create a new folder in the skins directory in your EQ folder<br />
2) Copy all the files in there from the default directory in skins<br />
3) Piss around with the files you want to change<br />
4) Load EQ<br />
5) type in /loadskin [foldername of the new skin] (or something along those lines)</div></div><hr />

5) type in /loadskin [foldername of the new skin] (or something along those lines) <br />
<br />
Is there a command you can put in eqclient.ini to save you having to type /loadskin &lt;folder&gt; each logon?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Once you put it in the first time, you don't have to put it in again (it remembers.)<br />
<br />
There is a separate file:   UI_xxxx_yy.ini (where xxxx is your character name and yy is your server number) that contains the UI info.<br />
<br />
While the line:<br />
<br />
UISkin=xxxxx (where xxxxx = your skin name)<br />
<br />
is in there, there is also a ton of other stuff in there.  I'd recommend using /load xxxxx from in-game instead.<br />
----------------<br />
Here's the longer version- instructions from one of the mods I'm using:<br />
<br />
LOADING THE MODIFICATION<br />
<br />
To use this UI Mod, you must edit your &quot;eqclient.ini&quot; file<br />
in your base EverQuest directory (defaults on installation<br />
to &quot;C:\Program Files\EverQuest\&quot;).  Find the line in &quot;eqclient.ini&quot; that reads &quot;[Defaults]&quot;.  Under this line, add a new line that reads:<br />
<br />
NewUI=TRUE<br />
<br />
Now, log into EverQuest.  Once you have gotten to the character selection screen you will see that you are now using the new user interface.<br />
<br />
Select a character and enter EverQuest.  Now, to load a particular<br />
modification you must type &quot;/load @&quot; where &quot;@&quot; is the folder name that you have installed the modification to.  To load my modification, if you followed the directions above to install it, type:<br />
<br />
/load modname<br />
<br />
And my modification will take effect on your user interface.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
PRESERVING YOUR WINDOW POSITIONS AND OPACITY<br />
<br />
WARNING: Doing the below may result in problems involving the spacing and positioning of your windows, or crashes.  If you experience problems, use the method described below to change to the &quot;default&quot; skin (ie. the line must read &quot;UISkin=default&quot; to change back to the default skin).<br />
<br />
When you load a new UI modification or skin, your windows will be reset to certain default positions.  Needless to say, these default positions are very, very stupid.<br />
<br />
Instead of using the &quot;/load&quot; command in-game to initialize new skins and modifications, I suggest directly editing your character's UI files.  A character's UI file will be named something like this:<br />
<br />
UI_charname_23.ini<br />
<br />
Find the particular character(s) you want to load the modification and open their UI file.  Find this line:<br />
<br />
[Main]<br />
<br />
Under that line will be a line indicating what current UI modification that character is using.  Now edit the line below &quot;[Main]&quot; from whatever it currently says to:<br />
<br />
UISkin=modname</div></div><hr />
