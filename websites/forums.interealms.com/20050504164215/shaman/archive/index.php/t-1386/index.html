<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Please take the JBB out the game, Im sick and tired of reading those 3 letters, fun for the anti social soloist but not much else.<br />
<br />
Please dont hurt me with the inevitable flames :)<br />
<br />
p.s Grats on actually looting an item /bonk the marketeers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>imel007</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">How much do JBB's usually sell for now anyhow?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">about 20kp on bristlebane...I still can't figure out why. At the level you have 20kp it is worthless. Thats 8 seconds you could be can dancing or medding and you prob gonna resist. Its a fun greenie killer and a nice twink toy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Torlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hey, I'll be the first to say you don't need it to be a good Shaman. At 59 with one more yellow to go till 60, I did ok without it. And probably 30% of that time was soloing.  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hibbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I just spent 30k on a JBB on Torv.  Was it worth it?  Nope.  I would have been much better off saving up another 20-30k for a fungi tunic, or just spending that 30k on general upgrades.  Am I sorry I bought it?  Not in the slightest.  It's an item I have wanted for a long time.  I knew until I got one, I would always be on the lookout for one.  Now that goal is taken care of, I'm finished with it.  Anyway, farming plat isn't too hard, even at lower levels.  Heck, I even had fun here and there. <br />
<br />
I'm not saying the JBB isn't a great item, but I'm not saying it IS a great item either.  If you want one get one.  If you think the JBB is the crutch of a bad shaman, get one anyway.  It does have nice AC, and matches the JB gaunts and arms after all.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">At 45 JBB is all of that and a bag of chips.<br />
<br />
At 51 JBB is STILL all of that.<br />
<br />
Get the toys, make some noise. JBB + Epic + Fungal + Jobarer.<br />
<br />
Man what I wouldn't give to be a big, green, a$$-scratching machine at this point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>tinysun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Government warning : JBB will lead to brain cancer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">**rathjar**<br />
i am doing nearly always full damage whit the JBB.<br />
263 damage every 8 sec.<br />
hard do more damage in melee.<br />
whit attack on,we can swing at least one time between every JBB cast,adding more damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gettinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">A JBB is worth every cp of that 20k.  Can you be a great shaman without it?  sure.  I didn't get one until level 58 and didn't feel at all diminished by not having it.  That said...I'm glad I do have it now.  Just think of it as one of those many handy spells we have in the book, only mana free.  Mana free damage is good in lots of places.  I don't just use it solo, I also use it in groups and even on raids.  Hey, if mana is good and no one is in immediate need of heals or buffs, why not kick in a little damage?  One of the things I love about shammies is their versatility.  A JBB just enhances that aspect a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i just got one in rathe for 7K plus a mushroom veil and 2x6ac,65 hp rings........looks like a good deal,).i already had one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Paerlith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Great in groups too.  One can add damage, and never have to slow the group down to med.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Oogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I still use my JBB  A LOT at 59,  would never sell it.  It is too useful for soloing, sure its a bit slow, but the damage adds up and its mana free which means you can just keep pulling.  Worth more than 20K in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hey, I heard that if you use a JBB too much you'll go blind :eek: .</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's OK, because as of the last patch, Cure Blindness is now working :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well, at halfway through 59 I finally got one to drop (been camping it since 53)...:P  Still, I like it and I'm having fun with it :)</div></div><hr />
