<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Akbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok all this is my first post so maybe this sound stupid but here is what i am thinking.<br />
In the patch coming up SOE is revamping group Xp <br />
They say to this ratio<br />
2 people 20%<br />
3 people 40%<br />
4 people 60%<br />
5 people 80%<br />
6 people 80% but divided by 5 NOT 6 and that amount to all 6 members<br />
of the group.<br />
<br />
Ok I did some rough VERY rough calulations and this is what I got<br />
<br />
If a Mob gives say 10 for exp then <br />
1 person gets 10 for xp<br />
2 people get 10+2=12 .... 12/2= 6 xp to each person<br />
ok so if you do the same ratio for each added member of a group it comes out to the following<br />
<br />
3 members = 4.6<br />
4 members = 4.0 <br />
5 members = 3.6<br />
6 members = 3.6<br />
<br />
so my question is : Am I off base here? or does soloing still make sense?<br />
<br />
If I can get the original 10 for soloing then I am set BUT <br />
If I am wrong I would like to know<br />
<br />
So I would like some input on this <br />
If anybody woith a bit more Xp on how XP is split in the game could chime in I would be thankful<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The question will be, can a full group kill 3 times faster than you solo or not?  If a full group kills 3 mobs for every one you kill they will get 3.6 *3 = 10.8 exp while you get 10.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">don't forget they're nerfing POP ZEM to make up for the change, so soloing will yield less xp post patch</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">a full group with enough dmg dealer could kill at least 8 time faster,and there a lot of place where you don't lack mob(or more difficult)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Soloing you'd be killing much slower on much easier mobs that would be giving less xp.  So you'd be hard pressed to convince me that there is a place a soloer could ever get better xp than a group.<br />
<br />
Okay okay okay I admit a bard pulling all of HoH and gaining 7AA per pull this is true they would get better xp than a group.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Apothian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I recently started a Beastlord on test with 2 friends and as for the exp bonus, bogus BS.  We TRIED to fill the group takign any class we could.  The next day we wouldnt let anyone group with us.  I lvl'd  twice as fast without full group.  In fact i didnt notice a difference at all.  In fact i incourage all to start a toon on test, the population is pathetic which makes for interesting fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Calculations look about right (assuming those numbers), but as mentioned, the real bonus is in the kill rate.<br />
<br />
Before this patch, it was more like:  10 pts for soloing, 2 for a full group.  So that full group had to kill 5 times as many mobs to beat a soloer.  As for PoP mobs, I find it often takes me 5-6 minutes to kill a mob, and most groups can kill a mob a minute.  So it was about even.  But then you factor in deaths, afk's, LD's from the whole party, and their rate over an hour is lower than yours going steady (you have full control over yourself, except maybe LD).<br />
<br />
Now groups only need to kill 3x as fast.  They can probably still kill 5-6x faster than you, so they're going to be getting around 16 pts for your 10.  Take into account ld's, afk's, deaths, etc, and they're probably down to 12-13, which still beats your rate.<br />
<br />
That's the aim of this patch, to make the amount of exp gained by a group out-do that of a single person, due to the rate at which they can kill mobs.<br />
<br />
<br />
And the exp nerf doesn't come into these calculations at all, all PoP mobs are giving less exp, it doesnt matter how many people kill them.  It can be assumed that his hypothetical numbers are post-patch, maybe the mob gave 13 exp before Wednesday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A mob a minute?  that's a little slow.  I hit the mob with a slow and put the Puppies O Powa on him, and they're always up, before he's dead.  I'd say 45 secs per mob (once pulled) was a better gauge, for my guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bolthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Not a math wiz here, but wouldn't it look something like this?<br />
<br />
((EXP*BONUS PERCENTAGE)+EXP/NUMBER OF GROUP MEMBERS) = exp per group member.<br />
<br />
<br />
Solo exp given when killed=1000	<br />
<br />
2 group members = ((1000*20%)+1000/2) = 700 exp per group member<br />
<br />
3 group members =	 ((1000*40%)+1000/3) =733 exp per group member<br />
<br />
4 group members =	 ((1000*60%)+1000/4) = 850 exp per group member<br />
<br />
5 group members =	 ((1000*80%)+1000/5) = 1000 exp per group member<br />
	<br />
6 group members =	 ((1000*80%)+1000/5) = 1000 exp per group member</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Skeeter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Can't speak to the math...<br />
<br />
But I play on Test (yeah, that place with the pathetic population) -- have 3 characters over 60 and 3 more over 50 between my wife and I.  We've noticed a definite increase in experience with full groups -- between the exp modifier change and the lowering of dark blue mobs it's much easier to find a good hunting spot.  Ssra mines are now good experience, as are FG bugs (been spending a lot of time helping new guildmembers and such get their VT key).  POS still seemed great experience with 6 -- didn't try any solo or small groups to see just how much the experience was 'nerfed' if at all.  Though the folks that normally solo haven't been complaining much...<br />
<br />
Can't speak for everyone, but we see this as a great change. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Like any of that matters. I am just glad the bonuses are being extended for grouping.  Know why?  Cuz I can't even ****ing log in without getting 14 tells for groups.  If i go anonymous, I'll only get pathetic pleas from guildmates, and those are the freakin worst.  If I'm not doing anything special . . like soloing . . . I'll get guilt tripped into grouping.  So I never end up soloing anyway unless it's a VERY odd hour of the night.  Thus, making grouping more advantageous for me will help me directly, since I seem to always group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dasgood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Talk about useless ramblings .. please read on =)<br />
<br />
OK so where does it all end?  Once this goes in and all the rangers find groups ... 2 weeks later everyone will be 65=)  then you start working AA if you have been smart enough to hold off on AA's till after 65 well beside run3 ... 1000AA's later at the dope exp rate ... we should all be 65 and 1000AA'a in a month or so right? (well except for the soloers who are still on the old exp scale)<br />
<br />
end game coming soon =)<br />
<br />
*VI says to itself ... how can we get people to quit EQ and play SW and EQ2?  ... well if we give them all a sense of accomplishment they will move on!  So lets reverse the last 4 years and make exp flow out the yin-yang!  Its the least we can do for coming up with hell lvls!*<br />
<br />
Hey I just thought about this ... The only thing thats going to change is that people who group will get as much (pretty much) as people who currently solo ... and from what I read above about kill rate, if true people who group will be like the soloers before the patch!  Hey that class-sorta-balancing whats going on with VI!<br />
<br />
So I guess their &quot;nerfing&quot; solo types ... The question remains do people solo because they can, because they dont play 10 hours a day, or because they dont like other ether-people?  I would think that nerfing the type that do it just because they can ... well according to VI - EQ is a grouping game! is ok .. but it also hurts those other people who dont group because they cant.  I only play about 2 hours a night and I would fee bad about only staying for 2 hours (I always thought at least 3 hours is a minimum for helping a group).  OH WAIT the exp is kick ass now so even an hour of play time is like 3 after the patch =) (well ratio is not based on anything scientific)  <br />
<br />
My brain hurts ... oh wait it hurt before I wrote this ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
What's wrong with this?  SOE (VI was out of the picture long ago) doesn't want you to quit EQ.  They've got a new expansion for you to pay for and they want your monthly subscription, even if you don't play the game.  Either that, or they want you to buy their 'total access' subscription.  The end of EQ means a loss of revenue, and EQ won't start losing money due to server and GM salary costs for a LONG WHILE.  EQ's gonna be here for months and months to come.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dasgood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Agree .. but seriously it seems like most people in the same groups the day before the patch .. I got 3 blues tonigbht vs the day after the patch .. I got 2 yellows ... I wish I knew how to count like a big boy to figure out what the gain will be, but it seems that in some cases player A in a 5 or 6 person group will get 60%+ per kill vs the night before.  it jsut seems that if you dont group your gimping yourself AND lets say that you can normally get 20% a night depending on how long you play for ... I would imagin that you should be able to get double if not better than that per night .. is this way off base?  <br />
<br />
sorry if I sound stupid .. liberal arts degree only gets you so far =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shaben</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Not a math wiz here, but wouldn't it look something like this?<br />
<br />
((EXP*BONUS PERCENTAGE)+EXP/NUMBER OF GROUP MEMBERS) = exp per group member.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think that's right. I read it as<br />
(((EXP*BONUS PERCENTAGE)+EXP)/NUMBER OF GROUP MEMBERS) = exp per group member.<br />
<br />
This means that in a group of 5 the total experience is divided by 5 then distributed to each member. A group of 6 will also only have the total experience divided by 5 before it is distributed to each member.<br />
<br />
Solo exp given when killed=1000	<br />
<br />
2 group members = (((1000*20%)+1000)/2) = 600 exp per group member<br />
<br />
3 group members =	 (((1000*40%)+1000)/3) =467 exp per group member<br />
<br />
4 group members =	 (((1000*60%)+1000)/4) =  400 exp per group member<br />
<br />
5 group members =	 (((1000*80%)+1000)/5) = 360 exp per group member<br />
	<br />
6 group members =	 (((1000*80%)+1000)/5) = 360 exp per group member<br />
<br />
<br />
Which is what Akbear said<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bolthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">ahhhh, I was thinking that the bonus would be added in after the exp was divided by the number of players.<br />
<br />
Would be nice if the calculation did work that way.  :D</div></div><hr />
