<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With the first epic there was not a massive gap between high-end raid players and the rest of the population so it was pretty easy to throw together a quest that everyone could chip away at and eventually finish with a few friends helping out (not talking about the faction method here).  Most of us picked up a SoF at some point, and it was not an easy bit of gear to replace for several expansions.  <br />
<br />
The epic 2.0 is &quot;designed for people at the upper end of the LEVEL (65-70??) spectrum&quot; and comprised of &quot;a combination of solo, group, and raid content&quot;, but the real difficulty lies in making an epic that is worthwhile to hardcore raiders and not an impossible quest for more casual players.  How do you eclipse a weapon like the TA (Time's Antithesis) and yet not hand out too weighty a reward to Joe Casual?<br />
<br />
I scraped together a few ideas and this is what I came up with:<br />
<br />
1.  Epic 2.0 needs to be multi-slot.  This might be just primary and range, but more slots = more utility and tends to keep items from being replaced easily.  I probably would have kept my first spear around longer if it was able to be thrown in range.<br />
<br />
2.  Epic 2.0 needs to be improvable by several means with the same ultimate result.  Through raid flags, LDoN points, and/or mini-quests (ala iksar cudgel) perhaps.  This gives everyone an option and maybe weighting content differently would allow the epic to keep pace with raiders and still keep other players happy.  While raiders may arrive at the final result quicker, other players can rest assured that they too will get there some day.<br />
<br />
3.  Epic 2.0 needs a novel effect(s).  Anything from a badass buff to a DoT O' Death or supa-slow mod that we won't have access to in any other form.  This gives the epic more utility and possibly makes it worth getting just for the effect if nothing else.<br />
<br />
I almost threw some sort of slow spell on as a &quot;needed&quot; item, but if the epic is able to be tossed in range, that really ain't necessary.<br />
<br />
Yes my line of thought may be a bit myopic, but does anyone have some useful input? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hang on to that dream pal.  Epic 2.0 will either be unobtainable by the masses, or useless to the Ubahs.  The gap between casual gear and raid gear isn't getting any smaller, therefore making both type of players happy is next to impossible.  And lets not kid ourselves, SOE can't fix the easy things, let alone tackle a tough task like making the Epic 2.0 uselful for everybody.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When Epic 1.0 came out, it WAS a raid level item. You dindt get up into Kurn Tower in the Hole with one group. You certainly dindt clear Reavers and take our Nah and Rak Ashiir in CoM. This was a high end, raid item. Now, its a no brainer, 3 guys, &quot;heck Necros solo Reavers and Rak now&quot; quest. <br />
<br />
All of EQ is like this. Its called &quot;mudflation&quot;. If Epic 1.0 didnt make you quit because you werent in an Upper Level guild, why should Epic 2.0 make you quit?<br />
<br />
I will tell you why, in 5 simple words. Learn em, live em, be the ball. Ready?<br />
<br />
Todays EQ players are SPOILED!<br />

Need further clarification? Read any &quot;Raider vs Casual&quot; thread. It boils down to one thing. Every player feels like he &quot;deserves&quot; every single piece of gear in the game. Period. <br />
<br />
Don't get me started. I got enough negative reps from this now, but I WON'T back off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, once they changed Rak the epic 1.0 became a raid level item.  <br />
<br />
Before that, there were public raids into Fear at the time and you could get enough Child's Tears out of a single raid to make rain.  The Hole portion was posted multiple times as doable by single groups with maps/invis etc.  Oddly enough, the first epic completion was a feat of err..faction.  Rak even cried at the end and the quest actually made sense. :p<br />
<br />
It would just be the same old lazy BS to toss the epic 2.0 into Tacvi for the 10 people who had not yet quit EQ at that point with flashy ads saying &quot;Everyone will enjoy it!!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Give everyman a shot and make it fun.  Remember how cool it was to log back and forth checking the boards while the entire community tried to figure the first epic out?  Bring that back to EQ, don't just lump stuff into a hole where next to nobody will go.</div></div><hr />

You are completely full of (grrrrr) Blazz.  Most players feel the &quot;deserve&quot; equipment comparable to the time they have invested into the game.  There are always asses that think way above their ability, but don't sterotype them into the general casual playing public.<br />
<br />
Todays players aren't as spoiled as they are lazy.  Sure, an FBSS can be had by just about anyone, but eventually most people will have access to EP gear too.  It is called evolution.  As the game progresses, old content is easier and easier to get.  How can you blame players for this?<br />
<br />
Epic 2.0 will either be obtainable by most, or just the Ubahs.  I'm guessing that since OoW is pretty much the second part of GoD, that the Epic will be for the Ubahs in the beginning.  Sound familiar?!?!  Anyone?!?!  Guess what, 2 years from now the Average Joe will probably be wielding the Epic 2.0 and the only explanation is evolution of the game.  Deal with it already and quit blaming players for changes in the game!!!<br />

Actually it will probalby be less, but thats my whole point. Is the fact that not every single player able to complete the 2.0 quest in the first month its out a problem? <br />
<br />
It is for some, trust me.<br />
<br />
You seem to think I am upset because the current EPic is so easy to get. I am not. Not one bit. I LIKE the way this game evolves. Eventually, nearly everyone who puts in effort gets rewarded in some fashion.<br />
<br />
Not getting into it, I have said what I have to say, thats how I feel. Sorry if you dont agree. Different play styles yield differing levels of gear. If you make a conscious choice not to raid, or just simply do not have the time (although, many many guilds raid only a couple times for a few hours a week, we arent ALL 10+ hour a day people you know) then you won't see some of the gear. I didnt create the system, I simply play within it.</div></div><hr />

You are seriously deluded if you think casual players will be around in 2 years now that viable competition is on the horizon.  The only question is when SOE discovers the &quot;secret&quot; that the mass market trumps the niche market 100% of the time, 24/7/365, in a capitalist society.  When SOE learns this salient fact I expect a dose of &quot;too little, too late&quot; open content.  <br />
<br />
You'd think Sony's electronics marketing division would speak to their other divisions, but apparently not.  I didn't have to join a raid guild to buy my Sony TVs, DVD players and portable radio, but what do I know, I'm just a customer (for now). :)</div></div><hr />

My butt still hurts from the screwing I got from GoD. If SoE thinks I'm buying another expansion, they can think again.<br />
<br />
I blatently admit I'm treading water til WoW.<br />
<br />
Epic 2.0 sure isn't going to make me stay. Level 70 isn't going to make me stay. Maybe listening to some FEEDBACK from the hoards of people screaming *might* make me stay.<br />
<br />
I've been EQ since six weeks after it went live, with three accounts for most of that. And within a day of WoW being release, buh bye. <br />
<br />
I don't mind mudflation. I don't mind Rak being a one group mob, whereas 30 of us used to have to go after him. I even don't mind them opening up the planes based on level instead of accomplishment. But after the treatment of my class for the last three expansions, sorry, I lose means you lose.<br />
<br />
Is the grass greener? Maybe, maybe not. But I'm sure going to find out.<br />

I give up, you guys are right.  EQ will die when WoW comes out, and even if it doesn't, there won't be any casual gamers in EQ.  EQ isn't the best game on the market and they have no chance of retaining at least 70% of their player base when WoW comes out.<br />

<br />
I used to play  The Realm . Couldn't IMAGINE leaving that game. (My first MMORPG). Had a buddy who tried EQ and ranted and raved. So I bought it (Kunark) loaded and logged in. <br />
<br />
Completely blown away. Couldn't sleep. (Luckily was on vacation). Said &quot;Cya&quot; to  The Realm  within the same week.  EQ was that much better - not visually (I don't care about graphics), but as a game. <br />
<br />
* IF * W.O.W. comes out and is a mind-blowingly superior game - the exodus of people from EQ will make the &quot;rats and sinking ship&quot; analogy look like a singular walk on the boardwalk.<br />
<br />
Friends are all that is holding many people to EQ. Five years is a hell of a run. And even if EQ isn't financially viable for Sony - somebody will pick up the license I am sure. Hey, no new updates, no patches, but who cares? Maybe they'll undo the Sleeper fiasco so I can get one of them Shrouds. <br />

Heck, maybe to help cover costs - they'll SELL items.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Faern, how ironic would it be if IGE bought the rights? :)<br />
<br />
Oh, and on topic ....<br />
Epic 2.0's should mirror the old epics.  Long storylines involving some camps, some running about and trying to answer riddles, and at least one good 2+ group raid (one that can't be fudged with 1 enchanter pet preferrably).  It should yield an item with slightly lower than PoTime stats - 170-180hp's range perhaps, but with an effect that is useful enough that the post Time high end folks will still want one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
uh, you'd be surprised how segregated Sony's Entertainment division and technology/manufacturing are.  for one thing sony's entertainment (music, vids, movies) are run out of LA and NYC almost exclusively by Jews (not stereotyping here... in his biography Aiko Morita Sony's founder specifically admits he told his men to hire jews over other americans...) and manufacturing is run out of tokyo by little japanese men.  manufacturing is home grown in japan, entertainment are all American aquisitions from Columbia etc<br />
<br />
about the epic, there's ZERO chance that it wont be uber content at outset.  *** wouldn't it be when by very definition it's the best item in the game<br />
<br />
if soe was smart they'd make the epic slot specific per class both for class efficacy and for MUDflation.  any weapons are going to be obsolete in one expansion MAX (even if they aim the epic at the higher end of the uber scale).  obviously for a paladin the epic must be a sword.  likewise it makes sense that the wiz epic is a primary wand.  but for bards why not make it a lute slung over the back slot or a songbird mask that fits over the face to mimic any instrument.  let the shm epic be a totem that summons a superior pet or allow superior bear form with passive mana regen and actual, viable ATK benefits.  SK's been bitching nonstop about mitigation why not give em a uber BP with mitigation bonuses.  BP, back slot etc are much less suseptible to MUDflation and gives sony a free ticket to address some of the issues each class has been bitching about</div></div><hr />

I like this idea of the epic getting better with more flags/keys/trials you have. It makes it worth getting for the end-game, and the casual, imo. If the stats get better, maybe the effect even. ...If that isn't too hard for them to program... Although, this is sounding like Intricate Wooden Figurine 2.0... =P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh Iz, I think we should do a search for threads and find out how SOE handled the other &quot;serious competition&quot; so far, you know, DAoC, AO, even SOE games like SWG . . .<br />
<br />
They took some of the nicer ideas from those games, incorporated them into EQ, and as a result, EQ is stronger. <br />
<br />
Diablo 2 is &quot;for the masses&quot;. Quickie quick. Lots of fun. Shooting Star to the Extreme. Heck, I gave up EQ for 2 months solid when D2 hit, then another month when the expansion for it came out. <br />
<br />
So far, EQ has 100% dominated ALL comers. I really don't expect anything different with the release of OoW either. CoH has some folks now. WoW will take a bunch for a while. Whole &quot;uber&quot;guilds left for DAoC you know. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Only thing what is keeping me in EQ (I am here since beta 2) are FRIENDS, who still play. I don't even log on, when friends are not on. Whatever SOE does, it doesn't matter to me anymore, as in most cases they totally blow into wrong direction with their updates and expansions, requiring people to WORK in a GAME. By &quot;work&quot; I mean the tedious week long camps, mupltiple hour 'events' and so on. And if you don't have those &quot;8 hours per day&quot; for the game, then you're screwed and don't see even half the stuff. Bah. As far as I am concerned, there should NOT be any content or anything in the game, which requires more then 4 groups just to get through it, so so, as a maximum. Heck, 4 would be absolute maximum... <br />
<br />
Anyways, if my friends would leave EQ at some day, I would not hesitate to leave right away as well. Or, if WoW comes out, and I try it, and see that it's indeed good, I'll get my friends to come with me. I haven't seen anything being released in EQ, which I could call &quot;fun&quot; instead of &quot;annoyance&quot;, as it is now, and the new expansion with yet another XP/AA XP grind, spell camps, epic weapon camps and &quot;must have 100 people and be Time enabled and be through GoD&quot; kinda events and requirements only push me, personally, further. I seriously doubt that this new expansion makes the game more fun, from the available information at the moment, it will only introduce yet additional grinding-camping, etc.<br />
<br />
Hope is that EQ2 maybe is different, but, since the same team makes it, can't really bet on it  yet.</div></div><hr />

I think Blizzard will be the first serious competitor to challenge SOE on the real issue- the time invested in people's existing characters.  Blizzard's track record on releasing great games that break sales records repeatedly is unparalleled- I think that is a good sign that they know how to make good games.<br />
<br />
Personally whether or not we bail on EQ the day WoW is released or a few months after really depends on the feedback from people playing the live version of WoW.  I do know that things like the shard camp for the cleric epic in EQ are NOT fun (170 mobs so far, no shards) and if WoW removes more of this useless, timesink brutality that will be enough for me.<br />
<br />
Edit: Fixing LDoN (see other thread), releasing LDoN 2.0 (since Kunark 2.0 won't happen) and opening flagged content would go a long way towards keeping us post-WoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Armak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">First of all, we all know that EQ been dead for 2 years, at least that what i have heard here. Every time it comes a new game - EQ dead.<br />
<br />
We im guessing not even WoW will kill EQ, not fast atleast. EQ will die by EQ, is my guess. When EQ becomes too easy or too hard, people will stop playing.<br />
<br />
As for WoW not having time sinks.....*** do you think made EQ live so long as it have? Ill tell you &quot;Time sinks&quot;.<br />
<br />
Time sinks that you beat makes you feel good(like problem solving). You did something hard and you won, thats what brings us back. Time after annother we scream &quot;I hate EQs damn useless time sink&quot; and the next second we turn around and &quot;brag&quot; about some obscure mob we manage to track down and kill after hours of &quot;wasted&quot; time.<br />
<br />
If WoW dont have any time sinks, it will die fast. Thats how it is. If the time sink is a long camp or a raid encounter that is hard to beat, it doesnt matter, that and friends is what brings us back to the game. <br />
<br />
If i just could go into EQ go to a shoper and ask for the best equipment in the game. and then start playing, what fun would that be. I quite the game in a few days. No challange = no fun.</div></div><hr />

The only challenge mindless timesinks like the shard camp in SF provide is staying awake.  There's nothing wrong with timesinks per se as long as they provide fun and entertainment while you do them.  EQ has way too many timesinks that are not fun and do not provide a real sense of accomplishment like beating a challenge.  Beating the king in chardok w/ my bazaar crew was fun and a challenge- camping the shards in SF is not a challenge and is not fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The difference of course being that the definition of &quot;raid&quot; has changed - when I got my spear of fate, I think the most I had was four or five groups, for the Hole, and that was considered a pretty big raid.  The main tank was wearing a mix of crafted and some indicolite, maybe cobalt gauntlets, using a wurmslayer and the sword off Renux from the rogue epic, and that was considered a pretty good setup.<br />
<br />
If Epic 2.0 can be done with five groups of bazaar / LDoN geared players, it won't be much of a challenge to Time types, but it will be scaled roughly to the same level of difficulty that the first epics had.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bamn! - that's the point.   Epic 2.0 should be something that &quot;At its rollout&quot; is at the top of its type of gear for the class.   Pretty Graphic's aren't the only issue - ie cat head, dog head, or even Absor's head on a stick.  <br />
<br />
My suggestion on this that Epic 2.0 has crazy stats, 3 slots, two effects - Damage/Slow combo spell on it, AND charm effects working like the 'Intricate Wooden Figurine'.    <br />
<br />
Then as others have stated, as one quests/raids/etc ... the effect on it increases in nature related to the effort.   If Devs are really stuck on making this look like a cat head ... make the fangs grow longer everytime you do something Ubar.   Then Ego's will have real check on the length - /wink</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">There's a very simple solution... They've had it since Kunark, reused it during velious, and had at least one similar quest in the game for every expansion since.... <br />

Progressive quests. The iksar class weapon quests were great for that. you could start them at level 5 and keep upgrading them untill you hit 60. I still have my shaman cudgel on me at all times and it was a great quest to do.<br />
<br />
Dain ring, same thing. you could start it one group and work your way, upgrading it till the 10th ring that required a uberraid (waaay back then) <br />
<br />
Prayer shawl, same as dain ring. <br />

Plenty more of those in Pop. <br />
<br />
The breakdown in communications quest in God seems to work along those lines as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
What do all these items have in common ? Casual players can complete the stages till they reach a certain point which yields good rewards. (how many people have 8th dain ring ?). And Raid or hadcore players can take it to the final step and upgrade it to something that will benefit them at the stage they've reached in the game. No one is truly left out.  <br />
<br />
Of course, once again, the measure by which this epic will be rated is the TA. But I'm hoping that the devs realise this already.<br />
<br />
PS : Gaining EQ items is a bit like shopping in a sense.... the fact you can't afford something doesn't necessarily mean the item is overpriced... it just means you can't afford it. You have a choice of working harder towards your goal or accepting the reality that the item is out of your reach at the present time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">We im guessing not even WoW will kill EQ, not fast atleast. EQ will die by EQ, is my guess. When EQ becomes too easy or too hard, people will stop playing.<br />
<br />
<br />
The really amazing thing is, people will stop playing both because its too easy and too hard all at once.  The stratification is simply amazing at this point, and something I hope other games manage to avoid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">The difference of course being that the definition of &quot;raid&quot; has changed - when I got my spear of fate, I think the most I had was four or five groups, for the Hole, and that was considered a pretty big raid.  The main tank was wearing a mix of crafted and some indicolite, maybe cobalt gauntlets, using a wurmslayer and the sword off Renux from the rogue epic, and that was considered a pretty good setup.<br />
<br />
If Epic 2.0 can be done with five groups of bazaar / LDoN geared players, it won't be much of a challenge to Time types, but it will be scaled roughly to the same level of difficulty that the first epics had.<br />
<br />
     Figured I would jump in on this thread, and I have to agree with Blazz.  When the Spear of Fate came out it was a &quot;raid&quot; level item.  Your tank that you mentioned would be hard set to find any gear better at the time than what was mentioned.  I didn't see epic'ed players around &quot;commonly&quot; until late Velious- mid Luclin.  Epic 2.0 is going to be a raid level item, and it is going to be a damn good item.  When the first epics came out they were well ahead of any other weapon out there.  Shamans just happened to luck out with our epic being easier to complete than say... the Necro, Shadowknight, Ranger, Magician, Enchanter, Warrior....the list goes on.  <br />
     Raids are a part of the game design, just like xp grinding, farming, and tedious camps.  There are people in the game that will hate each and every one of those aspects of the game.  Raids have evolved to be a &quot;challenge&quot; to the raiding populous, whether it be by insane aoe's, zerging adds, or just annoying scripts.  Sometimes SOE listens and changes the content, but must is left the way it is.  Some of the content is lousy- I won't deny that, but for those that continue to complain after devs say &quot;Its working as intended&quot; is like the irrate customer that still shops at the store that stiffed him.  If SOE were to come out tomorrow and hand everyone a 65 maxxed aa shaman with the best gear in the game- everyone would quit because there is nothing to do.<br />
     Some people have gone to CoH and others will to WoW when it comes out.  Good luck, I hope you find what you are looking for, but just like I know SOE will fubar a patch/expansion/login I also know that for every 10 people that leave for another game- about 8 come back.  WoW sounds great, but Blizzard hasn't cared too much about hacking in the past and that will kill WoW faster than any bad patch/lousy customer service ever will.  SOE is already releasing info on what EQ2 is going to be like- a game for the &quot;casual&quot; player.  It sucks, it combines everyone annoying nerf I have ever seen in EQ1 to stop &quot;twinking&quot;, and promote friendly gaming.  From what I have read with &quot;item breaks, trivial loot code, soloing nerfs, class mudflation&quot; it sounds like its going to be dull and annoying.  They have already said that they are going to combat kiting and farming with a new aggro system and the trivial loot code, so it sounds like soloing isn't going to be common and you like everyone else will have approximately the same amount of cash on hand as everyone else- not to mention if you do try to sell items, the game is going to receive a cut of the sale.  For me, my money is going to EQ.  I don't want to play a superhero, so instead of buying the game, logging in, and trolling the boards with &quot;Why do I have to play a superhero?&quot; I just..... don't play the game.  Everquest is filled with mudflation and we already voiced our opinion on the shaman class to the devs.  Our job is done- the ball is in their court.  If they foul it up- then we can either leave the game, or keep playing and stop complaining.  As far as the uber loot goes,  raiding is an aspect of the game- one you can choose to either do or pass on.   Complaining about it makes as much sense as someone complaining about wanting to ding 65, but doesn't want to xp to get it.  Everquest is a timesink, it has been since day one- nothing has changed and the game is five years old.</div></div><hr />

LMAO!  And the bastards even have daily mandatory attendance! 8-10 hour raids 5 days a week w/ Saturday and Sunday for soloing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">My suggestion on this that Epic 2.0 has crazy stats, 3 slots, two effects - Damage/Slow combo spell on it, AND charm effects working like the 'Intricate Wooden Figurine'.    <br />
<br />
Then as others have stated, as one quests/raids/etc ... the effect on it increases in nature related to the effort.<br />
<br />
This sounds like it has some SERIOUS potential. Perhaps the Epics will be LDoN types of &quot;Aug slotted&quot; items. The first, un-auged one is VERY good, darn close, if not better, than every current epic (maybe its almost identical in stats, with a small bonus like +50/50 mana/hp), but fairly simple to get (NOTE: I mean relatively, based on your gear-level-guild, etc. Easy for Time+ guilds, moderate for EP guilds, doable by pre-EP guilds, and possible by Bazaar level folks who can muster up a few groups of friends).<br />
<br />
Then, as you complete the various advanced stages of the quest, be they raids or whatever, you are awarded the &quot;augs&quot; to stick in it. Each aug will increase the power of the Epic accordingly. <br />
<br />
Wow, talk about timesinks that have HUGE potential for actual fun. I can see it now, &quot;Ok Monday we do the Clerics Epic Raids, for the Healing Adept 4 aug, Tuesday we do Warriors, and get them the Anger 4 aug, then on Thursday we do Shaman and get them the &quot;give your whole raid +100 all stats aug&quot;. Next week, we get the Stage 2 Augs for everyone. <br />
<br />
It actually does sound like a blast. Make other augs available for those slots for the more casual players, too. This could be a solution that would appease both the raider and non-raider alike.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, what they should do is invent another slot for the Epic. Then, when it turns out to be too hard, give everyone an uber one that you get by hailing a Dorf in PoK . . .<br />
<br />
. . .hold it, they pulled this one already. Don't mind me, still bitter about all the time I invested in REAL charms before they decided to pass em out like candy with better stats after 2 flags than every single other charm in the game.</div></div><hr />

The Epic should be a high level item obtainable by anyone with, at most, one group of help.<br />
<br />
Make it difficult.  Create an instanced zone that *must* be soloed by the player in a couple parts.  I'm all for it.<br />
<br />
However, giving even &quot;low&quot; (read:  Bazaar/LDON geared) players *one* piece of equipment available that is absolutely awesome will *not* unbalance the game.  It won't make those players equivalent to raiders.  It will however give those players a tremendous feeling of accomplishment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">The real problem with Epic 2.0 is - it has to be VERY uber to make it worth the while to quest it - at least better then the TA, and then some (to last more then one expansion).  So it has to require either incredibly rare spawns (what appeals to the &quot;casual&quot; gamer) or incredibly tough mobs (what would be good for the raider).  If they are clever they require &quot;ether/or&quot;.  Bring me 10 journey boots or the head of quarm.  One guy camps the ancient cyclops for 3 month, the other spends 3 month on the progression.<br />

I also think possession of your first Epic should incur some sort of bonus. You can choose to go back and do Epic 1.0 or not, but for those that have been playing longer, just a little &quot;bennie.&quot;<br />

     I am really not trying to flame you on this one, but they already have an &quot;Epic 2.0&quot; weapon that lvl 60's can acquire- its called Epic 1.0.  At level 60, I would be willing to bet that your epic is one of your best pieces of gear- there are not too many upgrades outside of NToV and up that you would switch too.  As far as what I expect Epic 2.0 to be... its going to be a combination of long boring camps/raids/group/grabbing 10 items spread out over 8 continents.  Now, in the past Verant has added a few nifty items you get along the way.  When epic 1.0 came out we had a nifty shield/insta sow boots.  Druids had a lesser form of their epic.  We will probably see something like that for the Epic 2.0, but the quest is going to be long and HARD.  It really defeats the point of having your epic weapon if everyone is walking around with the same thing.  There is also no point in having an epic weapon if you upgrade it to something else later on in the expansion.  Getting your epic 2.0 will be considered an accomplishment by yourself and everyone else similar to today's shamans that post about getting their TA- it is an &quot;Epic&quot; journey that your character will take, and when it comes out will probably be reserved to 10% of the populous that have the resources to complete it.</div></div><hr />

Excuse me, but in a game with: Initial Release, Kunark, Velious, Luclin, PoP, Ykesha, LDoN, GoD, and now OoW, - that's main plus 8 expansions - why do you seem to be complaining that you need to hit expansion 3 or higher to get a better weapon that what is available in expansion number 2?</div></div><hr />

What someone else has in no way diminishes what I have. That elitist attitude is one of the biggest problems with EQ. That also doesn't mean it should be given upon character creation like the rogue epic. (/rude Kendrick)</div></div><hr />

Yes you're right about the current one being like a level 60  version, but my overall point was that it would be nice if the epic were a series of weapons from low level to high like how the Iksar quests are.  That you have to complete in sequence, with of course the final version being very hard to get.  I'm not sure why you say there is no point to this kind of quest, most of the Iksars I've known love this series of quests and find them very satisfying and it will not result in the level 70 version being common at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Samanna, I am not complaining about getting a better weapon- I am pointing out that Epic 1.0 is still a nice weapon to have and many people do not upgrade it until they hit Vex Thal/Elementals.  My point was in reference to Gunderson's post which later on in the thread he agreed with me.<br />

<br />
It's possible that they might do a progressive quest- they did it with the BiC quest for GoD, or they may just work it like the old epics where you get side rewards along the way (shield/sow boots.)  You will probably even be able to knock out half the quest without needing a raid. (most of the first epic's &quot;raid&quot; content was towards the end of the epic quest.)<br />
As far as not wanting to drag 50 of your friends along, EQ is 5 years old- since the initial release raids were required to get the &quot;present&quot; top end items.  Epic 2.0 will be a &quot;top-end&quot; item. There is nothing elitest about it- its a game design just like the mindless hours you grind for xp.  Epic 2.0 at release will be reserved to the top 5-10% of each server- those that, upon release, will have the neccessary time/resources to complete the quest.  There will probably also be some class envy with certain classes having an easier time getting their epics than others. (how many necros you see running around with their Epic 1.0?)  After the release of a few more expansions, Epic 2.0 will become easier to get and you will see more players completing theirs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Any raid content will be a huge issue within the next 6 months . . . once EQ 2 is released you'll see server populations cut in half.  If not more.<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter if EQ is a superior game (I'm not saying it is or it isn't, I don't know) but simply that people always crave &quot;new&quot; and &quot;different&quot;.<br />
<br />
Tribes was a game clearly superior to it's sequal Tribes 2 . . . yet almost 2/3 of the players dropped Tribes for Tribes 2 at it's release.<br />
<br />
That is the way it is.  The only hope for sustained raiding is the reverse of what happened when they split servers back in the early days of EQ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tend to disagree with this statement. While players may THINK they crave new and different, once they actually get there, they discover its REALLY no better than their old and boring EQ character after a while, except your new guy is usually significantly less powerful. <br />
<br />
Either that, or the &quot;new and different&quot; content gets blown through and maxxed so fast it becomes boring, like Diablo 2. <br />
<br />
Lots and lots of people leave EQ for other games at one point or another. In fact, I am willing to bet EVERYONE who has played more than 2 years has TRIED something &quot;new and different&quot;. However, a large percentage come back to EQ, for whatever reason. <br />
<br />
WoW and EQ2 are supposedly designed with the casual player more in mind than the hardcore. Thats all fine, but no matter what you do, there are GOING to be hardcore players. Look at Lineage II. Already the &quot;plat&quot; shops are turning out cash in HUGE numbers. I said it before and I will say it again, MMORPGS are solved. <br />
<br />
Play what you like. Have fun playing whatever you play. But before you bury EQ with games like EQ2 and WOW, lets get those games on the market and live for 6 months or more, then see. I am betting things like Level 70 and Epic 2.0 are going to bring a LOT of folks back to EQ after they test those waters. Even those who have &quot;quit forever, for the 100th time&quot;.</div></div><hr />
