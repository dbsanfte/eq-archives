<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I tried to reply to the other Ogre stun thread, but could not...so I thought Id start a new one to have this question Ive had for awhile answered for me and the community<br />
<br />
For the sake of debate...Id like to have one thing made clear to me.....<br />
<br />
As far as Ive always known there is a difference between being stunned and interrupted....as such, because ogres are immune to frontal stuns dose not necessarily mean they are immune to interrupts?<br />
<br />
 Ive never found myself stunned for more than a few seconds from melee combat in 3+ years so far...so if my understanding is correct, then being immune to stuns is kind of over-rated IMO.<br />
Thats just my opinion though so Im not trying to start a heated debate about it ;) just trying to figure out if it is that outstanding of an ability.....<br />
<br />
I ask this question very repsectfuly and any insight would be appreciated :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ogres cannot be stunned from the front. All this means is a mob cannot interrupt a spell via bash/kick. They still have to have a successful Channelling check if they get hit by melee, like anyone else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree with you 100%.  I am a barbarian and I almost NEVER get stunned.  When I get bashed, it will very very rarely stun me, and only sometimes interrupts.  The only time I really get stunned is when I am running away from something and it is hitting me in the back - in situations like this, ogres are just as vulnerable as the rest of us.<br />
<br />
The way I understand it, ogres are like giants.  They are unstunnable (at least from the front), but stun effects will still interrupt their casting, thus making the racial ability very very overrated for shamans.  If you were a warrior maintanking an uber mob, this would be a handy ability.  Getting stunned could mean losing aggro and thus losing the fight.  For a shaman, though, I don't think it is that big of a deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Graal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ogres are immune to stun from the front.  Ogre spell casting is not automatically interrupted when bashed from the front.  Ogres must still make channeling rolls to cast through damage and movement.  Ogres can still be stunned by attacks from the side and rear.<br />
<br />
The lesser races all deny the overall superiority of Ogres and their special ability.  All I know is that there is nothing more annoying than getting stunned when I have to play a weakling race character.  Its just not used to the sit and spin that I see barbies do all the time.<br />
<br />
I am,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I play a shaman and an sk, both ogres.  The shaman has been an ogre his whole life, but the sk was a troll for a long time.  He got rerolled as an ogre because, having played Flufy for so long, I found periodically losing control of my toon for several seconds (usually at the worst possible time) to be unbelievably frustrating.  <br />
<br />
     As a shaman, there have been numerous situations where I managed to get that wipeout-preventing slow off, or hit the tank/cleric/chanter with a heal just in time while getting beat on, but there's a more personal example that sticks out most in my head.  I was checking out CS, probably way before I had any business being there.  I wound up getting aggroed by a wyvrn, so I run to that tower thingy where the zone out is.  Apparently someone else had just had an aggro problem too, because I was going up the stairs, turned the corner, and ran into 5 wyvrns.  As they were beating on me, I backed into the corner and hit Gate, and made it with about 15 hp left.  Did I make my channeling roll?  Most definitely, but it is my firm belief, as they were red to me at the time, that I would have gotten stunned by at least one of them if I wasn't an ogre.  That would have meant a multi-hour CR, as this was back when you still needed keys to get TP'd there, and I didn't have one.<br />
<br />
     On a more mundane level, with no-stun, I can do certain things with a much higher level of comfort than I would be able to otherwise, like pulling, root-parking, and running my tail to the zone when things go bad.  Oh, and as far as it being irrelevant when you're running away goes, all I can say is, running backwards is not nearly as difficult as it might seem at first.  <br />
<br />
     It's been commented elsewhere that, pre-60, no-stun isn't that big of a deal compared to regen, ac bonuses, etc, but I have to disagree.  It's a big bonus even at the lowest levels, IF you play in such a way as to take advantage of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Smasherr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">/shrug.<br />
<br />
when running away from mobs i'm not vulnerable like the rest of shamans cuz i'm not stupid enough to turn around.  <br />
<br />
backing away allows me to never be stuned while fleeing.:)<br />
<br />
i partner with a lvl 60 barbie alot......we do notice that i tend to get less interupts.  <br />
<br />
<br />
a stun spell is a spell....if ya got low resists you get stunned...if you have high resists you don't.  <br />
<br />
in big raids...with mobs hitting 4-500+ every second matters.  you get stunned...then goodnight sweetheart.:)  <br />
but i guess that doesn't matter these days...with the price of coffins coming down and all.:)<br />
<br />
<br />
play a ogre SK/shammy/Bst (any caster ogre) to 60.<br />
play a non ogre caster type to 60.<br />
then let us know your findings.<br />
<br />
when playing my friends toons in raids  to cover for them when they can't make the raid i personally notice the stuns and interupts...but that is because i have never been subjected to being stunned or interupted by bashing.  i guess this ability is one that you only miss once you have experienced it first hand...not in theory and words.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've noticed that even if a MOB bashes or kicks a non-ogre caster, you still have the possibility of not being stunned.  My fave thing nowadays is to pull a mob with slow, run it back to pet, then casy EBolt and see if I can channel through when MOB gets to me and whacks me first thing.  Generally there is a bash or a kick in that first volley and I would say I have a roughly 50% channel rate even through a bash that connects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i'm glad i chose ogre. i'm originally an alt like you (the poster on the original thread), and with fungi+hp gear+jbb etc, levelling from 1-51 at least was pretty cake, a level or two a day in kunark outdoor zones. i either solo'd or duo'd with a melee partner, and frankly i found soloing to be the best (although it's boring).<br />
<br />
main thing is....getting stunned ticks me off, not just on my melee main, but particularly when you're casting spells. imo, ogres are the best at level 60, where the bonus of regen is pretty minimal, although trolls are very close. advantages are regen and snare necklace for example, two very nice things to have. i'd never consider a shaman race that couldn't use JBB, btw :P<br />
<br />
also, i like having alts that can bank in OT - it's an awesome, awesome xp zone from lvl 30-45 and you can get the OT hammer along with your spells easily when you hit 50+.<br />
<br />
the high starting stamina is nice too, free extra hp. low wis kinda sucks but i never have problems because my mana pool is too low when xp'ing. remember, if you're burning all your mana + more killing a mob for xp, you're fighting the wrong mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">FYI you can channel through a bash as a non Ogre. Stuns are a different matter....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Because there's only a chance to get stunned and only a chance to get an auto-interrupt on a bash.<br />
<br />
With an Ogre... there is no chance.<br />
<br />
It's true that you don't miss it until you've had it. For comparision sake my monk has been stunned almost 2000 times while my Shaman has been stunned 30 times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gloobonious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It's a lifesaver doing those long solo fights against tough mobs.<br />
<br />
When you engage in those 15 minute+ fights (LodizalYeldema, for example) having a 0% chance to be physically stunned from the front is a HUGE plus. Even then, I get a lot of spell interruptions... which is still better then being completely stunned.<br />
<br />
And yes, the epic is still a bitch to channel through, even when immune to being stunned in this fashion. Also, if you are hit while fleeing from the back, even a normal hit can stun an Ogre... and all races.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think its interesting...I haven't seen an Oger yet post that our 'no-stun' ability is overrated.  <br />
<br />
As stated in the other thread, it's a huge advantage.  It's the only racial advantage you can't buy or cast.<br />
<br />
<br />
low wis kinda sucks <br />
We have 3 WIS less than Barbarians, but 27 more STA.  I'll take that any day, and twice on Sunday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>oOga[FoH]</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">While no stun from the front really kicked ass in pre-Kunark, Kunark and Velious, it's pretty trivial now.. With the Channeling Focus AA ability, just about any race can channel through even the most serious rapings.. And thats fine, I'm not mad about it.. I always thought the entire race debate was silly and fruitless.. I made an ogre because I wanted to be an 8 foot tall fatass, not because of superior stats, good looks and no stun from the front.. :)<br />
<br />
Luclin leveled out the playing field and I think that's cool, now lets just add sucksars to JBB armor or give them an equivelant so they can stop bitching too!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gert Groinwounder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">sucksars =====&gt; ROFL!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Xalbus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I play an Ogre Shammy on a PvP server and I cant tell you how many times the no stun has saved my life from getting coined or greenie farmed. I continually channel gate through all but the most serious gang bangs. I was in a corner once (best place for an ogre to fight from ;) ) getting whacked on by a dorf pally and a barb warrior and they where doing there best to interrupt my gate spell (I was much lower than them at the time)  and I never quite put the pieces together until now. I have a 52 chanter on Terris Thule and he has a channeling level near 200 if not over and he is interrupted all the time. Ogre shammy very rarely. Usually takes a 54+ hp whack to do that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">&quot;We have 3 WIS less than Barbarians&quot;<br />
<br />
damn, I actually though it was more. I didn't mean that having low wis really sucked arse, just said it 'kinda sucked' heh. But you're right, it's pretty close to barb and only 13 less than iksar.<br />
<br />
btw Ooga, i think the main thing is not getting stunned, not just interruptions from bash/kick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Everything who thinks it's over-rated has never had it, period.  All the ogres agree that the skill rocks, and it does.  Everyone who's never experienced it tries to deduce from their experiences why it's a useless skill.  Don't knock it 'til you try it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">So far from lvl 1-37 I would not trade it for Troll regen and Barb faction combined.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Mez think da No Stun from da front is nice but it is also overated.<br />
<br />
Regen dat da Trollie and Iksar get is far nicer then No Stun and more generaly usefull.<br />
<br />
We ogres do get interuped from bash and kick and mele hits.<br />
<br />
Is no stun nice?  Yes...<br />
<br />
Torpor is also nice and reduces the relative advantage of regen over no stun.  Torpor is da great equilaizer in dat it makes all da shaman races significanlty more powerfull.<br />
<br />
Raid / Solo shaman  60 Torpor Orger da best.<br />
Group shaman 60 Torpor Trollie / Iksar da best.<br />
<br />
Mez play da Ogre because I love da model and our culture.<br />
<br />
The only reason dat people argue about this is becuase the differance is trivial.  If any one race was clearly da best then we would just all agree and 95% of ous would be playing da same race.<br />
