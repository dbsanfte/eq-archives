<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zerglin Rush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">what lvl should i aim my sights on getting these?<br />
and are they mid way part of epic? as in do i have to do serveral lil quests before i can gain these?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The boots are the mid-way reward for the epic quest.  You also pick up a decent shield pretty early on (and easily attainable at your level).<br />
<br />
Do you have a guild or a few friends?  At your level, you could probably pull this off with one good group, perhaps a bit more if your levels or equipment are on the lean side.  The final battle for this is in Mistmoore, where you must kill Black Dire.<br />
<br />
You can solo pull Black Dire to the zone and fight there.  Makes recovery easy, and allows you a relatively easy escape if it goes bad.  Just don't use the words to trigger Black Dire, simply tag him and run like hell for the exit.  Took a few tries to get it done when I did it way back when, but it was just a matter of patience and persistence.<br />
<br />
Be sure you have a good tank and a good cleric, and Black Dire is kinda mean.<br />
<br />
The boots are always in my inventory, and I still use them daily.  Excellent reward to work towards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At 44, you should have no problem doing the quest up to the fight in MM solo.  The Black Dire, is pretty hard for your level (impossible to solo).  Enlist the help of a 50+ cleric/shaman and a 55+ tank and you should be able to  finish this part.  One note, have the tank pull it to the zone.  I think the Black Dire can be pulled solo at 55 or 56.<br />
