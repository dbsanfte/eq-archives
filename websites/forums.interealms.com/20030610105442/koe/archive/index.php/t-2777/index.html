<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Valimar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Thought this was sorta cool and funny at the same time so here:<br />
<br />
Valimar, 42 bard, was hunting giants and wolves in GD with a 43 rogue, when i saw Gorul Longshanks go up on track near the giant fort - having seen him rip up a lv 56 war and a 51 cleric (don't know the mana of the cleric when they started), i was leary but mentioned him to the rogue....<br />
<br />
Rouge wanted to give him a try - so i went to go pull him, that's when i noticed that there were 3 of him on my track now, lol<br />
<br />
anyways, i grabbed one of them and he doubled for 120's and kicked me - we spent about 30 min kiting him in circles (had a number of adds to deal with during this time), but all we were doing was snare, and 22 dd song and the rogue was bsing once when she went above 3 bubs of health<br />
<br />
we won at the end, and he dropped ice weave but i'm just really surprised that we won - never thought about how good bards are at kiting non casters really<br />
<br />
anyways, look forward to grouping with yall soon<br />

Bards rock.</div></div><hr />
