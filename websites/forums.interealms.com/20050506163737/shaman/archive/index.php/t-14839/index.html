<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hail,<br />
<br />
I can't seem to figure out how to get my Intricate Figurine Stats correct.<br />
I can find the ac17 uber version, but unfortunately my flags don't extend so far.  <br />
<br />
I've seen links to people with lesser versions, but haven't found one that matches my stats yet.<br />
<br />
I have PoV/PoS, BoT, Tactics, CoD, HoH, and PonB, &amp; Torment flags.<br />
<br />
Can anyone point me in the right direction?  I hate having my Magelo out of whack with my virtual reality.  :p <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't think charms in Magelo will scale at all. They always seem to have full stats. I guess it would be very hard to code, because different charms depend on different things that you can't put into Magelo - such as, the number of people in the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Best way to fix it is to go get flagged for everything, then it'll be right :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Best place to ask this is on the magelo board but I'll answer anyway.<br />
<br />
Charms have a &quot;base&quot; stats which is what shows up for the item. That base stat is either multiplied or divided depending on the charm. In the case of the flag charm the base stats are the max stats and then it's devided to what ever's appropriate for the level. Magelo captures the base stats at this point and that all it does. Jelan is working on putting a multiple in magelo profiles for charms so you can set it to the right level but it isn't there yet and he's on vaction right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i add it anyway, my charm is 60% which is nearer to a full charm than an empty slot, and my magelo needs all the fluffing it can get ;)<br />
<br />
Bugs me though, I have always kept my magelo updated and accurate from when I was running about in totemic ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hamenu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Here's a link to a discussion on this topic at Magelo. It sounds like they have plans to make all of the charms &quot;scalable&quot; by the wearer, because Magelo won't be able to fully validate some of the attributes.<br />
