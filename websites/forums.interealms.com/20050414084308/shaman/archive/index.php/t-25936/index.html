<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Flifo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone have a suugetion on a good aug to put in type 4 slot?<br />
I mostly raiding/grouping Shammy, but occasionally like to solo. There dont seem to be that many options for the Ldon type 4 augs. So whats ya think?<br />
<br />
Sorry..I should have took time to look, I see this pretty well covered in other posts..please delete</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Type 4 is bad, get a type:all hp/mana aug.  Either Cypher of Veeshan or Gem of Bolstered Power or, if you can swing it, a BiC aug.  That last is a lot of work, but by far the best option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Perfect Garnet of Constitution is any slot although the aug is kind of crappy... i was using the gem of bolstered power for a while.... BiC is to much of a bitch =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shammygirl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I put the Veintappers STone from MPG there..very nice</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Veintapper is 2.5dps.  3, perhaps, with max spell crits?  And shaman rarely melee.  It's more damaging to chainclick elemental pants for the dd lead-in on Pox!  How is that &quot;very nice&quot;?  Like, it's soloable, and free, but that doesn't make it good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
dude...as Dory in Finding Nemo says....&quot;relaaaax&quot;.  I was agreeing with you that it doesn't qualify as a &quot;good&quot; augment in that sense.<br />
<br />
/boggle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I actually melee quite a bit, as I do put out a bit of meaningful DPS. coupled with Speedbump and DoTs, I typically put out alot of damage.<br />
<br />
Veintapper is something I currently keep on my melee weapon (Staff of Eternal Flames: 50 dmg, 35 dly w/ 400 DD proc), but that will be replaced soon, probably with the Life Sap 2 aug (125 pt lifetap) from DoN merchants.<br />
<br />
however, I use my epic 1.5 when raiding (I don't melee on raids as I don't want to get riposted by a mob that hits for 3800.) so HP all the way on weapons you will not be meleeing with much.<br />
<br />
I like lifetap augs not because of the DPS, but because of the extra healing. with my gear regen, persverence and lifetap aug, my HP nearly completely recoups from Pained Memory by the time it refreshes.<br />
<br />
have I mentioned I love the Bandolier feature? lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I put the Veintapper's in just because I had nothing better to put in. It is my intent to have a HP aug in every aug slot possible, but until I get that many... whatever's handy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shlob</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Brohg, im sorry but im a shaman and i melee all the time except when im on raids. please speak for yourself when you talk. yes a hp/mana aug would be better but untill you get one of them, i would use the LT it helps for when you do canni melee a few times and bam your back to full health, i have that aug and proc like crazy atleast 4 or 5 times a fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">4-5 times a fight, huh? -wow- 300 damage...  over a fight that lasts about a minute?  Thats 180 mana you miss out on medding, worth nearly 1100 damage (more if you have foci and/or crits) if it were contributing to another cast of Sisslak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I went with HP augs, melee for shaman is just a waste of med time, as Brogh said.  Only event I routinely smash things is Cyano in Qvic due to it's near total resist rate on spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">well, medding isn't really a concern unless i'm burning mana in a way that I can't counter with canni.<br />
<br />
but then, I don't use epic for melee. there is a stern difference in using epic and using a weapon with a much higher dmg/dly ratio and a sizable proc. lifetap just helps counter HP consumption from canni/mob.<br />
<br />
but this doesn't help on raids, I typically use my epic on raids, as it gives better HP/mana and I can use a shield for even more HP/Mana/stats. but in groups/solo I tend to hop in and melee, as it helps the mobs go bye-bye faster.<br />
<br />
go HP/Mana on epic. there are plenty of augs out there with sizable bonuses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Nya! (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=82593)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Fandele Longtooth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Slightly off topic, but what's all this talk about medding? I don't think I've meditated during a fight since I quit canni-dancing around lvl 50 (if that even counts). From everything I've seen, canni is a much faster way to regain mana than medding could ever be. You can even cann4 while meleeing if you time your casts right and your weapon has a high enough delay.<br />
<br />
I feel like I'm seriously missing something here and I'm hoping someone will clue me in...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I feel like I'm seriously missing something here and I'm hoping someone will clue me in...<br />
<br />
I think you are... I have this spell, Pained Memory (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5403&amp;source=Live). Compared to Cannibalize IV (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1332&amp;source=Live), it is about 4.5 times the HP to Mana conversion, but only usable once every 18 seconds. If I'm unable to be on my horse, and there's nothing to cast (say, during a long pull), I cast this and then sit for the extra MR until it is recastable - or until something else needs doing. Sometimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Fandele Longtooth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Thanks, Samanna. See what happens when a guy takes a few months off?<br />
<br />
Funny, though. People complained for so long that our active mana regen left too little time to do anything else. Now SOE seems to have addressed that issue and what do we do with the saved time? Meditate ;)<br />
<br />
We now return you to your regularly scheduled aug discussion...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I'm usually too busy to meditate (and have too high agro to sit) as well, but I'm usually, by the same token, too busy to melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I'm putting Chaotic Strike4 and Enraging Blow on mine. Chaotic Strike4 for those pesky CHers I find myself soloing all the time, and Enraging Blow so I can keep aggro off the Necros I group with. My usual DoN group makeup for crystal farming missions is: SHM (me), NEC, NEC, NEC, NEC - sometimes WAR or RNG or MAG. We used to rootrot until I got leopard, and started doing collect 15s in under 20 minutes by ripping through everything with pets while I tanked (unless the WAR or RNG was there), SoLeoparded, and healed while getting twitched. I usually have to spam Nihils/Turgur to keep aggro off them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">SoLeoparded<br />
<br />
now, I'm southern, but I don't think I could say that, even being drunk off my ass.<br />
<br />
if I want to keep aggro, I tend to keep poison DoTs up, the aggro they bring helps for the most part. if someone gets an aggro spike, I'll cast one of the cripple line. usually that is enough to keep aggro.<br />
<br />
if the mob is coming after them after that....they deserve aggro. no reason a necro should really worry about aggro anyway....they can FD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Spell:Disempower is the best snap agro we have at 2.25sec and 45mana.  If you have a really good focus and cleric spell haste buff, then Crippling Spasm can be faster, but costs 225 mana.  AC debuffs are -huge- agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Shlob</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I always use Envenomed Breath when kiting or trying to hold aggro from necro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">yeah disempower is where it's at for snap agro<br />
really though if you're kiting you should be able to keep agro<br />
off of necros easily... click a slow at it to counterbalance<br />
the necro's snare, then just use poison dots instead of mixing in<br />
curses. your dps will suffer slightly, but you'll far outweigh the<br />
top necro in agro since they'll be mixing in curse- and fire-based<br />
dots which are substantially lower agro than poisons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>psionic11</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I use &lt;b&gt;ROOT&lt;/b&gt; (Greater Immobilize) to regain aggro, since it's perma-memmed anyway... useful at least for not having to chase the mob down.<br />
<br />
I've noticed if you MALOS mob on inc, then SLOW it, you won't be as high on the mob's aggro list.  But if SLOW first thing without MALOS, you can really get the mob's attention, especially if the slow was resisted...<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Shaman Aggro Tools&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;<br />
pull mob (be first on mob's aggro list)<br />
SLOW (esp high aggro w/out Malos preceding it)<br />
Cripple/Disempower etc.<br />
poison DOT #1, #2...<br />
**All of the above before anyone else gets on mob's aggro list**<br />
ROOT<br />
sit<br />
high-proccing weapon, like a Pile Driver (scoriae bite/stun)<br />
<br />
Eventually with a Chaotic Strike aug (stun), Leopard/Panther, and the Destructive Fury, Reflexive Mastery, and Defensive Instincts AAs, any well-geared shaman can step up, jack aggro, and be Master of another trade.<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Introducing the ShammyKnight...&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">No, no matter how well geared, a shaman cannot be a tank.  The exceptions you'd inevitably point out if I didn't say &quot;no&quot; now are against trivial content.  I know that the content is trivial directly because you can tank it.  A *fully* aa'd shaman, with AC equal to a warrior (which is a sad state for the warrior, who in comparable gear would really always be 4-500ac ahead, at least) tanks about 80% as well as the warrior would with *no* aa.  Check that out.  A warrior has 1600ac, -0- aa.  That's bazaar-able, if expensive.  He tanks 25% better than a shaman with 1600ac (Time/Qvic gear is needed) and 500aa.  <br />
<br />
On the one hand, it's remarkable to compare shaman and warrior tanking at all.  But it's pretty obvious that a shaman will never be &quot;tanking&quot; against anything that matters.  For a fully aa'd, geared up shaman, it will take a real tank to fight mobs that can improve his situation.  Just as is the situation for a low-aa, bazaar gear shaman, or the level 55, 45, or 20 shamans.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>psionic11</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Ah, my arch-nemesis Brohg is point to my counterpoint once again.  I expected a reply as much.<br />
<br />
You must really think that I am some sort of newbie or misinformed shaman who thinks that some miracle shaman can tank Quarm.  In challenging content, I, as well as any decent shaman, know my roles as slower/debuffer/backuphealer/DPS/CC...<br />
<br />
However, in &quot;trivial&quot; content which the top shaman in a family guild still frequents, or in pickup groups where there is no other tank to be found, there is plenty of opportunity (read: fun-time wow factor) to tank.  Older raids clearing trash mobs.  Normal LDoNs.  Omens expos.  Soloing summoning mobs in NC, Sol Ro, etc. for AAs, Exp, or drops.  One-group, duos, or trio missions to Veksar, Kedge Keep, Old Sebilis, CoM for others' epic quests and certain drops...  <br />
<br />
Soloing in BoT still yields 6-7% per kill. When you want to get a chain-pulling AA grind session there, a ShammyKnight doesn't sit around complacently whining with the other skirts and hybrids about needing a tank... he invites more DPS to the group, chain-pulls singles, and proceeds to tank, DPS, hold aggro, and bring the bastards down in a minute until a &quot;real&quot; tank shows up, if at all.  Everyone is happy getting 2 more AAs in a couple hours or so of fast-paced fun.<br />
<br />
Yes, there's the extreme end of &quot;uber&quot; zones where a shaman does not tank at all (GoD, MPG+, Elemental).  Of course, it's not in your nature to infer that I or any decent shaman would already understand this.  <br />
<br />
But there's also the extreme of being the Big Fish in the litte pond that is the family guild, where there are only 2 tanks with 8k+ HP buffed, and an obnoxious amount of rangers and beastlords in the raid.  Where someone has to step up and CC and off-tank raid trash.  And then the others are once again amazed and reckon this particular ShammyKnight one of the better tanks they've seen in their up-and-coming adventures.<br />
<br />
Brohg, not all of us are lucky enough to be as uber as you.  Some of us work with what tools and environments we are given, and master them to the extent that we can be the best we can be, and enjoy the flexibility and variety that a well-played shaman can bring to the game.<br />
<br />
So, go on and point out how a shaman cannot be a tank.  It will not alter my playstyle, and I still tank often enough.  My point with the earlier post on aggro was to provide tips to other shaman who also tank.  To contribute rather than berate.  <br />
<br />
I understand it is more in your nature to be negative, as your many posts about how awful/annoying Leopard/Panther was going to be about 3 weeks ago, yet now your later posts are on the other side of the bandwagon.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, didn't mean to jack this thread with off-topic remarks.  There are many good points/facts Brohg has brought up in this forum which I agree with.  However, I prefer to share by offering tips and possibilities that others may not have thought to do.<br />
<br />
In short, hopefully most here understand that when a shaman &quot;tanks&quot;, he is not relying on his meleeing input to be the main DPS.  One tanks to be a meatshield, to hold aggro off of others, out of the necessity when soloing, or simply for the fun factor.  <br />
<br />
There are times when the ShammyKnight should step up and jack aggro off of another non-tank in the group... as when the tank dies prematurely, or the mob leaves the tank and goes for a caster or healer in the group.  Or when there is an ADD that needs to be gotten under control.  The ShammyKnight may not be the Main Tank for the group, but he is not the background caster who lets his groupmates die from bad mob aggro management.  He is a momentary tank when he needs to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>psionic11</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Flifo, my favorite suggestion so far is Bethiana's.<br />
<br />
Chaotic Strike will not only help hold aggro if you want it, but will add another &lt;i&gt;utility&lt;/i&gt; to your meleeing arsenal -- it will interrupt casters and slightly lower mob DPS by frequently stunning them...<br />
<br />
Your DPS is best contributed by DoTs mainly, not Proc Augs.  Your tools to &lt;b&gt;lower&lt;/b&gt; mob DPS are slow, cripple, and your defensive abilities.  Why not add to this toolset and STUN the mob for one second a few times each battle?<br />
<br />
When you successfully stun a mob and prevent a would-be 300+ hit, doesnt that far outweigh any +50 HP aug you could put there?</div></div><hr />
