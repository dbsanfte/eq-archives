<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bedalin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I saw on the AA guide that there is a cap of 50% on casting time?<br />
<br />
i have a 20% spell haste(buffs only) item<br />
if i buy quick buff 3(50% cast time reduc on buffs)<br />
<br />
is it right i will be caped at 50% or does the reduction will be 70%?<br />
<br />
<br />
for the moment i have quick buff 2 wich means my Quiescence cast in 3.3 instead of 6 sec(45% time reduc)<br />
if this cap is real it means i will get alsmots no gain to buy wuick buff 3<br />
<br />
<br />
is there the same cap with spell duraction??<br />
50% with aa + 20% with shawl for exemple is caped at 50% also?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No, there is no cap on extended enhancement.  You will get 70% longer buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You are right about the beneficial spell haste, it will be capped at 50%. I have had QB3 for awhile and no matter what cleric haste or mage haste I get on me, Quiessence is and will always be 3 sec cast time.<br />
<br />
I am not sure if Haste of Mithaniel will work on heals though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Works on all benifical spells including heals.</div></div><hr />

Buff extention AA's + items does not appear to have a cap. SCRM gains you 50%, and there is at least 20% extention item (Coldain Prayer Shawl) out there, resulting in a 70% extension. I have heard that there is a 25% extender item in PoTime, but have not confirmed that.</div></div><hr />

There is indeed a 25% beneficial extention focus in time.  Only item that has it atm is pulsing onyx ring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes, QB2 puts you at 25% reduction, add general 18% haste and you're nearly at the 50% cap.  It's why I never bothered to do QB3, and why you'll see that same phenomenon on many profiles of shamans with lots of AAs.  QB3 in my case would be 9 points spent for 7% haste on buffs, simply not worth it.</div></div><hr />
