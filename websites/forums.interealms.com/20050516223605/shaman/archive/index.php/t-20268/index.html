<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>vaniar luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I dunno if anyone has advanced this as an option, I did a search but didnt find anything (course Im search defective usually)<br />
<br />
Chanters and druids have spells that are limited by lvl... why couldnt they give us a slow, say 30-60% that doesnt mitigate on mobs lower than lvl 68 (just tossin any old number).<br />
<br />
I mean this would sure help ALOT with getting around the &quot;classic 3&quot; requirement to succeed in Sewers, Vxed, Tipt.... I cant speak with alot of experience about how Koda will be effected by this (with regard to mob lvls) but wouldnt this (and a real HoT Group plz) really do the trick?<br />
<br />
It would handle the Heal vs Slow issue and it would handle Shaman contribution in group settings.<br />
<br />
Ya this doesnt come close to solving all our issues, but why cant we have a non mitigated slow. It would certainly make a druid healer, and pally/SK tanking viable again (without requiring PoTime gear)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It is not just slow mitigation that kills shaman healing. It is six expansions worth of nerfs by omission on healing speed, healing impact, healing cost combined with short fights, constant movement and slow mitigation.<br />
Even giving us a 60% nonmitigatable heal would put us below druids on a 30 minute nonstop fight. Not to mention a single resist on slow still has the potential of killing the tank.</div></div><hr />
