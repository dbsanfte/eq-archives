<br />
Hi!<br />
<br />
I dont know what luclin mobs you aim for but a Ranger can tank pretty well and still have a good DPS output. Guess a shaman should be your other toon as you need slow and heals...<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents</div></div><hr />

The burrower is really nice loot, I have tried this with 65shm, 65rng, 64 war. Got him close but healing was a tad rough, even with adv healing adept/gift.  Have done him one group.  Perhaps with the Paladin/Shm duo that would be different. *shrug  Course if you do find you can duo the Burrower, please share the strategy you used.  Cleric alt could really use some of the drops hehe.<br />
<br />
Not really High end but have done Radir/Tawro other misc named in UP duo'd with ranger, things along that line........<br />
<br />
Hope that helps~ Shanone</div></div><hr />

dont u have to mez the few fishes in the room befor him anymore ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">dont u have to mez the few fishes in the room befor him anymore ?<br />
<br />
No.  They changed him a while back from worm to bug model and changed the rampage to flurry.  Also removed the fish.<br />
<br />
I'm going to start looking for some things to duo/tri (can bring a Wiz).  Going to start with some dragons and go from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xarila</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">hmm hmm so its might be possible for a monk shamy cleric trio..will take a long while , but its might be  possible...i will give it a shot  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Shaman Paladin is the best combo in my eyes. Since most douable boss mobs have low HP comparable to newer ones, your dots will add up for a whole lot of damage if you stack them.<br />
<br />
One of my favorite past-times on EQ right now is helping old friends who has not yet reached endgame with their epics. We are currently working on the cleric epic. Ixiblat was a joke. Im sure Ragefire wont be any more of a contest.<br />
<br />
Also the Fish (tm) in Cobalt Scar is a good mob to hit if you want to farm Cloak of Crystaline Waters.<br />
<br />
There is a tale about a paladin/shaman combo on Vallon Zek. He kills kunark dragons singlehandedly 2boxing. He could solo gorenaire, but having the shaman makes it a whole damn lot faster.<br />
<br />
Once he PVPed a whole pure-team guild who had wiped on Gore before taking Gore down himself.<br />
<br />
Trakanon duo should be doable if you work around the mushroom-ports somehow. Trak is soloable by a ranger since he casts very much and you pop innate invis when being banished and let him summon you back. Not sure how the banish/summon procedure would work in a duo...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Xarila</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">so burrower can magicwise  partially slowed and full diseasebased slowed right ?<br />

well, i am going  to put a tracker to ac and give it a shot as soon as i see him  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
no, he isnt, i did ragefire , talendor, va dyn with my trio with no problems..well, the va dyn fight last 37 mins  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Xarila</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">oh, 1 more question about the burrower fight.<br />
<br />
are there any roamers nearby which add or does the burrower spawn any adds during the fight ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shrapnac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Burrower is in a room by himself.<br />
<br />
He's perma-rooted so you can fully debuff him before you engage.<br />
<br />
He's underwater so make sure you have EB or an EB item since the fight will probably take a while with just a duo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Orgak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">so burrower can magicwise  partially slowed and full diseasebased slowed right ?<br />
<br />
The slowability chart shows him as Disease slowable only and he mitigates that.  I raided him a few times with various guilds.  The first time, I tried to Turgurs pretty much the whole way through the fight (we had so many people on that raid...) and it didn't land once.  Grummus has landed nearly every time for me since and he's always mitigated.  Just like the chart says.<br />
<br />
One tactic for controlling aggro that has worked well for us is to have the Pally cast stuns on him for about 10 - 15 minutes before engaging.  After that, he'll never turn his attention from the Pally.  You can debuff him before you get in melee range so you don't have to touch him unslowed.  I know jack about Paladins, but it's important you don't bring him down in health to the point where he starts summoning.  That's 97%, iirc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Xarila</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">well, i am going to use a 8,5khp monk to tank him and do the damage.<br />
<br />
debuffing, slow and memblur befor engaging him will i do for sure, after that only melee with the monk and using dog + spirit call and clerc &quot;pet&quot; ( cough  :rolleyes:  ) after a bit dmg may be 10-20% i was thinking of using poison and disease dots...<br />
<br />
any infos if the dots land on him or do they get resisted all the time ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Orgak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The only DoT's I seem to be able to land on him with any consistency is poison.  Ironically, I can't get disease to stick hardly at all.  You'd think he'd be susceptible to disease as he is disease slowable and I debuffed him with Malicious Decay.  I didn't have much luck with Bane or Anathema(sp?) either.<br />
<br />
I should mention that the above info is raid info.  I've never tried to duo him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Xarila</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">well i am going to try it as soon as he is up  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">burrower in AC? the worm looking mob?<br />
<br />
he wasn't perma-rooted the last time i killed him. not duo, was a group or 2.<br />
<br />
he just doesn't move unless agroed.<br />
<br />
can train him and anything else you agro to zone in, zone out and zone back in and have your way with him.<br />
<br />
he procs AE mana seive and summons so soloing is out of the question i think.<br />
<br />
keep him in the hallway and stand around the corner for heals and move in and out for dots, slows and debuffs and what not. just a suggestion...<br />
<br />
are we talking about the same burrower?<br />
<br />
if we are i know my monk friend duo'ed him with a shammy succesfully with luclin/NToV gear. no VT gear.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">try sham/bst<br />
<br />
bst splitting tank duty with self and pet, and taking over heals while pet tanks--that helps a ton. affords sham extra time to regain mana.<br />
<br />
i duo all the time with 65 bst. haven't tried anything like this mob yet, but i'm thinking it's about time to give it a go.<br />
<br />
only 47 aa at the moment (bst has aa in the 90s), and gear is mix of good baz items and mini raid drops for both of us--bst has better gear on average.<br />

i am trying to kill trakanon now, but it's a lil more tactic than vadyn(vadyn is pure tank/heal strat with good reslow timing and canning)<br />
i think trak will be more difficult than Zland, even if he is 65 instead of 70, the banish touch is hard to deal with(i plan on pulling him to the banish spot but i am not sure were it is)</div></div><hr />

Also Rhagg1, you can just malos the adds and the will come at you and kill them. You don't have to mez :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
hehe yes, i know, but that was respawn during the rhag 1 fight.<br />
since i boxed 4 chars to kill rhag i really couldnt kill adds as well during the fight, so i just mezzed them.  ;)<br />
<br />
well as edition, only had respawn during the 1 time i killed rhag 1 , never happend again. now they pop allways 3-5 minutes after rhag went down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I soloed Rhag 1 a couple months ago, before the HoT and regen changes, so this should be fairly trivial now(one character soloing that is). <br />
The tricky part is the respawning mobs in the room as mentioned above.<br />
It took me about 28 minutes to kill Rhag 1 with the respawn happening at 20% health. You will get 2 to 4(all) of the room adds, and that's where you need to become inventive if you want to win.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />
<br />
P.S. Try it solo first, it's great fun.(Oh, he's immune to Poison and Disease and regens about 600 HPs/tick)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Kunark dragons are a joke now (with the exception of Trak).  I'm going to duo one when I can find them up.  Trak has been solo'd by a SK, Druid, and Ranger as far as I know.  SK would FD on punt and get summoned back, Ranger would use innate cammo on punt and would'nt get shroom aggro.  Not sure on the druid though.<br />
<br />
Wanting to try VanDyn next but need to see if there any tricks on pulling him.<br />
<br />
Has anyone tried boxing IV yet?<br />
<br />
And once OoW comes out, I think Rumblecrush will be the next big thing to die to a duo.<br />
<br />
Oh, Servitor of Luclin is very gimp.  I 3 boxed him this weekend (use a 63 Mage).  BoT was able to cover the heals and it took about 8 minutes to kill (Turgurs had just wore off at the end).  SoL does flurry, but that means he hits twice in 1 round.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Xarila</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Has anyone tried boxing IV yet?<br />
<br />
<br />
if it would be possible i would have done it allready, may be with lvl 70 it will be possible, but i doubt it. IV simply has to much hp to box him down. the problem will be the respawn. thats why i havent tried it yet.<br />
<br />
...but i will try it with my 4 chars as soon as they got lvl 70 and the needed spells. if i had as 4th char a wizzi for some more dps it might would be possible.<br />
<br />
with lvl 70 rumble and doom will fall to my 4 chars for sure</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">If your talking about repops around the edge to the room, then positioning is the key.

and so on.  I honestly don't remember it being _THAT_ hard to slow zland back when ... am I missing something?  I'm guessing that Balance would make this muuuuuch easier .... but required?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Hail,<br />
<br />
I just did Zlandicar last night.  Druid, Ench, Shaman, Cleric.  We had healing out the wazoo, though it really wasn't necessary.  I don't think I did more than Q myself and dogdog a few times.  Most of the cleric's healing was on the pets who kept getting hit with the AE (we were resisting them).<br />
<br />
Tash makes a huge difference.  Give the SK and yourself a Tash stick (heck, they are cheap enough, give dogdog and the SK pet each one too) and you should land slow soon after it procs.<br />
<br />
I couldn't get Malosinia to stick either yesterday.  After Malos, Turgur's (second try), and Velium Strikes were the only things landing reliably, and VS was hitting for partial more often than not.  I wouldn't waste mana trying to cast any DoTs (go ahead and try clickies though).<br />
<br />
I think you could do it with an SK/Shaman duo if you just stuck to careful mana management and melee.  Buff your pets ahead of time (include resist disease) &amp; keep Q or BoT on the pets &amp; your SK all the time.  Be sure to give the pets summoned mage swords &amp; keep them alive - their melee damage will be substantial over the long fight.  Use Spirit Call right after you slow so it might be up again before Zland drops (it will be a long fight - don't forget to time your slow so it doesn't wear off).<br />
<br />
I was honestly very surprised how easily Zlandicar went down with no melees and no real nukers in our group.  Next time I'd like to try soloing him. :D <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />
