They have been used since before the Romans and everything is fair game for cartoonists who wish to deliver a message.<br />

Personally, if this lawsuit makes it to court I'm going to be very depressed.....</div></div><hr />

I don't think they have a prayer in my professional, un-informed of the facts, opinion<br />

I am not form the states, annyone got a link to a news article about the situation (or anything official) ?</div></div><hr />

BTW What the hell is a sexual anorexic and does that mean there can be a sexual bulemic?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ogrym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">sexual anorexic means your &quot;lean&quot; on having sex.  Guess a sexual bulemic would be a nympho.<br />

This WILL get to court unless verant settles out of court, but considering the only thing i've seen her mention she wants is a stupid sticker that won't do a damn thing, i'm not sure *** the point of the whole thing is in general.  She's gonna piss away alot of cash for nothing and give EQ even more publicity and get more people to try it out.<br />
<br />
At least now we know why the EQ rates were upped, gotta cover them legal fee's somehow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>thorvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I don't know... if I saw a game on the shelves that had a freakin warning label on it saying. &quot;This game is so addicting you'll wanna never put it down!&quot; Not just something that's part of the box art but actually a government warning... <br />
<br />
I don't know about you but I'd pick that game up in a hearbeat. Must be damn good, wouldn't ya think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Azhdarkhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Reminds me of the great plan to put labels on cd covers warning of explicit lyrics... I imagine the marketing types wish they could take credit for the idea.<br />
<br />
If computer games like EQ cause suicide, you'd think there'd be a lot fewer of us hanging out in these forums.<br />
<br />
Same goes for blaming violent behavior on Quake:<br />
Number of teenagers/young adults who play Quake/Unreal/etc. - 100's of thousands<br />
Number of said teenagers/young adults who wig out and go on killing sprees - 4 or 5.<br />
<br />
Doesn't really suggest a causal relationship, does it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>argoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hmmm... everyone who gets cancer has at one time or another drunk water.... drinking water causes cancer!!!! <br />
<br />
Sounds like sensible logic to me<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'll leave it to Denis Leary (The American Comedian) to give the proper take on 'warning labels' (He's talking about cig's)<br />
<br />
 &quot;Like the problem is, we just haven't noticed the warnings yet right? Like all of a sudden, smokers around the world are going to go 'Holy ****! These things are bad for you?? I thought they were good for you. I thought they had vitamin C in 'em and ****!'<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter how big the warning on the pack is. Cigarettes could come in a black pack, with a big skull and cross bone on the front, called 'Tumors' and people would be lined up around the block going 'I can't wait to get my hands on these ****in' things!'&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">2 things<br />
<br />
1. everyone listen to or watch or read denis leary's no cure for cancer (what that came from) its hilarious.<br />
2. its a damn shame that woman is from milwaukee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ever see a pack of smokes from Canada?  They have giant color pictures of diseased lungs, people on respirators, and &quot;impotent&quot; cigs.  Really nice, and still people buy them.  I say freedom of choice,<br />
but deal with the consequences yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">&quot;It's like any other addiction,&quot; Elizabeth Woolley said last week. &quot;Either you die, go insane or you quit. My son died.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes.  It wasn't the fact that had mental problems and a gun, it was the GAME...<br />

If she wins, she will be able to say to herself &quot;Well, it wasn't MY fault my son failed the Darwin test, it was the evil, mind-controlling game!&quot;, and her lawyer will get money and publicity either way.  It's pitiful.</div></div><hr />

If you mean this will get to a judge, you are correct, but it will NEVER get to a jury.  They have a problem with what is called &quot;proximate cause.&quot;  <br />
<br />
SOE will win on a motion for Summary Judgement based upon what limited facts I know.<br />
<br />
Based upon my experiance in product liablity cases, their insurance company will only settle for nuisance value, if at all.<br />
