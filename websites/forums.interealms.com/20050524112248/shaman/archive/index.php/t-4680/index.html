<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Trubblesumm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
Well I dont think I have done too bad. but here is my magelo and was wondering if people have some upgrade ideas. I am a casual type of player (european timezone) on Drinal Server.<br />
<br />
looking at maybe 15kpp in very near future.<br />
I have coldain ring 8, going to start working on 9 soon.<br />
<br />
Was looking for a Lodizal shield (still am sorta). but my randoms suck so far.<br />
<br />
www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=272148<br />
<br />
I have a resists bag, basically Diamond/Blue Diamond gear and a Froggy crown.<br />
<br />
Was hoping to one day hit 1k ac (969 ac self buffed atm) and over 200 Wis (screwed my starting stats). Of course HP would also be nice.<br />
<br />
I am 4 blue from 56. and one yellow from first AA point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Shaman randoms suck full stop.<br />
<br />
Kronenbourgs Conspiracy Theory:<br />
<br />
Each class has an inbuilt modifier that is used by the random number generator when deciding mob loot and shaman roll's.  This would explain why malo/torpor drop rates suck.  It would also explain why every guild I have ever been in uses the term 'Doh...shammy roll' if anyone rolls craply.  I have yet to work out why the only time shaman rolls are not affected by this built in, hard coded, you will roll with loaded dice thing is when the loot is total crap.  I can guarantee if I am fighting somewhere and 6 items drop, 5 of which are god loot worth a gazillion bajillion plat, all of them I will /ran 100 and get under 10.  If a piece of 100pp ****e drops I will roll over 95 every time.<br />
<br />
Ok, so probably a little bit far fetched, but that is the whole point of conspiracy theories.  If I never post again it is coz I have stumbled on to something and VI have set out to silence me ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's much more complex than that.<br />
<br />
The game looks into your equipment and bank to see if you can use an item.  If a shammy could benefit from said item, they roll low, otherwise they roll really high.<br />
<br />
I'm famous for 996's on items that I really don't want and 6's on ones I NEED.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You nailed it for me also - It's how I've ended up with most of<br />
my items - most of the time another in the group and i end up trading for what each other wanted...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Off topic but why do some people roll out of 1000 and some roll out of 100? I know and have always rolled out of 100.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>jraven1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Some cheap upgrades that I've seen in the bazaar on Xegony that would apply to you would be:<br />
<br />
Ivandyr's Hoop: 2500<br />
Chitinous Belt: 2-3k<br />
xxx Dragonhorn Bracers: 3k and up<br />
Goranga Idol: 500<br />
<br />
Might also want to try the Coldain Military Wristguard quest. It's a pain in the butt if you're not on Giant faction, but I did it with a RZ-worshipping mule and it really didn't take that long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i'd suggest getting more hp if you can :)<br />
<br />
maybe a shadel bandit ring and a djarn's amethyst ring to replace those velium fire opal rings, not too hard to get with one or two friends..  heirophant cloak is better than lodizal shield IMHO, except for resists (but you arent on a pvp server) and maybe a bone braced buckler from the grey for a new shield, ac25 10 str 10wis 55hp 55mana if I am remembering correctly..    and a velium black sapphire neckalce!    try getting some people interested in doing the benevolence quest also, if you are on claws of veeshan faction, very good bracer for tank classes, and great range slot item for priests</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What's the name of the bracer if you are on Dragon Faction?<br />
<br />
I'm threatening to the dragons, KOS to the giants, Kindly to the dwarfs. Working on the dragons and the dwarfs and my 5th Coldain Prayer Shawl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Harlas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I thought I was the only one with bad luck on rolls.<br />
<br />
Every item I CAN and WILL use--I end up losing the roll.<br />
<br />
Now if I am in a group or raid where no one CAN use an item--I tend to roll high. IFS/SS BP/SK Boots from KC etc....<br />
<br />
Of course--now with the bazaar--it is not that much of a problem /grin<br />
<br />
I am thinking this is a shadow benefit for being a shaman...with MCS (multi character syndrome).</div></div><hr />

<br />
The random number generator isn't always 'random'.  For a better random number people will *seed* the roll by rolling for a random number between 0 and 1000.  Then that number becomes the random number.<br />
<br />
ie:<br />
<br />
** a random number between 0 and 1000  MekuDuku rolls a 878.<br />
<br />
ok now everyone in the group rolls vs 878.<br />
<br />
** a random number between 0 and 878 MekuDuke rolls a 602.<br />
** a random number between 0 and 878 Snapdragn rolls a 788.<br />
<br />
I win, gimme the loot. :)</div></div><hr />
