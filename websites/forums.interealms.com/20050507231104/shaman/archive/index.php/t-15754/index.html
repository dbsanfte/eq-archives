<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My little party (62 shaman, 62 monk, 47 mage) has lived in Sebilis for quite a while. Generally, we've been farming for cash and exp for the mage. Most of the mobs are light blue or low blue to the lvl 62s. The killing is easy as most of the mobs hit for under 140 and have low ac and hp. The lvl 62's averaged maybe 1 blue of real exp per hour. <br />
<br />
We got bored of Sebilis and decided to move to PoP. Since we weren't sure of the monk's tanking ability vs the much harder hitting mobs of PoP, we start out with the trash mobs of PoN - ravens, treants and spiders. We fought for two hours chain pulling without too much undue difficulty. <br />
<br />
At the end of the two hours, it appeared that we had made roughly two blue of real exp - or almost exactly what we would have gotten in Sebilis. A little research reveals that the mobs we were fighting were roughly lvl 52 - or about the lvl of a Krup frog. <br />
<br />
So, in summary, we fought PoP mobs that were MUCH harder than Sebilis mobs, but received almost the exact same amount of exp per hour. I can't help but wonder if this applies across the board - will lvl 58 UP monkies that hit for 200 give roughly the same exp as lvl 58 PoP mobs that hit for 500? <br />
<br />
Yes, I know that now the 6-person group fighting a steady stream of lvl 60+ mobs is going to have maximum exp. But if you are fighting small-groups like mine, I have to wonder if the old world is a hidden mine of exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A change was recently made that a) lowered the exp obtainable in PoP zones and b) raised the exp attainable in old-world zones.  <br />
<br />
I guess the idea was to alleviate some of the crowding in the zones (which they promptly quadrupled by suddenly making every mob drop incredibly nice loot and every named spawn practically every 15 minutes).<br />
<br />
In the end, for your small group, you may get better experience in an old world zone (but remember, light blue is light blue and will never grant the same experience as a steady stream of dark blue mobs). <br />
<br />
I recently took my beastlord to katta for 5 levels and was quite satisfied with the experience.  The mobs are easy to kill, the experience was steady, and I was able to fight there effectively solo.  It was rather enjoyable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Tier 1 like PoN wont be that great for 60s.  With many zones openned up youll get better mileage in Hall of Heroes, PoS, PoV, and BoT.  Youll need a full group for best results and some of those zones, BoT for example is usually crowded and full of noob trainers, atleast on my server.  If your going to duo, well sounds like you found a good place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The game outside of PoP is a collection of pointless zones devoid of any appreciable experience or loot.  Everyone cool is in the planes, you should be too!  All other zones are a waste of your time.<br />
<br />
Especially do not take that group to deep Nurga, say, where everything's blue to 65 and falls over almost before you pull it.  For the love of god, don't do that, at least not if you're on Rodcet.<br />
<br />
DEFINITELY avoid Ykesha.  Vile, awful place with nothing to recommend it, and 1k plat splits after a night of xping are only a figment of your imagination.  Unless, of course, you're not on Rodcet, in which case feel free.<br />
<br />
And for the love of all that's good and holy, stay out of chardok B.  I've heard that just zoning IN there, at least on Rodcet, can strip your characters of all items, delevel you to 35 and probably make your wife run off with your truck and the dog.  Is anything worth that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jahvah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I recall a few months back a patch that changed the experience bonus relative to your level.  The basic gist was that level 60+ characters would get more experience by fighting mobs near their own level.  The downside was that the exp was nerfed for low blues.  I don't know if they changed it back.  But with two level 60+ characters fighting level 52's, you may be feeling the effect of that patch.  This was long before the recent group experience bonus patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Skeeter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">POP is definitely 'the place' for easy experience.  Get a really good group and you can grind out an AA an hour with no problems.  Zones like BOT/ HOH and POV/POS even let you use your mounts so no sitting aggro.  Great place to go and veg out, let someone pull back to your group for hours and just 'grind.'  ugh.  Doesn't take any skill or finesse to play in many POP zones (there are exceptions, like COD -- and you generally need a good puller regardless of which zone).  <br />
<br />
If you like to crawl a bit and aren't afraid of dungeons (gasp!  no graveyards!!!), you'll find other spots that are as good/nearly as good experience and even have loot!  (Yeah, there is some loot in POP -- in the right zones -- but anyone who's spent time in POV isn't going back because of the insane coin splits).  Plus the other zones are usually a lot less crowded these days.  Zone into Nardok and see what I mean.  Or Veksar -- you'll probably see a 65 necro camping the rotting shopkeeper and blacksmith.  And maybe a group trying the nobles.<br />
<br />
In the end, it's what you like.  I fully expect Seb, Chardok, Veksar, and other indoor dungeons to be nearly empty when LDON comes out -- since all the 'crawlers' will move there.  No idjit trains.  A dungeon all to yourself -- crack it, crawl it, loot it, and go home.  And over time earn credit towards some nice rewards.  And the folks that like their safe and easy POP experience will complain that there isn't any new content. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Depending on how well geared you are, you're 62 sham and monk should be able to dou PoS desert fairly well. For best resalts  you want to find stuff within 5 levels of your characters. Everything in PoS desert (except giants, don't mess with them) is 58 and very nice exp through 63.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">As mentioned, the key to good exp is fighting mobs at your level.  Killing mobs 10 levels under is not worth it.  Almost all mobs in tier2+ are 60+, which means within the 5 level radius for everyone.  Which is also why tier1 zones are much more deserted than they used to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">&quot;As mentioned, the key to good exp is fighting mobs at your level. Killing mobs 10 levels under is not worth it.&quot;<br />
<br />
What I was trying to get across was this...<br />
<br />
Lvl 52 Krup in sebilis. Hits for 150, low hp, low ac. <br />
Lvl 52 Raven in PoN. Hits for 300, higher hp, higher ac<br />
<br />
After some experimentation, it appears that fighting the Krups gives the same amount of exp per hour than fighting the ravens. The PoP zone bonus is counteracted by the larger number of Krups I can kill.<br />
<br />
Your point about mobs ten levels lower is well taken - but PoP is not the only place to get lvl 60 mobs. I can find plenty of lvl 60 mobs in Sanctus Seru and they all hit for under 200. Assuming that I can drop them in a vaguely similar amount of time, then doesn't it make sense to fight an &quot;easy&quot; lvl 60 (200 hitter) rather than a &quot;hard&quot; lvl 60 (500 hitter)? <br />
<br />
So... I am proposing a hypothesis: that mob level has much, much, much more to do with exp gain than whether it is in PoP or out of PoP. And given the very high damage rates of PoP mobs, if one can fight outside of PoP and get the same level mobs, they should. <br />
<br />
Of course, there aren't too many zones that can support 6 lvl 65 people looking for lvl 63 mobs outside of PoP! But this might influence the thinking of people 50-60 who chose PoN over Chardok/Seb etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">PoP USED to have a huge exp bonus for the zones. Made them better exp. When they rescently changed the grouping exp bonus's they toned back the exp bonus's for the pop zones so there isn't as much difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Getan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">xp per hour can be viewed as a function of (xp per mob) * (number of mobs killed per hour) * (ZEM).<br />
<br />
ZEM for PoN is something like 1.19<br />
ZEM for Seb is something like 0.85<br />
<br />
1.19 is 40% more then 0.85.<br />
<br />
Assuming that mobs killed are the same lvl, if you kill 40% more mobs per hour in Seb then in PoN, you make the same xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">As far as open zones go, CoD is prolly the best zone I have seen for exp.  Of course it helps if you move into the Crappin' area or Rats and out of the trainy ZI.<br />
<br />
HoH is nice and booooring when not camped up and BoT is good if you can stay away from the trains and people screaming that you just stole their chef/bartender/chambermaid camp.<br />
<br />
PoP exp definitely &gt; all, but you need to get into some of the higher tier zones to really see it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">To put this whole conversation into perspective.<br />
<br />
Take a zone like Cazic Thule and flat out chain kill mobs on top of the 4C temple with a 100+ damage shield on the warrior, a high end wizard and rogue doing damage and no slow on the mobs (for damage shield).  That xp still doesn't compare favorably with PoP at level 65.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking your crew gets the same xp in old world zones because you aren't level 65 yet AND you weren't fighting stuff close to your level in both cases.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Tier one xp is terrible at 61 or 62. PoV xp is simply *awesome* at that level...<br />
<br />
Don't label PoP as some generic zone - tier1, 2, 3 are enormously different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ungerargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Deep in Droga, there are camps where all the mobs are 59-61 (meaning 2/3 will grant at least a 90% xp bonus for being close to your level at 65).  The mobs only hit in the low 200s, have medium resists (similar to tier2/3), and /gasp drop 10-20 pp per kill, with an odd gem or two.  The named in the area aren't any harder than the regular mobs, and most of the loot there can be sold for 10-15kpp+.  Combine this with the fact that, for non-PoP, Droga has a VERY high xp modifier and...you know where I've done the last 3 levels and 40 AAs. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Nothing beats pulling yellow con mobs in the elemental planes for 4% to 6% aa exp each. And while its somewhat tough to learn how to do it consistantly and smoothly, there is nothing anywhere else that competes with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
where do you get that kind of info?<br />
<br />
Is there a website somewhere, I have always been interested in this kind of info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Fulgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">This is an update to the patch message posted in another link. The most significant change is that the reward for PoP is not going to be implemented at this time. Read on:<br />
<br />
June 11, 2003 3:00 am <br />
------------------------------ <br />
<br />
** Experience System Change - Grouping ** <br />
<br />
We've made some improvements to the way experience is rewarded in EverQuest. These improvements are aimed at positively reinforcing the act of grouping. After all, this is a Massively Multiplayer game. <br />
<br />
Prior to this update groups gained a 2% to 20% experience bonus for having two to six members. <br />
<br />
As of today this bonus has increased to range from 20% to 80% for having two to five members. When a group adds a sixth member, the 80% bonus remains, but the experience gained is only divided by 5 before being distributed. The sixth group member no longer causes the experience gain to be divided by 6. <br />
<br />
Planes of Power zones had an increased experience award above and beyond those of most other zones. Because of these new dramatic improvements to group experience gains, we will be reducing the zone-specific experience bonus for Planes of Power zones a bit. As long as character is grouped with at least one other in these zones, they will see an improvement in experience gain over the old system. The one down side to the new system is that there will be a small decrease in experience for those who do not group, and only for those who do so in Planes of Power zones. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Experience System Change - Level 60+ ** <br />
<br />
In addition to the above changes, we have increased the range of NPC levels that give a character experience after they reach level 60. This will open up many of the &quot;old world&quot; zones to players previously restricted to Planes of Power zones for experience gain. The range of NPCs that will be &quot;blue&quot; to a level 65 character has been increased as far as level 50, with the &quot;light blue&quot; range extending to level 45. The best experience gains, however, are still for fighting things around and above your level. This should open up areas for high level characters in groups and solo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Necrosis (Scarab)/Guardian (Mr Lamentation)<br />
<br />
Guys, I think a lot of you missed his point. He's wondering if hunting in PoP with his already established trio is a good idea xp wise.<br />
<br />
My answer would be no.<br />
<br />
Your mage friend's pet would be shredded the first time an unslowed add even sneezed on him (that's assuming you're fighting mobs even halfway challenging to the 62s). Fighting trash in PoN/PoI/PoD isn't worth the time, effort, or aggravation. You have a nice spot (and believe me, I've been looking into Seb to level my shaman) and it works for you. PoP isn't a good idea IMO since, as you mentioned, the mobs are tougher for approximately the same reward (except the loot part).<br />
<br />
I'm assuming you're not in this for the 'great xp' if you have a 47 mage with you so that being the case, stick to the old world stuff and forget about PoP til your Mage gets fairly deep into the 50s. At 55, s/he can accompany you to PoV or PoS where the xp would be appreciably better (because the mage would be able to contribute on more equal footing).<br />
<br />
Killing Krups gives you a shot at Sebilisian Berserker Cloaks and Runebranded Girdles. There aint NOTHING of similar value ever gonna drop off a blood raven or treant.<br />
<br />
I know people rave about LoY but I just don't see the allure. From what I've been able to tell (playing a then-45 ranger in Gunthak and Dulak's and later the 65 rogue in Torgiran Mines and Nadox), the mobs have more hp/ac and hit harder than mobs of comparable level elsewhere. If I'm going there with a group of friends, that's one thing. But to solo or 2box, there are other places where my time is better spent IMO. I don't have LoY on Amorae's account atm and there are only 2 reasons for me to get it: 1) 8 extra bank slots, 2) Stoicism. Coin splits are decent but as mentioned, there's better available elsewhere.<br />
<br />
My advice is stick to what's working for you now. Anyplace you go that's challenging for the 62s, the 47 either won't be able to come with you (i.e. BoT/HoH/PoV/PoS) or if they can come with you, they probably wouldn't be able to contribute much (deep Nurga, Chardok B, etc).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Nurga would be decent for your little group there. Just watch out that the mage doesnt get too much aggro since some of the mobs there does like to cast Ice comet and I guess a level 47 caster wont last through many of those.<br />
<br />
Apart from exp the goblins drop a decent amount of cash and gems once in a while. And they almost all have a chance of dropping items needed for quests relating to the slaves you can help escape there.<br />
<br />
So far my ranger and shaman duo has gotten these upgrades from those quests:<br />

for a nore exciting exp time, try east wing in charasis, not the greatest exp but loads of fun!<br />
<br />
id guess DN is good fun but personally i never been, as i not a huge fan of exping in hard to get to zones....ok charasis is almost hard to get to, but at least thers a pop book in the OT.<br />
<br />
imo luclin suks for exp past lvl 40.<br />

So for me at 55 to 62 kunark still rules.[if u want a balance of exp and loot i mean]</div></div><hr />
