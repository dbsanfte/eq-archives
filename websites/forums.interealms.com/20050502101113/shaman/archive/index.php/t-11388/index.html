<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>steveo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The more I read, the more i succumb...<br />
<br />
I'm one of the type offolk that roll with the punches, and sometimes get irritated hearing so much complaining about nerfs and class balance. I try to take it with a grain of salt, move on, and play the game to the best of my abilities, given the tools I have a t my disposal.<br />
<br />
This doesn't seem hard as an overly-twinked re-roll. <br />
<br />
However, the more I read, the more I wonder. <br />
<br />
Originally, I thought to myself as I read through 99% of the posts here in the general forum, most of the people here are conspiracy-theorists...<br />
&quot;It's because I have slow that...&quot;, &quot;It's because I am too versitile that...&quot;, &quot;It's completely directed at the shaman community that...&quot;...<br />
<br />
BUT, after reading these boards and seeing the topics come and go, and the passionate responses most of these topics generate, I have actually joined the ranks of the conspiracy-theorist myself.<br />
<br />
It's absolutely incomprehensible that the decisions made at SOE on any of the recent (and not so recent) shaman changes (insert your favorite one here) made it to production without the slightest foresight or discussion on the overall effects.<br />
<br />
I really do hate to be one that jumps on the nearest bandwagon, but the LOY spells (or spell CHANGES is more like it) just seem to be irrefutable proof that they just dont give a ****... plain and simple. I dont feel the need to explain why I feel this way, nor do I feel I need to address the other issues, there are plenty of threads that do just that.<br />
<br />
I look forward to levelling up, I look forward to my next round of spells, and I look forward to being the shaman I expected to be when I created this character.<br />
<br />
I can even look past things that were changed for gameplay reasons (foci items), original intentions, or &quot;the vision&quot;, etc...  However taking one of my spells, diminishing its functionality, then expecting me to buy an expansion to get back what I lost is just over the freaking top!<br />
<br />
NO OTHER CLASS had this happen.<br />
<br />
There MUST be something we can do to stop the rampant (and un-thoughtout) changes to the shaman class. Are there not enough of us to make a difference? are there not enough of us to be heard? <br />
<br />
Do any other class boards hear anything from SOE? Are we the olny ones that dont? <br />
<br />
I only have one idea, the most likely place for us to be heard on ALL matters that pertain to the shaman class is to post them on the actual EQ (SOE station) messageboards. In the newbie zones where free discussion is allowed to take place. They sure as hell dont even read these forums.<br />
<br />
I can think of several issues that would help satisfy many of us while at the same time having little (or no effect at all) on the game as a whole.<br />
<br />
1. useless spells in our book<br />
2. alchemy herb prices<br />
3. slow mitigation (since we already pay for having slow with other setbacks)<br />
4. spell drop rates<br />
<br />
If you wonder what else there is, have a look at the front page of the &quot;general&quot; forum any day of the week.<br />
<br />
The treatment we are getting is insane, makes me wonder if levelling up is even going to be worth it in the long run. (im only lvl 38 now)<br />
<br />
Just seems to me that when another priest class benefits anything at all, we pay for it...<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to make a big rally or anything, I'm just wondering if anything we ever do will get heard or at least responded to...<br />
<br />
flames? ideas? anyone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kraegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think you hit the nail on the head when you say that SOE puts things into production without any forethought regarding the effects.    There are TONS of examples - donals bp being one of the biggest ones i can think of.<br />
<br />
I don't think its so much that SOE has something against any particular class - but rather: 1) they mis-percieve the true status of a class OR 2) they make changes without thinking the consequences through OR 3) combo of 1 and 2.<br />
<br />
ITs really just poor quaility on SOE's part ....</div></div><hr />

how come no new race can be a druid ? /sarcasm off .<br />
<br />
Hadd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naarlina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, the shaman community isn't exactly united when it comes to the class's abilities.  There are numerous threads complaining about nerfs and such, only to be followed with flames saying &quot;play a different class if you don't like it&quot; or things to that extent (sometimes harsh, sometimes not).<br />
<br />
This is contrary to many other boards.  Check out the enchanter boards sometimes, (or clerics, SKs, necros)...for the most part they are quite united against SOE whenever even the threat of a nerf arises.  Not so here, other than the most extreme nerfs (and then, only after the fact).  Hell, most of the time even if the nerf makes obvious sense, you'll find these classes complaining in unison to SOE. <br />

The squeaky wheel gets the grease.  Check the druid boards for proof.</div></div><hr />

YOUR ASTROLOGICAL READING: Face it - you've gone over to the dark side.  You are obviously in it for the short haul.  Your obvious distaste for the SOE shaman vision makes you ill-suited to be one.  Don't let this evil, conspiracy-filled corporation drive you to become a cynical, burned-out shell of the person you used to be.  Re-roll as a druid and have a happier life.  <br />

getting a spell changed only to get the same spell back when you buy a new product is a bit weird.<br />

<br />
Topor drops -- Nothing<br />
Malo drops - Nothing<br />
Healing changes now that slow mitigation is in the game - nothing<br />
<br />
There is such a huge list of  things we asked for that has got no response , that SoE has come here and person and LIED right to our faces about.<br />
<br />
This spell is not worth a fight imho. Its plain as day how high on the list we are in the concerns of balancing and class correction. So what we do ? We continue to take the BORROWED mentality of other classes that have complained about dumb **** and got it fixed ? If there was a point id say go for it , but we have been there and done that to no avail. My suggestion is to go back to the basics and work around your issues in the game. <br />
<br />
Its kinda like the dude wiating in Qeynos for a SoW cause he desnt wanna run to HHP without it. There is a point where you should just suck it up and run cause waiting for that sow is going to make it even longer , if that makes any sense to you.<br />
<br />
The true mentality of the shaman is simple. Intelligent , wise and proud. Bickering and holding our breathe is not our style and it doesnt get anything done. To me there isnt much a point to it anymore.<br />
<br />
<br />
So my suggestion , work around it. Radient Cure is a fairly good option to help this &quot;problem&quot;</div></div><hr />

The reason they are so united is because the moderators of those boards delete the posts that don't agree with the majority.  I don't know about you, but I for one have posted stuff only to wonder where my post went (on the other boards).  I can appreciate seeing both sides of an argument, so I am glad we reside on a &quot;free&quot; message board.<br />
<br />
THEY MAY TAKE OUR POSTS, BUT THEY WILL NEVER TAKE OUR FREEDOM!!!<br />
<br />
um yeah</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">To address your points Steveo:<br />
<br />
1. Every class has useless spells. Be thankful every single one of our level 65 spells has a definate use. We know when we turn in a rune we will get a decent spell. Of course maybe that's to pay us back for the pain of the spectral spells. <br />
<br />
2. Alchemy as it is right now is not for the poor or low level Shaman. I do it and it is profitable and I do make more than sow potions. You won't make 100k a week but I know I could make 20k if I put enough effort into it. However you do have to have the cash to begin with to get started. That may or may not be a problem depending on where you are. It is however useful despite what some say.<br />
<br />
3. Slow mitigation does suck and I do not agree with it especially if you go ahead and make stuff immune anyway. However no one has ever turned me down for a group because mobs mitigated slow. <br />
<br />
4. Spell drop rates....that's a tough one. I got all my spells in a reasonable time but I know I got lucky somewhat. It is possible to get your spells if you work at it. However if you level up very fast and spend no time in Kunark you better have ways of making money or some kind friends because you will not have all your spells. However again, it appears our spells up to 60 will soon become researchable so depending on what that takes it could be rather trivial to get your spells up to 60 soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">1. Malo/torpor, possible option to research them.<br />
2. Disinfecting Aura, loved it, completely bewildered when we got it, sucks to lose it--but no big deal.<br />
3. I'll take slow mitigation over slow immunity.<br />
4. Stoicism for low level shamans, that's a huge bone.<br />
5. LoY spell complaints? Look at necro/sks. New 52 FD....yay....<br />
6. Alchemy is more fun with LoY than at any time in the history of EQ. With the addition of focus potions and illusion potions, what more do you want?<br />
<br />
The bone's been thrown, some people just like to deny it's existance, because it's so much easier to sit back and complain--old habits die hard, eh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>kaid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Here is something new you guys may find interesting from sony.<br />
<br />
With this patch we introduced the ability for intelligence casters (Enchanters, Magicians, Necromancers and Wizards) to create additional spell scrolls using their research skill. Many of the newly researchable spells have only been available from quests or killing NPCs in the past. The new research still requires components from risky locations or dangerous foes. Our goal is to increase the number of ways to earn rare spells, without reducing the challenge required.<br />
<br />
This, however, creates a bit of an inequity between the intelligence casters and the priest classes (Clerics, Druids and Shaman) when it comes to acquiring this type of spell. While there is nothing inherently wrong with different classes earning their spells in different ways, we don't see a reason to give more options to one type of caster than another. In this case, we have taken the opportunity to give the research skill a little more value and at the same time negate any imbalance between classes.<br />
<br />
Some time in the near future we plan to introduce recipes for the creation of certain spells for the priest classes. Intelligence casters can use their research skill to create these priest spell scrolls, and priest classes will benefit by having an alternate method for obtaining these spells. This helps out both priests and intelligence casters, and creates a new niche for research as a trade skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The only real beef is the situation with our spectrals.<br />
<br />
That's just plain dumb.  <br />
<br />
I don't get the change to DA, that part is also dumb, but it doesn't have much impact.  It does show a shocking lack of knowledge and foresight.  <br />
<br />
In any event, Shaman are fine as a class, imho.  Wish I had my focus items back though....<br />
<br />
Druids needed to whine, because their situation was pathetic for a time.  That's not right for any class, even druids.   :p<br />
<br />
P.S. Yes, Avatar is also broken, as are Kunark spell drops.  But maybe there's an alternative route now.  We train in research now?  There'll always be something to be unhappy about, makes you appreciate the stuff that does make you happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Racknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Wait, you forgot about INT caster being able to research our high level spells in the near future.  That's like a double edged bone.</div></div><hr />

Some folks want spell drops increased, some want their focus items back, some want to sit around and do alchemy and have it mean something (good for them).  As for me, I just want my horse back the way it was.  I'm pretty content otherwise.  Shoot, there's always playerauctions.com for the spells :P<br />

<br />
My whole point is that i regularly see good ideas here and good (and bad) discussions about them. Even when a big drive to be heard is made and a huge thread is growing (Remove Str and Dex Spells? (  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ... Last page ) its just falls into the void, unanswered and probably unread by anyone from SOE.<br />
<br />
Just makes me wonder if our concerns would be better heard elsewhere. Thats all.</div></div><hr />

1. Malo/torpor, possible option to research them.<br />
 Possibly not, or it may take months.<br />
<br />
2. Disinfecting Aura, loved it, completely bewildered when we got it, sucks to lose it--but no big deal.<br />
 It wouldn't be a big deal if any of the other classes had to buy this expansion just to get back a spell they already had. I'm still not going to waste my money thanks.<br />
<br />
3. I'll take slow mitigation over slow immunity.<br />
 The way mitigation was implemented acts to level the playing field for slow and that hurts the number 1 slower the most. Example, 70% * 50% = 35% slow for shaman, 50% * 50% = 25% for Beastlord. Instead of a 20% advantage you now have a 10% difference. They could have a straight percentage that is subtracted from your max, (ie 70% - 20% = 50% for shaman, 50% - 20% = 30% for beastlord). Or perhaps a new 50% poison slow and mobs that could only be disease or poison slowed.<br />
<br />
4. Stoicism for low level shamans, that's a huge bone.<br />
 Every other class except pure melee got 2 new spells, this is not a bone just to the Shaman class (who you'll recall only got 1 new spell).<br />
<br />

 See above comments by Zorlac<br />
<br />
6. Alchemy is more fun with LoY than at any time in the history of EQ. With the addition of focus potions and illusion potions, what more do you want?<br />
 I don't do any trade skills, they are boring, I couldn't care less if you could make rez potions with alchemy. I don't think the Shaman class should be balanced through alchemy.<br />
<br />
And you forgot 1 Boinshar:<br />
7. Affliction Focus nerf... ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The big problem, if there is indeed one, is that nobody at Verant ever decided what the shaman class was supposed to be.  When the game was being developed, Shaman were the kings of stat buffs.  However, unlike today, stat buffs were useful.  Strength made a big difference in damage.  Agility raised armor class substantially.  Unfortunately, the beta testers realized this pretty quickly and min/maxxed.  Everyone who made warriors used a Troll or Ogre.  Rogues and Paladins used Dwarves.  <br />
<br />
The developers were concerned that everyone would use the same few race/class combinations, so they lowered the usefulness of stats. Shaman just happened to get caught in the middle of that.  I'm not sure when slow was added to our arsenal, but I imagine that it was increased in power after stats effectiveness were changed.  Shaman have remained in a sort of limbo, without having their real usefulness defined.  Their low population in game has made them a low priority.  <br />
<br />
During beta, it seems that rogues and bards had the same general problems as shaman:  a lack of class definition.  <br />
<br />
Disclaimer:  These views were gleaned from conversations with those in beta, and not from my own experiences.  So take them with a grain of salt.</div></div><hr />

Now I'm have become a little cynical, generally unhappy kitty with the way we've been treated.<br />
<br />
I'm still furious about the spell change, this just after dealing with the foci change ect. <br />
<br />
They did add some fun stuff to alchemy, but the illusions or just that, fun and they are not exactly priced right for just the fun aspect. Do chanters have to use a star ruby (~78 plat) everytime they cast an illusion?<br />
<br />
One of the reasons I've gotten so cynical is I've spent a lot of time on Hobbez simply to have him be marginalized. Last night I got home late from work and I got a message from my GL asking me to please get my cleric on because they needed him. Wish Hobbez was so loved. Being shaman #4 on a raid blows big time. No matter what theres always something to do with my cleric. <br />
<br />
As far as to Sony reading the boards there was a discussion on the cleric board about this recently. Someone posted that sony keeps a close eye on the boards only to change things that players like and screw em up. Also as far as official sony contact, their only post there in about a year or so was an Ad for EQ online adventure. They went to post an ad, but couldn't actually make contact with the players or anything.</div></div><hr />

You do realize that doesn't change anything right?<br />
<br />
Slow mitigation &gt; slow immunity.<br />
<br />
Every other class except pure melee got 2 new spells, this is not a bone just to the Shaman class (who you'll recall only got 1 new spell).<br />
<br />
You are comparing a mini torpor to 2 in-line upgrades of minor spells from other classes.<br />
<br />
Torpor (and it's variations) is a game changing spell for shamans. I don't think I need to explain how much more mini torpor means to shamans than any other LoY spell to any other class.<br />
<br />
The fact that torpor's so rare makes mini torpor that much more desirable.<br />
<br />
See above comments by Zorlac <br />
<br />
I've pulled Vindi with a level 52 SK during Velius with just FD, the new FD makes life slightly easier for necros/sks and gets replaced easily at 60.<br />

 I don't do any trade skills, they are boring, I couldn't care less if you could make rez potions with alchemy. I don't think the Shaman class should be balanced through alchemy. <br />

LoY spell complaints? Look at necro/sks. New 52 FD....yay.... <br />
- No offense but 52 Death Peace clone just owns. FD failure rate (Death Peace cast time) but for SKs without Blood Ember legs it's a godsend. <br />
<br />
No joke.  A second chance for FD to work is the best.<br />

Complaining never worked for shamans becasue no one from SoE plays one it seems.  It's not what you know , it's who you know.  Get someone from the dev team, give them a 60 shaman and no pp and say, ok go get Topor and Malo.  After a few months of suffering you might see a change to the drop rates.</div></div><hr />

I play alot of different classes/races and all of them have problems. The thing is though is that its just a game, if you dislike it so much don't play. Whining and bitching back and forth solves nothing, just makes ya look like a bunch of spoiled brats who want more toys. All of these problems haven't prevented you from playing shaman, and haven't prevented us along with enchanters from being an essential part of any group post 55 or their abouts. Be thankful you don't play a ranger, they don't get groups, can only solo mobs with crap loot and generally get the shaft from soe as well.</div></div><hr />
