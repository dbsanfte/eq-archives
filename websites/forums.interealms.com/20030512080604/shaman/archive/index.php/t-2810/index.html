<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">but I've got ANOTHER epic question. I was going to do woe/envy/marr till I was max ally, and I've done it 3 or 4 times. But last night I did Kirn and had enough faction to agro so I've decided to try and do the rest &quot;by the book&quot;. Now, I haven't done the CoM reports, or the Ghisok books, but I have the books. Should I:<br />
<br />
(A) Turn in the books to make sure my faction is high enough for Neh to agro, but I'm not sure if it can get too high or not...<br />
<br />
(B) Just turn in the ring, and pray your faction is high enough since Kirn agroed, and turn in the books after you do Neh.<br />
<br />
Help me, I'm so conf00sed...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Do the reports, do the books, turn in the ring to neh.  All of the reports except the student log you can probably get in about 30 minutes with a group.  The student's log might take you 10 minutes, or 10 hours, depending on your luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I got attacked and didn't have time to say the right thing that makes him give you the pouch for the reports. Maybe I can just turn in the books without doing the pouch, or can I just go up to him and say the line to get the pouch. /Shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Same happened to me.  Darn tigers.  Spirit wouldn't talk to me afterwards.  Had to redo Dire. <br />
<br />
This was pre-&quot;adjustment&quot; though.  Maybe books, and books a 2nd time to keep the faction adjustments going appropriately?<br />
<br />
If I had this happen now?  I'd redo Dire again, then the reports, then the books, just to make sure everything's hunky dory.  If you do this and the spirit eats the books, your faction should be high enough to proceed to the next part of the quest.</div></div><hr />
