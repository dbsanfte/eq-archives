<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Perciville</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Started a Shammy on 2nd account recently and LOVE playing him. He's got decent gear so far, but having never played a casting class before, I dont know a whole lot on caster gear.<br />
<br />
Question is...  Where can I find a FT I or II item that I can get with out too much problems with my 56 Warrior???<br />
<br />
Thanks for the input<br />

<br />
TBH I can tell absolutely no difference between have no FT and having the FT2 I have now, but the earring just has damn nice stats anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Most of the readily available and/or tradeable FT items are recommended level 51 or so.  Your shaman would not benefit much if any from them.  Get a regen tunic instead - it will give you a lot more mana regen when you get canny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ikky BP will help out more than FT1 and it's cheap enough unless you really want to spend the cash on a Funguy.  Pretend your shaman is a ranger &amp; outfit him with the best combo of AC, HPs and then Wis.  Search this message board for reasons why.<br />
