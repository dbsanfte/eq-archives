As anticipated Sony has added click effects to PoP quest armors. Rogue ornate pants now have summon: scorae poison.<br />
<br />
Nice way to practice safe sex :p <br />
<br />
So what about ranger armor? Hurry and look, I'm dying of curiosity!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ugh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aedail Mistwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hah, they managed to something even more crappy than a snare on the BP, that's sad :/.<br />
<br />
They put a spell that lasts 2hours and 30minutes and costs 350mana to cast, and is outdated already at level 62 when rangers get Strenght of Tunare. As a level 65 ranger with Protection of the Wild I wouldn't even consider using that effect :/.<br />
<br />
I hate to be whining, but that's the sad truth.<br />
<br />
<br />
We don't seem to be the only class that had a kinda crappy selection of effect on BP, Enchanters got Shield of Maelin on their robe, a typical spell that you don't cast often, it has long duration and is self only, but at least you don't downgrade yourself when casting it :/. Warriors on the other hand got Arcane Rune on their BP, which is an absolutely kickass effect, grats to them :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Shield of the Arcane, not Arcane Rune. the guy that posted that on steel warrior was confused. you really think they'd give us a 1500pt rune effect? Not that 300hp self buff isn't nice. But it's certainly not Arcane Rune =P<br />
<br />
 There's a thread of people posting their effects on the FoH board.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Taluvan Winterscar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">BP effects needs upgrading. Look at our SoV BP, they have right click CoE which is a unique spell that get used even at 60. But POP armor have a lvl 60 spell from previous expansion and one that no one past 62 would probably use is a joke. I mean come on, at least put Call of Rathe on it or something from POP rather than some stupid old spell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd really like to see them add Eagle Eye to more items.  As far as I know it's only on one item and there are exactly 2 of those across all servers cause they are in worthless IA.  It's a great spell, but annoying to keep memmed/buffed.  Eagle Eye as a perm effect would be even better.</div></div><hr />

No clue about the Legs and Breastplates though. Warrior Ornate Legs are Health, Elemental are Shield of Maelin. Warrior Ornate BP is Arcane shield or something.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
Elemental Armor effects for Melee/Hybrids seem to be these:<br />
<br />
Bracers - Vengeance 3 | Worn<br />
Boots - Vengeance 5 | Worn<br />
Gloves  - Aura of Bravery (3 Regen, 30 Atk) | Worn<br />
Helm - Faerune (Enduring Breath, See Invis, Ultravision) | Worn<br />

<br />
From the developer's corner:<br />
<br />
Planes of Power Class Armor<br />
We've been looking over the PoP class armor effects that went to live servers today, and we're likely to make changes to a few pieces.  We'll evaluate the armor sets and see about getting any changes onto the Test Server before Christmas break.  Please keep this in mind before you make a great effort to acquire any planar class armor, as the effects on it may change. <br />

I guess WP will be replaced with snare... :D</div></div><hr />

Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Yzen Danek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">What VI really needs to learn about putting effects on armor is:<br />
<br />
If you give pure melees armor spell effects, you need to also give every other class effects that they cannot already cast. <br />
<br />
If, for some reason, they must put on an effect we can already cast, it needs to cast as fast or faster than the spell we already have, or save us an appreciable amount of mana. If there are no new spell effects to give casting classes without blurring class roles, then upgrades to existing spell lines work well, e.g. the cry of fire effect on Vex Thal gloves. Few enough people see each high end upgrade that granting a spell upgrade in that fashion isn't going to unbalance anything. <br />
<br />
For rangers in particular, anything else is useless to our class. Rangers are never strapped for mana during the buffing phase of a raid. Never. Clerics, shamans and enchanters are over in the corner laying down many thousands of mana of buffs per group, and we all regen mana at the same rate. Even a single ranger can buff a full raid on one bar of our relatively puny mana pools, and be ready to go before the primary buff classes are done and full mana again.<br />
<br />
Even PoTW on the bp would be pretty useless. This is a spell that only needs to be cast once every 2 and a half hours, that's 1500 ticks, for a mana cost of 450. That's equivalent to FT0.3. One third of one mana point per tick. On the breastplate, the flagship of the armor set. Riiight. The gloves are Vengence III, and the BP is FT0.3.<br />
<br />
If it were me making that armor, I'd just put 41% haste on the ranger bp, and fix that seemingly ubiquitous problem I read about for rangers getting shackled to Swiftwind. Problems solved; everyone's happy. Put 'Effect: Swift Spirit' on the Elemental BP, and you're an itemizing champion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Sean SpiritArrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Effect on Ranger elemental legs is Spirit of the Predator, 8 sec cast...<br />
<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
P.S. I'm not kidding, please shoot me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Mortok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Yup I agree with ya Yzen Danek.  Maybe one day Verant will put good effects on our stuff again.  They started out with the Tolan armor being good... with Summon Arrows and port on the BP they really gave us hope.  I wish they would have stayed to that and put totally new effects on ATLEAST the BP.  When I saw the first Velious quest BP with Call of Earth on it I was pissed.  I highly doubt the elemental BP will have anything new.  Probably will have PotW.  Oh well.<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW... whats the stats on the leggings Sean?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Sean SpiritArrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">50 AC, 155hp, 140 mana, 17 Str, 20 Dex, 15 Sta, 18 Wis, 5 SV Fire/Disease/Poison, 30 SV Cold/Magic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Mortok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Seems to be better than your Spiked Chain Leggings... other than the effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Celt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Heh jeez even flowing thought  would have owned spirit of the predator click :P  Would be nice to have an expansive mind clicky for rangers and beastlords :P <br />
<br />
Why do they give us spells we can cast already, that's just ludicrous :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Shaod_TZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Spirit of the Preditor ...<br />

Thats pathetic that Ornate legs have a much better effect than elemental.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Azarius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">i would like to see aura of resolution on bp, and aura of valor on legs, just looked those up on lucy very nice effects.  that would balance out with the rest of the set and with other items put us close to atk and regen caps at same time.<br />
<br />
aura of reso = 5 regen 50 atk<br />
aura of valor = 4 regen 40 atk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Kinidyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Druid boots are Mana Preservation IV and Monk gloves are Celestial Tranquility.  We are getting hosed hardcore on effects of our armor, it's really not even laughable.<br />

The math there is not difficult.  From what I've seen all the hybrids are getting screwed with Spell Effects on thier PoP armor, how about some swift spirit as opposed to crap vengenance.  I mean geez.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Sasandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">actualy vengence 3 is far better than celetial traquility, celetial traquility does not stack with either SoV or SoT which is about 134 visable atk between those two, vengence 3 on the other hand does stack, none of the monks in my guild even click their epic anymore (celetial traquility is their epic effect) because it's useless now due to stacking issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Sean SpiritArrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">The ornate gloves have less hp and worse stats than their epic gloves, and an identical effect. And Epic is a joke to get for a monk - I wouldn't complain about their gloves, it's not an upgrade at all.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>shion graywords</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">heh, since VI is unoriginally copying epic effects now, might as well throw on Swift spirit and a right click earthcall on the armor, better than Warders and Predator.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Davood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">heh putting right click avatar on the bps is MASSIVELY better then any right click ranger spell that could be on ranger armor haha... shaman get turgur as a click... hmm<br />
<br />
well who knows.. maybe they will put avatar on the ranger armor too...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Hawkwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Actually I bet we will not get Avatar, the Paladin Elemental BP gets the new Brell's so I would guess we get PotW. Our boots probablly have Vengeance 5 since the rogue boots do (and our ornate follows that pattern) and would guess we also get Aura of Bravery (again rogues). Helm as was pointed out was Faerune, arms Regen and Legs SotP (bleh on both), and finally bracers Vengeance 3. That looks to be our whole set...some of it obviously effect wise is dissapointing to say the least in my opinion.</div></div><hr />
