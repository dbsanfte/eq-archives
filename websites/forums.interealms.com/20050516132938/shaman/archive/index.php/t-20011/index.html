That aside. I made a few toons on the new server and stumbled upon a paladin quest in kaladim where you turn in 4 bone chips and get EXP. Well on my BST i dinged level 9 in like 30 min for handing in bones which seems so much faster then even the best power leveling. You can then take skill points and train up what you missed and the bone turn ins give you cash and items to sell. My BST is fully equiped with newbie quest armour and has more then 10 plat to spare cause of this quest and my beserker was able to self fund himself partialy ( beast was after i found it on my zerker and he fully funded himself ). Everfrost drops a plethera of bone chips and you can buy them too for like 1-2 plat a stack if you are careful about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
I wonder if there is a quest after this cause it seems to top out at level 9.  Crushbone belts maybe ?  I wonder if there is something after that too...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Been known about for along time..<br />
in fact I think I used that quest in 1999.. and it and CB belts are about the same.. <br />
Belts might take you to 11 or so, but not really worth it. I guess you could probably use legionarre shoulderpads after that, but thats 4 per turn in, and alot rarer than belts.<br />
<br />
I believe there is a similiar bone chip quest in Qeynos, Gnoll fangs are pretty good as well I think. And moonstones are nice for like 1 to 5 I think. They are the reward for gnoll fang quest, and many times you can find hundreds on merchants in Qeynos for about a gold each.<br />
<br />
I think all the good exp quests like that stop at about lvl 11.. heh remember tumpy tonics? You'd have like 90 people in FP handing them into that guy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tienen Crazywolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wow, does this thread bring back memories =) Not on my shaman of course, none of the xp quests seemed geared towards trolls, but oh man did my first char, my druid take advantage of these quests! I think he got like 4 levels off tumpy tonics, maybe more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd love to see your skills after powering up to that level.  *snicker*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Don't forget the wine quest in neriak, that one works well up to like 14 or so. Gnoll fangs isn't very good, the fangs are all no drop. Lightstones and greater lightstones have a quest in nk at the gypsy camp thats supposed to be good xp, and theres the runnyeye warbeads quest in runnyeye. Also theres quest in halas for ice goblin beads and I think ya can turn the gnoll fangs in there also. THen theres the bandit sash quest in qeynos as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>iso2202</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Back when Grobb wasnt being ruled by those amphibious freaks, Froglok Blood was definately the way to go, gave huge amounts of exp, wish they still had that...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i really wish they would incorperate more quests like this to go into higher levels. I mean i can understand not making them quite as fast and easy, but it would be nice to have some places that you exp/explore in and some of the drops were for exp. I dont care about how fast it literaly was, im talking about how fast it seems. It just doesnt feel like grinding, it makes EXP more of a natural flow of the game rather then torture you have to endure to reach higher and newer content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">There was the shark meat quest like this, where you handed in shark meat for exp and cash. The only problem was that you could buy the meat from a vendor in Thugadin, and then head back to G'fay to hand it in. People were leveling chars upto 30's and 40's with this.<br />
<br />
Sony nerfed the meat off the vendor back in the begining of 2001 about a month before I started playing :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Oh yea, when I was powerleveling my friends cleric, we got him from 1 - 50 in 3 days of average playing, He was level 25 in the first 4 hours I belive. I just got him 8 toolbox's full of pads from EC and WC, he turned them in, then we pulled bandits in NK and he turned in the sashes. After that we moved to Highhold where he would solo goblins and turn in their ears. Then sense he was evil sarnak tails in OT. and finally just god old fashioned nuke down and zone till 50.<br />
<br />
And yes, he was the worst cleric ever for like 3 weeks while he got his alteration up to a normal level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dalarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There is another quest in the paladin guild in kaladim for aviak talons, these drop off of Krag Elders (hard to find) and Aviaks in OOT (whole island of 'em). Was still decent experience (most of a blue per hand in of 4 talons) around level 20, just not very efficient as the talons don't drop everytime and don't stack. May go back now that my berserker can kill everything but Gull Skytalon and see if they drop a bit faster when I'm pulling more than half the spawns.<br />
<br />
The problem with doing the quest to level route is defense skill. The others you can spam minor heal or spend points on, defense you cannot. It sucks to be level 15+ with a defense skill of 2 (had a bard like that).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Qeynos badge of honor has excellent exp return.  I did this quest a ton in my 40's.  Besides the killing of the mobs for the quest, it was the only experience I got in my 40's.  Think I used this til i was 51.  Exp grinding is still, by far a lot faster.  I had a lot of fun doing this quest and at the end everyone I knew had the badge of honor.  The badge of nobility, however, takes quite a bit longer to finish up.  Thing is, about 2 or 3 months ago when I went back to do it for old times sake, the interrogator was bugged and I couldn't finish.  No idea if it was ever fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The weapon turnin quest from veksar isn't really that bad for exp.  Every set of 4 seemed to net me (solo) another percent of AA.  I don't think I can really hope for more out of a quest at lvl 65, and it was a nice bonus as I maxed out my cabilis faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I remember back in the day farming the hell out of the orcs just for belts, buying them from other people for low, and then selling them to others for high (2pp a belt was a killer price).<br />
<br />
Made a few hundred plat and I thought i was uber.  And what did I buy with all my new plat after I ran over to East Commons and haggled a bit?<br />
<br />
A silvery axe for my warrior...6/22 and I was a berserker!  God I miss that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Iknumon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Mammoth calf hides is a nice little quest in Everfrost. Turn em in (I recall it's 4 at a time) to the rogue on the second floor of the bank in Halas; you get experience and a random rogue-armor piece that you can immediately sell to the vendor downstairs. Did that with both my war and my shammy for aeons.  Given the faction I got there, those guys should make me their queen.<br />

Crushbone sholderpads &amp; belts are still good though. Got some mad XP at 44 for the Stoicisim quest - about a full yellow IIRC. Round that level it might be worth doing the quests for other classes as well, if the turnin item drops.</div></div><hr />

I just leveled  a zerker and a BST ont he new server with the bone chip quest. If that baby is nerfed i cant imagine what it used to be like  :eek: <br />

I got my GF from lvl 2 to 7 in about 12 min or so. Any i was distracting her too ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I still have 1880 Shark Meat sitting on a mule  :D   I loaded up a mule full of meat the night before they removed the meat off the vendor in Thurg.   I just use it to fix/raise factions in Kelethin.<br />
<br />
There was the shark meat quest like this, where you handed in shark meat for exp and cash. The only problem was that you could buy the meat from a vendor in Thugadin, and then head back to G'fay to hand it in. People were leveling chars upto 30's and 40's with this.<br />
<br />
It would take you ages to reach level 30 or 40 with that quest.  It took me a full backpack 200 meats to get to level 8.  At that point the xp really slowed down.   It takes forever to do because you have to ask for a container, open container, put in 1 meat in each of 4 slots, combine, hand container in, get item, drop item in inventory, ask for new pack, repeat.<br />
<br />
And after doing it... your skills SUCK!   I'm half tempted to reroll my Berserker because at level 10 his Defense is a whopping 2!!! and his Offense is 5!!.  I could PL him back to 10 in under an hour easy.   The ONLY benefit of doing quests is faction.  Those 200 shark meat made my Berserker Ally with the warrior guild in Kelethin and warmly to the merchants (Barb berserker).<br />
<br />
IMO is faster and easier to just PL the normal way.  Your skills are much better at the end and it really doesn't take as long.  Here is some of my logs from PL'ing my wizard with Jaradis.  <br />
<br />
[Thu Mar 27 01:05:21 2003] You have gained a level! Welcome to level 27!<br />
[Thu Mar 27 01:26:18 2003] You have gained a level! Welcome to level 28!<br />
[Thu Mar 27 01:46:25 2003] You have gained a level! Welcome to level 29!<br />
<br />
20 mins a level.<br />
<br />
[Sun Apr 06 04:01:48 2003] You have gained a level! Welcome to level 32!<br />
[Sun Apr 06 04:38:21 2003] You have gained a level! Welcome to level 33!<br />
[Sun Apr 06 05:18:59 2003] You have gained a level! Welcome to level 34!<br />
<br />
<br />
~35-40 mins a level (Tizmak were going light blue, so xp was getting poor).<br />
<br />
With a druid or enchanter you can go even faster depending on the class.</div></div><hr />

I can't remember the name of the guy but he's in South Qeynos.  I could find him easy but can't really say how to get there.  You can find the quest on Allakhazam's.  Its one of the original quests I did back in 1999.  Nice way to get faction in Qeynos with the goodies, but it trashes your faction with certain types.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Chesgard Sydwen  (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=2825) is your guy. It lowers your bloodsabers faction, but it's no big deal as they are only in one part of the city.<br />
<br />
You get some PP and an item that you can sell back to the guy next to Chesgard Sydwen. I used this quest to make cash when I was younger and skint :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">After 2 nights, I went from 1-30...about 9 hours played with a 51 Druid PLing me.  Once you hit 40, it slows down unless you have a 60 standing by to take over.  But really, once you hit 40 you have to spend so much time working up all of your skills that it is usually better to just play it out from there IMO.  The only good news is that your Off and Def should be close to being maxed out :D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Tolfu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Ther was a quest in DSP where you quested for a spear. A part of the quest where you did a hand in and got the turn in item back along with another item gave about as  good exp as a lvl60 gets from killing a blue mob. People were just turning in the item, destroying the reward item and repeating the turn in over and over and over .........of course it has been nerfed.<br />
<br />
The bone chip quest is useful I guess if you haven't twinked too much and don't have much support in the form of a second account.  I use to use the bone chip quest for some alts I did earlier, but recently, I just don't bother. Getting to lvl9 when you have a lvl 1 character with 1000hps, endless heals and damage shields probably won't take as long as standing in Kaladim handing in bone chips, even when you don't include the time to get the bone chips :)<br />
<br />
But yah, I wish there were forms of gaining exp in this manner outside of killing mobs. Quest designed just for exp, that you can do solo. That was actually worth doing, but also not so easy that it replaces what we already have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">i really wish they would incorperate more quests like this to go into higher levels.

<br />
Go up to PoHate~  Armor drops you can handin for extra exp when you are done.  It'd be nice to have more similar things though I agree, sucks just that 1 zone and the exp isn't even that fantastic even with the extras.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Here's a bit of info on the lightstone quest.<br />
<br />
There is a version of it for good guys and bad guys. I guess agnostics can do both?<br />
<br />
But anyway, you hand in either regular or greater lightstones to the gypsies in North Karana if you are a goodie.  Watch out for griffawns and griffons!  Faster than SOW, some of 'em.   This gives you faction with some of the good guys, like the citizens of freeport or something like that -- various freeport and karanas citizen and vendor type faction.<br />
<br />
Bad guys like my iksar and my ogre hand in lightstones to the DE merchants in the desert in South Ro.  For this you get factions with such people as Dark Bargainers(they're in Neriak, the DE town, for instance).  It's a nice way to repair (some) DE faction if you screw it up killing DE's.<br />
<br />
As I recall, you can get druids to take you to south ro and wizzies can do south ro and maybe north ro too.  So it can be done pretty fast, which is nice, because the lightstones don't stack!<br />
<br />
Now, talk to the NPC's in the two camps and you'll see they take either regular or greater lightstones.  Hand in your lightstone and I forget what you get for the lesser, but for the greater you get a container that sells for the merchant right next to you for 9pp each.  They are similarly priced at vendors, so unless you're really dirt poor, you can do this for quite a while without suffering even if you buy all your lightstones.<br />
<br />
So you get experience and faction and cash for turning in the lightstones.  Lightstones are very common on vendors in West Commonlands and similar areas wherever willowisps are.  <br />
<br />
If you want to kill them yourself, though, you'll need a magic weapon if you're using melee; regular ones don't work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I used the light stone quest to pl a chanter to 4th so he could invis others (for other faction quests)<br />
while they dont stack I did gain exp so fast my escort asked me what was beating on me...I went from 0 exp to almost done with 5th in about 2 min. I had to sell stuff back to the merchant and get more stones from my escort but it was blazing. <br />
and with the right faction/Cha you can make a PROFIT turning in gls's to these merchants and selling the containers. <br />
<br />
also they are the last of the monk containers, ultra low weight giant size and easy to get.</div></div><hr />
