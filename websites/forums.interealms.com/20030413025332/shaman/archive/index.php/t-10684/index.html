<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sarathi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Got a question, I am on the last step of my Epic ( Kill Lord Rax Ashiir), I turned in my tear, he went aggro we died :( . Question is do I have to get another Tear and turn it in, or will he just aggro when he spawns.</div></div><hr />

I just finished mine the other night. For those interested the mage pet way still works well. We had 3 mages, 2 with fire pet up and one with his epic pet. Fight lasted about 5 minutes with only one pet going down during the whole thing.<br />
<br />
Also a word of warning, my original guild was never gonna be able to do the Hole or Neh part so I did the shortcut. Later I changed guilds and was able to do the quest progression correctly. When I turned in my scale the spirit ate it! A gm looked and my faction was all hosed up. He said it was probably just a glitch but he reset my faction to low ally and I had to go do the shortcut again anyway. So if you have any doubts about your faction/quest progression I would recommend having a guide/gm with ya when you turn in the scale.</div></div><hr />

The message said my true spirit faction could not get any better. a couple days later I did the Rak portion of the quest and turned in my scale np.</div></div><hr />
