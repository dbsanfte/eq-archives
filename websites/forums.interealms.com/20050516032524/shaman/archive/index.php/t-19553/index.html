Now it went from a Super Avatar to now our old berserk line with some oomph :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Actualy its not bad. Its obviously a AA and its obviously for us. &quot;Someone has been infused with the power of avatar&quot;  or whatever. Depending on the AA cost, its not horrible, oh and it needs to have a short reuse time and stack with Q.<br />
<br />
If all above falls in line, i would probably get it.<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
<br />
NM i just noticed it self only.<br />
<br />
I guess its still cute if it stacks with Q though. Now if this was a group spell....</div></div><hr />

It's for clerics - not joking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Like I said in the other thread, Fine, give clerics a melee AA if you must, but for ****'s sake call it something without the word &quot;Avatar&quot; in the damn name. Yaulp 7 or whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>lfclan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So.... Clerics got melee upgrades, new hammer spell, and now get a 200% damage increase AA buff.....<br />
<br />
Seems clerics are the actual battle priests we were supposed to be not BSTs....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah, playing a cleric is looking tempting for once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah, playing a cleric is looking tempting for once.<br />
<br />
<br />
Makes no sense for a cleric to have, UNLESS it turns into group v1 or v2.<br />
No cleric would buy that AA if it's self-only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You must have forgotten all the clerics with summon hammers that melee now.<br />
<br />
They would love that AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Whilst its self only and for clerics its not that great.<br />
<br />
Cleric melee is all about proc damage, they actually hit for not much at all, 200% very little is still well, very little.<br />
<br />
Just the naming of it is utterly stupid, otherwise its not really anything other than rabidbear for clerics.<br />
<br />
(Ps SoE, how about upgrading rabidbear with some of this 200% melee damage stuff eh?) =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Sebazy is right on the dot, its rabid bear for clerics.  The stats this AA adds are virtually worthless for clerics (just like RB is for us) because of their skill caps, so the net DPS added by using this AA is negligible, and certainly not worth the AAs they have to spend to get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>lfclan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ok, Im curious about this, If a cleric can hit mobs for say... 40 to 60 points of damage with the hammer they have wouldnt the buff increase of 200% make them hit for 120 to 180? <br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
Is it a total effect on the clerics damage output? Like if they do melee a mob for say a total of 3k in damage over the entire fight then if thy pop the AA skill it will actually make the total damage they do for the entire fight 9k?<br />
<br />
OR <br />
<br />
Am I just loooooney?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dorrian Bloodstone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Slot 4 is unknown 200, the same unknown as in the weapon affinity aa that increases proc rate.  What this ability appears to give is:<br />
<br />
1. Haste (100 hands effect)<br />
2. Melee damage increase of 200%...bringing standard parsed melee dps of cleric hammer from 5dps to 15dps?  Maybe.<br />
3. Doubling of proc rate on level 3 of this AA.  (Essentially moving proc damage from 25dps to 50dps)<br />
4. HoT which stacks with all other HoTs  200/tick for 5 ticks (1000 heal)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">This is a crap AA for Clerics, and one we would jeer at if we got it.  <br />
<br />
It should be improved so it's actually useful for clerics.  I have no issues at all with their ability to melee.<br />
<br />
In fact, I think all classes should get double attack at level 50.  Call me crazy, but it wouldn't really change anything at all, except allow a little extra dimension that would be fun.  <br />
<br />
Everyone can melee up to level 20 or so, adding a little bit of flair back wouldn't alter any balance relationships at all, since I still am not going to melee in the EP, or Sol Ro or anywhere else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">They haven't changed the spell info on it, nor the class that will have it.  They won't change the spell text either until the end.  I think they just changed the spell text on ACP from the old Ancient Chaotic Breath text to the possibly final text.  Breath of Trushar still has the text for Cannibalize.<br />

see i thought this was the same one, but isnt it odd that it gives the exact same message our avatar gives??</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, it was cut/pasted from our Ferine Avatar Spell.<br />
<br />
This is a crap AA for Clerics, and one we would jeer at if we got it.<br />
<br />
So 200% damage, stackable haste, double proc and a 100pt less Quiescence is something you would jeer at.<br />
<br />
It should be improved so it's actually useful for clerics. I have no issues at all with their ability to melee.<br />
<br />
I do, they shouldn't be the melee power in the priests.</div></div><hr />
