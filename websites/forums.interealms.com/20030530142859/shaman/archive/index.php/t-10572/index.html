<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>lantril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi everyone this is my first post here in this community.<br />
<br />
I have an Iksar shaman on Bristlebane, currently level 15 and having a great time.<br />
<br />
I had an account previously where I played a druid to level 50 on Povar. I stopped playing around the time Kunark was released.<br />
<br />
How different it all is now !<br />
<br />
Paid my first visit to the bazaar last night, what a wonderful idea, shame about the lag though.<br />
<br />
Which brings me on to a question about money-<br />
<br />
I have a cleric friend who is level 54 (His nagging is the reason I started playing again) and he is keen to help me raise some money to buy armor and a good weapon. I need to raise about 1200-1500 pp for the items I wanted.<br />
<br />
So with that in mind, could anyone give me any tips as to a good spot where a 54 cleric could raise that sort of money fairly easily ?<br />
<br />
I think Hill giants were the best source of money in the old world although I remember that I made most of my early plat selling the bracer that Capt Surestout drops..Heh fat chance of that being worth much in todays expansive economy.<br />
<br />
Well thanks for reading my ramblings.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Caix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1500pp... One Spider Silk is 10pp on Xegony... hmm... 150 of them... that's like less than 8 stacks.<br />
<br />
There's prob much better ideas for a lev 54 cleric though. Thats what tiny little me would do ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Crystal Caverns in Eastern Wastes (Velious) is a good source. The geonids drop gems, you can make about 1kpp an hour selling them to vendors. Alternatively there is a good supply of spiders right next to the geonids, which drop crystalline spider silks. They sell for quite a few pp each.<br />
<br />
Hill giants are still an option, but farmed quite heavily.<br />
<br />
Alternatives are to go for loot camps, e.g Frenzy camp in Velketors, Crpyt in Old Sebilis. You'll need to group up for those, and so are dependant on winning a throw of the dice, but at least your cleric friend would be getting some xp at the same time.</div></div><hr />

There are some tips, but all depend on yours and your friends play style and comfort level with the zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Your best bet is probably trade skill supplies. One of the advantages of starting on an old server like Bristlebane is that there's lots of rich people that are working on tailoring and smithing. <br />
<br />
Also, ask your friend if he'd help you with the start of your epic. The shield is pretty good and the boots are priceless. They'll save your life often by the time you hit 50th lvl. Not sure if they work at any level but the clicky works at 20th, I did it with a friend not too long ago. Only place that you and a cleric would need backup  is for Black Dire. You'd probably need a 50th lvl melee around for him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>lantril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the info everyone.<br />
<br />
I think I will send him over to the crystal caves to try the Geos.<br />
<br />
I spoke to him on the phone just now but he is not quite sure of the best way to get to where they spawn as he has never been in before.<br />
<br />
I had a look at the map on Eqatlas and it has some tunnels marked as their spawn point, however I am not clear as to whether the exit marked nearby is just an exit or if you can get in that way as well.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Don't know about your server, but on Bertoxx, Old Sebilis is still plenty busy for a few groups, and the gem and coin drop in there is pretty good.  Not unusual to clear 500 pp or so for a session with a good group.  Do the pyramid, and get lucky with drops from the Scarabs, and you could easily double that.</div></div><hr />
