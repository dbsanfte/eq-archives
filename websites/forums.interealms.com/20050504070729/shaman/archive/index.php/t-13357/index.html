<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This should've been written as a complaint.  The fact that we got &quot;upgrades&quot; that made these tiny changes, while the mobs got substantial HP upgrades is ludicrous.  When I'm in a PoP group, I don't even mem my DoT's as they just plain don't help.  DD's?  At times...   However, I usually don't have room for a spell that's useful 'once in awhile.'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Poison Dot is a nice upgrade, particularly without the DD component. Agreed though, breath of ulthor isn't as good as I'd like and the dps is barely better than Pox. Still, having dots that don't break root is a big boost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hello, spells forum!<br />
<br />
I guess I'm a ghetto shaman, since I have no focus items.  <br />
<br />
This is a sizable upgrade, we can do 8000 points of damage in 2 minutes using just our 2 top dots.  Not near what the mobs can do, nor is it scaled up from our level 60 damage as the generic lev 65 yard trash mob is scaled up from lev 60 mobs elsewhere.<br />
<br />
The fact these don't break root is the biggy, tho, and makes them more than just decent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jorgan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Not quite off topic, but this odd thing happened to me the other day:<br />
<br />
I have a (now) 65 shaman and (still) 62 ranger, whom I used to 2-box often in UP to hunt down named.  At the time, both were 62 and I would sometimes leave them ungrouped to get those archery aa's faster for my ranger.  With KEI on my shaman, I could slow and dot--usually BoN and sometimes E-Bolt, two casts of each when mana would allow it.  Moktors are always relatively long fights and all of these dots would go full term.  I'd also use a dog, sometimes alpha'd, always hasted.  My ranger at the time had, after killing a few named, a windblade, but only 21% haste, and all the ranger and shaman buffs available up to level 62.<br />
<br />
I went back recently after hitting 65 and after also recently getting breath of ultor.  I have Cann5 and didn't need KEI.  Ranger now had a windblade and 36% haste.  I left them ungrouped.  I had dogdog out, no alpha, both ranger and dog hasted and ranger fully buffed.  I cast Ultor and two banes (with a Ext Aff 3 item) and actually KS'd my ranger.  I'd never actually done that before without dotting and constant nuking.  <br />
<br />
I know that a ranger's melee isn't great dps, but had no idea that I could out dps him relatively easily with dogdog, ultor, and a couple of BoNs without really trying--really, at 65 most things were light blue and I'd rather all the experience get awarded.  It might have been a fluke.  I only replicated it one more time, because I'd rather not waste losing xp on LB mobs.  After that, I didn't cast Ultor any more and my ranger started getting the xp again.<br />
<br />
Anyway, take that for what it's worth--not much.  Probably just more evidence of why I should perma drop the ranger.  I guess I should really post this in the Ranger's Glade to give them something to chew on.<br />
<br />
Oh, and yeah, shaman got screwed on PoP upgrades, yadda yadda yadda.  Party line and all that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Shandy, if you do the math, our two old DOTs do 7700 approximately vs the 8000 you calculated in 2 minutes. Not much of an upgrade in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Or you could just forget DOTs and nuke instead. Let's see in 2 minutes I could nuke for 925 every 10 seconds approximately so over 2 minutes that would be 11,100 damage. Excluding crits,resists, and focus items. If we throw in say an extra 100 damage average for focus and crits that would be 12,200 damage. Granted nukes are more mana inefficent especially for Shamans and you can't do anything but chain nuke for 2 minutes but I bet you get less aggro unless you crit then dropping 3 bloods on a mob. Even if we say okay with these drawbacks, DOTs are better, they are NOT markedly better, but marginally better at best. And that is sad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">ooor you could stack the old dots WITH the new dots, and voila more damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xanivus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I mem Blood of Saryrn, Ancient: Scourge of Nice, and Bane of Nife in exp groups. Especially in BoT.

<br />
Where are you getting these endless spell slots?  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Valka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Its fun to tank mobs when you overdot, but it is surprisingly much less fun when said mobs quad-700+ and mitigate slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Plus the cast/recast times cut into your damage as well. You can make a case I suppose that DOTs are better than straight nukes. But it is NOT obvious and clear cut as I feel it should be. We are known much more as a class for our DOTs than our nukes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>EQScott</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My perspective is one who has played more than a few classes in the 50 to 65 range (including Shaman), although not in an uber guild.<br />
<br />
I think Shamans did very well with respect to upgrades in PoP.<br />
<br />
- We got an upgrade to Disease slow<br />
- We got a better pet<br />
- We got an upgrade to Focus<br />
- We got an increase to group regen<br />
- Swift Like the wind<br />
- Group Haste<br />
- We got an upgrade to Malo<br />
- Q<br />
- Upgrade to DoTs<br />
<br />
While each upgrade is not huge, the overall impact is quite substantial.  Shaman DPS was never meant to be on par with other classes because combined with buffs/slow/mana regen/pet it would be unbalancing.  What else would we need?<br />
<br />
I love my Shaman and I think we're doing just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yes the affliction focus effects make a big difference. Extend affliction is definitely pretty easy to get a lvl 3 focus for and alot harder to get for a lvl 4. Affliction efficiency isn't nearly as easy to get for lvl 3 altho not too bad to get for the lvl 4 pottery peice altho pretty poor stats.<br />
<br />
If you compair the base stats/ratios the new dots are a pretty nice upgrade and for root doting the lack of initial dmg is great. Personally I've gotten MP4 item and an extend everything focus item so I no longer use my AE3 or EA3 items at all and stick mostly with the new dots but if you don't have upgraded focuses the lvl 60 dots are alot more appealing especially if you aren't root doting.<br />
<br />
If you want a frustrating comparison try compairing our lvl 50 dots to wizzy nukes of the day and our lvl 65 dots to the wizzy nukes now. It's pretty sad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Inconceivable!<br />
<br />
As for focus effects affecting DPS, right on the money, the only difference would be in eliminating some of the re-casting time. (which is significant, but not expressed in the fanciful numbers presented here)<br />
<br />
Is it time to get pleasantly drunk and forget about this dps nightmare? I vote yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">DPS?  I can't believe I'm the first here to say &quot;if you want insane DPS, roll up a wizard&quot;.  Not my job!  Yes I CAN speed up fights substantially by throwing a bane out on each mob.  If I'm partnering with a mage, I have enough mana (without a purchased KEI, thankyouverymuch) to malo, slow, bane, and keep the mage pet healed in tier2 planes - and be FM at the end of the fight while the mage nukes away happily with his nexus-C3.  Yes you CAN tell the difference when I don't bane.  It's very very obvious when partnering.  Not so obvious in a full group, but it does speed things up, it just takes 3 times as long to register the same amount of impact (6 people vs. 2).<br />
<br />
Regardless - I'm happy when I can do some damage, but combat isn't all about raining fireballs down on mobs.  Shaman is a subtle class.  We have lots of interesting things to do in (and out of) a fight.  Which means we don't get the raw damage of some other classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">My point wasn't how much DPS we can contribute - my point was relative to just straight out nuking, DOTs are not markedly better. And I for one had always considered us known for our DOTs more so than our pitiful nukes.
