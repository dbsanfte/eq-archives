<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Holth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm stuck here with my Epic, each time the courrier pop, he does not drop the log... :(.<br />
I've got a question : my guild plan to kill Black Reavers for ours druids soon.<br />
If we killl Lord Ghiosk, can I take the drops or must I wait to complete the previous part of the Quest?</div></div><hr />

The best way to make sure you have enough faction is to do the turn-ins in the correct order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Loot the books off ghiosk, but don't turn them in.  Once you get the courier to drop the log, then you'll be ok to turnin your logs and then your books.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had the Ghiosk books for almost a year before I got around to getting the log.<br />
<br />
Luckily people on my server are now exping there so all I had to do was ask them for the log if it dropped.  That way i could go kill the goos in the center house and get some exp instead of having to kill all the YT hoping for the currier to spawn.</div></div><hr />
