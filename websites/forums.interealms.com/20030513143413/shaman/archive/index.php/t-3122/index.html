<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rakyn Vaeltaja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since the Mines of Nurga have been revamped, there have been some reports that Overseer Dlubish for the Iksar shaman cudgel quest no longer spawns in this zone.  Does anyone know whether he still spawns in this zone and if not, where he might be found?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Overseer no longer spawns in that location.  From what I have been told the quest, up to that point, is on hold.  Have you not noticed that the Heirophant on the left side has been removed from the normal servers?  Supposedly for a story change?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Skek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Heirophant Oxyn was removed due to an xp exploit. Part of the greenmist quest involves him, it was possible to keep handing the chunk of tynnonium to him repeatedly for free xp...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>brokenlimit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">2 things,<br />
1 yes the cudgel quests are broken until they fix nurga, &gt;&lt;, personally i have almost all of them done except for the slate chant rock and the skull canopic sigh<br />
2 i was told by a gm that heirophant oxyn was also bugged in the fact that he came up kos to everyone, so he was removed from the game until next patch, /shrug<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tolfu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As of last patch, Heirophant Oxyn is back up on AB server, dunno if Nurga has been fixed as well, checking on that when I get the chance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rakyn Vaeltaja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks Tolfu.  I'm doing the quests right now and the Nurga-part will come up shortly.  It'd be a shame to be stuck at the fifth cudgel in such a highly rewarding and fine quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Was just in Nurga and no Overseer - didn't know he was broken so I spent an insane amount of time there ... *sigh*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">woo, makes me glad i did this part a loooong time ago!<br />
all im waiting for is sufficient forces to do kaggy, VS/VSR, and then the last bit in HS.<br />
good hunting all, hope hey fix this soon!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tolfu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I spent over 4 hours in Nurga camping overseer and never saw him, maybe the next cycle would have spawned him, but I doubt it. Guess it's still screwed up and I am about fed up with this quest. Going back to exp fighting till all this crap is fixed, coulda been 60 by now, but wanted to have the 8th cudgel first as I will probably never see the epic with this toon as it's my alt and far too many shaman mains in my guild are without epic.</div></div><hr />
