<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>loobusk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Man is this pissing me off; <br />
Im able to run two instances of EQ in windowed mode. I also made it so that ALT+TAB would work under windows XP to switch between the two programs. And yeah, even on my P4 2.6 ghz HT, 1024mb ram, radeon 9800 pro, there is lag prevalent while running two sessions at once with above avg modes(all models, 1280x1024, full clipping, no FSAA or ansio.f) But I can deal with that. What I cant stand though is the fact that on random and unpredictable occasions I lose control of my mouse pointer when switching between the two instances. I have to ALT-TAB repeatedly to make it work , but it happens again and again, and gets REALLY aggravating when for example my duo needs to run and I cant target anything to follow, or when my tank needs a desperate heal from the cleric...the cleric is looking at the sky(Although I can use the keyboard to do some of this, it is virtually impossible to change directions, click on objects, or target; especially while on autofollow%T, which is most of the time.)<br />
It seems as though when this happens, the mouse pointer gets stuck on the start menu or the desktop. Trying to click on anything will result in the whole window itself being moved, and the start menu popping up. I've tried auto-hiding the startmenu, un checking the option to keep it below/above windows, etc. I even tinkered with tweakui, but to no avail. What the heck is causing this? Has anyone ever faced this problem before or perhaps know of a fix? Help would really be appreciated because more and more I try to play EQ under these cirumstances the more frustrated I am getting with the game altogether. <br />
P.S I use a optical cordless, Logitech MX 700 mouse and cordless keyboard combo. Winxp SP1, all the latest drivers, no background programs or detectable ad/spyware (I'm kind of a freak at this:/ ), cable connection.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Try eqwindows. Running 2 everquest is a huge system hog, eqwindows seems to manage it alot better. Read the forums for a few, faq's, etc. I use it on my 1.5ghz system with 512 ram and geforce3 ti200, runs pretty good(I put another hard drive in and use it as the system swap drive, helped performance)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sorvani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">aditionally forget the mouse. unlss i'm slowing in a multi-pull(non-AE), looting, or opening a door i don't even think about touching my mouse. the F1 through F6 keys target yourself through the last person in your group. In you 2-box set-up hit F2 after your groups then type /fo to begin following and then alt-tba over to other window and then who cares if mouse ponter isnt' there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I get the same problems man sometimes.  I have about an equal machine as yours except i'm running an Athlon 2600+ with duel DDR 512s (1024 total).  What does happen to me when i can't use the mouse, and maybe this doesn't happen to you.. is that if I'm zoning with one character and try to switch to the other one, I am not able to use my mouse.  This is really only a problem when we are wiping, so I usually save my character and let the one I bot fight for himself :)<br />
<br />
I will have to try out eqwindows though.  I never have before even though I've been using 2 EQs on the same computer for about a month.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">eqwindows also has a nice little feature were you can switch between eq instances by pressing ctrl-alt-S quite handy.</div></div><hr />

I used to have the same problem when i was using a USB mouse and in windowed mode. I switched to a ps2 mouse the problem went away but now my keyboard is freezing up randomly!</div></div><hr />
