<p class="largefont">Click here for full thread: <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=11727">56... My current wall</a></p>
<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fulgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I quit the game, then returned. I was 55 when I quit... so I rushed through to 55 on my server.... I now arrive at 56 and find my first real wall...<br />
<br />
I have my spells and skill maxxed, but boy oh boy.... getting a &quot;DECENT&quot; group is really sucking.... I lost most of my friends when I quit and my current guild has about ummmm... 5 active members... so I am stuck getting pickup groups....<br />
<br />
I have mainly been in PON lately. I have 910 unbuffed AC/JBB no horse no epic......not tier two flagged.<br />
<br />
the question....<br />
<br />
Where is the best xp. I am really looking to get to 60 then AA.....<br />
<br />
My server is Karana...........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Mind soloing?  If pick-up groups got you bummed atm, try soloing Katta Guards.  I recommend Nathyn's Mansion Guards.  They are on their own faction, no issues hosing it really.  I went threw 56-58 pretty quickly on them.  Monotonus and crud for loot, but very easy to do.<br />
<br />
You could also try soloing in High Hold Keep.<br />
<br />
Or...soloing the Chardok zone-in (or bring a friend and duo there).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chelesa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I pretty much hit a wall at 56 too and just lost interest in trying to xp after a few bad incidents.  I got tired of PoN pretty quickly.  The two best places IMO are Plane of Innovation and Plane of Disease (especially a courtyard group).  Both places make the experience fly by if you've got a good group.  Just don't kill yourself by trying to slow an archaic model in PoI. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grayskies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ZI/ZO Tunnels in Charok got me through 56-58 fast, plus I would always walk away with a decent amount of cash, FS from the Chokidai and lots of drops for my Bazaar mule.<br />
<br />
You can single pull these tunnels at 56. Howling Spirit had no problems tanking these. Pull with Turgurs, cast BoN and EBolt while the mob is in your face, root and then back up to Canni. Pet can take care of the rest. IIRC, mobs will not run if you fight near Herald Telcha.<br />
<br />
Unless there is a raid on the Royals, chances are you'll have the whole zone to yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fulgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmmm... ok...<br />
<br />
<br />
I will head off to chardok an POI....<br />
<br />
See what that turns up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>yadaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">poi exp sucks compared to pod/pon.... first i would say get ur epic...<br />
<br />
ya...thats about it :p<br />
<br />
-yadaf-</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">PoI can be great xp with a nice group ( oh how rare that happens! ) do anything you can to get into a factory group in PoI its some of the best Xp ive had</div></div><hr />
