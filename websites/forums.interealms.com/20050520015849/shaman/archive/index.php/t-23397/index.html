<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So my guild is doing RZTW last night and we've got a few guests from another guild tagging along for the flag.  We're clearing to VZ/TZ and I'm doing malos for another shaman to slow off my target when I get the tell:<br />
<br />
Stranger01 tells you, &quot;can u shrink me plz&quot;<br />
<br />
So I do what any good shaman in my position would do and ignore the bastard.  A few mins later though:<br />
<br />
Stranger01 tells you, &quot;can u shrink me plz&quot;<br />
<br />
I look at the raid window ... yep there he is ... a rogue.  I'm thinking to myself , 'Don't rogues have illusion masks and stuff?'  I tell my group that I have to drop and do a shrink.  I load Tiny Terror because if you ask Barm for a shrink, your whole group gets shrunk.  Twice.<br />
<br />
You tell Stranger01, &quot;invite me for shrinks&quot;<br />
<br />
Minutes pass.<br />
<br />
You tell Stranger01, &quot;I need to be grouped to shrink you.  Have me invited.&quot;<br />
<br />
Minutes pass.<br />
<br />
Then I finally get an invite -- back to my original group because the groupleader assumed I was done by then.  Eventually the rogue sends me a tell saying that they couldn't invite me then but will be ready to soon.<br />
<br />
You tell Stranger01, &quot;You really should get one of those gnome shrinking devices&quot;.<br />
<br />
Stranger01 tells you, &quot;I left it in the bank.  I'm a dwarf and I wanted to be a little smaller.&quot;<br />
<br />
You tell your group, &quot;&amp;#@*!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I just pretty much gave up expecting people to take responsibility for themselves on raids.  I usually carry a few shrink potions around, and make them buy them from me.  If they don't have any money, too bad.  When the raid leader gets mad at them for being on a huge horse in a tiny hallyway, again, too bad.  They either get asked to drop the horse, shrink, or leave the raid.<br />
<br />
Usually our GoD raids are fast paced, and I can't be dropping group all the time for lazy folks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Haha, classic!<br />
<br />
I really hate Shrink at times.  I used to use my clicky shrink orb from VT constantly (mostly in LDoN adventures).<br />
<br />
The worst, though, is when on raids in places where they want everyone shrunk, and someone in the group freaks out.<br />
<br />
It will be something like this:<br />
<br />
raidleader tells the raid, 'shrink your groups'<br />
(double shrink by me)<br />
person_in_group tells the group, '**** who shrunk me'<br />
I tell the group, 'I did... notice they said to shrink all groups?'<br />
person_in_group tells the group, '()*&amp;%@% i hate it when i am shrunk i can't (something they supposedly can't do because they're shrunk)<br />
<br />
I've almost gone off on someone a few times for something like this where I am told to shrink and then the person freaks out and takes it out on me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heh...using /ignore would have solved that problem in a hurry, especially after seeing what class/race he was with /who ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">in LDoN runs, I shrink myself once on zone in and leave it up for a few minutes to see if anybody else wants a hit (without saying anything). If nobody says anything at the beginning... tough cookies.<br />
<br />
Drives me even more nuts when the chanter decides that NDT would be fun... especially on someone that was shrunk earlier, or my own pet! (which I make sure gets a good washing so it comes pre-shrunk)... grrr</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Balanthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Stranger01 tells you, &quot;can u shrink me plz&quot;<br />
<br />
So I do what any good shaman in my position would do and ignore the bastard.<br />
<br />
Haha too true<br />
<br />
They should remove the damn group only flag.  I mean it would be SO horrible to be running around and find yourself shrunk all off a sudden.  Well Sol-Ro tower steps excluded..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ya, clicky VT is nice, and I'm constantly doing it, especially when we have a necro in group.  His illusions makes shrink go away often.  <br />
<br />
Rangers seem to have two flavors A)  Like their dog form and won't take FA &lt;boggle&gt;  or B) Want FA, but hate shrink cause they can't seem to shoot arrows when shrunk....<br />
<br />
Monks.. I don't bother anymore.  If I have one in group, I cast group shrink twice immediately followed by growing the monk.  9 times out of 10 they seem to want grow. No clue if its justified or not.  I've never played a Monk, but seems to me third person view and a jump here and there would pretty much be fine for pulling.  dunno.<br />
<br />
The thing that drives me batty is when classes that have ZERO need to be big insist on it (until the raid leader yells at them).  Like, wizards for instance.   There is zero need to be 10 feet tall on that horse.  But I've had some really get annoyed when I shrink them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">From my experience, monks tend to get upset when shrunk if there are stairs nearby as they cannot climb them when shrunk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I've almost gone off on someone a few times for something like this where I am told to shrink and then the person freaks out and takes it out on me.<br />
<br />
There are some people for whom being shrunk is bad. Anyone pulling for example (get stuck on steps, or some other geometry, etc when some badassed mob is beating on them), anyone who can use good visibility to do their job (pullers, mezzers, some debuffers), MA and offtanks when not cornering (helps them move around in crowds and makes it easier to target).<br />
<br />
Usually I do individual shrinks, or alternatively use tiny terror and offer grows to people who need to be large.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">From my experience, monks tend to get upset when shrunk if there are stairs nearby as they cannot climb them when shrunk.<br />
<br />
That's understandable though. If being shrunk gets in the way of steps or whatever, then yeah, I can see not wanting it that far. I usually don't shrink twice unless specifically asked for twice... once, yes... twice, too much liability to get stuck in geometry anymore :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Being shrunk at Saryrn last night was a pain.  Getting up that stairs with 50-60 other people around you.... /shudder<br />
<br />
/g Prepare for belittlement!<br />
/cast 1<br />
/g Mwuhahaha!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Why can't they change Shrink to be like Mass Mod Rod? AE beneficial spell that gives a three-click shrink item on the cursor?</div></div><hr />

<br />
good idea. too bad they wont do it :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can shoot arrows fine when shrunk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Top it off with pet owners who won't shrink pets ... make it worse with pet owners who can't shrink their pets.<br />
<br />
There are times I really want a hotkey when asked to shrink a pet:<br />
<br />
/me: use your tiny companion spell<br />
<br />
/them: I never bought it<br />
<br />
/me: you are a ****ing idiot (this would be hotkeyed - mainly because there are so many other opportunities it can be used)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I didn't buy tiny companion until a few weeks ago, then again real shrink always used to work on them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Man that really pissed me off why in the @#$% did we need a special spell so shrink our pets?<br />
<br />
<br />
I am betting how shrink is going to work after omens is the following:<br />
<br />
SOE: Hey we gave them AA's so they can now have more buffs up.<br />
SOE2: Oh no kidding, we should make shrink have an icon now so people can click it off. Then we can make to MGB'able.<br />
SOE: Done!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I feel your pain. Every once in a blue moon I would get a tell from somebody in my LDON:<br />
<br />
/t Mystyqe Can I get NDT please ?<br />
<br />
(Note - this always seems to happen IN the dungeon. At least a heads up please.)<br />
<br />
Now one, NDT takes 1-2 minutes to refresh. Second, WHILE it's refreshing that slot is wasted.  Third - it doesn't last forever.<br />
<br />
Sometimes if I'm in an ornery mood I'll ask them:<br />
<br />
/g Ok high speed - which spell do you want me to drop - Root, Slow, Mez, Stun (actually a fast casting 8 second mez - but try explaining that to a Warrior who seems to be roleplaying his 55 INT), Charm, Mana drain, Arcane rune or Tash ?<br />
<br />
Personally * I * don't like being shrunk because on a multi-pull it is harder to see around people. (Tier'dal being short to begin with).<br />
<br />
And don't get me started on that F&amp;*^ing DMF or SoE. Lord, if there's anything I hate worse than mez breakers it's that damned bobbing view. (And personally I think it contributes to spell interruption - but that's just a personal /twitch /jerk idiosyncracy of mine).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Piwacket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I don't shrink bards....it messes with their casting range...puts them just under the 250 mark which puts them in agro range when trying to pull.</div></div><hr />

Please for the love of god join my guild... hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I would never raid with people stupid enough to not have a shrink device on them or a potion<br />
<br />
the 3 most used shrink options on our raids are:<br />
the playermade one which uses mana battaries<br />
the shrink wand from the deep (VERY nice item)<br />
potions</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kykha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Guess my guild is brought up well.  <br />
I never get tells for shrink from other people then in group and all non-shrinkers use devices or illusions..<br />
<br />
That's also the reason I think MGB Shrink should not be in Top Ten.  It's not a class issue, its the people in raid creating this issue by being slack  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">my bet is they will make shink MGBable one of these months, but it will cost AA!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Sylorish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">They finally made invis castable on other so there might be hope for shrink yet.  I wish they'd at least make it castable on others within the raid.  Everyone /feedback that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Ougabouga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">The best option I can think of for mass shrinking is to make it a raid leader ability.  Then the raid leader can click it whenever someone unshrinks.<br />
<br />
Rangers I find are the worse.  They hate being shrunk and will turn into wolf form to get rid of the shrink, then click off wolf right away.  This is a huge pet peeve of mine that I find extremely rude.  Especially after the raid leader has asked everyone to shrink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Haxot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">heheh,, Only been playing EQ for a year and a month now,, never knew about changing the thirds eprson camera views until, mm, 3 months back, maybe.<br />
<br />
And I *coughs* was a bad boy, almost always at only 1x shrink, or worse, full grown.<br />
<br />
Is rather funny to be passed around shrinking an entire raid because everyone forgot shrink items(it seemed) and then being the only person unshrunk at the end. ^_~<br />
<br />
<br />
thankfully, the 2nd f9 stroke takes me to a camera view that I've learned to use quite well... I never realized for so long that camera views could be adjusted so well to give me the illusion of being taller then my shrunken self.<br />
<br />
Raid leader shrink,, mm, love that idea</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">From the monk perspective, when you get used to the range of your throwing items and such, and just how large it appears on the screen, being shrunk throws that off a bit. It's a minor thing, but throws you off for a couple til you get adjusted to it. Shrinking a monk in the middle of things, will flip them out more. Though /split 0 0 0 10000 mid pull is still funny to me :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Koda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">There are 2 things that I require all my guildies to have by time they hit lvl 46 ... they MUST have an EB item and they MUST have something to shrink themselves with. Nothing drives me more nutz than to have to hold up a raid I am running just to shuffle the shamans around in raids for shrinks. For my guild, these 2 things are now required or I will not allow you in my raids. As for any open raids I run, I will always put a shaman in with the necros for both re-shrinking and regen.<br />
<br />
IMHO - if your PoP-and-above playable, its your responsiblity to have something to shrink and EB ... if you don't, your a high lvl newbie to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Dirkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">or B) Want FA, but hate shrink cause they can't seem to shoot arrows when shrunk....<br />
<br />
It used to be that you couldn't shoot arrows if something was in the way(like other people, chains hanging down from the ceiling, etc.). They have changed it now so that only geometry blocks arrows, as it should be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Anyone bitches to me in group about being shrunk, they're done for.  The rest of the night I click my Orb anytime my gems go grey.  They're getting shrunk about 1mil times and they can suck it.  There's no one in my guild without some kind of illusion with which they can get rid of their own shrink. I'm not memming Grow for anyone, ever.  Bastards can relog for all I care.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">only people that I see that really have a problem with being shrunk.. are some chanters, shaman and some of the pullers.  I think that all for the most part have a valid reason too.  Personally I like to stand near the front of the guild, for when they are chain pulling mobs I can quickly start to begin the debuffing process.  It lets me know how many are coming in normally and gives me a good visual on who is on what and what isn't being tanked/debuffed.  Same thing is true for chanters, they need to be able to see what is coming into camp, and what needs to be mezzed and what can be tank mezzed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Never complained about being shrunk on raids with my Paladin alt, but I despise having it done in a regular xp group in hilly terrain.  Makes pulling a real PITA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">In my previous guild I was assigned the duty of setting up groups and managing the raid manager tool. I would routinely set all my groups up with 5 and then bounce myself from group to group casting 2 Tiny Terrors each group. Fill out the groups and tada! Tiny Raid.</div></div><hr />
