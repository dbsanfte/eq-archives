<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chairman Meow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've fought Chavoor twice now, and not had success slowing him with Turgurs.  Is he immune to slows altogether, immune to the magic based, or just highly MR and hard to land?  I'd appreciate any feedback.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>iso2202</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, I believe he is slowable, I did a Vxed awhile ago with my BL, and let a friend of mine play my shaman, And appearently he slowed him, wether he really did or just had no idea what was going on I dont know, But Im pretty sure it hit, But it was Balance of Nihil and the slow message didnt appear till about 75%, so Im guessing hes just really MR</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>wakonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The easiest way to tell if a mob is immune to slow is after you cast you will get a message...&quot; %T is immune to changes in its attack speed &quot;&lt;--or something really close to that, I just lok for red text and the word immune.<br />
if it says resists, could just be very difficult to land, like vox/naggy, might not be worth the effort, but it is possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nope... he's slowable.  I've fought him many times.  Once in a while you get an unlucky streak and have problems hitting him with it.  I don't know if you used malos before he got to the camp, but I would suggest they maybe let you pull with it, or at least have him pulled to a spot down the way a bit whre you have plenty of time to stick maloson him before he arrives.  The fight is decently short so using Nihil will prob help matters if possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've slowed him three times out of three with no bounces.  But was grouped with a chanter who was casting tash while I malosed before tugurs.  That may have made the difference</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Fought him this afternoon and sadly failed a few times, then got called away to a raid. <br />
<br />
He is slowable by turgurs, but I go the message  'is only slightly slowed'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've fought him numerous times also and slow generally sticks after malos at slightly (30% I believe).  Unless you have a beefy tank and a druid backup in addition to your cleric you need to start spamming heals as soon as possible because he hits for 1900 quads (if I remember).  Thus you (the Shaman) have a real choice what to do if your first slow bounces.  I suggest switching to spam healing immediately and forget trying to slow.<br />
