<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fynris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Question please....<br />
<br />
If you have all the AA points that you needed... in what order would you obtain AAs? What, in your opinion, is the best progression for  AAs for a Shaman&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dont know why this is posted in this section, but ill answer anyways.<br />
<br />
Get Can5 FIRST! no if's and's or but's, just get it, its the best shaman AA by far.<br />
<br />
Then there are tons of options depending on your style of play.<br />
MGB is popular if you are a raiding shaman.<br />
Spiritcall is nice for a little added dps.<br />
Natural Durability is nice if you are low on HP for can5.<br />
Combat Agility i have heard is very useful in avoiding attacks.<br />
SCM saves a lot of mana.<br />
SCR increases buff duration, including torpor.<br />
others im forgetting too but its a start.<br />
<br />
Personally im going for spiritcall and SCR after can5, then ND and CA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fynris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What section should it be in?...<br />
<br />
You have to put 6 points into general and 12 points into Archetype before you can get Cann 5.... right??  In general category, I did Run 3, Regen 1 and Agi 2 (increased AC)... In Archetype I did Mental Clarity 3, then I did Cann 5.... I tried the Radiant Cure ability, but it doesn't seem to work very well or I don't know how to use it... but I'm trying to determine the best course of action from here... just looking for opinions.<br />
<br />
I agree wholeheartedly that Cann 5 is critical...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">u in a big raid guild or soloer..or just like to group ?<br />
<br />
have to know this to help out more</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My guess as to which area would be general.  Plus you will get a lot more response for good or bad.<br />
<br />
If you are on a raiding guild the cure one (cant find it's exact name) would be helpful as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Path<br />
<br />
<br />
For ALL shaman, no exception, you should get...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
AA 1-3 Run1-3<br />
AA 4-6 Regen 1-3<br />
<br />
<br />
All other general AAs are a waste. AGI is just stupid as it is a proven worthless stat, Stamina doesn't give you alot of HP, and all others are useless (I won't even go into putting it into wis :D )<br />
<br />
AA 7 &amp;8 MC1<br />
AA 9 - 12 MC2<br />
AA 13  - 18 MC3<br />
<br />
AA 19 - 23 Canni5<br />
<br />
<br />
That is what ALL shaman should take, no matter what, Canni5 increases our power as much as torpor.<br />
<br />
After this point, basically get anything you want (pretty much) but this is what I'd say to do.<br />
<br />
SC1 (nice extra DPS and its fun)<br />
SCM3 (ALOT of mana saving)<br />
<br />
<br />
MGB (only do this if your in a guild, if not its pretty useless)<br />
<br />
ND3 (added hp is always good)<br />
<br />
CA3 (good to avoid 500+ hitting mobs in pop)<br />
<br />
VP 1 (nice ability)<br />
<br />
SCR3 / SCRM (nice on torpor)<br />
<br />
Planar Power (my stamina is capped with bufs and wearin my HP gear)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well those are just IMO, but the first part is a must!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Togh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Run 3<br />
Regen 3<br />
Mental Clarity 3 (required for Canni)<br />
Canni 5<br />
SC<br />
VP<br />
QB2<br />
SCR 3<br />
SCRM<br />
SCM<br />
<br />
Then alot depends of style<br />
<br />
Healing Adept<br />
Spell Crits<br />
ND<br />
CA<br />
MGB, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Megara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I personally am doing MGB before Cann5 because buffing 100+ people on a raid sucks, and I raid almost every night.  But if you aren't in a heavy raiding guild, other AAs may be more useful to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mazirus Slaymaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">can5 should still be first, you use mgb every 72 mins, you use can5 every 3, so b/w mgb's your not gonna be as well on mana as you could be<br />
<br />
plus just in case your in a big guild, there may be other shamans to handle mgb till yuo get it<br />
<br />
well anyhow my aa so far<br />
<br />
regen3<br />
run3<br />
mc3<br />
can5<br />
nd3<br />
qb1<br />
mgb</div></div><hr />
