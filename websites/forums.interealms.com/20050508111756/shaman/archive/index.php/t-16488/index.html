Looking for any raid that is survivable at least.</div></div><hr />

I went on my first LDON raid to MM the other night, also with full raid of people from a guild in the Elementals (though no enchanters or mages that night).  Ditto on the failure due to too many deaths, with about 45 min on the timer. Ditto on the high MR of the mobs (plus a number were immune to slow).  Not much in the way of remarkable drops, and not much in the way of points. I came away thinking that LDON raiding was definitely a challenge, but feeling skeptical about the risk/reward balance.  Maybe it's different for lower-level raids, dunno.<br />

No such thing, from what I understand...  Min lvl to raid is 60, with  a required raid average lvl of 63+.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, that is probalby the easiest raid by far.  We had no problems with it and the reward was VT in quality.  The traps are mean, but most should resist them.  ANd if you aren't you surely shouldn't be setting up to fight in rooms with traps.  The bugs were easily mezzable as far as I could tell. <br />
<br />
I love the new raids and haven't seen one that won't be completed by someone somewhere inside of a month.<br />

That is a list of raids and I have rated them in terms of difficulty as best I could without giving anything away.</div></div><hr />
