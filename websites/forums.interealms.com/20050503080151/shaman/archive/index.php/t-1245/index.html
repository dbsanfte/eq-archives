<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gwaihir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My friend is level 31.  I am currently 21.  I think I can group at level 22 and get experience.  However, according to what I have heard, a level 22 and 31, the 31 would get 90% of the experience and would outdistance me quickly.  <br />
<br />
At what level can I group and get a reasonable amount of experience? Note that this is different from what level can we group period. <br />
<br />
I'm thinking 25?? <br />
He's a monk, btw, and I am (of course, the best and the brightest) shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>argoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What if you split your time grouping and being PL'ed? He should be able to PL you rather effectively. Don't group and have the monk beat a blue mob nearly to death. Shortly before the mob dies the monk FDs and you wade in to get the kill.<br />
<br />
I've never been PLed by a monk, but I think that's the way it works.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/agree Argoth<br />
<br />
A monk or SK can PL you quite well. They beat the mob down then Feign Death before it dies. I come in, clobber the mob and get the exp. He can PL you until you two can effectively group. Doing it this way your skills will be lacking a bit though. Offense, Defense, and melee skils will fall by the wayside until you two can group effectively.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The determining factor for your xp is likely to be how fast you can kill monsters, rather than the split of xp between you two.  Even if he's getting most of the experience, if you're helping at all, you guys will be killing tougher monsters than either would be alone, bringing in lots more experience.<br />
<br />
When grouping, definitely slow everything, keep him healed and buffed, and if you've got mana, drop a poison DoT (assuming it will last the whole fight- otherwise a nuke is probably more mana efficient.)  <br />
<br />
You'll get a little more group-friendly at 24 (regen, better buffs and DoT, cannibalize) and a lot more group friendly at 29 (better slow, quickness, better heal, invis, even charm animal can be neat if hunting in the right place.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Straif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My roommate got his computer just in time for me to ding into level 19, so his warrior started quite a bit behind me.<br />
<br />
We got him up to groupable level and we then went to find mobs which con real high to him yet blue and light blue to me.  He caught up with me in about 4 levels.  <br />
<br />
At this time he is 33 and im 36, but only cause I solo when he isnt around heheh :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I really wouldn't worry too much about him taking more experience than you. Grouped with him, you're going to be killing MOBs that con red to you, and so the experience should still be better than were you to solo. Also, with your friend being higher level than you, he requires more experience to reach the next level, so you should slowly catch up to him if you group with each other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Takk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">used to be if you con your friend  as &quot;Red&quot; then it wouldn't be worth your while to group with him. For one thing, in order for him to get exp, he would need to kill things that are Red to you. Experience wise, killing a red with him in the group will be like killing a blue or light blue mob. Also since the mob is red to you, 90% of the spells will not stick .... So you will only be able to heal and buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Andrewe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">They changed this a looong time ago... about the time that hybrid exp penalties were removed.<br />
<br />
The split in experience between the two of you will be about equal to the ratio of your levels (so about 40:60). At 22 I was grouping with a 32 and making about a level every two hours or so, so I don't think it really gimps your experience. This was with your exact same situation (lower shaman, higher monk).<br />
<br />
Just have them find something that's blue to them, itll probably be yellow/light red to you. Keep them healed and buffed. This works particularly well with any melee class.<br />
<br />
That whole &quot;higher person gets 90% of the experience&quot; wasn't really true, and to the extent it was, was totally removed when they took out the hybrid exp penalties (which has got to be more than a year ago).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Your lucky because heals and buffs never get resisted :)<br />
<br />
It's much, much easier for a priest to group with a higher level melee char than the other way around.<br />
<br />
A high level monk would love you for haste, stat buffs, and healing....even if you can't land any spells on the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kervin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">/agree Snapdragn<br />
<br />
I been grouping in DS were everything cons red. But they love the regen and buffs. Tried casting on mobs, gave up real quick. And to think I thought I was done hunting wolves, hehe.</div></div><hr />
