<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This is a fun fight for a single group.  Best pull spot - invis up and run straight down the hall from ZI, through the room with the fallen column and into the next hall, straight into the next room (avoid the rubble on the floor, traps) and once past the rubble break hard LEFT and go into the little alcove there.  There is a Shrouded Anisher in there; kill him.  His respawn is like 20 min. There are no wanderers in that area, you can pull all the rocks you want.  Rocks drop A Lucid Shard btw, keep one if you ever want to get into Vex Thal.<br />
<br />
Va'Dyn has a lot of HP, like the Rubble Rousers, but he hits a LOT harder than the RR's do and rampages.  Get slow in quickly and follow up with a cripple.  I didn't have any trouble landing slow after Malo at level 64.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Actually, if your group has some decent AE types in it and you are in a hurry, pull EVERYTHING between you and the room before VD, kill it AE style, then send in the shaman to pull VD.   Use the top level root (3 monutes with a neg 30 to resist) on one RR, and the fastest casting root on the other, then just run VD back to zoneline, by the time roots break you are so far out of aggro range that the RRs ignore you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you like the sig better save it to your harddrive before the moderators catch it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">We pull VaDyn this way: monk pulls mass ammounts of junk mobs from righ tin front of Vadyns room. Then a ranger pulls VaDyn by snaring a RR, When its aggroed, he targets the other RR, and runs far enough away to snare it. then just brings VaDyn to camp and zones, and the RRs just stand around the fallen pillar for 14 mins looking silly.</div></div><hr />
