<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Toddoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When: Monday March 17th later afternoon and evening<br />
Where: The Vampyre Castle in Tenebrous Mountains<br />
What for: To cleanse the castle of the evil that resides within.<br />
<br />
Actually, I'm still trying to complete the Loyalist Shield quest. There are 4 named and winged vampyres that respawn every hour or so. If Heratius Golden spawns on the top floor, his death will spawn our target. Valdanov Zevfeer (Level 62 with an insane regeneration rate)<br />
<br />
So, please bring your alt or bring yourself this Monday night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tweedl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Todd, I hope to join ya.  I can bring Tweeds and/or a 60 monk.   I'm not sure what the alt lvl range is on this, but I have a 40 war and 51 wiz I can bring too.  <br />
 <br />
I can't fully commit cause there are a few RL things up in the air for Monday and I'm not sure how busy I'll be yet.  I'll try my best to be there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>RizzWulfgard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I can join after I get home from work, it will be later in the evening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>itchyban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">How times change -- back in my 30s, needed to run to Katta for pet spells. The descriptions of FG and TM were pretty scary on eqatlas. TM the scarier one, so I ran FG, hoping invis didn't drop in a bad place.<br />
<br />
Now I find myself saying, &quot;Sure! Would love to join you in TM. I'll see where you are and what your needs are when I get back from work (Pacific time).&quot;<br />
<br />
Itchy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Toddoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">For alt range, I would say about 45 to 55 is ideal. If we end up with enough people for one of those massive train killing AE orgies, lower level players would be pretty safe. And, the experience is there up to level 60 on the generals. The winged were dark blue to me at 62. <br />
 <br />
This is also a good event for improving Katta faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Temp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think I can make this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Knibble Megentlee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">well fudge i gotta work a short shift till midnight..if you still there I will bring Tymber</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cubman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm in Todd...can bring Marcubo for more AE killin or Cubber if ye need more meatshields.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm not sure if I'll be on tonight but if I am I'll be there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Toddoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I would like to thank everyone that came out to punish those evil undead. We were lucky this time and only had to wait 3 cycles. <br />
<br />
I tried to distribute the loot as evenly as possible and I hope everyone at least had a good time.<br />
<br />
Thanks again, Todd<br />
<br />
P.S. The shield looks really cool</div></div><hr />
