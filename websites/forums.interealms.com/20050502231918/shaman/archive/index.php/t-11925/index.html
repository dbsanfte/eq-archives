<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Judlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Currently I have 32 aa's , 27 spent so far 3run, 3regen, 12mc3, 5canv, 4spiritcall.  My question is should i go ahead and finish saving for mgb, or put points into extended duration or critical blasts??<br />
<br />
Also have another question I currently have an amulet of insight for extended duration buffs.  The effect works on all of my group buff spells, and some single target things.  Things i have noticed it doesnt work on is torpor, focus of soul, endurance of the boar.  Is there a reason why the focus effect does  not work on these??<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Easy answer to this one.. Are you in a raiding guild? If so, MGB is an absolute must.  If most of your raids are 24 or more people, it's a good idea to get it. Otherwise, get the self enhancing ones.  Thing is, you'll get MGB eventually and you're almost to 9, why not just get it now and be done with it?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">amulet of insight only works on spells up to 60 plus I would guess there is a restriction that the buff has to have a minimum length of like 42 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">no restrictions on the buff cast time for benefit focus, all the spells you mentioned it not working on are either not considered a buff (torpor) or are level 61+ spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">MGB is a must when you a raiding regulary. If not get it later.<br />
<br />
Torpor / Quiesence + SCR3 / SCRM = godly for canni5. You cast Torpor / Quiesence once and you get all the HPs back you just lost with canni5. All your buffs will last 50% longer too. Very nice when you have to haste 4 melees + doggy.<br />
<br />
Our DDs are crapy. They won't get much better with SCF / FoM. Get SCF / FoM way later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have MGB and don't realy need it because are raids are mostly 2 or 3 groups, but I am glad I have it.  It is considered an asset to the guild and makes me more valuble to the guild.<br />
<br />
That said I can't wait untill I finish 59 and can use it to MGB Fucus instead of STA LoL.<br />
<br />
Critical Blasts is far far down on the list for me but I have SCR3 and SCRM and am very glad for all the points I spent on them.  Having a fast casting long lasting torpor is going to be great and the fact that I spend less time rebuffing because all my buffs last 50% longer has a lot of value to me becuase I hate buffing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm in the exact same situation as Judlaan.<br />
<br />
I'll probably get MGB next. . and then some SCR .. <br />
<br />
then spell crits then SCRM .. then some QB<br />
<br />
don't underestimate spell crits. they might not be all that usefull for a regular DD spell .. but they're useful and fun when used with rain spells</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Sorry but you are compleately wrong.<br />
<br />
Torpor is considered a buff and there is a min time limit on most benifitial focus items. If it wasn't it wouldn't be effected by the aa spell casting reiforcement and spell casting reinforcement mastery which it most definitely is. It also wouldn't be effected by the aa quick BUFF which it also is.<br />
<br />
In this specific case you can see Extended Enhancement III in lucy at http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=2335 you'll notice line 6:  Limit: Min Duration(48.0 sec).<br />
<br />
If you check enhancement haste you'll see simular limitations on min duration.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now if you take something like the Crown of Ambivalence and it's focus, Focus of mediocrity. Looking in lucy at http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3106 it's min duration has been reduced to 24 and therefore would and indeed does effect torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've heard some folks say go for SCM.  Reduction in manna cost on spells by 5, 15, and 30.  I'm thinking these cost 2, 4 then 8 to build up.  I'm in the same boat, and I totally see myself dumping my next points into SCM.  30% savings is huge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">SCM3 is wierd, it didn't really boost savings or help fizzles on my main spec that much (Alteration) and bar the mana savings I was actually really quite disapointed with it since I was more interested in the reduced fizzle rate.  But, it also gave a MUCH more noticable saving rate on my non specced stuff, it really did make my dots/nukes a ton cheaper to cast.<br />
<br />
Personally only you can decide your AA path though, I've always been a bit of a tailed cleric wannabie so I got the essentials first (MGB as I'm in a raiding guild/ND3/CA3) then worked on additional defensive and healing based AA's to improve my ability to keep myself and others alive (HA3/AHA3/QB3/SCR3/SCRM/RC2/SCM3/HG3).  Personally I don't think nuke crits are worth the time until you seriously spend on them, 2 points worth of them is 2 points down the drain, want nuke crits?  Spend on them properly.<br />
<br />
The golden rule though, don't just spend on little bits of fluff left right and center, you'll end up with 101 buttons/abilities that do sod all for you, save up and focus on 1 ability at a time and you'll thank yourself once you see a fully powered AA line and the difference it makes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">SCM's description in game is compleately wrong. There is no chance at specialization. It just always happens. You always save the mana. What spell casting mastery does do is save you an addition 10% mana on every spell. For your main spec that puts you at about 20% mana savings. For your other ones your at 12%. It isn't 30% but it still a nice savings.</div></div><hr />
