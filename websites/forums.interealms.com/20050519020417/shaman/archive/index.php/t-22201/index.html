&quot;OK, I see that all the dev's are saying that GoD was tuned for lvl 66-70 and is now being retuned for 65+. <br />
 <br />
Fine, great - I can understand that........ but how in the name of Rallos Zek can you say that with a straight face when it is possible to do these scenario's with a 65 warrior and 65 cleric + 65 chanter (charm pet) + 3 random others and this has been possible for a long time before any other tuning.<br />
 <br />
That reads to me that clerics, enchanters and warriors at level 65 are already as good as they need to be at lvl 70 and require no further upgrades !!!!!!!<br />
 <br />
It is ludicrous that some classes can function capably in an environment tuned for lvl 70 at lvl 65.&quot;<br />
 <br />
you know what? he`s right. darn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No, it means that a warrior's HP doesn't drop to zero with the assistance of a cleric's healing capability while a ridiculously overpowered charmpet shreds whatever the tank is fighting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There's a huge difference between the time geared level 65 player, and the casual family guilded 65 player. Probably some in skill, most in gear and spells. I would say it is safe to assume a time geared player can operate in an environment tuned for someone of higher levels, similar to how uber twinked out alts rape stuff in Paludal Caverns. I guaruntee you that not every 65 enc war and clr is capable of handling the mountain trials, and i have a question for you. Why would you not want warriors to get upgraded? That makes no sense, especially if you raid.</div></div><hr />

I agree, there are lots of level 65's who struggle in hard LDONs, but they are cake with elemental or time gear, 200 AA's apiece, and a group that knows what they are doing.<br />
/agree.<br />
<br />
Did another hard this weekend with a Time/GoD geared pally MA, with the rest of us being a mix of EP/non-EP folk.  It went so smooth I felt like I was doing a normal.  Finished in about an hour &amp; we weren't even pushing hard.<br />
<br />
A different group of 65's in lousy gear &amp; lacking their 3rd AA title would finish a normal in about the same time.  Figure a normal compared to a hard is 5 levels difference in terms of the mobs you are fighting, and I can easily see how well-equipped/AA'd players can survive and succeed in a level 70 tuned environment where most players would eat hot death repeatedly.  I'm sort of in the middle to those two categories I guess, since I do some of both. :p <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">also it was likely only the end zones that where level 70 based, and for those 2 clerics where needed, though it does beg the question why cleric /druid or cleric /shaman didnt work very well often? if similar in gear.<br />
<br />
but i can agree that the above post was abit over simplified. though i still think it show the differences between the holy 3 classes and the rest.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>whoadievz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think you perhaps missed the point of the whole retuning.  They're not neccesarily retuneing Vxed/Tipt which are relatively easy.  More thean likely they are retuning Uqua+ which are extremely dificult without a full raid force (54 /shrug) of the aforementioned timegeared characters with the 200+ aa's.  It was these zones, I beleive, that were tuned for 70ish level characters.<br />

<br />
I would guess they actually though they were going to raise it.  Around the time GoD started development, so it was getting tuned for level 66+, but then they realized it would be back before they started moving things onto the live servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Winney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It really is the Chanter charm that throws this out of whack more than the Cleric/Warrior piece. Yesterday for example I get an invite for a Tipt group which I accepted. I had done Tipt three times before but never completing due to adds, wipes and such. This group was Paladin, Cleric, Chanter, Ranger, Druid and myself. All level 65 with the lowest AA total of 180 on the Druid. Now mind you, the Paladin was rather sickly geared and AAed, he had maxxed AAs plus 30 banked, which is about 880 for a Paladin. He was at 11k and change for HPs, but remember, he is not a Warrior so no Warrior dics like Stonewall, Defensive, etc... We won in 26 minutes, it was that easy. Why? Because the Chanter had a Charmed Hynid Ravager which she hasted. They are snareable so with caution and timing a break isn't inta death. The mobs died in about 12 seconds. How do I know this? Well, I cast Malos on INC and the mob was dead before Turgurs finished casting. Granted, I do not have Balance yet but I do have generic Spell Haste 4 plus I had Aura of Revenance. My job in this group, as I was told, was not to waste time on Malos/Slow but keep the pet Malosed for the Chanter and heal the Chanter and Cleric if they get aggro, thats it, that was all I did. Now it's not like I am gimp. I hit just under 7k hit points with buffs from this group makeup, I have 340AAs a good bit of Focus effects and a full spell book minus Balance, Trushar and all 3 Ancients<br />
<br />
Granted, this was a higher end group, but it really showed me just how sick Charm is, how needed Clerics are and how utterly worthless Shaman are in GoD content  :(   So essentially I was gimped through the Tipt flag<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
  Always remember, though, that the use/tactics of charm in Tipt/Vxed is an isolated occurence.  What I mean by this is that only in this content do you see a chanter pet maxxed buffed/hasted/pet geared.  The group is foregoing all safety measures to get a chanter pet &quot;beast&quot;.  Tipt/Vxed allows for room to kite the pet around which makes this tactic feasible.  If these trials were more like the Sewers (inside/narrow passageways) we would not see the tactic used.  <br />
<br />
I also felt like you when I was running through Tipt/Vxed.  I didn't think I was providing anything because I wasn't slowing- until things went south...  <br />
<br />
The group make-up at the time was warrior/chanter/cleric/myself/ranger/bard.  We just had bad luck and the pet broke mid-fight.  The tank was waxed, and the bard was left to mez it.  The ranger &quot;gated&quot; due to being on the hate-list from a prior snare.  That left an unsnared &quot;post-pet&quot; running amuck with only myself/chanter/ and cleric to do anything about it.  While the chanter is attempting to re-charm the pet- the pet is attempting to eat the cleric.  The cleric drops to 8% and I pop off a crit heal- saving the cleric's butt and, myself, grabbing the aggro long enough for the chanter to re-pet.  The rezzes ensue, and we later win the trial.<br />
<br />
Could a druid have done the same thing? sure.  It is also very likely that the druid, in the same scenario, would have attempted to fire off a snare.  That snare may not have saved the cleric's life.  I find more and more often that what makes or breaks GoD trial groups is reaction-time.  Gear does play a part in it, (the group has to be at a certain level) but I find that players knowing how to react and with what saves the group more often than an additional 1-2k hitpoints.  <br />
<br />
**On a side note**  We did a Vxed trial the other day without an enchanter- I think the group make-up was cleric/warrior/monk/ber/nec/rng?  It was a very smooth group- kills went almost as fast as with a chanter pet and we didn't have the pet-break fiasco looming over us.  It was a little rough on me- cleric was only fast healing on named (cheal on all other mobs), but we succeeded with 0 wipes.**</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is ludicrous that some classes can function capably in an environment tuned for lvl 70 at lvl 65 <br />
<br />
A.) the 3 random others better include a snarer and a single puller, and preferably a shaman or mage for malosinia<br />
<br />
B.) they took charm out of ikkinz trials.  mountain trials were designed to be about as hard for a lvl 70 (or i imagine 65, since its been retuned) in txevu+ gear as PoJ is for a lvl 65 in Time gear.  An ideal group in pre ssra gear could do execution at PoP release, just like an ideal group in pre elemental gear can do tipt/vxed now.<br />
<br />
Statements like this, that assume the lowest tier of GoD were designed for level 70s, are foolish.  Sewers are obviously for moderately geared lvl 65s, Mountains for slightly better geared 65-66's, KT as an xp grind to 70 (not the best xp in the world at release, but it was the only one that was even decent on release at 65, so...), and ikk+ to be done by lvl 70s.  With level 70s i can't imagine uqua being much harder than say, rallos zek was for 65s (though longer/more drawn out).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Froggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I must say, I have done Tipt multiple times, and while the charm pet DPS does help, really, shaman warrior cleric and some  dps can still work, it just takes longer. I havent wont Tipt, but that was more poor luck then lack of skill. Most of the time it was time or elemental tank, clerics of various levels of equipment, and me, who is in buyable. Tipt isnt hard as it is. The mobs hit, and most mitigate, but when I help the cleric heal on tougher fights, things still go smoothly. Sure, shaman are not perfect, and we could use some work, we can still manage to fill a role in this content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Levels make a large part of making certain places pretty trashy to hunt in, but moreso is your gear.<br />
There's a huuuge difference between taking someone who's equiped with 25ac 30hp equipments lots, and taking someone with 50ac 130hp equipment slots.<br />
<br />
I'm EP/Time geared at present, as are the rest of my guildies.<br />
I just went through Tipt like 4 days ago with SK, Cle, Dru, Enc, Rng, me (shm).<br />
Our SK tanked the named easily enough while we used the charmed pet for dps.<br />
The reason was that our SK had 2600 AC (with bard etc on a raid she's got 2800AC).<br />
Adding 5 more levels isn't going to make the named magicly easier to tank.<br />
The addition of another 500-2000 more HPs depending on the gear coming out of a new expansion is what makes old content easy.<br />
I'd rather have a level 60 in full vex thal gear, than a level 65 in ornate.<br />
The 60 has the HP, AC, and resists to survive, even despite the lower level.<br />
<br />
And as for content like Uqua, the difficulty in this zone is high enough that it will take a LOT of expansions to come and go before this zone ever gets to be trashy.<br />
Yard trash (well, actually hallway trash) hitting for 1500-1900 coming in sets of 3 at a time needs a lot of skill to handle, no matter how well equiped you are or what level you are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">5 more levels will almost cut the DPS the tank with the same gear will be taking into half, trust me.<br />
Levels in EQ are the most important stat, a lot more than AC and HP could ever be. <br />
That's the reason why they aren't upping the level caps every expansion. That's on top of the power that comes from new spells obviously.<br />
Before they introduced +avoidance and all the other &quot;melee&quot; focus effects(Dodge I/II/III etc.), there was no way to affect a mob's hit rate, yet when you went from 50 to 60 or 60 to 65 you could notice how much more mobs missed you. That alone already made mobs like the Emperor trivial enough for so many 2nd tier guilds.<br />
<br />
There are more benefits to levels, though. On top of getting hit less, you automatically are hit for less, you resist spells better and you connect better with as well(casters see less resists too). This all on top of the visible effects like HP increase, new discs/spells etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Yes, levels will make Uqua much easier, especially on the resist side.  Hitting yellows with high MR has always been hard, gain 5 levels, make them blue and slowing should become much easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I would guess they actually though they were going to raise it.

<br />
What I think Jaradis was pointing out is that normally with an expected level increase, we see Lucy go ape**** spitting out a new list of spell icons.  He merely pointed out that it didn't happen anywhere around the time of release.  It is interesting food for thought, and could very well mean that the GoD difficulty level upon release was based on Devs not knowing how to tune an expansion- not an &quot;expected&quot; level increase...</div></div><hr />
