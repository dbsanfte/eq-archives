I had a quick look at the work involved for the cudgel quests, and added it to my 'rainy day' list..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bruzza Bashalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Everything I have seen has all shaman races able to use the cudgels.  Was this changed, or does it refer to the right-click alone?  I ask as I am one of the those odd folks that likes to quest (did my Whistling Fists for my monk, then the Tynn shackle again, then another steel if you want to know what kind of masochist I am :))<br />
<br />
I plan to start the cudgels soon, so I would appreciate any information you may have about this.</div></div><hr />

The &quot;rainy day&quot; list has become the &quot;stuff to look for cheap in the bazaar from people that don't know better&quot; list.<br />
<br />
Managed to get almost all the skulls needed for the 3rd or 4th cudgel for about 200pp.<br />
<br />
Got both the monk headband/sashes for a couple hundred too(not quite capable of dropping the guild leaders).<br />
<br />
Keep an eye out and remember to search for the things you're looking for. Not everyone knows they're worth something.</div></div><hr />

Bleh. GIMME CUDGEL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">anyone really look at how the cudgel quest is set up? makes you retireve all the iksar relics (skulls) all the way up th the skull of Rile! (yup the 8th cudgel, that's his skull) if any item should be iksar only, that's it bub. take your silly JBB; we, the blood of cazic have no need for it.<br />
and STAY OFF THE GRASS!<br />
/shakes his fist</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Maybe I killed Rile. Took his skull. Now I like to wave it around on a stick.<br />
<br />
Pity only Iksars and those retarded Trolls know where he is. One doesn't talk much and the other is retarded so the rest of us don't get a shot at it.<br />
<br />
I'll let you battle out which is which. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">um rile died a long time ago &quot;bro&quot;. the point is he gives you the power of his essence imbued into the cudgel, basically imbuing you with the power of Rile. any softskin that would speak so disparagingly doesn't even deserve Rile's blessing!<br />
/cheer faction cap</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Heh, you tell em Krakster.<br />
<br />
Different races should have different stuff, and different abilities. What's the point in having races if they don't mean anything? (Apart from sexy troll looks of course).<br />
<br />
Too many people seem to want to homogenise EQ, make all classes equal, all races equal. Bah!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Should be Iksar and Gnome only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I hear the cudgels give you hemmorhoids and make you bald prematurely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">That's why the cudgel is such a good item for us Leezards.......Iksar don't get hemmoroids. and we're already bald so to speak ! <br />
So if you want a cudgel roll an Iksar, you scaleless FREAKS !!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">currently its giving me an ulcer...... :(</div></div><hr />

They say warm milk helps too, what seems to help me in times like that is give a few clicks to my Skyshrine Hottie ring. <br />
summon Red head Barb Hottie.......at that point I tend to forget about my heartburn and whatnot !!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I still say roll an Iksar if you want a cudgel !!!</div></div><hr />

You betcha my friend, I got an Erudite alt Pimp that sells hottie rings, whatever you need, blond ,brunette, red head...you name it......and for the really desperate Troll and Ogre ( i personally don't recommend those) He currently resides in the Bazaar his name is Puttan Trixtawork.......look for him on Inny server. He sells them for 200pp....come one, come all !! :D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Blame the monks! :)<br />
<br />
On the monkey boards there was much whining when the whistling fists came out and humans couldn't do the quest. Right after that the WF (and I assume the other Iksar weapons like the cudgel and greenmist) where changed so all the races could do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Angelok Wolvenspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Why are you Scaly-dudes soo livid about OTHER races getting something that originates in your town ?  To me you are all egoistic .. people.    <br />
The last cudgle has nice stats for a ranged item .. well .. for me it does .. I kinda see it as a mini-epic.  Why, oh why keep that away from all the other Shaman ?  Can you please show me the l33t Troll quest that yields a likewise reward like the last Cudgle ?<br />
<br />
The other races cant storm into Cabilis and start the friggin quest ... it took me 100+ hours to get both my Monk and Shammie non-KOS.  100+ hours of senseless goblin, skeleton, and bandit killing.  <br />
I've earned my right to do this quest .. live with it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Can you please show me the l33t Troll quest that yields a likewise reward like the last Cudgle ? <br />
- Why you need a POS stat buff that is crippled with stacking issues when you can get JBB?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Angelok Wolvenspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I dont care about the effect on it .. I want the stats.   And since when is the JBB a quest ? :)<br />
I havent checked Grobb lately .. but as far as I know .. there arent ANY quests of this magnitude for the old world races (cant speak for Ogres and Barbs .. but I have never heard of any .. soo .. I presume .. yada yada yada :)).  <br />
Thats my whole point really .. finally there is a nice quest, that yields a nice item for Shaman (besides Epic) .. people need to work for it, if they are not an Iksar .. and Iksar are yelling and screaming about it.<br />
<br />
Ohwell .. whatever .. I hope to finish the 7th real soon .. and then with a lil luck get the 8th shortly after .. who cares what all you Lizzies think .. I will be happy with it. :)<br />
<br />
Be safe!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Go Go Angelok, way to homogenize the shaman races!  Why SHOULD they get anything we don't get! Why stop there?  Don't you think barbs should get the troll snare necklace too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Ok, why don't we throw out all races and make the uber race:<br />
- Max ally faction to anything.<br />
- Ogre immunity to stun.<br />
- Regen.<br />
- Sneak.<br />
- Safefall.<br />
- Infravision.<br />
- Forage.<br />
- Swim.<br />
- Slam.<br />
- Ogre like HP.<br />
- IKS like WIS.<br />
- AC bonus.<br />
- No plate nor gear penalty.<br />
<br />
We can call it the IksBarOgrVahTrl Shaman. Then every shaman will be equal and we'll be playing a version of everquest called: Everquest, 1984.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Angelok Wolvenspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Yeah that would be cool Zorlac ............ :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
I'm talking about quests .. I give a rats ass about who gets what quest (Barb with Snare Neck thingy .. sure .. to bad you cant be an Inny follower as a Barb .. soo mute point really) .. if you work on your factions .. you should be able to do the quests.  <br />
If you call that  'homogenize the shaman races'  .. soo be it .. I dont care.<br />
Since you two are soo full of YOUR point of view .. and I'm full of mine :p .. there is really no use to keep a discussion going .. soo I stop it before it even starts for real. :)   You got your opinion .. I got mine.  No hard feelings and stuff. :)</div></div><hr />

From everything I have seen so far, the cudgels themselves are useable by all shaman races yes? And you can work up faction in cabilis as well. So, where is the problem?

<br />
My barb gets cold and all those gnomes walking by make me nervous. Give us pants dammit.<br />
<br />
I think that there should be entire lines of armor and weapons that are single race usable.  I am not talking about cultural armor as it is too expensive but gear that can be obtained from lvl 1-60 that would be usable by only one race.  And they would not have compairable stats.  Most of the stuff now that is race restriced is just the same crap with a different color and name.</div></div><hr />
