<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Goodberry</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Are there any sites out there that have a serchable item database that you dont have to pay for? They all seem to be &quot;preimum&quot; services......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fulaq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you can understand the french....<br />
<br />
This is a superb site, searches the Magelo database too.<br />
<br />
jeuxonline homepage (http://eq.jeuxonline.info/)<br />
<br />
and here is the equipment search page (http://eq.jeuxonline.info/guides/objets/search.php)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>talos68</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If I recall the EQWADB (EQ Weapons and armor Database) is free, but they don't go into great depth on the item (I think they only show the basic attribs). You can find it here:<br />
<br />
http://www.planeteq.com/eqwadb/<br />
<br />
Since they moved it to PlanetEQ it's been hard to find!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There is kinda a way around Allakhzam's premium service to search for items. You can search for an item if you know it by name or anything close to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Goodberry</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thank you all for the helpful advice. Perhaps I will try a different tactic. <br />
<br />
I am a level 19 Shaman returning from a 2 year “break”. So much has changed that I really don’t know what equipment is appropriate for my level any more. I am decked out in pretty much all banded and I suspect that I could probably upgrade fairly inexpensively.<br />
<br />
I have about 800 plat to spend and I will be buying Lucin today so I can visit the bazzar. <br />
<br />
If I recall correctly you could search for items by aprox level range at allakhazams but I am not a premium customer so I can’t do that. <br />
<br />
Perhaps some of you elder Shaman could help a young bear out and give me some ideas on what gear I should be targeting and how much I should expect to pay for it. <br />
I Like to solo a lot so I am guessing HP/AC gear would help the most. <br />
<br />
I am also using a Glowing Wooden Crook or a Screaming Mace/Shiny Brass Shield combo…. These used to be “good” for my level….are they still?<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">With the introduction of the Bazaar anything in your price range is good. The Bazaar will allow you to attain items you'd normally have to wait eons to get ! You can do much with 800pp, much better than the glowing wooden crook Shiny Brass Shield combo.<br />
You could probably get a Slimey Harpoon and Clay Guardian Shield for less than 800pp. (Depends on your server). So when you get Luclin, get to the Bazaar and shop around. <br />
I got a full suit of Rygorr, Ivory collar, Spine Chill Spear, and Centi Warhammer for about 1000pp.</div></div><hr />
