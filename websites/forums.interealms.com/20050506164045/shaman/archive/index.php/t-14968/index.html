<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">No I'm not in the wrong forum, I post this here because more of you will be using a ranger for the same purpose as I as opposed to those in the Glade that are full time rangers.<br />
<br />
I have deided to make a small army of rangers to leave at named spawns I can solo, for example Lodizal and UP.<br />
<br />
My question is this, at what skill level is tracking range great enough that I could (for example) track Lodizal (I understand I cant expect to track the entire zone but as much as is reasonable), without having to level to 50.<br />
<br />
Currently my thinking is this.<br />
<br />
500 + ( level * 50) = tracking skill.<br />
<br />
therefore at level 20 I will have 1500 locs.<br />
<br />
What tracking skill would you suggest.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mojarda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">IIRC, Tracking maxes at a skill level of 200 until you are 50+.  That being said, the skill can be maxed by a ranger at level 39.<br />
<br />
As levels are easy to get these days, I'd suggest leveling to 39.  That should be more than suficient to track most targets with the exception of some raid level mobs that are located deep within indoor zones.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">some cases you dont need to lvl him.  For UP, stick the ranger on the steps to VT and you can track RC form there.  For Kland, DN ZO works.  Ssra though requires a high track skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heehee I have not one but 3 different ranger tracking mules I park in various spots to track for mobs for my guild.  If you are gonna send the mule somewhere nasty, you can always leave him at level 9 so he returns to bind on death with all gear.  You can get track to 50 at level 9.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Heh, yeah I thought of that...the level 9 not losing equip.<br />
Before this guy is parked someone semi-permanently he will be stripped of all his equipment ;) this will be handed on the the next ranger in my wee army &gt;:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">there are other ways to due similar things, like faction, sense spells, hide/sneak as a rogue, i have 4 trackers for mob and none of htem are rangers</div></div><hr />

<br />
What level you need for this very much depends on the mobs you're trying to track and how close you can get a level 1 char to them. In some cases, a rogue with sneak/hide may well be better than a newbie ranger, because it may be easier to level a rogue to 3 and move him up to the spawn point, rather than level a ranger to the point where he can get the required tracking skill.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest the ranger boards might be the best place to ask, because even if you don't intend to play a ranger, they still understand tracking, and spawn tracking in particular better than anyone else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
CAREFUL!  if you level a ranger to 39 you might end up really enjoying the ranger and you'll end up moving over to http://forums.interealms.com/ranger/  next thing you know you will have TWO toons to level, gear, AA, and such.  thats even more time down the EQ drain!<br />
<br />
then again the shammie-ranger 2-box team is pretty nice.</div></div><hr />
