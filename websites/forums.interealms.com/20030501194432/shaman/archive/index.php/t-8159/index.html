<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lalorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I logged on today after missing two weeks of play and searched the for potions in the bazaar.   Here are just a few potions that did not look familiar to me and they are not in EQTRADERS or any existing alchemy list I can find.  <br />
<br />
WHO IS HOLDING OUT?!!<br />
<br />
Phase Spider blood<br />
   Effect: Improved invisibility<br />
<br />
Cloudy potion<br />
   Effect: Invisibility (instant) <br />
   But is this the vendor bought one?<br />
<br />
Dark potion<br />
   Effect:  Regeneration<br />
   Again is this the vendor bought one?<br />
<br />
Bite of the shissar<br />
   Effect:  Strike poison<br />
   Is this poison skill from rogues?  It is rogue only potion<br />
   A few of only Rogue usable items so I’m sure those are them<br />
<br />
Dulsehound<br />
   Effect:  Dulsehound<br />
    What could that be?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Phase Spider Blood is dropped<br />
Cloudy Potion is indeed shop bought invis<br />
Dark Potion I believe is a shop bought crap regen potion<br />
Bite of the Shissar is a poison made by rogues, or a dropped poison for rogues.<br />
Dulsehound IS an alchemy potion. It's part of the 'Old Alchemy'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lalorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">@#$!#$^@#$%#@!<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No problems, anytime. Anything else just ask me (either here or ingame, antonius.fuudce)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok.  How do you pronounce your name? :p<br />
<br />
'Foodsss' is my best guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've kept the pronunciation of the original spelling of my name. I was Originally Fudce, then I moveloged to AB, but had to change because there was another Fudce on AB. (some newbie monk)<br />
<br />
It's pronounced the same way as Fudge, Fuds, if you will</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">For the record, Dulsehound isn't Old Alchemy,  it's Revamp Alchemy, and listed under Utility Potions on EQ Traders.  Its effects are +18 STR, -25 INT, 180 hp Regen at 3/tick for 3 min.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Doh, actually we're both right hehe.  It *is* old alchemy, but it never left the game like the rest of old alchemy did.  It's one of the ones that uses gypsy herbs that was part of the old, original alchemy but was left in after the revamp when sow potions and the like were introduced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">ok ok, I'm allowed to make mistakes!<br />
<br />
It's the same stylee as the old alchemy, loot + herb</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Dulsehound is the IG toe potion isn't it?   If so, no regen of 3 a tick on it, just a gradual loss of the stats (pretty sure on that at least... never seen any info about a 3/tick regen before and sen most alchemy related posts so far)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The IG toe potion is &quot;Stinging Wort&quot; (effect = &quot;Calimony&quot;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hrm, having problems understanding the concept of the 180 hp regen at 3hp a tick for 3 minutes.   Seems to me that would be 30 ticks and at 3 a tick that is only 90hp.  Figured he meant an Hp buff, but then again the IG toe pots are 399 hp anyhow. :(<br />
<br />
  Ah well, I am easily confused.</div></div><hr />
