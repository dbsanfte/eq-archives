<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Abandoned Soul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all, I currently have an Engraved Royal Velium BP (ac32 str7 dex5 sta5 svc10 svm4) and have been tinkering with the idea of picking up an ikky regen BP.  Bad idea?  or is the 5hp regen worth losing the ac/stats?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">5hp regen is nice; with my style of play (Shandy SMASH!) I prefer the stats. <br />
<br />
If you're like most shaman, you probably carry a pack full of &quot;stuff you like to keep around cuz you never know if you'll want it&quot; like clicky JB stuff, spare weapons, and &quot;down time&quot; type armor.<br />
<br />
If you have 4 - 6 k to spend, the Ceremonial BP is great for downtime mana regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>joebooracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">not really worth it when ya 56..and have regrowth..bear and reg go well together..iskar bp adds nothing on top of these.good below 56..when ya dont have bear form</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jargas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd say neither myself. Your current BP has good AC but nothing<br />
else worth hanging onto, and the Iksar isnt spectacular. <br />
Shoot for something that adds hp/mana and maybe some<br />
sta/wis if you can. Froglock Scale BP isnt bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I wore an iksar ceremonial at your level and loved it.  It WILL stack with natural regen, your regen spells, and bearform.<br />
 <br />
Definately get it.  Free mana and constant healing is a beautiful thing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've had a Iksar BP for about 6 - 8 levels now, I love it.  Im only 50, and I don't plan on trading it in unless I get a fungi or a fungus patch vest.  Otherwise, I can get better gear by upgrading my other slots.   If you gave me all 3 of these BPs, I'd only wear the Iksar BP.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Regen is great pre torpor, but 5 per tick isnt really that much.  Get a fungi, or just save your money id say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">5 a tick isnt alot . but when you add it to everything else . you cant go wrong.<br />
<br />
currently im 46 . when i put on Chloroplast and bearform and my Iskar BP . i have very lil downtime . no to mention if someone puts regrowth on me ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>TweadleDimm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">5 hp a tick is what? 25% increase in your regen with regrowth?<br />
<br />
ya that's not much.<br />
<br />
Get the ikky,it is great until you can get a fungi.<br />
<br />
As far as I'm concerned the only BP's shaman should be wearing are ones with regen . Extra hp=extra mana , and every little bit adds up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Far as i know the bp regen stacks on greater bearform and regrowth. 5 a tick may not seem alot but i do notice it when i dont have it on. Dont think the 7str really adds that much to your melee and 5stam a little bit of hps but the regen never stops. I tinkered with the idea of getting a wis bp istead of my iksar one but i am glad i didnt. Still wear mine at 58 and plan on it til i someday finally hit 60 and torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yeah a 25% increase in your regen is useless! Useless I say!<br />
<br />
Heck, bearform is only 2hp a tick... why bother casting it? Same as Regrowth! It's only 5 a tick more than Chloroplast! It's like throwing away 100mana!!!<br />
:rolleyes:<br />
<br />
In all seriousness... buy the IkkyBP. Take it off when you buy a Fungi or need resists on a raid. Do the math and it's almost like having FT2. People pay 80-100k for the FT3 boots from CT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">id would never be seen dead in an ikkbp with my ogre shaman<br />
<br />
why?  cos ilike goin toe to toe with a mob and sluggin its brains out!  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; need ac<br />
If a slowed mob hits u for 50+ damage every other swing  +5hp regendoes sweet FA to help u win the fight, however if it only hits one in three swings(cos u got a higher ac) and ur slugging it for more than that then  BInGO ur gonna get a req`d result!!<br />
<br />
ok if u got the spare pp and u are in a LOW lvl raid guild buy the ikky bp for raids, THEN SIT ON YA ASS AND mED LIKE A DROOD<br />
<br />
If in a high lvl raid guild buy a HIGH wis bp,  cos ull be getting c2 or c3 form the guild chanters.<br />
<br />
froggy scale is the all round bp, or if u gonna melle alot swop to the treeweave OR HIGHER AC ONE IF U CAN AFFORD IT.<br />
<br />
btw the ERVFP bp is the BEST looking bp i have seen for a shaman!  its a gorgoeus shade of dark blue, basically blue totemic bp look  aka MINT   Tones in well with the darkgreen of vel dragon arnour</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you really think a difference of 13ac will cause you to get hit 17% less, as in your example???<br />
<br />
No, it won't. It will make a minimal %age difference in the amount of damage you take. Much less than the 5hp per tick will help.<br />
<br />
The 5hp per tick ALSO helps when you're out of combat, when AC is useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">oogha - gotta disagree with ya here.<br />
<br />
a) most mobs I'm fighting now hit in the 100s, not 50s.  So regardless of my AC, I'm getting pounded.<br />
<br />
b)  missing 13 AC doesn't keep me out of the fight - I Aint Skeered!<br />
<br />
c) increasing my regen by ~35% at lvl 50 gets me back into the fight faster...while you're sitting around regening health I'm already beating on the next mob (or actually, getting beat on :))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">5hp Regen &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 13AC.  No question about it.<br />
<br />
Hell, even at 60 my JB BP spends most of its life in my backpack in favour of my fungi unless I am soloing something v hard and therefore gonna have to torpor a lot anyways.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I use this one...<br />
<br />
I think I got a bit lucky when I nabbed it for 13k, but I have never used an iksar bp, and I would not notice the difference if I did. Personally I don't need to canni all that often with jbb, and when I do canni it doesnt take enough hp away when I could just sit and med. Unless you are in a dungeon all the time I would get a horse rather then an iksar bp, the bad one only costs a few kpp more. 5hp a tick is only 1/6 more then the 31hp I regen sitting (28 standing) and thats not enough to me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Humburto - 31hps regen is nice - Im curious how you did that without a fungi.  AA pts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Shamrox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Keep your old BP and wear the Ikky in Downtime or while you have a mob Rotting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Before I off'd the 10,000th Mushroom King and got the Fungal Tunic , my Primary BP was the Ikky BP.  I have Torpor and I STILL use my FT as my primary BP.  I keep my SS BP currently as my backup/selected raid BP, but the FT is still numero uno.  I spend a lot of time being the only shammy to buff my entire guild and slow the mobs for raids, but still haven't seen mana problems with my choice.<br />
<br />
Bottom Line:  Go for the Regen, it's great for those times when you need to Canabalise or get a hit or two from the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Don't forget - fungus patch tunic was made just for us.  <br />
Took 3 groups of 50-60's out there, and ran 2 tunnels - one fast, one medium speed.  Nabbed a fungus patch (woot me!) and 2 of those shields.  It's cake getting any shield class to go, as well as any large guildies you have.  Who *wouldn't* like a fungi for downtime?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Warscar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I am with Humburto. You should buy a horse. Horse is &gt; then regen bp. Most of the real good solo spots are outdoors. High keep and Katta are cities zones and are perfect for the use of horses. When you are getting pounded on and JBB'ing 5hp regen per tick is meaningless. If I get low fighting I root, back off  and heal. All the while I am medding on my horsey.  I would rather wear my 30ac Barbed ringmail then 19ac. 13 real ac loss is like 20ac loss altogether. That is a sizeable chunk to lose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I recently went through a bit of an armor upgrade and finally can break 1000 AC self buffed.  Being bored I spend a couple of hours at the ice giants and compared performance with JB BP and CIB. Doing a single root at the beginning and melleeing whenever the giant comes after me I had less downtime with JB BP then with CIB due to lesser damage taken during the fight.  Now clever would be to swap BPs during medding, but I already carry three bags of swap equipment and am encumbered without HoS.</div></div><hr />
