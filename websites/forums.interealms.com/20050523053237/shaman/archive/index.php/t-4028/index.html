<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently achieved lvl 29 (yay for me) and was very excited to scribe Form of the Bear.<br />
<br />
I cast it and I turn into...  a little bear!  In fact, a few hours afterwards, I happened into a couple closely-leveled shamen also in bear form and they were nearly twice the size I was.  Everyone standing in the vicinity told me that I looked cute and cuddly (making me very mad... I want to be fearsome, not cute and cuddly).  They all told me that I looked very small compared to the other shaman-bears.  Every day since then I've logged on and casted this spell, I always turn into the cute cuddly little bear.  I've tried re-patching a few Eq files in my directory, and no cigar.<br />
<br />
So what the heck?  Anyone else had this prob?  I'm running a nice machine and a freshly installed totally updated version of EQ.  Why am i glitching like this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The level 29 bear is smaller than the level 55 bear.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think it would be any problem with any of your files, if other people are seeing it too. You won't get fearsome with bearform, no matter how big you are. specially with that goofy smile if you don't have a chain helm. I'd say be glad, the one thing I hate about bearform is the size. On raids I never use cause it takes how big I normally am vertically and makes me that big horizontally instead. If you really want to try and fix it, I'd try talking with a GM or stop by the Tech Support chat room sometime they're open</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You'll often see strange things/bugs with illusions, especially if you've zoned into a zone after the person has cast the illusion, traditionally theres been gnome sized dark elves (gnome using a DE illusion) and the like.<br />
<br />
The fact that you're smaller whilst being a troll is interesting, I'd enjoy the uniqueness!<br />
<br />
Size is a strange thing in EQ, I always thought all Iksar were the same height but a guildmates Iksar is consistently half a foot shorter than me. Wierd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Punquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">their is a simple explaination troll shaman cannot be grown when they use any illusion that's why you ll see some ikkyes being twice your size ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Gee, I remember the days when I had bearclothes on, and if someone zoned in after me, my Froglock Tunic always made me look like I was wearing a light blue sweater!  All the other Polar Bears laughed at me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">ahh, so you're saying that maybe I am the correct size, and maybe I'm seeing the other bears wrong?  These guys were like me --- troll shamans within 5 levels of me (30-35) and they looked like the 55 bear.  Except they were brown.  Maybe I'm glitching on their graphics?  A few people around us said we were all the same size, while another few people said I was half their size....  <br />
<br />
*shrug*<br />
<br />
I petitioned it just for &quot;S&quot;s andn &quot;G&quot;s, and got no reply...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>SkegBlackwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Its possible also that they cast grow on themselves, that makes you alot bigger as a bear..hehe<br />

Aha, yes then, its definitely a glitch and you can't control it. It happens when the viewer zones in after the character has cast the illusion, saw it again just the other day myself with a gnome rogue, he casts illusion erudite, I zone in, I see him as a gnome sized erudite. <br />
<br />
I've got a screenie of an ogre warrior with a pre nerf DE mask with the same bug - because he's actually an ogre he's huge.<br />

<br />
So, if you saw huge troll bears and you were the 'correct' size its because you zoned in after they had cast the illusion. Next time you see it ask them if they would pop out of illusion and recast it, you'll likely find you're all the same size.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hm... and I thought it was level based.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Simple solution don't use the damn thing.<br />
I can't stand bear form and hate having to use it to sneak into the hole.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">An ogre guildmate and I both went in the bearform at the same time last night.    He was probably about double my size, with no growing or shrinking involved.  I was using the 55 bear, he was using the 29 bear, since he's only 52.<br />
<br />
Later that night after he died from trying to slow too soon (snicker)  he cast it again, and came out my size.  go figure.<br />
<br />
btw, us large races that cannot normally grow CAN grow in bear form.  The trick is to shrink yourself once, and then cast grow  until you don't get any bigger.  You come out being the same height and width as an ogre (i.e. really freaking big).<br />
<br />
edit:  I just remembered, from back in my days using lesser bear form, that sometimes you will come out looking different.  There is a bear model that uses less polygons than the one we usually see, and your head looks more like a block with eyes and a mouth painted on than an actual head.  Sometimes I would come out in that form, and all the other shamans would be in normal bear form.  I would ask them, and they'd say that I look just like all the other bears to them.  I have seen a guildmate with greater bear form turn in to a white version of this bear before, as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>MagnoMightyMidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It's not the size of the bear but the magic in the hair.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The &quot;cast shrink then grow&quot; technique to become larger... does that only work in dungeons?  Shrink can only be cast indoors.<br />
<br />
I tried that last night in OT and since I had never used shrink before, I learned that.  hehe</div></div><hr />
