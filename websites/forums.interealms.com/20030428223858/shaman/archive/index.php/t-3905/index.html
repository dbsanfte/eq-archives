<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jvrebi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Followed the guide.  Buffs are maxxed and Cha is high.  Only low stat is Int at about 68.  At skill level 103 went to Luclin &amp; made Titan Potions.  I stopped at skill level 138 because I AM BROKE NOW!  Like the heading said I averaged spending 1k for every 7 skill points raised.  If that continues I'll need another 7k at least to get to a skill level of 180 where the Luclin potions are trivial.  Is this the norm?  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yep that sounds about right. 1k for 7 skill points is pretty awesome by most tradeskill standards....ever talk to a tailor or smith?<br />
<br />
or tinkerer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ludgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">there is no equality in the skill up costs to be sure.  most get expensive around 188 skill.<br />
<br />
You can get 7 skill ups in fishing for about 1 pp if it will make you feel better.  Been working on it for blessed fishing poles for Potc quests.  baking is cheap to skill up to the 140 range now with the filleting knife.<br />
<br />
alchemy, jewelry, smithing, tailoring and tinkering cost alot to skill up.  they get costly around 103 skill.  That makes a real difference.<br />
<br />
Talk to smiths who ran their skills up before the fine steel trivials were adjusted down and those smiths who did not.  It costs a tremendous amount to skill up smithing now in comparison.  Like x5 or more times more costly to skill up than two months ago.<br />
<br />
likewise talk to the shaman who skilled in alchemy before the herb costs were reduced.  Its about 1/4 th of what it used to be.<br />
we use cheaper ingredients than jewelers but they get a much better return on the stuff they sell back.  and they can loot gems to work with. <br />
<br />
This topic has been worked to death.  Besides improving the buy back costs, or giving us more sellable potions, itt would help alot if we could loot herbs or forage them.  No reason I can think of why shaman could not have a limited forage ability just for herbs for alchemy.  Not going to happen but, we can dream.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">&quot;itt would help alot if we could loot herbs&quot;<br />
<br />
You can loot herbs in Chardok off the herb sarnaks. Shame they aren't more widely lootable though.<br />
<br />
BTW, if you don't want to save money on herbs, do the old potions like stinging wort, dulsehound, and the fire giant toe one. You can either sell to players for good cash, or use half a 10-charge yourself and sell back to the vendor for almost the same amount as the herbs cost.<br />
<br />
Take forever farming that number of toes though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">150pp per skill point or so is about the best I have been able to get beyond skill 90.  Too pricey to be very high on my plat budget list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">That's about standard.  7 points for 1K is about what I got.<br />
<br />
Yes it's expensive.<br />
<br />
Is it worth it?  /shrug  Depends on the person and the guild, I would say.  A couple of people have asked me to add a section to my guide to discuss this very topic.  I have held off because the vast majority of people would say it's NOT worth it.  However, there are those few insane people out there who ENJOY tradeskilling to max and I wouldn't want to discourage them from finding enjoyment in this game in this manner by including a paragraph of discouragement in the Guide.<br />
<br />
Estimates I've been given by those people who have hit 180 (I'm only level 56 so I can't max it yet) are that it costs approximately 20K to max alchemy at 180 from start to finish.  You can offset some of that cost by reselling some of the potions or by making specific non-triv potions by request.<br />
<br />
Have to have deep pockets...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Was the person who did 7 points for 1k at 103 skill have maxed wis or int?<br />
<br />
I don't think the other stats matter, like the other tradeskills, it's your maximum of wis or int, with the exception of Dex for Fletching and Strength for Smithing.<br />
<br />
Smithing is /horribly/ expensive now if you go the store bought route to 156 (gold chain mail), or heart breakingly annoying to farm if you decide to go the fs visor route (lq pelt + silk thread).<br />
<br />
I'm at 133 skill in smithing, totally broke, not ready to farm things for hours... I'm working on my 5th shawl so my priority right now is to raise my 124 tailoring to 158, I've got a backpack full of silk swatches and I'm buying vials of mana like there's no tomorrow for a giant tailoring run. Also farming in Velks for cc silk and the threads I need for the 5th shawl. I doubt I will have the patience to get the 210 cc silk I need to get my skill to 131 (Assuming 7 tries per 1 point skillup average, knowing that at 124 skill it takes 2 silks to make a swatch, 3 swatches to make mail or leggings, the only things not trivial at this point). That's 10 1/2 stacks of cc silk.<br />
<br />
So my current plan is to finish gathering the 75 (plus a buffer of 15) cc threads, and use whatever cc silks I have on hand before jumping straight to Wu's.<br />
<br />
As for smithing, I'll return to that soon, smithing and tailoring are the only two tradeskills that are too low to finish the 8th shawl. I probably won't bother getting tailoring far above 158 right now as I'm getting my butt whopped in mons letalis (I lack a JBB), and farming for acrylia is frustrating, but at skill 158 + geerlok, I can at least make the 6th shawl in a few tries.<br />
<br />
As for Alchemy, I'm on the fence. I want to be the best Shammy I can, so I will probably eventually raise it above 101. But right now, all my plat goes towards Tailoring, or my JBB fund (I just scraped together 15k, but I can't find anyone selling the damn thing :)). I'm also paying myself back for all the plat I spent skilling up so far in Alchemy. I'm almost even with that considering I sell sow potions to friends and guildmates at 75 plat, and 100 plat for everyone else, shrink on demand (very rarely), ITU on demand.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">In case it's confusing, I saved 2k for smithing to see how far it would take me from 124. The answer? less than 9 points via the mail route with storebought HQ ore.<br />
<br />
The JBB fund is another entity entirely - I won't spend my JBB money on tradeskills, no matter how much I want to :)</div></div><hr />

This was before Titan's potions, though, I did it the old way, making Greater Resist potions, and giving them out to guildies for Dragon raids.<br />

I'd rather have the JBB, personally.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grromp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">You have to get creative to level Alchemy affordably.<br />
<br />
Personally, I got &quot;sponsors.&quot;  People with a ton of money who wanted a certain type of potion.<br />
<br />
They gave me a fixed amount of money, and I put EVERY PP of it towards making whatever non-trivial potion they wanted.  First it was SoW.  Then Shrink.  Then the higher DS ones.<br />
<br />
It turns out to be a good deal for all parties.  In my experience, I wound up giving them more potions than the market price would have been, but I got to level my skill, &quot;free.&quot;<br />
<br />
Definitely worth doing, too, if you have a trader mule.  My mule has a couple of gate potions, a few ten dose Shrink, Grow, and SoW potions on it, and any time I leave it up overnight, I'm good for about 1,000pp in pure profit.  Which I can promptly spend trying to level my tradeskills more.  It's a vicious cycle...  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">You do good. It takes me 3 days to make about a K in profit, and that's friday sat sunday, sales are slower on the weekdays. I find mornings are the best times for sales, often before I get up PST, so I try to make sure she's all good to go before bedtime.<br />
<br />
Of course, I don't do gate potions yet, just shrink grow and sow, I have sold 30 sow potions in the past 3 days, 6 shrink (I ran out of stock), 2 grow.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking of expanding to do cure disease and cure poison and invis undead as I would like to have some on hand for my friends (friends and guildmates get a discount). These seem to have a wildly fluctuating price so I doubt I will get regular sales of these, but they would be nice to say, hey, buy it from my trader mule and I'll reimburse ya the diff, rather than &quot;go fetch me this, that, and this, and I'll combine&quot;.<br />
<br />
I was going to do some more titans potions today, but someone had aggro'd Staeon (one of 2 alchemy vendors who sells grow components in the entire game), all the way to the nexus teleport pad, and he was stuck there for 30 mins before I gave up and logged. As usual, wouldn't sell. &quot;Can't you see I'm busy here?&quot;<br />
<br />
I just dinged 58 last night, yay, I can now go up to 170 in alchemy. I'm still at 142 so it's time to start clcking on the titans, as 170 means finally the gate potions go trivial... not that they'll have a good success rate, but at least they'll be trivial.<br />
<br />
2 more levels to go, trying to get to 60 by my birthday, wish me luck... that's a level every 2 weeks.... I've been doing a level a week, but I hear 59 is a killer even with the rebalancing, so we'll see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Gaahh. I just did another skillup run. I got 4 points for my 1k in titans, with maxed wis (255).<br />
<br />
I'm now at 146. If this keeps up, it will take 8.5k to get to 180... sigh, that is very depressing for a shammy who is 1) trying to save for torpor/malo, and 2) insisting that alchemy pay for itself, that means several weeks of selling potions...<br />
<br />
Then I went and did pottery. 40 combines, I got /one/ skillup. (I am now at 208 skill in pottery). On the bright side, I got 39 opal steins now. On the down side, I have 39 opal steins and 9 titans potions now that I have to sell. My trader is now FULL. I may have to start using my primary account to sell crap when I'm not on... (using my old alt). Or bank crap to sell later. Either option is pretty depressing.<br />
<br />
I have very little room left for shrink and sow as it is, I'll definatley have to do one or the other as titans sell very rarely and I need to keep selling my mainstays....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Grromp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Sort of off topic, but..<br />
<br />
For pottery, you're definitely going to want to swap over to Star Ruby Encrusted Steins now, Harvyst.  They sell for good dough, as they are used in the Earring of Solstice/PoTC quest.<br />
<br />
Always look for a way to make money with your skills, even if you level them slower.  Long run, you can do more tradeskills if you have more money.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Do you think the failure rate on star rubies will be horrible with 208 skill? That's what I am worried about - loosing money too fast because I fail 4x combines. I do have a geerlok though, so I can throw in that. (Not using for the opals because I have more opals than I know what to do with). I'll look into the cost ratio....<br />
<br />
A sad note.<br />
<br />
Last night, a screwy bug ate my Trader. I am petitioning, emailing, phone calling, and chatting trying to get her back. She had about 7k worth of tradeskill stuff I was selling (and in her overstuffed bank) (titans, shrink, sow, opal steins), and that's going to hurt if I have to eat the loss... :(<br />
<br />
Call me spoiled, but I really enjoy tradeskilling, but it's going to take me weeks to work back the 7k to restock a vendor, plus I just lost my enchanted claymaker to boot (that was the vendor).<br />
<br />
CS gave me the lead gm's email address, but so far, no luck. I've spent 7 hours petitioning in the game too, guide upped it to GM.<br />
<br />
It's a real downer for my tradeskilling hobby. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Grromp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Cost for a Star Ruby Stein - about 100pp.<br />
Sales price of a Star Ruby Stein - about 2000-2500pp.<br />
<br />
At 208, you're going to succeed about half the time (I did a batch of 20, and my skill is 203.  I hit on 9).  So you could get the world's worst fail fit, and still turn a nice profit.  What do you sell the Opal ones for?  50?  75?  Hard to turn a profit on that ratio, if you ask me.  :)<br />

Good luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">It's offtopic - but star ruby steins only sell for about 300-400p on The Nameless.  Just an FYI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Star Rubies sell for 300-500p on Rodcet. So I need to have a 1/3 to succeed to break even.<br />
<br />
I might try adding a few to my repetoire, and see how bad the loss is. But one bad run with rng could be dangerous.<br />
<br />
I sell opals for 50 p, seems to be a good standard price. That's a 20 p profit because my operating costs, including failures (both in the laquering stage, the pottery wheel, and the kiln) is about 30 plat.<br />
<br />
To friends I sell for 30 p, at cost, just to get rid of the damn things.<br />
<br />
The problem with opals is that they do sell, but they sell slowly, and I am not the only person with 40 opal steins in my inventory. So it takes awhile before I have the inventory space to do another batch.<br />
<br />
The big money in pottery is in the idols, or faithstones, or crucibles of escape, but I'd rather not waste my money or time on iron oxide until I am closer to 250.</div></div><hr />
