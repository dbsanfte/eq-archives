<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celadreal</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 09:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hope the pictures at the nektulos.com etc. are just pics not screenshots becuase I could never handle that quality graphics. And I would hate to miss out on the exploration of this new world. Anyone have any info on this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Durgen</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why can’t you handle that quality of graphics?  Technical or personal reasons?  <br />
<br />
And btw.. I do believe those are actual screenshots.  The EQ2 engine is suppose to be based on/shared with the Star Wars Galaxies engine. And those pictures are SW:G quality in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blackguard</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While the system requirements and image quality both seem really high to us now, the proposed release date is not until October 2003.  That's a year and a half away, and almost no game comes out on time in this world.<br />
<br />
So if you're worried about your current computer running the game, start saving up.  If it can't already run Luclin in its sleep, you'll have to upgrade in a year anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sean SpiritArrow</div><div class="date">04-27-2002, 06:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Min specs will most likely end up being a 1.3 gig machine and a geforce 3 from what I've been told... not sure I want to know the recommended specs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rumour</div><div class="date">04-28-2002, 02:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">:confused:  My system specs exceed the current minimum requirements right now... I should certainly have no problem in 2003.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xaen</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 12:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye.. By the time it is finished, the specs will probably be 2Ghz machines that will cost $200 around then.. Just looking at the screenshows make my 1.6 GForce3 system ache in pain. Let alone adding 70 people in front of any of those.<br />
<br />
All I can think of is that they're have multiple detail levels, which would be a good idea anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darklogix</div><div class="date">05-22-2002, 11:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Remember that SoL was supposed to allow us to see capes n cloaks on folks too, but it was taken out cause 50-80% of the players machines couldnt handle it (back when a Voodoo3 would run Kunark well)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kirec</div><div class="date">05-27-2002, 02:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't worry guys - it's a modern engine, not the 3-year-old one that EQ currently uses.<br />
<br />
A LOT of new things have been added in the 3d graphics world since the advent of EQ.<br />
<br />
Also, you're thinking in today's terms - I highly doubt anyone will be buying a brand new 1.2 GHz computer a year and a half from now.  Everyone will have 3 GHz computers with Geforce 6's. :)</div></div><hr />
