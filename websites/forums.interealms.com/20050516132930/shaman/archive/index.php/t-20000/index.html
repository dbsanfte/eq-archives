My Guild atm is Tier 2 (according to Inny.com tier progression) and we're killing in the Halls of Testing heading towards NToV soon and then our main goal is Sleeper's Tomb. Above are the mobiles deemed Tier 8 by Innoruuk Server members, it is our second goal to progress in such a way as to take these mobiles out and finish our Vex Thal Key quest. <br />
<br />
I'm just wondering what kind of stats, AAs, gear, resists etc are required by the guilds that frequent places like NToV, Sleepers Tomb and the above posted boss kills. I want to put together a type of post on my guild website, an objective list for our Shaman, so that they have some goals to shoot for in the coming months so that we can accomplish our goals. <br />
<br />
Any feedback is helpful. I appreciate your time. Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Gonna assume Mobiles=mobs, but really it depends on how many people you have in your guild. I'd say at a minimum for the easier spots your gonan want level 60 as a cut off. And as ya progress 65 should really be the goal, with certain aa's. <br />
I'd start off with level 60 with malo as your cut off for ntov, with mgb a really good thing to have. By the time your going after Emp and higher tiered pop ya want 65, mgb, malo or malos, radiant cure, canni v and either remove curse or remove greater curse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Science of War has a ton of raid mob spoilers in their forums.<br />
<br />
<br />
Levels and AA are more important overall than a set resist or stat number, in my opinion, in terms of gearing up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmm, SoW is in PoTime Henora, not really a realistic basis for people just breaking into tier 2/3 PoP, NToV and VT.<br />
<br />
Just off the top of my head pulling out, I'd say something like the following is not an unreasonable aim...I wouldn't expect all shaman to have this at the moment if you are raiding HoT still.<br />
<br />
Equipment: 2500+ unbuffed hp, 100 in all resists wearing normal gear (not BD stuff)<br />
<br />
Level: 65, it makes such a difference.<br />
<br />
Essential AA: Canni V &amp; MGB<br />
<br />
Nice AA: SCRM, RC<br />
<br />
More Nice AA: ND3, LR5, SCM3, QB2<br />
<br />
Essential spells: 2xFo7, 2xTalisman of boar, Tnarg's mending for all,  later on at least 2 should have RGC too<br />
<br />
Useful spells: Quissence, FA<br />
<br />
No hard and fast rules for what's &quot;needed&quot;, but I think these are all good targets to aim for. Plenty posts on AA progression but I've listed those I think most important for all shaman on raids. Main slower might want to add defensive AA sooner, if you have such a thing (we swap around so peops don't get bored).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Goldark - if you had actually visited their forums, you would know they have an extensive library of spoilers.  Including ones for:<br />

Which the original poster specifically mentioned in his post as needing information for, search the Public Library forum for it.  There is also some other random information in there about other topics that may be of interest to this person.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 ok, does these &quot;spoilers&quot; include : armor, AA's, Stats and such?<br />
<br />
  Nice Site, BUT I would like to get information from those who are on this site. You all play Shamans and i would like to get an idea of the Stats, AA's, Gear and Resist Gear needed to progress through the listed Mobs.<br />
<br />
  This information will them help us set up goals for our Shamans to achioeve so we may continue to progress further.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dargothlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ok, I &quot;searched&quot; the Libraries and I found them to be ok, but still not the info i am looking for.<br />
<br />
 I need class information as to the stats, weapons, armor, aa's, hp and such for the mentioned progression. So far I have found very little information that helps.<br />
<br />
 If anyone has a few links, I could sure use them. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We've done everything you list there but saryn (not keyed for it yet), aten (working on VT now) and ring of vulak (no real interest) and we are not yet in elementals.  Here's the list of what your shamans NEED:  Malos, Turgur's.  <br />
<br />
Shamans with lots of AAs, good equipment, high hps, high resists, loads of mana are NOT the make or break of these encounters.  <br />
<br />
You can look at our guildroster for AAs and equipment if you think it would help.  The roster is embarrassingly misleading in two respects:  I'm not on it because I'm currently inactive, though probably one of the better equipped shaman in the guild.  And though we have a lot on the roster, our average raid force is anywhere from about 46-72 depending on what encounter it is.</div></div><hr />
