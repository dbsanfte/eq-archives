<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Setantha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Woot...lvl 40 and DEF at 200. AC now 900 with shield :))    Problem is I normally use 2hb :confused: <br />
<br />
Now my question: Do I now get the benefits of having a higher AC than 850+...or do I need to have 901 AC ?<br />
<br />
Set</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The theory goes at every 100 mark there is a significant drop in how often things hit you and every 50 mark there is a damage reduction.  From 850-899 you should see about the same amount of damage but from 900-949 there should be less hits.<br />
<br />
When I'm soloing I adjust my gear based on what I'm facing.  Straight-up melee I go for AC and can get my AC just over 900 so I do so.   Last night in Mistmoore helping a friend on a quest I dropped the AC &amp; put all my resist gear.  Still didn't help much, green mobs were still landing 200 point nukes :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">900 should work just fine.  I strongly recommend working up piercing as well as the 2hb.  a shield can help a lot in getting to the next ac point of 950 (e.g. a 25 ac SBS or Clay Guardian will net you about 38 ac).  And there are some very nice piercing weapons available for shaman.  I used a REIF until I finally got the Spear of Fate, but Howling Harpoon or Spine Chill are also very nice.<br />
<br />
and you can always add WIS with a shield, as well as ac.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">2hbs suxxah! Hehe, What are you going to do when you get 30ac+ shields ;) You can get so many Hp's Ac from shields its almost silly to do 2hb.. Although I'm sure theres some uabr shaman 2hb out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Its good to keep 2h blunt up, if ya dont what are you gonna do when you get rabid bear? Use epic spear for it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hmm, I have also maxxed defence 2 levels ago, and now my ac is 860 w/ shield of falsehood (till i get 2k for SBS or Bladestopper), this will boost it to around 870, then what? I have almost full JB (cept bp/legs) and rest is the highest AC gear i could find for slots(cept ears, they only 2ac). Is 870 good till i can get into a good guild and try for JB legs and JBBp or better? Just a little worryed that my ac is stuck at 870 for another 10 levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Setantha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My last shaman had 850ish AC at lvl 54 and he did alright. I been lucky this time around with my old guild and old friends etc, but so long as DEF is maxxed (or close to it) I dont think you need to worry. Maxxing DEF was my own personal target, as was getting as much AC as possible. At the end of the day, if you can drop the mob you have pulled...thats all that really matters no matter what way you do it ;)</div></div><hr />
