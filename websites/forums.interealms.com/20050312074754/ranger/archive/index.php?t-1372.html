<br />
Swifty really isnt that hard to get IMO, as far as the JR just take one stong group and do the em. Only do em for one pop tho once youve killed em all take your group somewhere and get exp.  The next night hit the reavers before you exp again. Do this and youll have one in no time.<br />
<br />
Fungi tunic is the best tunic for a ranger, unless your tanking, but then id only wear something else if it was quest or better.  If your guild raids aoe mobs its great, it helps solo the ac loss really doesnt matter.  I am in a guild that doesnt really raid anything past kael, have never bought any item over 4k and have 992 ac unbuffed.  <br />
<br />
You def. want both of them and i think itd be easier to buy the fungi and camp the JR, can say to the guild hey i need to go camp this for my epic pls help, but if you get your guild to help you camp a fungi then your still gonna be rolling against others there.<br />
<br />
If you have the hate stone in the bank though and can get both epics, then i might go with that.  Also depends what BP your wearing now and what weapons you have.</div></div><hr />

Jade reavers are not extremely rare from what I have seen, its just that reavers are not done often unless someone needs the item for their epic, so none are being gotten and sold. Of course you could just go down and camp the fungi also, but I think the reaver would be easier to camp myself. But both epics &gt; fungi, if you intend to buy the fungi and not camp the jade reaver I think you are taking the wrong route.</div></div><hr />

Are you asking which item you should &quot;buy&quot; ? If you aren't capable of doing the Epic quest without paying someone for it then I would suggest the Fungi tunic. After you buy your fungi tunic you should sell all of your droppable gear and buy a cloak of flames, some sweet piercing weapons, and as much Myrloakers as possible. Once you've done this give  everything you just bought to a good friend you can trust for a transfer. Then delete your ranger, create an uber rogue and have your friend give the rogue all the phat L3\/\/T. You should be level 60  with a Ragebringer in no time.</div></div><hr />

In order to do that effeciently you need to be able to do considerable damage. If you don't have your epics chances are you don't have weapons greater than epic-level output. If thats the case Fungi won't help that much. Epics are very very valuable weapons, this is downplayed because so many people have them. If I were you I would get your epics, I would try to raid for the pieces instead of buying them also. You really need alot of other great gear + fungi to be a solo machine, the tunic alone isn't going to get you there. If you have less than 40% haste the epic will more than make up for the lost regen with the increased damage.</div></div><hr />

The Fungi is nice, but as others have said with 50% slow and 40% haste you kill it faster. You can also get a ton of regen from Force of Nature/Choloroplast.<br />
<br />
With the epics you could solo enough junk to make the plat to buy the fungi, that isn't true the other way around. I use my fungi mostly for aoe mobs when raiding or soloing. Rest of the time I use my Untamed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Between Chloroplast, Skin Like Nature, Force of Nature and AA, we can match or exceed the Fungi's regen anyway.<br />
<br />
(Yes, I know the Fungi stacks with all of that.  But truthfully, if one fell in my lap, I'd pass it on to one of the guild's pure fighters or Shaman.  It would be a much greater increase in their power than mine.)</div></div><hr />

Incidentally, before you spend that 3k on the PoA sphere, I would urge you to contact someone in KC about it, preferably Aegerenth (sp?) or Darton.   On /ranger, they mentioned a week or so ago that they had spheres for mq, and there is always the chance they will set a better price :)</div></div><hr />

If you're already wielding Swiftblade of Zek and a Toxiferous Axe, or other similarly powered weapons, and have a high level haste item like a CoF, then go for the fungi. The epics will actually be a downgrade in damage and a HUGE increase in taunt. Otherwise, I'd go for the epics.</div></div><hr />

There something I'm doin' wrong?<br />
<br />
By the way, my equipment?   HAHAHAHA!!!  Don't even mention it.  I'm currently BP-less, ring-less, and belt-less (though I just picked up a Crush Tunic today:D  And beyond that, I think my most expensive peice of equipment is probably a lupine dagger.  I'm totally gimptified.  Go Ivy Etched Leggings!  Go Bracer of Scavenging!<br />

Since I'm SEoC-less as well, Earthcaller will have to wait, but nonetheless I think I'll go for Swifty rather than a fungi.  Now let's just hope everything works out with the JR I've got on hold:D</div></div><hr />

PoA stone might be worth the 3k since it might be a hassle, but single groups can get jade reaver and I'm sure you've got a few friends who'd go help with that.<br />
<br />
If you're looking for pure stats, epic would be the choice... but as far as lifetime satisfaction goes, i'd say do the quest, don't buy it.</div></div><hr />

I know its a pretty rare drop and all but, I just finished helping a ranger friend get her's as one of her last pieces.  It took a few trips, and a couple times I thought of just buying it for her, but once one dropped I was sooo glad I didn't.  It was just hard to spend 20k on an item from CoM lol, its silly to me epic or not.  Keep doing CoM and you'll eventually get a reaver.  You may not get the money for fungi again for quite a while.<br />
<br />
Look at it this way, if you can get a group together for it: the whole time you're there, you're getting exp exp cause its one group, not a raid.  Its really pretty damn good exp for anybody under 58 or so, and even at 60 I was getting some (a few dark blue mobs and lots of lights).  You'll probably get an ORS every 2 hours and they still sell for a few k or so, along with some MoSS and throneblades.  If you get an extra reaver ( could happen ) all the better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you solo or group more?<br />
<br />
Fungi if you solo, epic otherwise. At 50+ if you pick your targets wisely you can solo with no downtime using a fungi. Epic may alow you to kill a little faster, but you will still take more damage and have more downtime than if you had a fungi.</div></div><hr />

<br />
IT IS RUMOURED THAT THE JADE REAVER DROPS HAS BEEN INCREASED.<br />
<br />
I can only confirm this. Last week i joined up with some guildies. We took about 10 people there and killed us some. We about about 4 reavers (where 1 of them went on a string of 6, 1 did a string of 2 or 3, the rest did a phantom/lord poof). By the end of the fun, we had 3 Jade Reavers drop.</div></div><hr />

And those who think that fungi is only for soloing....  I don't buy it.  I use mine for solo... I use mine for ae, and because I now can maintain 1200 ac with fungi on.... ( I believe in the 1200 soft cap on ac) I use it when I tank as well.  As you level the epic will get significantly easier to get.  Fungi will not.  A warder with a handful of buddies can do swirftwind in a matter of a couple of days when most of your servers contested mobs are down and not due for 2-3 days.    A warder with a handful of buddies could now camp Fungi for weeks and not win a roll.  The efficient use of time or plat falls heavily toward fungi.  I don't think peeps who do not wear fungi can comprehend how much that regen does for overall abilities.  And when you start putitng points into aa regen... it just compounds the benefits.  If you have the opportunity to get earthcaller vs. fungi go with earthcaller.  Slow beats regen anyday imo  but barely.  I was under the assumption a coupled pointed out... that it was swift vs fungi.  In that case ... for crying out loud if you need haste that bad get a sash of D if you can't afford a rbb or dragon cloak and some of the cheap but still amazing weapons if you can't do ntov... etc.  centis, jagged, defience, are cheap now.  Crescent blades adn the like are down below 20k on my server too.  Good luck mate...  nice problem to have.  )</div></div><hr />

hehe I wish I could buy a fungi for 40 - 60k. They're going for upwards of 100k on Torvonnilous. It's absolutely ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

If ya really want a regen I would go for the iskar BP. Its what I wear, and like it so much I even sold my treeweave. Sure its not as nice as the fungi and the ac is low but, its 35k+ cheaper... and with SoN, FoN and cloro... I haven't cast heal soloing since i hit 55.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The mere fact that you will get 40% haste should be enough (how much does the CoF sell for?) , but being able to slow a mob 50%?  This not only makes soloing ALOT easier, but in group situations where there is no enchanter or shaman as well.<br />
<br />
And like Dlaritan said.. You can be buffed like mad, but if you do not get a proc while soloing, you get eatten alive.   Epics win hands down IMHO.</div></div><hr />

What you DON'T have is 15pt standing regen.....hmmm. If you don't have haste that comes close I guess the epics are the way to go, but if you do, it'd be more of a tossup.</div></div><hr />

Epics are invaluable... hell i deequiped my swiftwind for a few days trying to convince the guild i accidently gave it to the key master in PoA... even with DCoS or chanter haste, and a Decent 1hs i wasnt dealing nearly the same damage<br />

Why isn't anyone commenting about what people say when they see you run past with lightning on your swords.  That means something.  I never felt as much a Ranger as when I completed my epics.  Anyone with plat can buy a fungi, but only Rangers can wield the lightning swords.  DO you know how many times on HoT Raids I announce &quot;(Mob) slowed via a Ranger epic&quot;  and peeps say &quot;didn't we have a Shaman? lol but he had gotten a number of resists.  The fungi will benefit you but your epics will benefit everyone you ever ground with from just one additional peep to a 40+ person raid.  I don not understand why this is even a discussion.<br />

As a side note, if you were on my server, someone would MQ the air stone for you for free, and strangers would set up CoM raids with you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you shouldn't have to pay for your epic.  why spend money on it when with a little patience you can get it for free?  with the exception of maybe PoA stone you should be able to do this rather cheap... <br />
<br />
I was REALLY tempted to buy JR cuz of the crappy drop-rates I got but after 3 trips to CoM I finally got one and was very happy I didn't waste the cash on it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have the fungi, can't get anyone to do the Epic parts I need.  So unless I get all the parts I need I will just have to do the fungi.  <br />
<br />
For the record........  The epics are not easy time wise.  They require a massive time investment.  Be prepared to sit and camp VSR for 20+ hours after he dies.  Then get a group and go to CoM and pray that a JR drops.  Then get raid force and go to PoA and the Hole.  Finallly get another raid force together and pray that you get a drop in Hate.  PoA raids usually last 3-4 hours to get to the island for the drop maybe longer.  JR you can get lucky on.  The Hole is pretty easy just a pain to get into.  Hate will take you forever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Never, and I didn't say anything to indicate that I thought you could. Normally folks use the swarmy till slow procs, then switch to something that DOES approach the epic DPS...say a woodsmans' or a exquisite velium/LSoEE combo. The point was that a nice slow is available on another weapon besides the EC, and haste approching SW haste is also fairly common.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crydee Ossiriand</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 07:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you spend your entire playing existance soloing and never grouping with another player ever, sure a fungi may be good. But so would epics.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you do play with other players, consider this...<br />
<br />
1. When the shaman or enchanter in your group (or raid) dies before the mob gets slowed, a fungi isn't going to be able to slow the mob either.<br />
<br />
2. When you're not taking much in the way of damage to the point that even Chloroplast alone does the job, how much regen do you really need?<br />
<br />
3. When you go fight a dragon or some other AE mob, a fungi isn't going to give you +10 to all resistances. It is also not going to be able to regen you enough make up for not having those resistances.<br />
<br />
4. After Morting Swiftwind, our local uber ranger Sean latter decided he needed to get another for archery and posted about it. I know of other rangers that had banked their epics (instead of Morting them,) only to pull Swiftwind out again for archery.<br />
When was the last time you saw a posting by someone who morted (ok sold) the fungi cause he thought he didn't need it only to find himself going to get another?<br />
<br />
5. Along the same lines as #4, a fungi doesn't do a single thing help archery.<br />
<br />
<br />
As you can see, epics are multi-functional.<br />
<br />
<br />
While people will often make statements how Earthcaller is easy to replace, it took me a trip to NTOV and getting a 41% offhand haste item to &quot;replace&quot; Swiftwind for everyday usage. Even then, the haste increase I am getting is very minor to the point that I will definately be getting out Swiftwind anytime that resistances matter more.<br />

Swiftwind &amp; Earthcaller &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fungi</div></div><hr />
