<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>EQBendur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking for some advice.  I 2-box a shammy/rogue and gf runs the warrior.  We are in CoM at the moment and will probably stay through 52.  Our funds were recently pooled and we put about 12k into bazaar gear for the warrior, focusing heavily on AC.<br />
<br />
I'm looking for 2 things.  1, where should we be focusing our hunting after leaving CoM at around 53?  We primarily like the mass blues that get mowed down easily.  2, which mobs can the three of us start trying to farm to improve gear at that level.  I'm hoping to be able to replace the warrior gear with equivelant AC items that also add in some resists, as that is where we are lacking and I rarely try to keep resist buffs on us.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

BendurNurga would be good.  Easy mobs at the front, challenging mobs at the back.<br />
