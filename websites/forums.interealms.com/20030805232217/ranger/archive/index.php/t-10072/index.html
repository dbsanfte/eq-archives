<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Foreststalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wouldn't work, unless it is a improved animal fear.  If a ranger can fear anything outdoors, then they can solo most of anything they want.  Kind of like using a Bio orb, incredible advantage when bow kiting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>tdgreer1203</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok, we can't get ports, even though we are supposed to be like the druids, we can't get good enough ac, even though we are melee, at least give us fear. I understand what everyone on here is saying, but its like some people have been saying, the chances of us being able to port are very, very slim, but they could at least give us the spell fear. This way it wouldn't be so hard for us to solo. I'm pushing for ports too, but I would do just fine with fear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Domandred</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A true fear, even if just outdoors, would honestly overpower us.  I frequently park my cleric right behind me and do one thing with her /stand, /assist ....FEAR, /sit (well okay that's four things).<br />
<br />
Very rarely do I heal myself with her.  Instead I heal myself and chloro.  With her fear and my DPS we take down pretty much anything that is not raid level and can be feared with absolutly no downtime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>tdgreer1203</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Man, thats awesome. I get what your saying though, and they could put some limitations on it, but still, plain animal fear just doesn't work as well as a regular fear would.</div></div><hr />
