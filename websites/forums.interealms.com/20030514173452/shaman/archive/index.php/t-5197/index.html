<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I'm lvl 58 working on getting to 59.   Katta for me as a Troll has been a great place to Exp.    I've either duo'd with my RL wife with her 58 Ranger ... or solo'd for last level and half when I only have a couple hours to spend.    That's background.<br />
<br />
Before patch with 4 yellows into 58 ... I could get a blue and half in a hour.<br />
First patch took me down to 2 and half hours to get a full blue.<br />
Second patch has me somewhere around hour plus for a blue.<br />
<br />
I know that the exp number to get out of 58 has changed.  And that 58's exp pool number was much easier than 59's.    But it still feels like Katta experience is lesser than before even with exp resorting.   I've noticed that Katta is NOT getting any lvl 60 AA'rs post patches.    <br />
<br />
Anyone else noticing the same thing?   I'm only a blue or so from 59 now ... so will be able to post on 59 experience shortly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Runicmyst Outlander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">After a break from EQ, I came back and noticed xp in katta was signifigantly lower, even after the second patch. I'm glad to see it wasn't just my mind. Also, my xp bar lost two blues, but I am assuming this is due to the revamping of 50-60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>FloppyDisks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Katta appears to be back to what it was exp wise.  The reason you feel it is less is because 58 requires more exp now then it did pre-patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Judlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I am currently doing Nathan Illum guards and am getting a blue bub per hour duoing(lvl59).  As for the loss in your exp bar to the guy who posted above, i think you are the only person who experienced this, ya may want to contact verant and ask them why you were the only person to lose 2 bubs of exp......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I guess until more testing is completed ... the feel for exp is going to be completely subjective.    Good thing is Katta got me through 58.   Even better is it's still good exp for 59 ... though it is slower than 58.   <br />
<br />
But I'm not complaining at all ... happy for 59 exp to be leveled off a bit.   On the other hand ... I've made it through all the other Hell levels so would have suffered through 59 as it was.   It never made sense to me for 59 exp to be so skewed.</div></div><hr />
