<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We who play EQ sometimes don't see the big picture.  EQ is a money making enterprise owned by a large corporation.  EQ exists because it makes a large profit for this corporation.  And true to almost any corporate ethos, the more money EQ makes the better it is.<br />
<br />
So how do you increase your profit margin with a service product like EQ?  Not only do you charge a monthly fee, but you regularly introduce new content to keep customers from getting bored with the product.  Each time EQ releases a new expansion, they see an additional influx of cash that supplements the already sizeable income they recieve from monthly fees.  In fact, expansions must be so profitable that corporate managers in charge of EQ probably pressure their employees to turn them out as fast as possible.<br />
<br />
Such pressure means that developers and designers must focus on producing new content as fast as possible.  Furthermore, that new content must appeal to a wide variety of customers, from the ultra-elite end game users to the casual gamer.  How do you keep up with such pressure to create?  You try to build content that incorporates established norms of design that don't require complex adjustments to existing content.  You assume, for example, that class balance is fine as it is.  Then you add content that increases the demands on the abilties of those classes, while at the same time giving the classes slight adjustments to existing tools to deal with those demands.  This means you save time because you don't need to redesign class rolls with each expansion.<br />
<br />
It appears, however, that this formula does not work for shamans, because the established design norm for shamans was to make them comparatively weak in all of their abilities while making them powerful at debuffing mobs.  Unfortunately, the utitlity of debuffing does not scale linearly with increasing mob power.  Rather, since debuffing takes a finite amount of time to apply, the value of debuffing experiences a problem of diminishing returns with increasing mob power.  At some point, mobs are so powerful that debuffing becomes inconsequential to the outcome of each encounter.  When the power of debuffing is thus mitigated, the shaman class is left without any meaningful contribution to encounters.<br />
<br />
As much as the people of this community appreciate the patchwork that SoE applied to our healing, the fact remains that the shaman class has been designed out of the game in GoD.  There appears to be a lot of interesting and challenging content in the expansion, but in their rush to produce it, SoE lost sight of the role of the shaman class.  The old formula doesn't apply to the new content.<br />
<br />
Now that GoD is &quot;old content&quot;, developers are already busy at work with yet another expansion, with its promise of additional cash flow to sweeten the bottom line.  Few resources can be spared to fix what was broken in a game that has become so complex that predicting the outcome of new design innovations on game balance is becoming increasingly difficult.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>frroooaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It should have been obvious to everyone, but I doubt it was, so good post  ;)<br />
<br />
Their testing department must be completely inept. They already knew of issues with mitigation in PoP yet put it en masse in GoD with no balancing to the Shaman class. Enchanters get by with their other unique lines (mez, charm) and upgraded spells. Shaman got no unique spells, upgraded direct heals, or upgraded nukes to help with this blatant loss of balance in a fast pace environment. This is beyond squeaking by, I dread to see what new GoD areas have in store for us.</div></div><hr />

Adding expansions - new content - would be welcomed by the vast majority of players if the expansions contained what they wanted - something new.<br />
<br />
The problem is that adding something genuinely new requires some imagination from the Devteam.  On the other hand trotting out the same old stuff, simply changing the graphics and upping the mob's toughness does not.</div></div><hr />

Um, thanks for reiterating my point Crusty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't agree that adding new expansions necessarily sidelines the shaman.  The way that they chose to approach it in GoD - high DPS, low HP mobs - sidelines us.  The Luclin approach (lower DPS, high HP mobs) actually favored us.<br />
<br />
I do agree that the class balance has gotten way out of whack over time.  There's only so many times you can build a new story on top of the old foundation before you exceed its design parameters.</div></div><hr />

GoD is the first expansion which i regretted to buy. Wish there was a money-back option....</div></div><hr />

<br />
While, in a very general way, I agree with your sentiment, this paragraph should shout out, quite loudly, the solution.  Learn a new formula.<br />
<br />
The days of simply hitting Malo/Malosinia/Malos and then Turgur's, sitting, and mana regen'ing are over.  No more hot key shaman.  What a shame.  Because in the last year or so, I have become really disgusted with what passes for a large part of the shaman community.  Shaman that know one role, and one role only, and can't even play that part well.  I cringe at how many times I have been on an alt, and heard a shaman say oom.  Or watched a tank go down, because the shaman in the group wouldn't hit a quick heal in between the clerics ch.  Didn't even have it mem'ed up.  But he sure as heck had his dog icon still loaded.  After having already cast it.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but in this game, only one class has one specific role, and that is the warrior.  Maybe it is time for people to look to some of the other things a shaman can do, beyond slowing and buffing.<br />
<br />
Has SOE overlooked us?  In many ways, yes.<br />
<br />
Have they slapped us in the face?  Fabled Journeyman Boots - nothing more needs to be said there.<br />
<br />
Have they neutered us to the point of being useless?  That depends on the person at the keyboard.  If all a person can do is hit a hot key or 2, then maybe they deserve to be useless, and go sit in Kunark somewhere.  Regardless of class, I prefer to group with someone that can think, and operate, outside of the box.</div></div><hr />

I have to ask how the slap occured? Seriously, you guys should watch the Fedex commercials about &quot;taking the drama out&quot; of situations. I can't help but think of the catchphrase &quot;We're doomed&quot; when I see comments like this.<br />
<br />
Think about it. So people can camp an item that will let them cast sow. SLAP.... lol... who honestly cares? SoW is not the be all and end all and I really could care less about it. So Sow potions might not be as sought after, but who on earth really buys them anyway?<br />
<br />
Slappety slap slap slap. It's a fantasy game. I think you all get just a teeny bit worked up over it.</div></div><hr />

SoW was more important... no... more &quot;unique&quot; (even though several classes got it)... before the advent of Run Speed 3 (and now RS 5)... horses/lizards... potions... buyable TBoots... etc...<br />

Before rangers and beastlords had it...<br />
<br />
People would get shamans and druids, in outdoor zones, just because they could SoW.    SoW was the shiznit.<br />
<br />
It's not anymore... the poorest, not willing to camp person, can get RS 5 and be just 10% slower than SoW.<br />
<br />
Rich people with top horses can already beat it by far.</div></div><hr />

Some of us have played this game since Pre-Kunark... some of us remember when Black Fur boots were the only clickie sow in the game, and had to be earned.<br />
<br />
And some of us know that, even now, they are self only.  Unlike the TGB effect on the Fabled... It was just one example.  I am sure there could be hundreds more added to the list.  That is just the most recent.<br />

Maybe I am just a bit too old school.  Maybe I still take too much pleasure in having gotten my epic before SoL.  Regardless of the worth of the effect on either the SoF or BFB's, the point is, they had to be earned.  Things were different.  And to me, giving a camped item better stats, and a better effect overall, than an item that was earned, is a slap in the face.  Regardless of the overall usefullness of SoW.</div></div><hr />

fudorf,<br />
<br />
I don't buy into the &quot;I used to walk uphill through the snow both directions to Qeynos&quot; line, sorry. The game has changed. So you can target a sow clicky, that is a good thing. Check out the other thread about this, the one where the majority of Shaman (myself included) think it is a godsend that we don't have to cast sow as often. SoW is relatively meaningless. The black boots are still meaningful, you can self click sow yourself on the run. I earned them, so did you. Congratulations. The point is still the same. Dramatic slap in the face comments are bizarre and just wierd.<br />
<br />
This isn't the only thing I can comment about. There are several threads going on regarding the needs of shaman. If I see something that hasn't been said I will add my comment. I am not going to re-iterate someone elses post just to see my name in print. I chose to post against this because I think the whole overly dramatic &quot;Slap in the face&quot; type hysteria is idiotic. That is my choice.<br />
<br />
So, you wise old timer, why don't you settle down and put some ice on that nasty slap mark.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There was no hysteria that was supposed to be implied.  Disgust, yes.  But not hysteria.  And I still get as many tells for a 'billy' as I did before they came out.  And with the advent of PoP, and AA's, SoW is pretty much un-needed.<br />
<br />
I don't disagree with any of the comments about the worth of the effect.  I disagree with the overall stats, and the effect, of an item that is easily camped, as long as you are willing to wait in a line to get it.<br />
<br />
But once again, this was not the main point in my response.  Just a single line.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Surveys have shown that many regular EQ players spend more hours a week playing EQ than we spend at work.  yeah, we get worked up over it.  We have a LOT invested in these chars and this game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gnofr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I am under no illusion that player enjoyment of a &quot;game&quot; has much to do with EQ development priorities.  Profit is a rather pervasive driving force.  That doesn't make it simple.  Even with the prevalent focus on short term return on investment in our modern business environment, there are those looking to the future.  It's hard to carve a piece out for yourself if you can't see past this quarter.<br />
<br />
Maybe SOE's priorities for EQ are solely driven by short term business models.  Certainly they're more aware of all aspects of the competitive arena of the gaming market than any of us outside looking in could possibly be.  Yet seeing Sony's products over the years and considering the wealth of research implied thereby makes me wonder about what EQ's highest and best uses might be.<br />
<br />
If I were looking at how to establish a secure and dominant market share across a broad spectrum of technology burgeoning into cyber space and had EQ within my clutches, I wouldn't squander it solely to short term profits.  I would value it far higher as a research vehicle with a myriad of possible simultaneous uses.<br />
<br />
How does an established consumer base react when we do XYZ?  Where XYZ is anything programmers can implement within the game environment, from simple nerfs and single-click upgrade purchases to the introduction of instanced zones to the replacement of the entire graphics engine to name but a smidgen.  That's without even considering the research potential of the mixed virtual and real economy and its relevance to yet unestablished virtual property law.  Then there are all the possibilities for psychological study and experimentation with avatars, groups, guilds, etc. with an eye toward market development and social engineering.<br />
<br />
As an aside outside such a game as EQ, how long did it take for competing companies to wise up to the war of words on the Web and their place in molding and maintaining a market?  Doesn't anyone fondly recall cross corporate cultural complaints concerning competing content?  It used to be so easy to recognize that sort of troll.  Ah, progress...  Or is that propaganda?  I'm amazed to think how many people take whatever they're fed at face value.  It's as though we're desperate for simplicity and despite the obvious overwhelming complexity of life, stubbornly stick to stupidly simple solutions. <br />
<br />
So it's amusing when people wonder why folks take stuff in EQ so seriously since it's only a game.  To most of us who play and probably to many of the developers, it's &quot;only&quot; a game.  Sony didn't grow into the multi-national corporate giant it is today by being that short-sighted.  I wonder what EQ really is to them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I've been playing this game since before kunark, seen all the expansions and changes to the game and our class that have come down, and I've just got this to say right now.<br />
The game is the best it's ever been.  It's better from starting a character to right up to the end game of PoP Time.  However, the latest expansion (GoD) completely breaks the shaman class.  There's no reason for us in GoD.  No reason to have a shaman along at all, in fact, like hybrids, we have become a nuisance class that must be gimped thru each trial as a third rate contributer, bound to our success or failure by the abilities of other classes.  <br />
<br />
GoD makes my class obsolete.  No, I'm not a bot shaman and yes, I play my class well and actively.  Anyone who's known me over the years can attest to that fact.  But I'm rather out of options.  I just can't do what I need to do to keep up with GoD progression in any sane manner.  Maybe this is payback for shamans being desired in PoP.  Now that we are last on the list of desired classes for GoD.  <br />
<br />
Anyway it's sad and I'm really discouraged to play EQ anymore since it seems that my class has become marginalized to the point of being a joke.  I've liked EQ for years now and it's been a large part of my life.  I've grown attached to my character, and I have no other character that is nearly as powerful as my shaman.  So, I'm not really going to play much until either the class is fixed to HAVE A ROLL in GoD, or I start a new game, like WoW.  Some friends of mine who quit EQ a while back will probably play WoW.  That's reason enough right there to switch games.  <br />
And maybe the WoW shaman class won't be a meaningless joke.</div></div><hr />

If the expansion isn't worth the money to you then why exactly did you buy it? You obviously thought LoY was worth the price or you wouldn't have gotten it. I know pleantly of people who live without it because they didn't want to spend the money on it. No one is holding a gun to your head to buy an expansion, you go out and buy it on your own free will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Wisey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">No need to discuss about business model.  I don't even think the problem is so complex.  It is much simplier.<br />
<br />
Shamans need better heal, fasting casting time for debuff and maybe even newer buff and debuff spells. It doesn't take a lot of programming time to give us the above.  In fact, it may bring more profits because the general population may enjoy EQ and GoD more since they don't have to wait 5 hours to find enough healing power for their groups.<br />
<br />
The real problem stems from the fact that the design team has other ideas about shamans and cannot understand that shamans have become useless in GoD with high dps/low HP mobs.<br />
<br />
The problem we have is the mindset of the design team and the people who has the final say about how shamans should be.  None of them play a shaman of course.<br />
<br />
Uber shamans who have good mana, max healing AA, FT items can probably still play a role as an assist healer and occasional debuffing and buffing in GoD.  Assist healing is a vital role in PoP and GoD.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, others are left to bleed.</div></div><hr />
