<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>vivala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey fellow shaman,<br />
<br />
I took the advice of many of you and took the suicide run in the deep,  i /q out and lived,  worked great.  Came back in, cast bear form, but can't seem to find anyplace to climb up the far side.  I'm trying the west wall,  that is the correct side?<br />
<br />
I did manage to get on the path, but it seemed to end.  Could someone please tell me approximately where you can start the climb please.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>vivala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, I made it up the canyon on the far side.  I got to the Thought Horrors, made a pet, buffed up, pulled one....<br />
<br />
<br />
The sucker charmed me, which killed my pet,  then took me back to his spawn point.  After charm wore off, i ran back out on the ledge, then he charmed me again.  After it wore off again, I gated.  Can anyone give some advice in how to solo the thought horrors in the deep?  please</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The only advice I can give you is to make sure you're buffing your MR to help resist charms. You might also want to keep Disinfecting Aura memmed to cure yourself of Tash. You don't have a magelo, so I can't see what your resists are like. It's possible you may want to swap in some MR gear if getting charmed continues to be a problem.<br />
<br />
Not all of the thought horrors are enchanters. In my opinion, those are certainly the most aggravating of the horrors to kill. Hopefully you'll be able to kill that one and won't be plagued by many more.<br />
<br />
I assume you're trying to solo the deep shard?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You happen to have MR buff on? IF you did say was just bad luck. If you didnt says buff up and maybe get some Mr resist if you would feel more comfortable. Funny thing with mobs that can charm they dont always do it and alot of times it doesnt land or last that long. But once in a while one catches me off guard and i would get a nice long charm on me. <br />
  Other thing is dont think they are all Chanters so you wont have to worry about charm being cast on you. Luck of the spawn. Course someone please correct me if i am wrong.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the informative response, people should take lessons from your helpful response.<br />
Actually, yes, i'm trying to solo the deep shard, or i'll get my pet cleric to follow along, if i can get him there safely.<br />
Here is my magelo, I do have a full set of resist gear, i'll have to put that on:<br />

<br />
Kudos to you! That's showing lots of chutzpah  :cool: <br />
<br />
My advice then would be to put on some of your MR gear, and be very aggressive with the enchanters - load on the dots and perhaps add some dds to burn him down quickly before he gets too many attempts to charm you.<br />
<br />
Best of luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Chanter mobs are nasty...<br />
<br />
I guess I was just lucky not to encounter one when I went for my shard.  Buff your magic resistance and hope for the best is all i can suggest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Does the trick of putting a low damage disease DOT on yourself work Vs charm the same way it does Vs mez?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">No Wodon, damage on a charmed mob just has normal effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>writher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I solo'd this shard using the same method. <br />
<br />
Fortunately I got the shard off my very first pull from a non charming thought horror.  Get some resist gear and use an MR buff (GoD would be nice if there is an enchanter willing to cast it) and try again.</div></div><hr />
