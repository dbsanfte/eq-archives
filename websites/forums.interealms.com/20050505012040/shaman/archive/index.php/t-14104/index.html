<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bandicoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was thinking of taking my 60 sham and 60 monk to the seb crypt to try and get Torpor but the camp looks a little boring if you just take out the emp PH and the blood skellie PH if they are on about a 30 min timer.<br />
<br />
So I was wondering why not take out the emp guards as well? I see from this thread<br />

that there are 6 guards and they can't be single pulled. So the question is, are there any casters that spawn as emp guards?<br />
<br />
If not, the monk should be able to FD split them. If there are more than 1 caster, it is looking a little dangerous...</div></div><hr />

great idea except I only have a rogue to let us in... not to hang around, so we have the locked door on blood's room to worry about, leaves just the 6 emp guards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
single pulling the guards is possible with an enchanter/cleric (pacification)...however it s not easy and there is still some chances to have 2 or 3...with an ench it s no problem of course....<br />
<br />
<br />
single pulling with a monk could be possible, but given the size of the rooms, I would say it would be difficult....but still possible.<br />
<br />
mobs are not casters if I remember well, but they proc a HT.<br />
<br />
once cleared, you can camp in the emp room and kill the repop. Ench and shaman had no problem doing this. I assume a monk can do it also with a shammy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bandicoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks celebel...<br />
<br />
I was thinking of getting the sham to use some invis vs undead potions whilst the monk pulls, so this way it shouldnt matter so much if the room is small. The main issue is whether any are casters since spells ALWAYS break FD... also it might be hard to FD split 6 mobs if all mobs aggro on the initial pull, but once it is broken should be a bit more interesting...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What I want to know is...can I take my shaman down there and just smoke this entire area?  I'm not scared...and my roommate is a rogue so I can bot him to open the doors for me (if I decide not to try to bot this)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Best thing to do to stem boredom is aggro various mobs through the door to the 4R area, 2 skeelies/maybe a ghost extra is something to do while you wait</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Owwiefixer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It is a pretty boring camp and the spawn time for Empie Chotty should be reduced big time.  I've got 100+ hours in this camp, between solo and often times with a partner.  Conversation seems to be the best boredom ward. :)<br />
<br />
We've pulled the whole guard spawn for grins before.  It wasn't too difficult.  I'd say a good duo or solid trio should have no problem.  They dont hit very hard, slow easy and root park nicely.  60+ Shammy + enchanter or 60+ shammy + necro shouldnt have any problem splitting this, and once split the shammy should be able to handle the rounds.<br />
<br />
The best idea is to try and aggro the guards outside the door.  If you space these out, they can give you something to do.  Just sit right up against the door and they will aggro through the wall and come in.  <br />
<br />
If you can get a group of say 4 people, the bounce between empie and 4R is also a good cycle.  The timing to kill the 4 rooms, then back to empie room is almost perfect.  There are also all sorts of neat toys and trinkets to be had in 4R- from hiero cloak, nullspace WR box, snare whip, JBB, ykesha club, tash stick, etc.etc.  Nothing to write home about, but fun toys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I dread this question, because there's only one reason why anyone would consider such a long, boring, possibly dangerous camp:  the quest for the illusive Malo and Torpor.  The rollercoaster of emotions that you get while soloing the Emp is pretty bad.  PH after PH spawns, and Emp doesn't drop those Shammy spells as often as he should.  <br />
<br />
It's pretty crappy that SoE fixed things like the Cleric Epic (twice) because of all the heartache they were causing and yet, they won't do anything about the drop rate.  Yes, they made spell research possible on these two spells, but the drop rates are so rare and random, that I doubt 5 have been combined for Shammy's on all the servers.  Personally, I check for 73 right every single time I log in and log out, but I've never seen it for sale.  Where can I camp a mob that drops it?  Or did SOE replace one system where the spells don't drop with another that it's totally random for the pages to drop and therefore, we can't complain that there's no drop, because they say we can't have a large enough sample.<br />
<br />
Anyway, best of luck in the camp, I truly hope that you get lots of Emps and he drops a lot of extra Torpors, while you wait your Malo   ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bandicoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks, already have malo (managed to buy it) but don't have torpor. I realise the sensible thing to do is forget about it and go on to 65 but the trouble is, I ain't sensible! (want to hang around 60 for a while).<br />
<br />
It is either Guardian Wurms or emp, haven't worked out which to try yet (lesser of two evils?)... I guess I'll try both and settle with whichever is the least objectionable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, emp is definitely safer ... just boring as all hell.  If you go down there plan on staying the whole day, or more even.  Bring a book!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>celebel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">one important thing that someone mentionned:<br />
<br />
-there are 2 guards outside the blood room (locked door)...if you go too close from the entrance door you will aggro them...so it s another thing to be cautious for...</div></div><hr />
