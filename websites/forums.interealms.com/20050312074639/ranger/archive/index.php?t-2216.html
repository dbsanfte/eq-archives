<br />
Interesting because while they may have been portrayed as somewhat like that in Middle Earth (Tolkien's world) that is not the only view of halflings possible. Verant has a history of halflings in Norrath that few people ever explore.<br />
<br />
It was halflings and the paladins of Marr who have historically held the evil in Neriak at bay, and done so for centuries. It has been the halflings who controlled the goblin incursion in the central mountains of Antonica. And it was halflings who were attacked hardest in the Halloween 1999 event. In the RP history of Norrath, Freeport was not the threat - Rivervale and Highhold were the threats and the Tier'Dal knew this and planned accordingly.<br />
<br />
The battle has always been against Innoruuk and rangers who wield Swiftwind and Earthcaller should know this. And in that battle, halflings have always been on the front lines. For a ranger to denigrate halflings is, at least in the context of Norrath, a rather contemptuous act. For a ranger to actively hate and even hunt halflings just because they can be rangers is to play right into the hands of Innoruuk.<br />
<br />
So be proud, you epic wielders who hate and hunt halflings! (&lt;-- sarcasm for the humor-impaired.) <br />
<br />
You are, in a role-play sense, a rather contemptible, despicable, and traitorous black spot on the name of rangers everywhere.</div></div><hr />

would be IMO..yes I was a Middle Earth junkie.<br />

I like halfings in general and love Rivervalle just think it was a <br />
bad call.<br />

I was there during the Halloween event, was my first event in EQ<br />

And as far as your short timeline of Halfling history ? <br />
<br />
It does seem to paint a picture of a race of beings that <br />
eagerly protect all that is near there home..meaning little travel<br />
done..</div></div><hr />

From what I have seen most people who hate halflings is because they see them how Tolkien portrayed them in LoTR.  LoTR is not the end all be all book on fantasy.  He did not create halflings and his views of them shouldn't be used as the sole basis for comparison.  Halflings are short, they are not fat.  They only appear to be fat because of their small size.  You try and shove enough muscle to equal a human into a compact size and see if it doesn't bulge.  ;)<br />
<br />
P.S.  Trolls are fat.  (It comes from eating all those halflings.):D<br />
<br />
P.S.S.  They go really well when served with Miller's carrots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In Tolkein's wonderful mythos, rangers were humans.  Elves had archers, but not rangers.<br />
<br />
A bit of the pot calling the kettle black I think.<br />
<br />
Personally, I could care less if halflings become rangers, they are a good race and have great starting stats for the class, which the elves might be jealous of, maybe?.  When they give the class to true dark elves instead of just those who have been around a long time and got the pre-nerf mask, then I will scream to high heavens.</div></div><hr />

 i was thinking the ranger comunitie where nice torward each others.<br />

<br />
I think the bitterness stems from the patch where Verant was doing all sorts of nice things for all of the other hybrid classes (including new spells) but only ranger &quot;improvement&quot; was the addition of halflings as a racial option.<br />
<br />
This does nothing whatsoever for existing rangers and to add insult to injury the starting stats for hobbit rangers blows away the starting stats for all other rangers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Does Verant really thing that I would quit a L60 ranger with about 160+ days played just to be a hobbit? Sorry. I'm not doing that.<br />
<br />
While I won't join in on the anti-hobbit hysteria, I can see where others of my class are coming from.</div></div><hr />

I am just curious in the sociology of the RL char that would chose them for looks or style,  there's probably some ugly non-politially correct stereotype cast on them as well... <br />
<br />
if VI felt it just to make Trolls rangers  are we expected to welcome then with brotherly love as well?   I think not.. <br />

<br />
By the way, --&gt; You can't claim that because we kill halflings we side with inny.  <br />
<br />
An example...  Dogs kill rabbits..  Cats kill rabbits...  Are dogs allied with cats?  I highly doubt it unless imprinted upon birth.<br />
<br />
I'm DAMNED sure I didn't grow up with halflings and my feet aren't covered in thick disgusting hair either.<br />
<br />
BTW --&gt; The halloween even was secretly arranged by rangers... They felt the furryfoothellspawns deserved punishing.<br />

So I care less about tunare.. Mother of all deserves to die anyways.. anyone should know that Solusek Ro is the true diety anyways &gt;=)  Burning prince all the way.<br />

A quote..<br />
<br />
It was halflings and the paladins of Marr who have historically held the evil in Neriak at bay, and done so for centuries. It has been the halflings who controlled the goblin incursion in the central mountains of Antonica. And it was halflings who were attacked hardest in the Halloween 1999 event. In the RP history of Norrath, Freeport was not the threat - Rivervale and Highhold were the threats and the Tier'Dal knew this and planned accordingly.  <br />
<br />
Freeport was already infested with the corrupt militia so I could very so argue that tying up the paladins in nfp with the corrupt guards was Inny's way of holding the paladins at bay while they went to destroy weaker enemies.. (IE : Halflings )  Divide and conquer... Much like the allied plan during world war II... US started with colonies in africa, took out italy next, then worked their way in.  (mainly)   Perhaps the paladins in NFP were the strongest threat and setting corrupt guards in helped to reduce the strength and destroy it from the inside while they took care of the inferior beings. (Halflings.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So be proud, you epic wielders who hate and hunt halflings! (&lt;-- sarcasm for the humor-impaired.)  <br />
<br />
Damned proud. :D <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
They don't exist. They're just Druids with a strong desire to become a ranger. =) <br />
<br />
Posers from the start... They saw something good and it's taken them HOW long to catch on?  I feel reduced brainpower vibes while walking in Rivervale ;) <br />
<br />
And you're right.. They taste great with Miller's carrots &gt;=)<br />

The great hunt continues...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaffis</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm in full agreeance with Crydee, especially the insult to injury on the stats bit. The guy who got me started on EQ was originally a halfling druid. But that said, if I think of all the worst, rudest, most selfish druids I can, 97% of them were halflings. Why? Because halflings have ridiculous stats, so this type of player naturally gravitates towards them. Are all halflings bad? No.<br />
<br />
Let's put it this way. If I rolled up a halfling, before I even allocate my extra points, that halfling would beat every stat that I care about on my Half Elf level 54 ranger if he were naked. Does that sound racially balanced? Now toss in a 5% xp BONUS. Sound fair? Halfling stats were just broken to begin with, I just didn't care because it didn't play into my class. Now that it does, I get to be retroactively annoyed.<br />
<br />
Finally, toss in the idea that any Halfling I may end up grouping or raiding with has gotten to the 50s in less than a month real time, and you better believe I'll make a general judgement about his/her playing skills as a ranger. If I'm proved wrong, great. We're a damned hard class to play well, and I don't especially like those who haven't learned to play well and give our class a bad name. They fuel the old Kunark-era morons. This particular dislike isn't race related, I dislike ranger morons equally. But if I see a powerleveled wood elf twink, I have to find out the hard way. If I see a halfling my level, he's automatically powerlevelled, so I can steer clear right from the start.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tolkien in now way, shape or form disliked halflings.  Hell, they save Middle Earth, y'know?<br />
<br />
Also, from a &quot;Tolkienian&quot; perspective - Rangers don't travel all over Middle Earth either.  Only one is described that way - Aragorn.  The rest are described as staying specifcally in the regions of Eriador protecting the Shire (for the Dunedain) and Ithilien (for the Rangers of Ithilien).  <br />
<br />
I'm not sure where the &quot;Rangers roam all over the world&quot; thing came from as some sort of definitive character trait of a Ranger.  D&amp;D likely... but then again D&amp;D now allows Halfling Rangers too :)<br />
<br />

You get one, perhaps 2 answers (I've always considered Gnomes more neutral than good, myself): Halflings.<br />
<br />
Look around, there's a lot of halfling humor.  Most of it is actually good natured.  I might make jokes about camping Rivervale but would you ever see me doing it? No, and I doubt you'd find many others doing it either.<br />
<br />
Now, for those of you who seem to be having some problems with grasping this humor consider that you might be jumping up and down in arms over what's frankly a non-issue.  I'm not a real fan of the concept of Halfling Rangers, but then again I'm not a real fan of the concept of non-human Paladins, and you won't see me descriminating against either.<br />
<br />
I reserve the right to razz people, good naturedly.  If there was some sort of pan-epic conspiracy to shaft Halfer Rangers, maybe all these hollars would have a bit of substance to them, but the fact is there is not.<br />
<br />
By all means, however, get up in arms about a non-issue and ignore any of numerous things you could get a bug up your hinder about if you really needed to be bugged about something &lt;---Sarcasm for the Humorously impaired<br />

On the other hand, after the end of the First Age, Elrond was still around, so there certainly was a half-elf still around.  Plus, I would expect more half-elves were born from Aragorn and Arwen.</div></div><hr />

Dunedain.  Dun=man, edain=elves.  Half-elves.  By the end of the Third Age, the elvish blood was pretty thinned out, but they were considered half-elves. <br />
<br />
<br />
Not again... please... not again..<br />
<br />
Dunadan = &quot;Man of the West&quot; i.e. of Numenor.  Has nothing to do with elves.<br />
<br />
The line of Numenorean kings, of which Aragorn was a direct descendant, can trace its lineage to Elros, Elrond's brother.<br />
<br />
As has been posted here before, Elros and Elrond were &quot;Half-Elven&quot;.  At the end of the First Age, they were both given a choice as to be counted among elves or men.  Elrond chose the Eldar, Elros chose man.<br />
<br />
After the end of the First Age of Middle Earth, there were no more &quot;Half-Elves&quot; in Middle Earth - period.  <br />

course I've always been nearly as biased on Half-whutnot bucketheads too myself..  sure they are half elf  but really whut is the other half..  and how few are left of true non-diluted blood linages.. <br />
<br />
In a true roleplaying sense halfelves make better rangers than anyone. Why? Because rangers are loners by nature wandering the forests and protecting all in it, shunning society for love of the woods. Who better to be a ranger than a race that is accepted by niether humans or true elves? No one I can think of none other than a Half Elven Ranger. I personally am proud of my true hybrid lineage and also proudly call Surefall Glade my home. And what is wrong with the bucket? Protects us better from the shovels if you ask me.:D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, the SK's got a lot, lol....<br />
<br />
I suspect the hatred of halflings comes from the stereotype of halfling &quot;drooidz&quot; who in the early stages of EQ tended to be some of the most greedy inconsiderate players imaginable because they were so easy to play and so powerful at soloing and farming. Mind you I say tended to be. Another aspect is that it's the &quot;flavor of the day&quot; character class (whatever happened to all those iksar necros, anyway?). <br />
<br />
Certainly I know plenty of wonderful people who play halflings of all classes. I can't say I've had much contact with halfling rangers as yet, only grouped with one, and aside from being stubby, he was competent. He had a good demeanor about the ribbing halfling rangers take, and he was asking me a lot of cogent questions about my experiences as a long time ranger. I for one was more than happy to help pass on some of my experience to him.<br />
<br />
We all have our biases and prejudices, but just because a ranger is a halfling is no reason to hate him or her, we should judge people based upon their behavior, not their class/race combo. I'm sure if you get to know them better, you can find plenty of more valid reasons to hate them! ;) (KIDDING!)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kishin</div><div class="date">05-02-2002, 05:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think Kaffis and Tamas said it best.<br />
<br />
str and sta of a human, wis agi of a wood elf, better dex than either...  add in the xp bonus and you're liable to get some people pissed off. <br />
<br />
add the fact that most dr00dz are halflings, who really don't represent their race in an RP sense at all...<br />
<br />
add the fact that they get their own quest armor, HFL only (which is a step below ivy and -much- easier to get).<br />
<br />
it's a formula for jealousy and resentment.  i'm openly opposed to having those quests HFL only.  i would love to see equivalent quest NPCs in Kelethin and Surefall, but it's not going to happen.<br />
<br />
and for those of you who are still like &quot;so what? it's not that big a deal, let it go!&quot; imagine for a minute that rangers got sow at 39, like they used to.  and imagine being in your mid40s and hearing about a new race for rangers, only one that got sow at 30 - but the older races still got it at 39.  wouldn't you be a little upset?  that's the way i view verant's hearty welcome of halflings to the ranger fold.  no, it's not a huge deal.  but it's kind of annoying, and i think an innappropriate move on the part of VI.<br />
<br />
two. keeril, the &quot;misfit&quot; role of half-elf RPers does not make them a better ranger RP-wise.  the common ranger character trait is that they're ok being alone (with nature).  i know my character loves being in groups, but doesn't need them.  soloing for a few levels can be almost restful.<br />
<br />
and three.  if i could have my choice of deities, i think i'd have to go with xegony.  she's a sexy elfin ethereal goddess - with wings!  i mean, nothing against Tunare's whole soccer mom thing (what's up with that o.o?), but when i sit down to, uh, worship, a soft elven angel really turns my crank.  you know, maybe it's just me =D.<br />
<br />
EDIT: oh, and hebourn, comparing random drops to starting stats is a totally invalid argument.  that's right.  go home and weep.<br />
<br />
and i forgot to say this too: by persecuting halfling rangers, we may actually be doing the halfling ranger community a favor.  all rangers used to get ragged on, only the ones who were tough as nails came through in the end.  halflings who fight it through despite verbal hailstones may very well end up better for it.  this compensates for their innate abilities, that they may one day be as worthwhile as the rest of us =P.  <br />
<br />
so help the rangers.  hurt a halfling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i know some dark elves who would like to have a word with you about that =P.<br />
<br />
but frankly hebuorn, i no longer regard you as a welcome member of these boards, due to your complete inability to see the opposition's side, and your blatant lack of desire to do so.  these are two values i hold very highly.<br />
<br />
i think it's innapropriate for you to be getting up in arms about stuff no one really cares about - but has fun bitching about.  these boards are for three things: the sharing of information, discussion of game-related issues, and fun.  yes, fun.  your overly defensive personal attacks further none of these three goals.<br />
<br />
i try to make my insults and attacks clearly tongue-in-cheek (unless i'm actually attacking something, in which case it should become clear why).  i'm sorry if your understanding of english doesn't allow you to pick up on these nuances, but i'm not about to tailor my posts for you or your appropriately halfling ego.  nor should anyone else.<br />
<br />
so what you need to do is relax.  all of us here at The Glade are good people; it seems to be a common theme among those who play rangers.  a little arrogant sometimes, and sometimes they go a bit too far, but good people nonetheless.  a ranger is the only class i trust, out of the blue, if i need an item swap or the like.  i've been asked a handful of times myself.  <br />
<br />
so you need to relax, or leave.</div></div><hr />

Some people are halfling bashing just for fun, but there are those who are not.  It is those people that are truly upset about halflings that make me mad.  They remind me too much of the ranger bashers.<br />

Oh and since your understanding of english doesn't seem to be up to par either.   He wasn't comparing random drops to starting stats.   He was pointing out that some things are just unfair and there is nothing that we can do about it.</div></div><hr />

&quot;go home and weep&quot; was meant to be good-natured harassment - in retrospect, i should have put an &quot;=P&quot; at the end of it.<br />
<br />
and ist, yes he -was- comparing (&quot;unfair&quot;) starting stats to (&quot;unfair&quot;) random drops.  his main point, that stuff is going to be unfair, doesn't change what his argument actually consisted of.<br />
<br />
but after the helm of the tracker and the new wood elf tunare-only bows, i don't feel that bothered by it =D.  kinda feel bad for the long-standing half-elf and human karana rangers, though.  hopefully they'll get something to make up for it in PoP.  oh, and they are adding new noob quests for each race, one by one.<br />
<br />
istvann, as long as you try to see the other side of the argument, that's good enough for me.  in the first post i was just trying to share my views, crack a couple jokes.  in the second, i was a little miffed. and like i said in my first post, halfling rangers aren't a big deal, they're just a little annoying.<br />

there is a difference in fairness between random events(such as drops) and set things(halflings haveing better stats, unless they put it all into charisma or something dumb like that) one is luck one is'nt, also i dont hate halfing rangers, or any other type of halfing, but i do think it us unfair, un RP like, and an over all bad idea to put halfing ranger's into a game<br />

to expand on this, i have read a LOT of fantasy books, played many fantasy games and almost every single thing i have read that has halfings in it they are lazy/fat/hate travel/ and half the time are shifty. now are these the traits of a ranger, uhhh no</div></div><hr />
