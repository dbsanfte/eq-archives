<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, <br />
<br />
My computer has been completely ****ed up since the new DX9 patch, haven't been able to log in without getting disconnected 10 minutes later. I've tried so many things, and talked with the moron CSR's numerous times to no avail. So, I need to buy a new computer, but I'm on a really tight budget. I am basically looking for a bare bones tower for preferably around 300-350. I'm pretty clueless about building a computer, so it would have to be a site that will custom build them for you (as I don't need a complete system, vid card, monitor, CD drives are all reusable from my old system). I've tried to go to pricewatch, I do a search for the 300 price range, then I go to the site, and the prices are a lot higher than that. Basically, I'm looking for good places to go, and also general recommendations for what specs I should buy to run EQ (FYI current PC is p4 1.6 gHz with 512 RAM, FX 5200 128 MB vid card.....so I'd like something along those lines, as I was happy with the performance when the computer worked). Any suggestions are appreciated, thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />
