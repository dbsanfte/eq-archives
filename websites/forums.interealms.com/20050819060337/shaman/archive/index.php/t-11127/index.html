<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vimnh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been playing a necro my entire EQPC career, (about 2 years) and now EQ is about to come out on the Mac<br />
<br />
I am switching to the Mac version of EQ, and I am thinking about making a shaman my new main... The question i have is:<br />
<br />
How well can a shaman actually solo? Are thier solo skills comparable to a necro? (ie. can i solo my way to 65?)<br />
<br />
I ask this only because I have grown accustomed to soloing, although I am looking forward to the group aspect of the class as well.<br />
<br />
I would appreciate any productive feedback, any replies along the lines of &quot;necros are the suck&quot;, &quot;Macs are overpriced paper weights&quot;, etc. are discouraged.<br />
<br />
RESPECT<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dispite what you've probibly been reading on this board, Shamans are still very good soloers, they are also versitile and self-reliant. You can play all aspects of the game as a shaman, from solo'n and grouping to high ending raiding. Not that I've played a necro, but I've played with plenty with duo's. They're playstyle is actually pretty similar to ours for soloing mostly in regards to the fact that we both do most of our damage with dots.<br />
<br />
Also, I've been using a PC since my 8088 and I'd never use a Mac as my primary computer. But, I'm a graphic designer and I use a Mac everyday at work. Its a great machine. I wish I could afford to have both at home :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Necro can solo better for exp (from what i have found) because they have much higher dps.  Shaman are good soloers because we can solo almost anything.  Until the new charms came out we were able to solo any mob that could be solod.  That is no longer true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Shaman's can solo well, but alot depends on your equipment at certain lvls and your spells. Post 60 you just wont solo as efficiently as an average group unless you have Torpor. 45 up through 50's ,JBB and epic help tons. We can solo pretty well though of course we just arent goin to get exp in most situations and lvls as fast as a necro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Shaman are one of the very best soloers int he game. Probly not THE best , but a 65 shaman is nothing to joke about. I do things that amaze myself to be honest. Nothign a necro or mage could do im sure , but still , being in that group makes me happy.<br />
<br />
Trust me , if you like to solo a 40+ shaman is for you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Level 52 shaman, Level 55 necromancer here. There is zero comparison.<br />
<br />
Solo XP is all about kill rate. Which means doing damage, not taking damage and recovery of spent resources. Necromancers hold all the advantages here, giving them a insane kill rate.  <br />
<br />
Now once a shaman gets kraggs (L58) their mana regen gets a huge boost, which may change things. And once they get Torpor (L60) they can efficiently heal / canni mid fight allowing them to take tougher mobs. Of course if you make sure you always have KEI things are a lot better.<br />
<br />
But no, shaman soloing is not time efficient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well i dont judge soloing soley on kill rates , i tend to find mobs and battle them for the adventure of it. i find the strongest point over any class in the game is staying power. at 65 i can just keep hitting that jbb and casting that epic and sitting on my horse casting Q on me or my pet while he chews down the mob with mage weapons and avatar and full buff , esentialy forever.  Unless the mob is hitting for 600+ i can sustain forver. Lil can5 and im good to go , but thats very dangerous unless you have virt or aego. <br />
<br />
But then again  , im not talking XP  , just pure treasure hunt mode</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Necros solo faster and more efficient than us until level 55 when fear no longer works.<br />
We can still solo the same stuff they solo before that leve but it will not be AS fast.<br />
On the plus side we can still solo when we wish to (and we are quite good at it) and if u don't like it u can lfg and get a grp really fast.<br />
That is why shaman &gt; necro<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hadd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">shamans were great xp soloers .. no longer true . if you were used to a necro you will find the transition hard , shaman will have more troubles soloing , and when you have finally assimilated how to solo for max efficiency you will realize that it is way more complicated as a shaman ( necro has less troubles to solo, easier ) ... as a result you will find out that the shaman is more group friendly , more duo friendly , and can tweak its way of soloing and adapt to most of the situations . <br />
<br />
btw i said shms no longer are great soloers ... thats compared to a necro , because nowadays with a lil twinking and a lil kei , a fungi and co , you will find that you have no problems soloing your way up , and that its fun :)<br />
at high end levels i wonder if we could say that shamans are still the best soloers of all the non charm classes ....<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">We can solo from level 1 to 65. We can also get groups easily from 1 to 65. While we can't solo as quickly or effectively as a Necro, we tend to die less when mobs catch us.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for all the info yall, Im lookin forward to some shaman action on March 15 ( thats when EQMac comes out )<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I see necros soloing in HoH.  I, too, can solo in HoH.  I think my kill times are about the same as a necro.  Once I get my better PoP dots, I'll be a bit faster.  Root and rot is my game here tho, since I have no snare.  I see necros using their pet and aggro kiting a lot.  That must be pretty efficient.  I don't have a lot of downtime either tho.  I dunno.<br />
<br />
Basically it comes down to this post 60.  <br />
Do you want snare or slow?<br />
<br />
Until 60, there is no question, necros solo exp mobs much faster than shamans do.  <br />
After 60 shamans start to catch up.  <br />
<br />
Necros solo exp easier, faster, and can do so with much worse gear than shamans can.  <br />
<br />
Shamans are always more popular in groups than necros. <br />
<br />
Give and take.  <br />
<br />
If you want to solo, go with a necro and post on their boards.  My buddy wanted to solo, made a necro, was good at it, got to 60 in record time, lost interest, and quit -- all in about a year's time.  Net result?   About 40 real days /wasted.<br />
<br />
I'm starting my 4th year as an EQ player.   That could be inspiring or sad, depending on your point of view.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I wonder which class has the least turnover rate?  I've played nothing but a shaman, save for twinking a monk to level 40 in a couple days and got bored of him, for almost 4 yrs now.   The only class I would even consider playing over a shaman is a beastlord, but not even that has got me off a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>psykopath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have solo'd from 1-40 in around 4 days played with no power leveling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">That's nothing.  I soloed to 45 with my monk in under 4 days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Flargly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Someone asked about player/class turnover. I played a mage to 60. Mage can solo to 60 much faster than a shaman... or at least he can considering mage can have crap gear and do it. Shaman to match teh solo speed of a mage needs a fungi, jbb or epic, and a horse helps. Plus AC/HP gear.<br />
<br />
However, I've pulled my shammy to 58 now. Hes more fun to play. Why?<br />
<br />
1) He can solo AND group. Its 10x easier to get in a group with my shammy. LFG with the mage is nightmarish. If i get bored of grouping with the shammy I can still solo. Its not as effecient, but its not like its 50% slower. Its maybe 25% slower... if that. Besides, with pop, the real exp is in a group anyways. I solo mostly cause i want so alone time and am sick of people whining for buffs, ect.<br />
<br />
2) He dies much less. Mage is a pansy. If he cant get a mob to stick to the pet, or the pet dies, you better hope to god you can either channel a gate through the smackdown first try, or die. In an outside zone with run3 you cna usually haul ass to zoneline, but in a dungeon if you ran past any otehr mobs, you are dead with a mage. With the shammy, its MUCH easier. You simply dont die. Root Cloro/Krag/Torpor whatever yourself and just haul ass out, or gate out. Adds? no problem. Root slow, and kill it after the other 4 queded up die.<br />
<br />
3) Soloing large mobs for fun/profit/thrills. Shamans can do this with good equipment. Basicly if you can put out damage manaless and concentrate on cani/heal, you are good to go. With a mage you have no way to mitigate damage, and pet heals blow. If the mob summons, Game Over. Mages are good at killing low level dark blues. Shamans can kill just about anything as long as the shaman can mintigate the damage. shamans loose effeciency at killing low dark blues with the trade off that they are able to solo much higher mobs.<br />
<br />
All 3 things combined makes the shaman more fun to play for an extended period. You can switch back and forth depending on what ya want/need. With a mage its mostly solo and  pray you can get into a  pop group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Shamans are very solid soloers, but they are not as strong as necromancers are.  Equally skilled necros will generate xp at a much higher rate, even where the shaman has somewhat better equipment, because the necro can put out damage, and damage is what gets you xp [I am not including charm soloing here--comparing a necro with PoP charms in the right camp to a shaman in the soloing arena is like comparing a nuclear missile to a pop gun].  <br />
<br />
As for loot soloing, again you have to give the overall crown to the necro.  Instaclick invis (admittedly they don't all have it, but it isn't exactly very difficult to obtain) + root + fd + snare = a lot of loot camps a necro can do that are exteremely difficult or impossible for a shaman (e.g. just about every named in Chardok, Drusella Sathir).  <br />
<br />
This overlaps a bit with the &quot;big game hunting&quot; category, where shamans and necros are closer .<br />
<br />
Necros are also very powerful in groups, but 99.9% of the eq population seems ignorant of this fact, and my necro friends do seem to have more trouble than I do getting groups outside our friends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Rebelheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Will shaman go solo PoP mob with only Bane of Nife and Pox? not tier one of course..<br />
necro gotten new dot /nuke at 61 62 ethreal parchment while we have to wait til Spectral and rune.<br />
Seems to me they can get to 65 ezier than us.<br />
<br />
When a pull failed, they can just FD and wait til mob forget, we have to zone; while their pet will remain there if not engaged with mob, our will go poof; their pet buff is all in one (correct me if I am wrong)<br />
our cost lots mana (fos, ac, haste, regen, and or agi sta)<br />
<br />
not hard to see they can solo ezier than us; and due to our low dps/long lasting fight, we CAN NOT allow a screw up or two.<br />
<br />
on treasure hunt, they can solo something unslowable but not summon; we can solo stuff that summon or unsnare-able. i think we are even on that one, on exp we fall behind.<br />
but imo shm solo is the fun point: decide you tank or pet tank; swapping spells during fight (heck I wish we got more than 8spell gems) and MOST fun part is when add come, how you handle it and such.<br />
I kinda believe shm solo is about fun not exp, depend on what you want and then decide to make a nec or shm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Vhalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Finding groups for a shaman is very easy, I don’t recall being LFG for longer than 30 minutes at one time (if that happens you just solo); as well as I enjoyed being able to solo when I needed some time to myself. In PoP I sometimes duo with another shaman or any tank for very good xp.<br />
<br />
I have a necro alt and I found out that soloing in the early lvls with a necro was much easier for me. However, my RL friend has a Shaman alt that he got to 48 solo in a month playing part time; with today's ability to just go to Nexus and get C3 mana regen is no longer a issue, JBB is available in Bazaar most of the time, Epic is dirt easy to get (in comparison to other classes.) I think you will enjoy playing a shaman due to so many ways you will be able to fit in throughout your Shammy career.<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Numzan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">necros blow away shamans for soloing. i've played both. that crappy root spell they gave the shaman sucks untill i got paralizing root. the shaman can however i think do more damage in the long run. I like the necro mana regen better. and the pets arent bad either.<br />
<br />
But over all i enjoy the shaman more, because of the buffs and slows needed for raids.<br />
<br />
I guess your better off testing it for yourself. You will defentially enjoy a shaman. And yes they do get asked alot to join in groups. Whereas the necro ends up soloing.<br />
<br />
Numzan<br />
<br />
p.s But i am old school necro and new school shaman so my opinion maybe biased</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The thing necros get that helps out is FD.  I have yet to figure out how to split the guards in hoh.  They come as pairs with out lull or harmony or fd to split them and root is resisted way to much</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">necros blow away shamans for soloing. i've played both. that crappy root spell they gave the shaman sucks untill i got paralizing root.<br />
<br />
If root makes such a difference to your shaman soloing, no wonder you think Necros are so much better.  I soloed off and on from about 35 through 60, through mid-58 pre-Luclin, and root was just crowd control for extras I happened to aggro.<br />
<br />
Yeah, if you try to solo a shaman like a mage or a druid, it's not going to be very effective.<br />
<br />
That said, I'm getting a handle on soloing in PoN now and Torpor has changed the entire mechanics of the situation.  It's the first time I've let my pet tank for me, and while I don't know if this is the most efficient, it certainly seems safest.  Maybe I'll get brave and take tanking duty back once I get used to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Flargly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I was pet tanking till 58. At 58 with cani4/KM I tried the tanking and, well, it seems like its more effecient still to let the pet tank. I keep him fully buffed and regenned.. He heals huge amounts while I'm pulling the next mob.<br />
<br />
I'm only at 920 AC.. I'm guessing if I pop over 1k it might make a bit of difference, but dunno. I'm also guessing if I ever sell my soul and manage to get torpor at 60, I'll be tanking again :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Hey Landragoran, where do you solo in HoH? I seriously can't find a decent spot.<br />
<br />
But, more on track, we SUCK at soloing in PoP. I play offtime, 11pm CST to like 4am CST. As such, I've always relied on my soloing to a degree. At 34-60, it was always there, places like OOT, lguk, WL, VL, Chardok and AR got me thru many a night when groups were thin and no one was raiding.<br />
<br />
But, I seriously have PoP tank soloing for a shaman to be inefficient to impossible. The mobs hit WAY too hard, some mitigate slow, you tend to need lull and harmony to split, and many are unrootable.<br />
<br />
- A PoV planar larvae took 4m and nearly killed me, and my gear is OK tho it's hardly amazing. Golems can be root-dotted, but they run fast and hit hard if you get a resist.<br />
- The frogs in PoS forest can be root-dotted, but it's slow. The cave ones need harmony/lull I'm told.<br />
- PoD mobs can be solo'd along the wall, but they have a decent assist range and some spiders CH. Plus, the exp was yucky.<br />
- PoI was possible at the zonein, but it's trained alot and was slow. Inner factory was impossible to single pull.<br />
- BoT, no way. Need harmony/lull and they hit too hard.<br />
- PoN, never tried but I assume it's like PoD<br />
- PoJ. Can't do jail, because you two-pull, and the area before the jail wasn't that good.<br />
- HoH, never saw a good spot so any guidance would be appreciated.<br />
- CoD, dunno, I'm not flagged :)<br />
<br />
Thus, based on what I've seen, and how I see chanters, druids, mages and necros solo wonderfully for exp, I'd say we cannot be in the top 4. Plus, wizzies can do some effective kiting that I've seen in HoH and PoV. Thus, for exp, I'd put us at no. 6. I've seen all of those classes get 1 aa in under 30 minutes, when my fastest in a group has been 57 minutes.<br />
<br />
More than just the exp loss, I miss solo'ing for sport, something I used to do. Taking down Lodi, GWs, Phinny, TM's etc was fun even it wasn't efficient. We have NO chance at solo'ing the minibosses now.<br />
<br />
Sorry guys, but good solo'ers in PoP are ones that can charm. Show me otherwise, PLEASE :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>psykopath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">That's nothing. I soloed to 45 with my monk in under 4 days<br />
<br />
This isn't a pissing match, he wanted an idea of how well a Shaman could solo, so I told him how it was going for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">At 60 with epic, jbb, bane, pox, horse and torpor I can effectively solo very well for my own tastes.<br />
<br />
In PoP I can solo an AA in under 2 hours with aego/virtue and c3 at the courtyards in PoD.  Slightly less if those camps are taken.<br />
<br />
I can hit up chardok for an aa in about 3 hours, or just fight until c3 wears off and then refresh.<br />
<br />
I can park myself in fungus and get an aa every 4 hours if I can get two camps, or take a 6-7 spawn camp and get one in 5 hours without any other class buffs.<br />
<br />
I can go to umbral and solo the monkeys for an aa every 2.5 hours or so with buffs.<br />
<br />
51+ really is when shamans start rocking for solo effeciency assuming you have the correct toys.  Fork out the cash for a jbb, horse, fungi and if you can, epic, then when you get 45 the levels will fly by.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I wouldnt say shamans are near the top soloers without the toys.  My shopping list included: torpor, jbb, epic, fungi, horse, bane, pox, canni5.<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
Wanted to mention Cazic Thule also.  If the entry mobs were on a faster spawn (its like 19 mins ugh...) that would be an easy 2-3 hour AA solo if not more.  Take somebody with FD with you and you can take the courtyard as well.<br />
<br />
As for soloing to 65, I dont know yet but Im sure I will find out soon :)  I can for sure see soloing to at least 63 and thats just in tier 1 zones.</div></div><hr />
