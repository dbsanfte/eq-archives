<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First lets start with the basics.<br />
<br />
Borrowing parses from the Wizards about Specialization and SCM.<br />
Which have been throughly documented and tested.<br />
http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm28.showMessage?topicID=23.topic<br />
Which has also been confirmed somewhere on our own boards which I can not find atm.<br />
Also confirmed on Cleric board someplace but cant locate that atm either.<br />
<br />
Spec 200 = About 11% savings total<br />
Spec 50 = About 3% savings total<br />
<br />
If/when SF works as described then<br />
<br />
Spec 100 would offer 5.5% which would be a 2.5% increase.<br />
<br />
Ok so far then without SCM or any mana prev items we have a savings on our 60+ conjouration spells of:<br />
<br />
(all numbers are rounded to nearest full number)<br />
Blood of Saryn 535 mana a 2.5% dercease would be 13 mana per cast<br />
Bane 490 mana a 2.5% dercease would be 12 mana per cast<br />
Breath of Ulthor 550 mana a 2.5% dercease would be 14 mana per cast<br />
Plague of Daluda 393 mana a 2.5% dercease would be 10 mana per cast<br />
Spear of Torment 275 mana a 2.5% dercease would be 7 mana per cast<br />
<br />
Average savings on all that would come out to 11 mana per cast.<br />
<br />
15aa to save 11 mana per cast if it was working as described.<br />
<br />
Now take in ccontrast SCM.<br />
SCM1 is 2aa for 2%<br />
SCM2 is 4aa for an additional 3%<br />
SCM3 is 6aa for an additional 5%<br />
Total is 12aa for 10%<br />
<br />
Edit: to correct numbers sorry should not get distracted when typing ;)<br />
Now if you look at 200 spec for SF you would have a gain of 8%.<br />
<br />
IMHO 15aa for a 2.5% gain is NOT worth it.<br />
An 8% gain for 15aa would be on par with SCM.<br />
<br />
We would have this:<br />
(all numbers are rounded to nearest full number)<br />
Blood of Saryn 535 mana a 8% dercease would be 43 mana per cast<br />
Bane 490 mana a 8% dercease would be  39 mana per cast<br />
Breath of Ulthor 550 mana a 8% dercease would be 44 mana per cast<br />
Plague of Daluda 393 mana a 8% dercease would be 31 mana per cast<br />
Spear of Torment 275 mana a 8% dercease would be 22 mana per cast<br />
<br />
Average savings on all that would come out to 36 mana per cast.<br />
<br />
I would like to ask SoE to please leave SF going to 200 spec and not fix it to the description. But rather fix the description to the way it is currently working.</div></div><hr />

<br />
thats all for now.</div></div><hr />

That is what he has written.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nah I edited it. I was busy at work when I posted it rather than wait till I got home when I would be less rushed ;)<br />
There is a note saying I edited it as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Maybe the plan was to raise secondary forte to 15 AA from 10 AA (which it was during beta) and then raise the cap to 200.  With the description never getting changed.<br />
<br />
Who knows.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was hoping this, but my Spec. Conj. appears to be stuck at 100.  has this been stealth nerfed back to a 100 cap now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes.  If you buy Seconday Forte now, your skill will not go over 100.  If you bought it shortly after GoD release and were able to raise it over 100, it will not increase any further.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">so all those who didn't get it right away are not as uber as those who did =(<br />
<br />
Darn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yep it is capped at 100 now :(<br />
Time to /feedback it I guess if we want a change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">that kinda sucks for those who didn't max it at 200 asap after God was released. Oh well leave it to sony to tease us yet again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just got secondary forte.  It REALLY is a helluva lotta points for a tiny gain.  Specialization, particularly for a secondary ability, means so little in today's game that they really should give you a little better bang for the buck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>T'harkis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">For the cost, secondary forte should go to 200 for everyone.  Agreed that it's not fair that those who purchased it early get &quot;more for their money&quot; than those who didnt buy it right off because tehy saw casting subtlety or whatnot as more usefull and put off buying secondary forte.</div></div><hr />
