<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I havnt been soloing at all with my shaman (who is 65 170+AAs), so i desided to try it out, and maybe farm piglet some.<br />
here is what happend<br />
i rooted and dotted one mob got and add rooted and dotted him also, was down to 20pct mana when both where killed, and i was like yes this is easy... then piglet comes out i get him rooted and dotted and then i looked at his health... if i kept all dots on him he was about 80pct, but his regen got him to full health in no time, then i tried again dots and AA pets, got him down to 70pct then in 30 sec he was full health again, then root broke and he went back......<br />
how can a shaman kill a stupid little mob which have an insane regen. if i start DDing then root breaks and he goes away, so i have no idea on how to take him.<br />
It would be nice with some help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I assume you're talking about the piglet in PoTa.<br />
<br />
Here's the tid: You know how mobs have insane regen if you're out of their agro range? Well, same thing is true for piglet. The only difference is that the piglet has an agro range of about 2 feet. To know if you're in agro range of him, root him. Then slow him, dot him, do whatever. If he is not facing you, you are out of agro range of him and you need to move forward. If he's facing you, you'rein agro range of him, and just stay where you are.</div></div><hr />
