Last night I tried this spell for the first time. I cast it in Fungus Grove on someone with Shriekers Curse on em...the on that roots you and turns you into a fungi. I only did one cast...but it had no effect. I didnt cast more than once becuase the curse only lasts a few seconds and it didnt seem worth it. Anyone found a use for this spell?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cepheusRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That spell will remove most of the curse AE's from higher level luclin mobs in a number of casts (usually 2 or 3).  It's invaluable in fights such as THO, AL, etc... if everyone doesn't have greater remove curse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you aren't fighting THO or the Luclin uber mobs... <br />

there are traps in Ssra that curse you that it will remove as well.<br />

One in particular on the way to the assassin room casts some wierd mana drain curse.   The first time we went there it landed on our only cleric and we had no way to cure her and the curse supposedly lasts 2 hours or something.   Duel/Rez fixed it, but now we don't have to worry about it, 1 or 2 casts of Remove Curse takes care of it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Stonienogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">drops rarely from The Great Saprophyte, a shroom twice the size of my ogre, in a room on the right just before FG in Echo Caverns. i killed him twice and got two spells now, but that's crazy luck for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wolfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not sure if someone was spiking the mobs, or not, but... Last saturday in Misty Thicket I was toying with a halfling ranger, grouped with another ranger and a druid. We twice had Remove Curse drop, once from an Orc Oracle and again from Mooto. Happened right at the start of our session and we never saw them again, so we were thinking someone might passed them out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I helped kill the GS twice and he dropped the spell both times.</div></div><hr />

We had the same thing happen while doing the Assassin.  We couldn't cure it, but the thing about this curse is that every time you cast a spell, your mana bar is reset to what it should be.  As long as you can actually cast a spell, you're fine.  So for a shaman it's really a non-issue, because of cannibalise (0 mana cost).  Insta-click items work as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Is the Great Saprophyte soloable for a 52 shaman? I watched some level 60 kill him easily but i noticed he has an AE poison attack.  How many hp are we looking at on this bad boy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The GS is definitely not one to solo at 52</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hardest green I've ever fought i think.  He chain casts a knockback poison DD, and then summons you.  Damn hard to cast any spells.</div></div><hr />
