<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vodyr</div><div class="date">05-05-2002, 07:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I am hunting in MT area as a Karana worshiping Human, because its a great place to come up, and they have a Ranger guild, and for RP its one big Karana love fest.<br />
<br />
What sux is that I am a mostly non-twinked (ie I have 5+ totally empty slots, using a 10pp weapon, 4gp bow) Ranger on this server, but the new Ranger low level quest armor is HLF only.<br />
<br />
Seems kinda silly. The armor is perfect for a true noob, but only Halflings can get it.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't be upset except for the fact that there is *nothing* nearly as good for obtaining at that level for a true noob of any other Race. I would kill for something with 5-7 AC in all of my empty slots.<br />
<br />
I wish that they would revisit this, as I am getting the drops, but can't use the stuff =(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously, the newb armor is an obvious attempt to get people playing the halfling rangers, and halflings generaly wear small gear, while humans and half-elves wear medium gear.  Unless its one size fits all magic gear.  Wood elves could squawk, but Woodies worship Lady Tunare only, so it all makes sense, no Karana gear for the Woodies.<br />
<br />
Thus the newb rangers of the original races are left out in the cold (again).  While somebody else gets the neat newb stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just spend some time leveling, and you'll come up with the cash, or even better loot something yourself, that will be a much better piece than the newbie Quests. It'll all fall into place with time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
but still, i like arguing, so i'm going to argue the principle..  <br />
<br />
screw the reasonable justification that only halflings should wear this. deity/size is a trivial thing... CT-lovin' SKs still wield an Inny epic.  Even the wee gnomes.<br />
<br />
Also, i have it on good authority that it wasn't just rangers who got new noob armor, it was all the halflings... and rangers got the worst stuff. (weapons: rng 4/27 1str dex, war 4/25 10sta).<br />
<br />
if they don't flesh out all race/class combos with noob quests by the time they stop expanding EQ, i'm gonna be a wee bit annoyed.  and dammit, Verant! take away the shorty xp bonus &gt;=/!  that was a bad idea from the start.  20% penalty for race regen is fair, but a 5% bonus for being short and chubby (and having good stats) seems like.. hmm... favoritism? which is totally out of place in the most holy art of Game Balancing.<br />
<br />
*grabs his pitchfork*  nerf the halflings =D!</div></div><hr />

And the halfling rogue dagger is magic, 6/21, plus minor stats and *great* looks. Oh well. Even better than the dragoon dirk, I wear offhand.<br />
<br />
These new class quests went first live for darkelves, halflings were second. More races will follow, as I was told. Let's wait for next patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kishin</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 11:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i heard there were similar quests for gnomes, and one or two other races.<br />
<br />
i guess i'll go back to my firiona vie ranger after they implement the wood elf quests. RPing is a nice getaway, and there's something to be said for earning all your stuff, so =D</div></div><hr />
