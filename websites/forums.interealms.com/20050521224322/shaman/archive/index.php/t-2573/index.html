<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Excelsior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So far, using primal cudgel, I have found two stacking issues.  It wont stack with AGI buff, and it wont stack with a certain SK spell.  Dunno which spell it is, but when i group with an Sk friend of mine, sometimes it lands, sometimes it doesnt.  I believe Avatar overwrites it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Oishii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yes, PE has never stacked with any AGI buff that gives over 20 AGI..  i'm not really sure about the SK spell, but i suppose if there was one that gives over 20 AGI (or some kind of AGI modifying buff) that it would not stack/overwrite.<br />
And as for Avatar, yep it will overwrite PE, so for people who use primal weapons, you might as well just give them AGI :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zenok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">sounds like it wont stack w/ VoB then eh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>WulfTyger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Stacks with VoB just fine.<br />
<br />
This is the same spell that's been on the hammer from VP. no new issues with it. It never stacked with the agi buff (or group version of it) and never stacked with avatar. Works just fine with most everything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Karadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">it also does not stack with our Sta buff..and if you cast it first and then try to cast sta,agi it will overright it..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Snowfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Stacks fine with STA buff.  Use my primal cudgel all the time and never had an issue with STA buffs.  Just any AGI buff or Avatar (VoB just fine with it).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A certain SK group buff prevents (gulp!!!) TORPOR from landing.  That's truly nasty.  Strangely enough, you can't even remove it!  Even after the patch that made buffs removable.<br />
<br />
Interesting, cloak of the akheva(I think that's what it's called), an SK cloak, also prevents torpor from landing.  I don't know if the effect or spell or whatever is in any way related to the group buff mentioned, but SK's have two things that prevent torpor from landing.  <br />
<br />
Was in CT just last night as the only healer, and I assured the SK with me that she was guaranteed to die if she didn't take torpor not landing seriously and figure out which buff was the problem right away.  I let her know that there's no way in heck I can heal the whole group slow things, and try to heal a 60 SK with only chloroblast to boot in CT.  She finally figured it out by taking the cloak off.</div></div><hr />
