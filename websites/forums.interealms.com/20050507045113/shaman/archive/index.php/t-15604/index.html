<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Don33</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is there anyway to change your surname?I got frustrated after my first 300 rejected surnames and finally put in something short and stupid and it accepted it.Im guessing i am probably going to be stuck with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Petition a GM, it worked for me a while back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/petition.  Whether they will grant it or not probably depends on your luck of the draw with whoever answers the petition.  A friend of mine did get her surname deleted just because she petitioned and gave her reason as &quot;I don't like it&quot;, so ya never know. :)<br />
<br />
bah, Walruss beat me. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Surnames can be removed at any time.  Just /petition.  There are no guidelines or any right reasons.  Only thing is a Senior guide or GM has to do it, so it might take some time after you petition for one to take care of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Technicaly they are supposed to say no now... and tell you to use the $$name change service.  However it is largely the luck of the draw.  Some GMs will do it, some wont.<br />
<br />
One thing that has worked for friends of min in the past was to pettition that you are getting married in game and want your friends surname as your own.  If you dont want to keep the same name as them, petition later that you are no longer close and want to get divorced... and they will change your surname for you again :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Conditions for Surname Changes:<br />
<br />
Customer Service will change a Character's last name at his or her request, provided that the Character is level 20+ and either the requested surname, or the requested combination of the first name and surname do not violate the Naming Policy. Upon approval, this change may either result in the Customer receiving a new surname or the removal of the surname altogether. <br />
<br />
YMMV</div></div><hr />
