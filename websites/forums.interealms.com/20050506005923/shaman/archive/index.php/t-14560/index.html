<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>msatchmo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I was parsing some stuff the other day with my l33t 3rd party programs and I noticed I got like twice the exp I got soloing a mob when I increased my cha from 60 to 130... <br />
<br />
Conclusion:   The more CHA you have the more exp you get.<br />
<br />
<br />
p.s. this is a joke lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Cha owns ! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>The Doc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">what does l33t mean?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We will now refer to this is the Alpha buff!!<br />
<br />
Please delete this thread ASAP, nothing to see here!!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>msatchmo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I also found that cha makes topor and quiesiance last 3 extra ticks if your cha is above 100.<br />
<br />
Also I tend to dodge a bit more when I have my cha buff on but this I haven't parsed yet.   I also seem to lose less exp when I die if I had a cha buff on when I met my final ending...<br />
<br />
please let me know if you've noticed this as well.<br />
<br />
Also I heard rumors that giving our dog our lowest cha buff actually makes him quad attack and rampage?  can anyone verify?<br />
<br />
*cough*  I mean nevermind , You didn't see any of this *cough*</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shammann65</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ha See SEE!! I knew it! People laughed at me when I created my Shammann. They said: &quot;Put your starting points into Wiz and Sta&quot;. No No... I know better. I have the L33T shaman... I put all the points I could into Cha. Now I'm a 65 shaman with ALL maxed out stats. The so-called uber  65 shaman who called me a fool, has everything exept cha maxed. I own! Now others are starting to see how great Cha is. MGB cha Inc!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Alpha buff =  Phewt l33t PP exploit !! you can earn tonns more pp with higher Alpha stat <br />

Against Yelinak, but didnt they take that away or is it still working?<br />
was a bit ago I fought Yeli..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>msatchmo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Salas they are gonna nerf that +50cha bag once they find out how unbalanced the game is with cha items like that floating around.   Seriously it's only a matter of time.   They'll probably replace it with some worthless +HP or +mana or something else we really don't need.<br />
<br />
I've also heard if you have invis on and cha buff (cha must be in the first slot) it works as an invisibility to all buff.... even works against undead... just a lil bug I found.<br />
<br />
Plus we all forgot it makes you more charismatic meaning you get more tells from hot chicks who REALLY ARE girls in real life! SWEET!</div></div><hr />
