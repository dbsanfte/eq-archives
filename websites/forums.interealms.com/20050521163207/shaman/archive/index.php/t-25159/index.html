<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Warren Maguson Emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hmm...  I've never seen anyone talk about the ending of the storyline of Planes of Power but many things have bothered me about how it all ended after my guild defeated Quarm.  <br />
<br />
Now that PoP has been beaten by many people I just wanted to get a consensus of how many people felt robbed by the ending of Planes of Power. <br />
<br />
For those of you who do not know but were curious to the ending, I've cut and pasted a spoiler from the events that follow the defeat of Quarm.... if you dont want to read it, hit the back key now....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
*** SPOILER INFO  ***<br />
<br />
Zebuxoruk staggers about and looks at you drowsy, from his weakened state. 'My thanks to you. I am surprised to see you have made it here. We must get back to Norrath. The time has come for me to share my knowledge. Something is coming, a threat to us all, and the sands in the hourglass are thinning. Make haste and take me back the way you came.'<br />
<br />
Zebuxoruk says, 'I am surprised at the gods for taking such drastic measures, though I suppose all of the creations of the Nameless are capable of displaying poor judgment and irrational behavior. These gods are burdened with powers and responsibilities beyond our comprehension, yet at times even they do not understand the eventual effect of their actions. I am compelled to share the knowledge of the gods with the populace of Norrath, so that I might save their creations. They do not realize that if mortality ceases to exist... if they are not worshipped and held aloft by the beliefs of those that they now have grown to fear... they will fall from power and a new age of darkness will wash over existence as they know it. I did not seek to interfere with them or their realms, only to free them from a fate that awaits all of us. It is this fate that now stands ready, greedily gathered on the edge of the void, ready to test the will of all mortals.'<br />
<br />
Zebuxoruk says, 'If they have taken measures these extreme I must rethink what I have done, and what I will do. If there was this much cause for conc...'<br />
<br />
Suddenly in a bright flash a feminine figure appears before you. Your ears ring from the loud burst as she slowly materializes.<br />
<br />
Druzzil Ro speaks with no movement of her mouth. Her thoughts flow through you, calming you as you begin to comprehend what she is trying to communicate to you.<br />
<br />
Druzzil Ro speaks to your mind, 'Zebuxoruk, my student I cannot allow this to happen. If you were to escape from another prison the will and power of the gods will have been compromised.'<br />
<br />
Zebuxoruk says, 'Druzzil, I have missed you. Wasn't it you that taught me in your own realm to seek knowledge and share it in all forms?'<br />
<br />
Druzzil Ro speaks to your mind, 'That I did, but I also taught you not to share your wealth of knowledge if it would affect the fate of others. I cannot allow this to happen. I must set things back to how they were before you and these mortals arrived here, I believe that you cannot understand this and I am sorry.'<br />
<br />
Druzzil Ro looks upon Zebuxoruk one last time, as a wave of sadness comes across her gentle face.<br />
<br />
Druzzil Ro begins to chant an incantation; mana flows out from her body in all directions. Things begin moving slowly in reverse. You become dizzy from the experience and fall to your knees. As you look up the last thing you can see is Druzzil Ro smiling in your direction. She then waves her arms gracefully and points at you.<br />
<br />
There is a brilliant flash and you find yourself displaced through time and space. For a moment you lose touch with yourself. As you wake, you find yourself back in the Plane of Knowledge, moments after talking to Maelin with the information of retrieving the Quintessence of Elements. Druzzil has preserved the timeline, and restored existence back to its normalcy.<br />
<br />
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br />
<br />
You have entered Plane of Knowledge. <br />
<br />
***********<br />
<br />
<br />
Thus after the culmination of all that work you've done, Druzzil Ro, the demi-goddess of magic, rewinds time and sends you back as if nothing ever happened.  Even in my high school creative writing course my teacher always instilled in me to NEVER ever fall into the pitfall of this kind of ending.  It's one of those endings that robs the reader of any sense of accomplishment right with the ending that says, &quot;And she woke up&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Honestly, while some sub-storys are interesting enough, if I want lore, I will read a book. This game is 6 years old. Trying to create new lore to tie into all the old/current lore has to be extremely difficult. The games lore isnt THAT critical to me, overall.</div></div><hr />

Or a Newhart fan.  Terrible show.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its in exactly this area that SOE should consult with players in.  There are some players that know ALL the lore of the game, from expansion plotlines to minor books that 1 in 1000 players read, and only a few remember.  Talk with those players and find out places that they can work in new lore.  Honestly, there are parts of lore that havent been explored yet.  I do agree though that the lore isnt terribly important to me anymore.  Perhaps it was the tenuous thread by which LoY was connected with LDoN, which was connected with GoD which moved into OOW.  VERY weak storylines there. (Im still unsure *** is going in on GoD)  Good lore creation stopped after Velious in my mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It actually makes a bit more sense considering that all EQ mobs (except the Sleeper) refuse to stay dead. You kill em, 3 days later there they are again! It's like wack-a-mole.<br />
<br />
At least when you kill Quarm, you know why the heck he is up the next time, Druzzil reset the timeline!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It almost would have been less far-fetched if SOE had used Quarm's death as a launch for EQ2 rather than do funky things with the LoY storyline and give us an expansion full of things we can't pronounce.  EQ2 was obviously nowhere near completion when Quarm bit the dust for the first time, but PoP could have formed a nice bridge for moving onto the next game.<br />
<br />
Consider progression up through PoP*:<br />
<br />
Beta 5 = Killing gods and dragons 101.<br />
RoK = Killing lots of dragons!<br />
SoV = Killing a couple more gods and the dragons we missed in Kunark!!<br />
SoL = Killing the former masters of the last expansion race and their 4-armed alien friends!<br />
Pop = Killing all evil gods and their minions...all the time...always...repeatedly...<br />
<br />
  You finished all the original continents, most planes, and even took out those freaks on the moon!  Dragging the $toryline out on $ome goofy tangent$ afterward$ ju$t $apped the game of it$ integrity.<br />
<br />
*LoY was a screensaver right? :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or something close to that. I don't find it clear at all, but yeah, Zeb had something to do with disrupting space time, but I think technically it was the loony priests in Uqua who ripped the hole that allowed Discord to enter, when they were actually &quot;trying&quot; to rip a hole to wherever Trushar is, to get him to come and whack all of their enemies for them and establish them as rulers.<br />
<br />
There are some web sites out there that actually try to collate all of the lore, but be careful when you look around, because some of them use lore taken from Beta, and SOE/Verant has repeatedly said that the lore was changed and some of that isn't valid any more. I'm not sure what &quot;valid&quot; means, anyway, given how much of it all is gibberish.<br />
