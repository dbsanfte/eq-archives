<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">By chance we found Zelnithak to be up in UP the other night, and a group of us decided to try him. For us this was an exciting fight, and the loot droped provided upgrades for three of us. <br />
<br />
Does anyone have sugestions on other mobs that are about as difficult as this 'horse'. I'm mainly interested in the fight, but nice loot would not be  a drawback. <br />
What we can usually gather is 5 - 10 players at around lvl 60 - 62 (a few higher and a few lower).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Good ole fashioned HoT farming sounds good, though not terribly exciting.  HoT named and Dozekar are also fun things to kill while you're in the area.  The Va'Dyn in Akheva is another mob you should be able to kill too.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, he's always good for a laugh if you have 3 or 4 hours to spend knocking his HP's down  :)<br />
<br />
You're at the &quot;in between&quot; stage.  Enough to do some mobs, but not enough to do the really fun ones.  You might try Trak, if you get 10-12 (we normally do him with six 65's now).  However, you're too few to try some of my favorite mobs:<br />
<br />
Aary isn't as tough now, since RC is out, but still fun, especially with chicken repops<br />
<br />
Everyone laughs the whole time during the Lady N fight.  Watching your guildies Whirl till they Hurl is sheer entertainment!  just watch the back repops.<br />
<br />
IV is a fun fight too, when the MT keeps yelling in /gu I'm BILND!, I'm BLIND!<br />
<br />
<br />
One that you might try is hunting Greig's End.  When the mobs hit you, they might cast Illusion on you.  Everyone who looks at you will see something different, from Scarabs to Female Gnomes, etc....  Take LOTS of Screenshots!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Reading the replies, I realise that I should have been clearer.<br />
<br />
As a guild, we are at the point where we can just about do the PoS mini boses. But, we are not a raiding guild. Few and far in between are the times when we have 2 full groups online at the same time, unless it is a scheduled raid (once a month, maybe less frequent).<br />
<br />
So what I was looking for was fun mobs that we can do just for fun (if they happen to be up) when we are just the normal amount of people online. This would normaly be 5 - 10 (probably closer to 5 than to 10). Zelnithak fits this bill perfectly as we discovered.<br />
