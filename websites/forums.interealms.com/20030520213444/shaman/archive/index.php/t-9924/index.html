<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just hit the &quot;recommended level&quot; to kill guards in Katta, but...<br />
<br />
There are a bunch of quests in Katta which I might actually want to do at some point, so perma-trashing my faction there would be annoying.<br />
<br />
Can you fix the factions you get killing the various guards there?  There are 2 kinds right?  Nathyn's and others?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ThatDumbGuy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm really not sure about raising Nathyn faction, but can't you raise Katta faction by taking down Coterie in Tenebrous? Check on eqbeastiary on allakhazam under their faction headings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harmonisia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">all faction from katta can be raise in seru</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jedediah Bloodmoor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Kill Nathyns guards and your regular Katta faction increases the only faction you lose is Nathyns.  Nathyns guard faction is secluded to one small area (nathyns compound) and will not hinder you movement in katta at all. Not to mention that of all the times I went there the bank was always camped but no one was ever at nathyns guards and you can kill nonstop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mongore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am only level 52 at the moment but I have a few questions about these Nathyn's guards. What level are they? What level do I have to be to kill them at a good steady rate? What factions hits and raises do they give?<br />
<br />
Any replies would be very much appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Been killing Nathyn's guards lately :)<br />
<br />
They appear to be lv. 44 and 45 mostly (lv. 44 guildmate was in kata and conned them at even and yellow).  <br />
<br />
I started killing them at level 55, they die pretty quickly.<br />
<br />
Noticed I can single pull them easier at 57 (rarely get more than one now, only pull from outisde and first room inside).  At level 55 I stuck to killing the 4 outside and did not pull from inside, unless I had KEI.  You can get 2-3 at once pulling from inside at lv. 55 so KEI a must to survive.  I could solo 3 at once at 55 by root parking and taking them on one at a time.<br />
<br />
Faction is: plus Valodius Custodious (sp?), negative Nathyn Illuminous, postive Coterie, postive heart of Seru, positive shoulder of Seru.<br />
<br />
<br />
Basically, only negative faction hit is with guys in the mansion in Katta, Nath's boys, themselves and nathyn of course :)<br />

lv. 57 Shaman<br />

P.S. Exp is between one blue and one and one half blues an hour at 55-56.  Depends how fast you pulling or if you stuck in /tell hell and chat :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">After I saw the reply that the faction hits for Nathyn's isn't too bad, I went and killed these buggers.  I'm level 55  (with fungi, horse, and jbb, but no epic).  I also had my trusty side-kick (2nd box 42 druid with horse, manapres2, healing2 foci) with me.  No outside buffs though (no kei, no aego, etc).<br />
<br />
If I was careful, I could sometimes single pull the outside 4, but I usually didn't bother and got 2 at a time.  They aren't too bad.  I pull with slow and if I noticed an add coming I quickly switched targets and rooted the other one.  Then slowed the add also.   Then killed them one at a time, aggressively rerooting the add.  <br />
<br />
I could pretty much NEVER single pull the ones inside the first door.  Generally, I got three.  Once I had the spawn broken, I was able to single or double the inside ones.  Again, root and slow are your friends.  They really are not very difficult mobs.  Whatever you do, DO NOT try pulling the inside mobs with root.  I tried this and ended up with 5.<br />
<br />
Once I got the hang of it, I was able to keep the outside 4, the 2 in the first room plus the one that always adds from there (no clue where she comes from).  And the 2 from the next room in that guard the staircase.   After that, I'd have to work on respawns.   <br />
<br />
I'd guess at 52, solo, you could probably take the front 4 as long as you can manage to pull no more than 2 at a time.  If you're very good and have very good gear, you might be able to work in the next 3.  Maybe not though.  Personally, at 52, I'd kill the giants at the burning woods giant fort.  Good XP and much better loot.</div></div><hr />
