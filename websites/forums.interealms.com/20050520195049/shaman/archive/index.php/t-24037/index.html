<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The shaman epic is primary only, its equipped in the right hand.<br />
<br />
The beastlord epic is primary secondary, its equipped in the bst's left hand.<br />
<br />
Therefore we are safe, because they are not going to let us have an epic in our left hands.<br />
<br />
Peace to all --</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">All priests/casters only get 1 aug slot when melee/hybrids get 2 as well.<br />
So their epic(s) can be augged out to be much more superior than ours as well.<br />
<br />
As cookie cutter as the epics are I fail to understand why priest/caster got the shaft on the type 4 augment slot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">And there are only two aug slots cause they didnt put an innate hate proc on the warrior epic and since no one would use it rather than a wep with an innate hate proc, they had to put 2 slots on warrior epic (so you could double aug it with anger/stun/etc). And cause the warrior gets two then a bunch of the other gets 2. And then those that didnt get 2 bitch and then they get 2 :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Katgo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">On the beast boards they were wondering why the Beastlord in the pic is holding the epic in the offhand anyway. Normally a 26/22 +2 cold damage would go in the primary slot due to the very small list of weapons that could outdamage the beastlord 1.5 epic. I understand the issue with the shaman epic on looks and what slot it can go into because people don't want to bag thier TA but I would still get it anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think they mean in addition to the type 8 slot.  All epics 1.5/2.0 will have a Slot 4 and a Slot 8.</div></div><hr />
