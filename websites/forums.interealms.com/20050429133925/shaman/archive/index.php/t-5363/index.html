<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was in Velious so I decided to go to Crystal Caverns, because I've never been there. Was invited into a group by a lvl 49-50monk(He dinged as I was going to him) to kill Geos. The exp there at level 47 was awesome, even grouped. Later a warrior joined us. I ended up getting two and a half orange bubbles, and almost 800p in a few hours there. Ever since I've been trying to get the camp for myself but it's like perma-camped. :(<br />
<br />
The next day while I was waiting with hope that the group killing geos would leave, I was killing the Terrors in this little hallway. They were all light blue/dark blue to me. Was getting pretty good exp there too, with minimal effort (I buffed my pet and let him kill them while they were slowed basicly). Got a decent amount of platinum from them, but nothing compared to Geos. Later I got invited by a couple druid friends to kill the queen. We cleared out the spiders in the hallway, all the way up to the queens spawn area. Took out the place holders and all the other spiders and eventually the queen spawned. We killed her, easily. I only used a little over half a bubble of mana before she was dead. After the druids left I decided I'd try the camp solo. The spiders in the room started spawning, so I was killing them off but then the queen spawned and started beating on me. Then suddenly the hole room spawned and I had to gate :( /sigh<br />
<br />
I'd say this is a very good dungeon for anyone level 40ish or lower maybe.<br />
<br />
P.S. Always remember to bring batwings here, so you can levitate down the pit thing. The monk was guiding me to the dwarf city in there and told me to jump down, but land on each bridge. Was pretty cool, but would be easier with levitate. Had to jump twice 'cause I got lost and ended up back there at the top LOL.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck ;)<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, if you manage to get the geo camp, keep it for a LONG time, because if you give it up there's a big chance you wont get it again for a while. Well.. that's what I'm going to do anyway. I figure while I'm soloing the geos, getting awesome exp(about as much as spiroc soloing actually) I might as well get to level 49 and get huge amounts of platinum :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I leveled up a few times since I started this thread. Was doing spirocs, easily for awesome exp. :) <br />
<br />
Anyway, I recently went back to CC. I asked for a camp check and nobody said Geos so I ran to the geo camp, only to find out it was really camped by a monk who was afk at the time. I went around the tunnels conning them, and they were all light blue to me. I'm sure they won't be the best exp there, but they are good cash. I have yet to get the camp to myself.</div></div><hr />
