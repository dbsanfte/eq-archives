You could try the hunting forums.<br />
<br />
But on the other hand, i hear that City of Mist is quite good this time of year  :D</div></div><hr />

Try Echo caverns, you should be able to take the fiends and crab guys. <br />
Once you get a bit higher, you can get good exp up until around 51 or so at the skeles / taskmaster spawn.<br />
<br />
When i duoed there, i found that we could kill all the skeles, and all the spawns outside the room in the time it take for all the mobs to repop again (constant pulls)</div></div><hr />
