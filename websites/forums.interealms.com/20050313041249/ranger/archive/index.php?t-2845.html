<br />
Kelliani, Briton, Ionium, Peredhil, Emmer, and Vvenn, it was a pleasure to group together for the Glade.<br />
<br />
I left after 4 hours of fun with a Level 5 ranger, kick, and 4 points of Fletching. We must do this again sometime, and I hope to see all my new friends soon. =)</div></div><hr />

Hopeully this will allow us to all from new friendships to carry on  ovre time on servers together like Test. I'd love to get together  every  once in a while just to get away from the &quot;grind&quot;.<br />

Oh, and stay away from the rabid wolves from here on out. You're too prone to catch the Cooties from them. At least until you get better cootie resist gear {grin}</div></div><hr />

Character wipe later.  We could go play there and probably get either politely ignored or thanked.</div></div><hr />

I had more fun tonight on EQ than I've had in a long time.  Chain tanking always a blast :)</div></div><hr />
