<br />
I have been away from EQ for a few weeks, so I am not up to speed.  I see OoW is supposed to come out really soon.  Are any files pre-downloadable like LoY and LDoN were?  The reason I ask is because I happen to have access to a fast internet connection for the next few days.</div></div><hr />
