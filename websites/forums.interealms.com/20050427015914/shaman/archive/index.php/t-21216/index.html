<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ophidion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Quick question... i have a lot of experience soloing tactics/hoh etc.. My question is the following:<br />
With my current gear (i usually have stat food not shown in my magelo profile) how difficult would it be to solo the table mobs in fire?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>brokenlimit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">not difficult?  doesn't take a lot to malo, root, dot, sit.  it just takes awhile, for that reason i much prefer to kite grp there, but that may not be an option for you.  malicious decay is your friend here, though.  <br />

try that thread. it has the answers you seek.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ophidion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I tried soloing last night and succeeded 14%aa/kill is yummy. I dont think my Slow ever wore off. Also I loving having my spell haste items =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just as an FYI... if you are going to be regularly soloing the tables you should consider getting Virulent Paralysis 3.<br />
<br />
Pull with Mal Decay and VP3. Root has never broken for me after Mal Decay. It refreshes 6 seconds before it wears off so you can position at your convenience. I don't bother slowing.<br />
<br />
With Mal Decay and VP3 you could solo naked here to be honest... it might take a little time though.... <br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ldon dots are your friends for tables xp<br />
<br />
I usually stack bane, anathema, BoS and BoU; throw in epic when I get time between canni etc. Pretty useful DPS with ba4/crit aff3, most kills are around 4m30s</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ophidion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i think once i get LR5 i will finish out VP... its such a handy AA to have... i am also considering farming the ornate pants in solro or saving some DKP for that clicky immobilize shield from air.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ophidion, I have both the pants and the shield (Defender of the ancestral spirit). I use the shield until rooted on ghetto cc, then hit with the pants for longer duration. 1 second difference can mean something when a mob is resisting.... it also means I can feel less dumb about having every clicky root item in Norrath.. heh.<br />
<br />
Good luck to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Gear means very little when it comes to which root-dot camps you can hold.  Gear only increases your efficiency.  You could solo probably solo the fire tables naked with 0 AA if you had a full spellbook.  You could easily do so with VP3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">VP 3 makes AAing fast and trivial with pof access.  getting VP3 will help you get all your other AAs faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">No one ever camps PoWater. Hraquis are 16% AA a kill and die faster than fire mobs, unless you pull a cleric (faith warden). Grab one of Grizlor's linked maps from his post in the medicine cabinet, and you should be able to make it down to Fishlord Lezom, which is where i pull to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ophidion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It is ASS to get a group to go to PoW when im trying to farm the sharkspine club... i have never ventured past the see invis mob, but i do always have an insta gate on me for shaman emergencies... i will try that out tonight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">that club is rare as ****...i still don't have mine...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Is it just the tables or anywhere in PoF where Shammy soloing is possible?<br />
<br />
Do the PoF mobs summon? If so how do u deal with that?<br />
<br />
Is it required that you have LR5?<br />
<br />
Any advice for required equipment &amp; AA's would be greatfully received.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ophidion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">only named summon in PoFire... you dont NEED lr5, but it is my favorite AA purchase i have made to date (save for cani) Rampage tanking for magmaton is fun</div></div><hr />

Tables is the best by far, because it has the best xp reward and is also the easiest solo camp in the zone.  You are root-dotting.  If you pay attention, you will never, ever get hit.  Use DoT spells with no DD component for max safety.  The only equipment you *need* is your spellbook.  Focus effects and ft equipment, or mana reduction or damage increasing AA's makes it much more efficient.  If you have VP3, you don't even have to pay that much attention, since they literally never break VP after MD.<br />
<br />
You can do other places.  The magma golems are OK for cash (at least  they were when ceramic incense burners sold for a ton, not sure on the market now).  There is a post here somewhere on that.  The xp is not great, they hit harder and are much more resistant to spells than the mobs at the tables.  They break root and VP all the time.  There is a lot of space to move around here though.  <br />
<br />
Another decent spot is to just pull mobs out of C1 into that empty space in front of the birds.  It is just like the tables except you will have to deal with an occasional caster and the xp is lower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>papiraul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">This is how I do it:<br />
<br />
If you dont have Dot focus items get a Ceramic Gavel of Justice (Will save mana when dotting).<br />
You will also need Affliction Haste IV and Burning Affliction 4. You can get this at your local tribute master.<br />
Easiest way to get trib points is by making Forged Picks. Material for combine costs 2pp, it's trivial smithing at 49 and will give you 320trib a piece.<br />
8 backpacks of Picks will yield about 38000trib points.<br />
<br />
Be sure you buy VP3. Do this as early as possible cause AA's at tables is easy to get. You will be able to buy all the other stuff you need pretty quick afterwards.<br />
<br />
I got 2 spellsets I use.<br />
1: Solo Debuff<br />
-Bane<br />
-Anathema<br />
-Odium<br />
-Malosinia<br />
-Malicious Decay<br />
-Quiencense<br />
-Pox of Bertoxxulous (this breaks root.. I'll explain further down)<br />
-Canni IV<br />
<br />
2: Solo Burn<br />
-Bane<br />
-Anathema<br />
-Odium<br />
-Breath of Ultor<br />
-Blood of Saryrn<br />
-Quiencense<br />
-Pox of Bertoxxulous (this breaks root.. I'll explain further down)<br />
-Canni IV<br />
<br />
Make 2 hotbuttons for them:<br />
/loadspellset solo debuff<br />
/loadspellset solo burn<br />
<br />
K, this is how you optimize the kill.<br />
<br />
Load &quot;Solo Debuff&quot; spellset.<br />
<br />
Keep max distance to target.<br />
Cast Malicious Decay (This will lower dis resists to be able to land VP3, and it will guarantee VP to hold its full duration. It will not get resisted)<br />
Cast Malosinia (This is rarely resisted. Max amount of times I've got resists is about 5 times in a row. There is no need to malos before, you will only waste mana that way, and precious dot time.)<br />
Cast Bane<br />
Cast Anathema<br />
Cast Odium<br />
Press hotkey to load spellset &quot;Solo Burn&quot;<br />
Cast Breath of Ultor<br />
Cast Blood of Saryrn<br />
At this stage Bane will run out.<br />
Cast Bane<br />
Cast Anathema<br />
Cast Odium<br />
Now press Canni V<br />
Target yourself and smack on a Quicense.<br />
Now be sure to click VP3 now and check how long time is left until it refresh. You got one tick to reapply it after it refreshes.<br />
At this stage Bane will run out again.<br />
Cast Bane<br />
Cast Blood of Saryrn<br />
Now reapply VP3.<br />
Cast Anathema<br />
Cast Odium<br />
Etc. etc..<br />
<br />
When you feel safe and got all this timed in you can add in the Epic from start of the dot chain. It will wear of just before you VP3 the mob the second time. So reapply it after that if you want added dps.<br />
Also if you feel like risking it some.. If you time it right and keep an eye out for how long VP3 got left before it breaks, you can add and extra dot. Pox of Bertoxxulous. This will break VP3, so be sure to cast it when VP3 only got 5 sec left before refreshing. And be sure to be at max distance before you do it. Pox will break VP3 but since VP3 refreshed during the time you cast it you will be able to reapply it directly after.<br />
With BA4 and Crit Aff 3 AA I usally dot the tables mobs down in 3min 30sec.<br />
Canni up as fast ass possible after kill and you should be able to DING an AA every 50 mins or so. (Or even faster if you got good manaregen and stuff.)<br />
<br />
