<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kalduin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Something interesting was added to Lucy today. Three new effects, Melee and Spell Crit I, II and III (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5710&amp;source=Test) , were added. This wouldn't be strange, except for what is listed in these effects. The standard &quot;1:  Chance to Critical Hit(5) &quot; is there, but there are also some unknowns. If you check the stacking, the only thing these unknowns don't stack with are the new shaman focus upgrades (Wanvu's Focusing (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5396&amp;source=Test) and Talisman of Wanvu (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5415&amp;source=Test) ). Does this mean that the new focus upgrades will give casters a chance to crit?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">it might be a worn focus , or a aa   most likely an aa  so it wont be a spell :P  via it will stack</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">looks like they removed the Percent to hit aspects from the buffs.  More useless buffs = woot?</div></div><hr />

seems fair enough, look at the recast...thiers is 30secs and ours is 2.25</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jeyche Deychundei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yet the cast time of 7.8 vs 3.2 is what i am mainly referring to.... espically when theres little under 200hps difference</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Bst one has a 30 sec refresh. it's mostly just a burst of DPS. You certainly can't chain it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Arguments of this type are only valid if you presume only 1 spell slot.<br />
<br />
beastlord:<br />
lev70 savage ice 1053 (3.2 ct, recast 30)<br />
lev65 ancient frozen chaos* 810 (3.2 ct, recast 30)<br />
lev64 trushar's frost 742 (3.2, recast 30)<br />
* most will never see<br />
<br />
3 casts for a beastlord = 2605 in 14.1 seconds<br />
1053+810+742 in 3.2*3+2.25*2<br />
<br />
shaman:<br />
lev69 ice age 1202 (7.8 ct, recast 2.25)<br />
<br />
2 casts from a shaman = 2404 in 17.85 seconds<br />
1202*2 in 7.8*2 + 2.25<br />
<br />
Shaman suffer from an inability to use their skills quickly.  The velious casting delay should have been removed in pop.  Shaman have never been strong nukers, but unfortunately DoTs are not something we can use (aggro concerns).<br />
<br />
So until the developers see otherwise, you will cast bane once per battle and like it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">a Beastlord is gonna have enough spells full already. I don't think they could keep multiple spots open for nukes.<br />
<br />
1) Nuke<br />
2) Pet Haste<br />
3) Chloroblast<br />
4) Pet Rune<br />
5) Sha's<br />
6) Poison DoT<br />
7) Pet Heal<br />
8) Fero<br />
<br />
Maybe they could drop pet haste for another nuke, but chances are they might need to keep something else there, like abolish disease or single target haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ulver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm guessing the new effects are in respose to the devs feeling that the tribute effects available were somewhat caster heavy. Thus we should see some melee style tribute out on the masters before too long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">God, do us all a favor and please PLEASE let new Focus spell overwrite caster line of buffs/melee self buffs (Shield of Maelin, Arcane etc).<br />
<br />
They made the Focus spells not overwrite because the casters (and Clerics) didn't want their buffs being overwritten.<br />
<br />
If you have a problem with casters who do want Focus and don't bother to click off their shielding spell before you cast.... if you gave them more than 10 seconds or so warning, F-them. They had their chance.</div></div><hr />
