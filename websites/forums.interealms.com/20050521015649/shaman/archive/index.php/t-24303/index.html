The global issues with Chests will not be fixed until the update later in the week.<br />
<br />
I feel a little guilty I was so anxious to get my epic, I just had to do it last week. I *knew* chests were broken and I should wait for a fix before dragging my friends out to BFE (ie Umbral Plains).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What about those of us who suffered bugged chests and are seeking item reimbursement? If you check the sticked post about Nadox, you can see that in game and email support are of absolutely no help on the matter.</div></div><hr />

(Bentsen '88 voice) &quot;I've been to Bum F*** Egypt.  BFE was my home.  Umbral Plains, you're no BFE&quot;.<br />

(sorry for the thread hijack).<br />
<br />
Glad to hear that chests will get fixed.  My guild is starting on epic targets tonite, but maybe we can wait a couple days for chest spawning fights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Matey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, what about all of us who got the Swarmfiend but no chest?  What about my guild members I've been helping over the last few days with their fights who didn't get chests?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You guys kill me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Chest spawned for me...hawt 90hp wizard boots wru!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My chest is the only thing thats certainly not broken...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Itzkul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">No chest spawned for my last week on Swarm fiend but another guild shaman got one last night on his kill from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I highly, highly doubt you guys are going to see anything if you've already done the fights.  Let's be a little realistic here.</div></div><hr />

Prove it.</div></div><hr />

I was under the impression they just nerfed these chests because they are A$%^#holes ... wow you learn something new everyday hehe <br />
<br />
Seriously I thought they were there orginally to garner more intrest i the quests then later taken away after people were into them.  Nice to hear they are actually coming back</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Pretty sure they where either intentionally broken or broken as a result of trying to fix them. The problem was there where at least a few of these epic mobs that where just being farmed by people for the loot in the chests even tho people weren't upto those stages in the quests. Thats not what they where put in for. Infact the whole idea of the chests was so that they wouldn't be farmed for loot. Also several of the epic mobs where way to easy for the quality of loot they where dropping.<br />
<br />
The way I expect this will work once they get them fixed and back in is that only someone at the right step in the quest will be able to loot the item and you'll always get the chest the first time you and never again. Always gonna have a nice bonus for the people helping you but never gonna be able to farm it for loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yah I don't think they'll reimburse anyone, my guild would be owed like 12 chests at least. And some of them do have really nice stuff, necro final mob is a real pita but first time we killed him had elemental quality boots in his chest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Does this have anything to do with the idiotic &quot;must have player of classX at stageX in epic 2.0 to get any loot requirement&quot;?<br />
<br />
So tired of seeing mobs like Cipheron be lootless because a chanter or whatever did not make it to the kill. =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Probably will be a case a requiring class X at step Y to loot, for the simple reason that most of these mobs have very short respawn times and if they didnt do that, people would be farming them to hell and gone for the loot rather than for completing epics. It is likely that was the reason the chests stopped popping (hello Cipheron!!).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I didn't even know chests were broken. And my guild had a few fights planned for tomorrow including mine in UP. (Last part I need :))<br />
<br />
Guess I should give them a heads up that they're bugged. Glad I read this before a possibility of finding out the hard way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kinadorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Does this mean chests will be fixed in the patch Wed. or a different patch later in the week?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yeah was wondering the same thing... Glori posted this yesterday and Wednesday= later in the week from Monday.   But I can assure you that *I* wont be the one to try it tomorrow w/o hearing one way or the other if it's working.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Chiperon is a mob for the enchanter epic quest. Why should you be able to kill him for loot if you aren't doing the chanter epic. The whole chest system is as far as I can tell an attempt to let them provide loot for those helping out with out running into problems.<br />
<br />
If they make the mobs have regular loot mob spawn times it's gonna end up being a bottle neck for the quest especially if people are killing them for the loot and destorying or letting rott the quest peice. Look at warrior epic right now. Isn't even a loot mob in veskar and it's already a huge bottle neck with a 3 day spawn. Now imagine that with people killing it for loot too. Or imagine needing an epic peice off of any exsisting loot mob. How would you like it if we had to kill tormax or vallon zek or who ever for our epic? I'm sure you wouldn't.<br />
<br />
If they make the mob have a quick, 30minute or 2 hour respawn like alot of these epic quest mobs have then the loot they drop is entering the world too quickly. So either can't be worth while or no loot at all.<br />
<br />
Chests are the way to allow them to have a quest mob that isn't a bottle neck that still provides something for those helping with out allowing them to be farmed for loot. Personally I think it's a great idea. They just need to get it working right.</div></div><hr />
