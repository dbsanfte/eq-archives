<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Misury</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all.  I'm sure some of you have heard of me by now.  I'm Misury Magusarcane, a 55 necromancer currently petitioning for KoE.  As it would stand I was going to play Misury as my main, but have grown overtired of him and not being able to find enough groups that willingly accept a necromaner they do not know.  So, I would like to introduce to you my new main, Vaulicx Leafblade.  He is currently a 47 rogue but will shortly be 48 and hopefully 51 within a week.  Truthfully Vaulic is making up for what Misury is lacking (eg. Max I've waited is 15 minutes to find a group. :)  I hope this doesn't upset anyone overmuch as I'll still be the same ol' Misury, just in a new form.   (c=<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nekky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Bah, don't give up on the Necro. They are a tough class to play, take a break and go back to him. I stopped with Nekky at around 54 and started my Cleric and played my warrior as my main but missed the power I had as a necro. Takes true dedication and a little patients to take a necro all the way to the top but you can do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Arborealus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">And you are definitely one of the best necros out there Mis...:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Misury</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thank you everyone for supporting me on my decision and the great advice too.  Basically I am playing Misury once in awhile, but not near as much as Vaulicx.  I intend to keep him and use him still. :)  He is very much a part of me but unfortunately he has lost a lot of his appeal since he's gotten up in lvls.<br />

Expect to see Misury, and know that he will still be there when you need him.</div></div><hr />

Mis, you are in the top of the necros I have met because you have truely appreciated the things you are able to do.  I truely hope you don't give up your necro forever.<br />
I am tho happy you've found another class you enjoy, we all need a break from characters at times and need something different.<br />
