<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Relv</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 10:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now, I've heard a lot of stuff about how Kendrick favored rogues, etc etc... but I'm not so sure I believe any of it anymore.  Last night I was leading a Sleeper's Tomb raid (-kendrick zone-) and contemplating whether or not to buy a Salindrite dagger should one drop.  (I did... a small mushroom is struck by a thunderbolt, arrrrr)<br />
<br />
But that got me thinking, here 5 months after Luclin's release I'm still using mainly ST weaponry, it was truly a great zone for rangers.  Primal, priceless, great bows, and SoDs/Salindrites.  Furthermore on the warders... they are ripe candidates for archery, very low AC and you can sit out of range easily and plink away.  And heck, even for the &quot;non uber&quot;, most of the better bows in the game come from Dragon Necropolis (-kendrick zone-).<br />
<br />
ST is one of the few zones, as was DN, that paid attention to bows and from the get go included rangers on almost all the good drops.  Furthermore the design of the warders and the AC in general in this zone lends itself very well to archery.  NToV?  Our Vulak weapon blows, 15/21?  Sad... and the bows all suck.  AoW?  Warbow of Rallos Zek sucks.  Ssra?  Up until the reitemization, this was pretty sad too.<br />
<br />
It's just too bad freeing the sleeper makes this zone mostly worthless and unused, heh, as it is on most servers.  That wasn't such a hot idea, but as a whole, the zone is truly a great one for rangers.<br />

If you ksed ventanit then you didn't have much of a bane crew cause 6 wizzie chain baning him will kick our ass.</div></div><hr />

Most of the Luclin complaints and loot disparity was from Ssratemple, which wasn't a Kendrick zone at all.</div></div><hr />

casting time is 6 seconds<br />
recycle time is 5 seconds.<br />
so aggragate time per cast is 11 seconds ( assuming they don't toss in sunstrike in between while this recycles for another 1650 damage during the 5 second recycle)<br />
<br />
so WITHOUT focus items which speed casting...<br />
and NOT counting crits.. which go off like mad.<br />
wizzie does 181 DPS WITHOUT crits of focus items<br />
<br />
so realistically wizzies can do 230 DPS with ease on ventani<br />
<br />
and if the wizzies really want to KS.. they can all mana burn....<br />
<br />
so about 6k on average instantly so six wizzies=36k damage in under 2 seconds....</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yeah... until they go OOM.  Figure a wizzie has what, 3500 mana?  And bane is 450 mana?  Spec saves you 10% cast cost?  So that's 7 casts for 14K, now you gotta med... even at 40 mana per tick, that's somewhat over 1 minute per bane... or a measly 33 DPS.<br />
<br />
So 230 DPS for the first 7 nukes... then 33 DPS after that...<br />
<br />
Compare to Trueshot on 4th warder of up to 300 DPS for 2 mins, then 115 DPS after that...<br />
<br />
Anywho didn't want to turn this into a WIZ vs. RNG thread, but rather my point was... Kendrick's zone ST turned out to be a really good zone for rangers (provided the warders are alive), and DN was much the same way.<br />
<br />
-archery:  low AC + out of AoEs, not many wall issues<br />
-loot: we can equip it and there are upgrades<br />
-bows: primal bows own, still haven't been surpassed in Luclin<br />
<br />
You don't find those things occuring at the same time very often...</div></div><hr />

Plus FT, Plus KEI, Plus Bard song, plus mod rods, mana regen AAs, ect ect...<br />
<br />
Wizards out damage everyone on almost every fight in the game (Cept Tunare) consistantly in uber-guilds, unless your wizards suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bladebane</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 11:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your numbers are way off with wizards. 3500 would be the unbuffed mana of an average wizzy with so so gear. With greater familiar, koadics and gift of brilliance that shoots up to 4100 mana. With AA and spec its 20% or more cost reduction. <br />
<br />
Each bane would cost 360 mana. A wizzy could get off 11 banes with that. With focus thats about 2250ish per bane and they would statistically get one crit unless they were unlucky. They would do about 27000 dmg.<br />
<br />
 By the time they casted all of these they would have regened enough mana for 2 more casts with abit of mana to spare. Add in a mod rod and a harvest and thats ruffly 3 more. <br />
<br />
With AA and focus a wizzy would cast banes at 4.5 sec each + 5 sec recast. It would take a little over 3 min(harvest+mod rod time included) to get off 16 banes for ruffly 40500 dmg. <br />
<br />
After they are oom they right click robe for about 50dps +bane every(koadics, gift, improved fam, bard, Potg, FT6  would get 48 mana per tic standing) minute leading to at least 80 dps. If a necro is availible for mind wrack that shoots up to 120dps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
 That's pretty optimistic=) I'd say an &quot;average&quot; wizzie with &quot;so so&quot; gear is probably just squeeking past 3k mana.<br />
<br />
 And I guess average for an uberguild type wizzie with bane spells and whatnot is 3650-4200 unbuffed mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fogel</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL!!! You guys are smoking crack, play a wizzie and you will quickly find out you cannot nuke like that for very long and live.<br />
<br />
Theoretically a wizard can out damage everyone, and they do most of the time, but your examples are crazy.. DB mixed with concussion, necro feeding, modding ect ect and wizard will do insane damage.... Not 300 dps though...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loga</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 02:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm sure most servers have killed the 4th warder.<br />

Archery is sitll situational.  I'm unhappy that it seems that the game is going the way of archery as I still believe archery should be situational.<br />
<br />
I fought for 3 years as a melee and want to remain that.  I don't necessarily find ST a good ranger area, at least not any more.  A primal bow is nice but it is still just a situational weapon, as it should be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sean SpiritArrow</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 02:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Then remain a melee, we don't get short changed on AA's for normal melee really, and we do have some rather nice Dual-Weild combos. However, Archery is now a viable solution, and has more potential for damage than normal melee - so I am now an Archer, and rather like it. Its not situational for high end Rangers - I use Archery on every single thing now.</div></div><hr />
