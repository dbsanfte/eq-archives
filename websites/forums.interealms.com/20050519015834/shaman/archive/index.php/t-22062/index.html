<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Famine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As it stands, the shaman community as a whole is voicing its concerns to SOE, which is a good thing.  However, they can not and will not listen to all of us at once.  Gemdiver at Graffe's is getting incredable communication, http://www.graffe.com/forums/showthread.php?t=18857 , we need to do the same.  We need one of our own to do the same.  <br />
<br />
&quot;For any classes that feel they're being ignored I'd suggest this: Get whoever you feel best represents your interests and ask them to PM Brenlo with concerns, questions or interview requests. From what I know of Brenlo he would never turn down a request by a class board for a Q&amp;A regarding current issues facing a class. Sometimes he takes a while to respond but he does care and will reply.&quot;<br />
<br />
Does anyone feel that they can, or suggest someone that can, effectively represent the shaman community, keep a cool head and is willing to spend the time and effort to get a line of communication open?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Famine, <br />
<br />
Brenlo and Rytan have declined to enter into any kind of discussion or debate regarding the shaman class at this time.  In large part, that's the cause of the current frustration.  There's no discussion, no reason, just a response that says, &quot;XX isn't convinced.  Post more info.&quot;  While it would be very very nice to see some dialogue, it's just not likely to happen--it's pretty hard to have a dialogue when one side of the conversation consists of, &quot;no&quot; with no reasoning behind it.<br />
<br />
While I certainly can't speak for the entire class (if for no other reason than because we have so many different view points since we're a utility class), I have actually attempted to open a discussion with some of the other developers at SoE, and met with some limited success.  I'm not going to post names or the like, but I understand that they are looking into some things.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind, that is NOT to say there will be any changes.  Hopefully, however, it does mean we may have a new set of eyes looking at the problem.  They may very well tell us no as well, but at least I'll feel better knowing someone without a grudge was checking.<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Chutoi would be the best.  He's dead on with his assessments of the class, its deficiencies and lack of redeemable qualities.  Further, he's shown time and again the ability to lucidly refute, challenge and explain away the typical, SOE company line regarding shaman.  Chutoi's posts are thoughtful, substantive and suggest real change.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, his assessment posted above in this thread is also, as usual, dead on.<br />
<br />
My 3 accounts expire next week.  They won't be renewed.  SOE is perfectly within its rights to ignore the fundamental issues shaman are experiencing with class balance.  As they have done expansion, after expansion, after expansion.  Just as I am perfectly within my rights to refuse to pay them one more cent of my money.  Simple, huh?  <br />
<br />
Anyway, not to derail.  I'd nominate Chutoi.  But it won't matter.<br />
<br />
Chutoi for President!</div></div><hr />

Murtak has had excellent information, compiled and presented in a non confrontational manner, and been soundly ignored. Gloriana's concerns were pretty much waved aside. I feel any representative would be ignored or dismissed out of hand until someone else is looking into our spell design. Note, thats not saying FIRE Rytan/Ryan. Just add a new member to the team, and let them take a look into our concerns. When you are getting the run around with a business, you take matters over the brick walls head. We need to know his supervisors name :P</div></div><hr />

I was really inspired by the Guild Summit and do communicate with Brenlo via email and participate on the &quot;summit forum&quot; at eqlive.<br />

<br />
I would love to be more involved, but real life comes first - I have to work to maintain my fabulous lifestyle :)<br />
<br />
PS Famine, you see that One Voice thread stickied at the top? I spent a lot of time working with posters to organize/manage the various shaman concerns. This new fight is just coinciding with a bad time in real life for me to be as active as I would like to be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When it comes to heroes i think Chutoi is one. He's been banging his head against the SoE wall for a long time, voicing our concerns.<br />
<br />
I dont think we need more representatives. Lets focus our support behind those that we have currently. If we spread out we will become weaker. We need one voice towards the devs to be heard.</div></div><hr />

I am a shaman representative on the druid boards, not the SOE boards ;) . I think we should all send PMs to Kytherea (or however you spell that) to have Chutoi be the official shaman representative. If Chutoi has no fear of developing ulcers that is.</div></div><hr />

No need to bite his head off.  :)  The SOE guys specifically asked for anyone who is interested to send them a PM.</div></div><hr />

No, she has a right, as much as she has done.<br />
<br />
My vote would go to Glori, and I'm not really farmiliar with Chutoi, but I do know how active he is.<br />
<br />
I think we should have one shaman rep, in a general sense. However, I think one of the front-running raid shaman should also be there to voice his/her opinion, like one in Fury's Edge or Arch Overseers. It's always good to have one focused on what's new, so we can get a head start on the newest gearing/raiding/high end spell issues.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>kunann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The person they choose to represent each class has to spend hours upon hours compiling/sensoring the requests of hundreds of players and sending them to SoE to read 2 to 3 sentences and throw the rest in the trashcan. They are asking for free labor. I'd feel sorry for the poor sap who get this thankless &quot;job&quot;. Why should the playerbase pay for their game and do their job for them? They had the right idea in opening the forums for class discussion. However, they need to put out MORE effort to communicate through those forums instead of trying to get someone else to do that for them.<br />
<br />
Actually, each class already has a central forum where they discuss the issues. It's not THAT hard to go to those forums to find out what the gripe is about. If they care about keeping their customer base, they need to take a more active participation in these boards and address the primary concerns. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I'm a little leary about this, just FYI.  I strongly suspect this is another placebo with hours of the usual frustration involved. (ie, &quot;thanks for linking the parses from 20,000 players who disagree, but I'm not convinced.  We think shaman should be perma-rooted if they ever get agro--change going live next week.&quot;)<br />
<br />
Nor, as Flabbo mentioned, am I likely to be a popular guy over there, as I am completely disinclined to let someone feed us a line of bull poop and call it caviar (as they have attempted at times).  That has its good and bad points.  They may or may not be less communicative, but (hopefully) neither will they attempt to feed me a line of poop if they know for a fact I'm going to call them on it.<br />
<br />
At any rate, I guess I'll submit my name.  I strongly suspect they'll choose someone other than myself, mostly because I think they're after a mouthpiece and not a representative.  That's NOT me.  I have no qualms about telling them when they're about to stick their foot in it.<br />

I appreciate the support, guys, and I'll put in an app, I guess.  However, I think you're backing the wrong horse on this one!<br />

Great for you. :)  But honestly with all that on your plate (plus some kind of RL obligations I'm sure) I don't see how you could devote enough time to be a good representative.  While you could possibly be a great rep for us, I personally don't recall your name at all which makes me wonder what/where you have been for our previous attempts at improving Shaman.  I'd prefer to go with someone I know from these boards to speak for our class.  If we can have multiple reps, go for it!<br />

Exactly why we want you Chutoi.  Unfortunately, you're probably right and they'd never choose you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I'd say Chutoi has been the unofficial shaman representative to SoE, and Gloriana the official one.  After seeing how much work the two of them put into post like the &quot;proposal&quot; or Chutoi's numerous posts at the SoE board, only to see SoE representatives routinely blow them off, I doubt more talk would make a difference.<br />
<br />
That beeing said if they want the headache I'd say Chutoi and then Gloriana would have my vote for official first and second shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Gloriana is doing fine. There is a lot of people that deserve the &quot; hero&quot; title or whatever. But Gloriana has the right contacts, she is fairly cool headed when dealing with frustrating issues and she is pretty enough to weave a mystical spell on the devs to make them listen.<br />
<br />
Ok that last bit was brownie points but the rest is true. She is probably the best rep we have to SoE and i guess it should be said out loud so its common knowledge.<br />

<br />
At any rate SOE is not really looking for someone to tell them about shaman problems. SoE have been told what the problems are time and time again. I believe they are looking for someone who they can control, who will as I said toe the party. I really hope I am wrong but I dont think I am.</div></div><hr />

They want to stall for time more and get a compliant and or complacent person they can easily work with.  Free mousepads for everyone!<br />

I love Glori and I respect both Chutoi and Murtak, but I have no doubt they want someone who goes down smooth as baby ex-lax and won't make either any trouble or any difference.<br />
<br />
It seems like they respect Glori, but I don't know what her record on going down is; I would expect some teeth outta Chutoi, and Murtak I think would just annoy them by talking sense instead of hopping right into the sack and showing Sony what that hole was for.</div></div><hr />

Oh, and they did this same thing for Star Wars Galaxies, and ignored everything the class representatives sent them, at least up until the time I quit about 7 months ago.

AND THIS is why I will not  play EQ2.  The S in CS is suppossed to be SERVICE.  What ever happened to the customer is always right?  While I was playing I did feedback.  I participated in a couple BETAs and gave feedback there too (and bug reports).  I even did a little write up for a published guide (a VERY small part of it).  I had over 280 played days (over my 5 years of play), but my experiences were never considered and sadly, there are people in this community doing more, with even more experience and knowledge and still jack and squat.  Sorry to further dent the stiff horse carcas, but I saw the quoted comment and blew a circuit.</div></div><hr />

The customer is always right was a saying made up by customers for customers as an excuse to be rude. However Sony has the worst CS I have ever seen and it will take a lot to ever get me to play one of there games again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Just wondering, has anyone played earth and beyond?  Yea i know it's shutting down, but as much as i hate to say it, their in game CS is worse than EQ's... It consist's of a 'help yourself' manual, and an e-mail address to use if you can't help yourself, and they will get back to you in a 'few days' from what my memory tells me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Well, if the only examples of worse CS then EQ are games that are shutting down that says a lot about EQ right there. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">&quot;The customer is always right&quot; is a load of crap.<br />
<br />
The customer, however, is always entitled to satisfaction - be that what it may: a rain check, a refund, a replacement... or the actual reason why there will be none of the above.<br />
<br />
We do have the right to know why the game has generally agreed upon problems, when we can expect fixes by Sony, and what we can do to help.<br />
<br />
And I think that's underway, to some extent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Razzaziah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">You wont find a hero among the shaman community.<br />
We all diverge on what a shaman is and should be.<br />
<br />
SoE is at fault and there isnt much we can do.<br />
SoE lives in a dream land where GoD/Time doesnt exist.<br />
<br />
The fact is that TODAY:<br />
- battles are 30-40 seconds<br />
: no Disease dots<br />
: no poison dots (unless paladin is present)<br />
: no DPS*<br />
or<br />
- 4-6 minute raid encounters<br />
: dps can not exceed 500 a tick from dots, or you will get summoned (i.e. you can NOT keep bane + saryrn on an npc)<br />
: your abilities do NOT stack with other shaman present<br />
<br />
If you are going to pick someone for SoE you have to make sure that you pick someone Jaded enough to point out the flaws (Chutoi) AND one who writes a heck of a lot better prose then most (Chutoi).<br />
<br />
If you think for a second that a class representative shouldnt be ANGRY at this stage of the game you are wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
Final comment:<br />
If a piece of equipment can:<br />
- give stun resists<br />
- give dot/dd mitigation<br />
- give spell reflect<br />
- give damage shield mitigation<br />
- dodge, block, strikethrough, etc etc<br />
<br />
Why are SHAMAN forced to buffing stats which we have proved beyond anyones reasonable doubt have NO effect on survivability in the game?<br />
<br />
Shaman should have 10 versions of ferine (i.e. 60 second recast 1 target buffs) which do extreme things.  +50% stun resistance, +20% dd mitigation,... and it should be a choice who shaman buff on a raid.<br />
<br />
If Shaman are deligated the job of only enhancing melee (do not think we can help casters, because beastlords are 'better' by design)... they better do it to a point where someone says /tell &lt;shaman&gt; lay some love down on me!<br />
<br />
The tactical advantage of having a shaman should be in preplanning what you want for an encounter.  If you know a mob mitgates slow why isnt there a +30% avoidance ferine (i.e. long recast).  If SoE is willing to put this crap on items, they damn well better be able to give it to a class to cast it.<br />
<br />
Right now the shaman is the perfect BoT.  Pay attention to him every 30 seconds to cast 1 spell, and every hour rebuff.  Optionally you can take the role of PULLER, because if you take a dirt nap, your group wont die.<br />
<br />
Welcome to  cynicism my friend :)  Its a happy little place that keeps your aa/exp split at 90/10%.</div></div><hr />

Consider the alternative philosophies.<br />
<br />
I don't think you'll find anyone over age 30 who doesn't think customer service virtually everywhere is far worse than it used to be most everywhere you go.  It's very notable.  Snooty clerks, bored fast food cashiers who just can't be bothered to even listen to a very simple order and get it right, doctors who want to process you in and out of their office without even asking you any questions about your condition at all or hearing anything you have to say about it  -- all these people are doing a lousy job, plain and simple.  At their own discretion, to no good end.  The last thing their standard of competency, courtesy, and professionalism(hey even a guy who punches a hamburger order into a cashbox by hitting a picture of a burger on a key for minimum wage can STILL think and be professional) needs is to be condoned and justified.  Poor human interaction brings down everyone who comes into contact with it, and is plain bad business.<br />
<br />
The idea that the customer is there for YOU and YOUR profit and YOUR convenience, and whose needs matter little, and not the other way around, on a practical basis does lead some businesses to fail.  Providing bad service or poor goods because you don't think it matters leads many restaurants that try to cut costs by serving smaller portions or inferior food or service to close down; same with many other kinds of businesses.  There's always another restaurant somewhere, or some place you can shop at without getting what look like racist scowls as soon as you walk in the door.<br />
<br />
Looks like there are going to be alternatives to EQ in fair abundance too, finally.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, the alternative to good customer service is never a good one.  If you don't like face-to-face contact with customers, the solution is not to try to magically change the entire world to fit your warped psychology.  You're simply not fit for the job.  Customers are not there to adapt to YOU and whatever  your personal problems happen to be.  If you think nobody needs a prima donna customer, well a prima donna clerk is of far less value.  Actually of negative value.  Unpleasant clerks in stores mean people don't come back, and you're out present and future money, and negative word may well go around, knocking you out of the running for the money of other people.  An unpleasant customer, by contrast, still at least pays money.  If you can't handle that, you need to get out of the business or maybe out of business period -- take up another form of work that doesn't require face to face time with customers, because you obviously can't handle it.<br />
<br />
A lot of people can't interact well with people, businesspeople and salespeople too.  The last way to address that problem is to just lay a permanent attitude of not giving a damn out over everyone you meet.  Lots of people don't realize how crummy this is on a personal basis and how lousy it is on a professional one; sometimes, luckily, those guys get their just deserts and go out of business, get fired, whatever.<br />
<br />
It's a kid's game to not take responsibility for your behavior.  A criminal's too, by the way.  A very large part of growing up is not justifying your behavior, but taking responsibility for it.  Lots of people go through their whole lives as children, but it's not something worth justifying or approving of, no matter how common it is or becomes.</div></div><hr />

Here in the South if you are mean or nasty - word gets out. And trust me, folks down here DO talk.<br />
<br />
I have some buddies who do home &quot;fixin up&quot; etc. Well they went into Home Depot and could NOT find anybody to help them. More than once and more than one person.  So they stopped going to Home Depot and now go to Lowes.  And told all their friends.  So Lowes in the Athens, Georgia area is kicking HD's butt.</div></div><hr />
