<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've got an Obulus Death Shroud and a JBB on Garf. He's lvl 54 and it might be while before I can get my hands on Torpor. The shrouds can go for 15k on our server, and the JBB can go as high as 20k. Should I sell both, getting 35k, and then try to scrap up the rest which would be about 10k, since Fungi's range 40-60k on our server? Or will the fungi not be as effective as a JBB and a shroud. HOWEVER, I have a horsie...so I JBB alot. Currently, I am soloing or duoing with a pally in Soupy's spot. I figured you guys would have a pretty damn good idea what would be best... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Personally I would keep those 2 and possibley try and get an Iksar Regen BP as those are pretty cheap.  The combination of JBB and Horse give you much more mana than a fungi will in outdoor areas such as where you are levelling at the moment, and the ODS is giving you a pretty nice saving on the mana you are using.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't think I would recommend it, Garf.  Yes, I love my fungi, but -<br />
<br />
you are aiming at top sales figure for both ODS and JBB, and near bottom for fungi.<br />
<br />
do you expect a fungi seller to wait while you sell the ODS and JBB, or to you plan to do without them while you auction for a fungi?  <br />
<br />
and I am not convinced the fungi is worth that much to you, even though you are a regen-poor barbarian.  as Kronen suggested, the Iksar BP would save you the two other items and give you some good regen, too.<br />
<br />
but the fact that you are even considering this trade-out tells me that I was right to vote for Cannibalization as the shaman class defining spell!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Keep the JBB, no doubt about that.  JBB+Horse = good thing.<br />
<br />
ODS is nice, but I'm not sure it's worth 15k- at least not before the end-game.  That said, there isn't anything you'll be able to buy that will give you a larger power increase around that price... an Iksar BP maybe, but you could probably just sell your current BP (depending on what it is) and have close to enough for that.  Definitely do that- regen &gt; all.  The fungi staff is also nice (and probably attainable for 5-10k), but now that it doesn't stack with Regrowth, it's just about saving the mana to cast Regrowth rather than increasing your total regen rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Good point Bigguss, forgot about that staff.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I use JBB, Epic, Horse, slow, pet, POSSIBLY a dot (depending on mana) and use about 1/2 a bubble a fight after the horse and canning back any lost health.  The fungi, albeit nice, doesn't allow you mana-free fights where the jbone/epic does.<br />
<br />
<br />
I did exactly the same thing you did and ended up buying a horse in the end.. (ok and an orb of void.. 10ac boost..DROOL)<br />
<br />
I agree with everyone above.  Keep the ODS and JBB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've got ODS, JBB and Ikky BP.   Saving up for a Horse (7k in bank, need to go pharm the last 1.4k) but someone in the guild is offering me a Barb Spiritist Hammer for 8K.     The horse would benefit me more right now, but that's is one heck of a nice hammer.<br />
<br />
While JBBing I turn attack on &amp; tank so I get a swing off between JBB blasts.   Imagine this:<br />
Your Space Ghost Blaster starts glowing.<br />
Victim_01 is hit for 263 points non melee damage<br />
You crush Victim_01 for 109 points of damage.<br />
Victim_01 is hit for 263 points non-melee damage.<br />
<br />
That's damn tempting.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, back to the point.   Keep the JBB &amp; ODS, buy an Ikky BP.  Don't worry about the Funguy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You need to turn attack off Taladen.  It negates the medding effect on the horse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The Barbarian Spiritists' Hammer procs quite a bit for me.  My max damage at 2hb 156 seems to run high-60s though.  It's wonderful when meleeing, because I can crush &amp; cann and be about same health/mana at end of fight, when in a group.<br />
<br />
Soloing, it's handy getting a leg up on mana during the last bit of the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Don't have the horse yet, the choice I've got to decide to blow my cash on the Barb Spiritists Hammer or Horsie.<br />
<br />
Currently I have attack on for the swing between JBBs but I'll have to turn it off if/when I get the horse.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you're energetic enough you can turn attack on and off between JBB blasts.<br />
<br />
<br />
Put my vote in for keeping the ODS and JBB, and buying a horse and iksar chestplate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">8K for the BSH?  That seems a little high, especially from a guidie.  Politely decline, get the horse, and wait for a hammer to come up on the trade channel for 2k.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">dont buy a Barbie Spirit Hammer for 8k, that's a huge ripoff.<br />
<br />
Maybe 2k, but not 8... jeez nice guildie.</div></div><hr />
