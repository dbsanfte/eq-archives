<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Inflatia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Tried to post this at bottom of pet guide but it kept erroring and never posted so here it is for discussion and possible addition:<br />
<br />
Does anyone know what level of pet is summoned by each companion summon spell?<br />
<br />
As has been mentioned earlier pets will no longer break mezz (and enchanters cheered themselves silly).<br />
<br />
Not mentioned was that some time agp pets stopped getting aggro from pets, an old now nonexistent issue mentioned above in the guide.  No longer an issue now.<br />
<br />
Pets no longer poof when you go invis... so the guide's suggestion of that as a way to get rid of an unwanted pet is now invalid.<br />
<br />
Pets now zone with you, even if you ran off while they delayed the mob, so long as they were akive when you actually zoned.  Very nice because you can now buff up your pet in pok with uber buffs and head out to where you are hunting.  Also it means zoning no longer means wasting a pet and the mana it represents.<br />
<br />
Could someone post here the natural regen rates of the various companion summoned pets please?<br />
<br />
Could someone post here the usual damage done and hit points possessed by each of the summon companion pets?<br />
<br />
A strong suggestion to those shammies under 44 (where we get the spell Summon Companion) is get a Ribbon of Empathy.  Not horrible stats on this bely but it also has unlimited clicks of Summon Companion and is clickable at 34 (or earlier) for shammies (yes, I know, we do not get a pet til 34) and I know my 26 beastlord can click it too.  Indispenseable when your pet gets lost or if you forgot to take the /pet guard command off before moving on. Like the spell, this click will not summon a pet already engaged with a mob til that mob is mezzed, dies, possibly if it is stunned ( I find the game sometimes counts stunned as mezzed as far as a pet is concerned and it will disengage from combat making you need to send it back in with another /pet attack command.<br />
<br />
Admittedly pet discipline AA is great but you can pet pull without it by hitting the /pet back off button repeatedly until pet and mob are where you want them.  (Personal note: pet pulling works extremely well with breaking the room of Phineagel Autropos in Kedge Keep as just one example)<br />
<br />
I used to read that the 34 pet was nearly useless while the 39 pet was significantly better but have not seen this since pets were revamped.  Is it still the case, the vast difference between them?<br />
<br />
Giving pets 2 weaps will make them dual wield, and the belt/girdle and muzzle from a mage also affect but I was told only mage pets actually gain any benefit from being given armor, is this true or not?  Also remember the minimum levels for mage summoned proc weapons... any pet can be given them but if the pet is not itself of sufficient level (it goes by pet level not your level or the spell level) it will not cause the weapon to proc.  This is for those who give their lcl 34 spell summoned pet two fist of ixiblat and wonder why they never seem to proc).<br />
<br />
Well that is enough for me for now, I look forward to reading any replies.<br />
