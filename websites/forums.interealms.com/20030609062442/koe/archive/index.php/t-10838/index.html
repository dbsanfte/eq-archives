<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Enmity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys, I never destroyed my genoid faction soooo:<br />
<br />
I'm attempting my Phenocryst Focus.<br />
<br />
I'll have all the pieces ready in about 2 days for sure, but will need at LEAST 2 high lvl ranger trackers, a healer, a MT, a chant, and maybe a damage dealer or two.<br />
<br />
We do the turnin, and 3 giants spawn in Wakening Lands.<br />
<br />
We need to grab the first 2 regular ones, somewhat easy kills.... the dificulty is getting them there alive (ranger track = &lt;3)<br />
<br />
Then the high priest is a bit annoying, can CH and gate, so we'll need to stun him if we can.<br />
<br />
After the smoke clears, I'll grab their medallions, and turn em in, and get a nice off hand!<br />
<br />
Thanks, hope to get a few volunteers!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Post a date and time when you want to have at it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Enmity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok, I've collected ALL of the crystals, the velium focus (edit: I'll need a quick escort to crystal caverns for a quick turnin there but then:) , everything.  I'm completely(edit:almost) ready to go on this one.  I'd love to do this asap, like tomorrow (thursday January 23rd) after any scheduled raid or the vamp hunting for Toddoth.<br />
<br />
It will not take as much as I had previously thought, only a druid to port us and track, a ranger to track, a healer, mt, maybe a damage dealer... and even that will be massive overkill.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Enmity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thank you so much:<br />
<br />
Baracus, Toddoth, Mei-YO (hehe), and Tuk (played by Bara =P) for all the help with my Focus!  I couldn't have done it without you, and if anyone else needs help, I can gladly walk you through it.</div></div><hr />
