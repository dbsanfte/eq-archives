<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Setantha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I started on the Tundra Yetis in DL at 35 and just hit 40 today..all still blue to me. The Yeti cave can be found in the NW part of the zone (pos2200 pos4800 approx). There are 7 static spawns all on what seems to be a ~10min timer. ( I have heard that there is also a roamer which would make 8 spawns. I have come across a few roamers but I believe this is a path-bugged yeti either from within the caves or from outside. Usually there are only the 7 statics.) The yetis have a VERY small aggro range so can be easily pulled singly. My tactics pre 39 were pet (pet parked near the cave entrance), self buffs, quick me and pet, pull with slow, Scourge and envenomed breath, melee. At 40 I dont even bother with slow or poison...just pull with Scourge and melee...does wonders for Defense and melee skills :)<br />
<br />
A point to note...the pathing here can be very buggy...I've lost pulls before only to have an add when I pulled the next. When I pull I normally back them out slowly to near the cave entrance...taking a few hits along the way...this seems to lull them into a false sense of security ;)  Max they have hit me for is 78...now at 40 they rarely hit me at all.<br />
<br />
Loot is average .. usually drop 1-5pp, words and occasionally Essence of Frost (smithing item I think).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kervin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Great Spot. They Walking Sleep or TI never stuck. I ran into a even con at 35 that even bounced EB. Great exp though. Thanks for the info. Died once, but made up for it in two kills. I also experienced athe sudden dissappearance of some, mostly when pulling from right cave. Found them, err they found me when I would walk close to one of the tunnel walls. They could hit me thru it, but wouldn't show their face :mad: . Dinged 36 last night, hoping it will help with slow sticking.</div></div><hr />

There are actually TWO roamers, as well as the seven static spawns.  The zone crashed whilst I was there, and there were two roamers when it came back up, but the first one seems to get lost quite quickly.<br />
<br />
I would pull with scourge, and back out whilst thumping them, and when outside let dogdog thump as i cast envenomed breath, and then pet kite them along the west wall. With an iksar BP at lvl 36, I would use two bulbs of mana and be back at full health when they died.<br />
<br />
They drop essence of WINTER (not frost) for cultural smithing, which sold for 25pp each on my bazaar mule, sold all six really quick too, so may have underpriced them. They also commonly drop &quot;Frosty Dakura&quot; or something like that, which look like flowers, but I don't know what they are used for.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Curious about these. How does our damage output handle these. <br />
<br />
Currently doing shrooms in DP which is really easy now with the pet. They 'only' have about 700-800hp (a wild guess) though. Planning on staying here as long as I can get a blue every 3 kills.<br />
<br />
I heard that the Yetis have ~1500 give or take. It seems that it would take forever to take them out, and that the downtime would be huge. Is that right?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Foresaken One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm currently hunting these yeti's, and they're pretty damn easy. Merrygrin, I'm level 35, close to 36, and with 2 dots, and 1 dot re-casted, me and my pet can rip through these with only about 1 bubble of mana gone per kill. Worse case scenerio ends with about 2 bubs gone. I always pull with scourge, run to the entrance where my pet is parked, have my pet attack while I cast E-Breath to grab it's agro, then pet kite it along the wall. E-Breath usually wears off when it has 2 bubs of health, and when it get to it's flee stage, I have the pet back off while I re-cast E-Breath. I have full health unless I cannibalize once or twice. Oh, by the way, I have about 942 hp unbuffed and my wis unbuffed is 163. I much prefer Wis over HP because you can't cannibalize when your to low on health. Each blue kills nets in about half a blue bub of exp and some fairly decent loot. Also, I would say they have 1500hp or less. After two E-Breaths and a scourge (About 900+ damage), it's usally dead with the pet doing about 1/4 to a 1/3 of the damage. I wouldn't recommend these pre-pet, as they would take WAY to much mana to kite and re-cast without your permanent DoT (Pet) doing some damage. Oh, also, there are some wandering mobs that a KOS to you, but if you kite them high along the wall, they won't agro. I've never died here, but got close to it when I decided to try a giant. Killed it, but I was Oom and the dog was dead.<br />
<br />
If you decide to do these yetis, my strategy was to always have a minimum of 60% mana, then I would pull. I would always end up with around 50% or 49%, unless I got one or two resists. Downtime is about 1-2 minutes before I got to 60% again. My defense is close to being maxed at 163 right now. Everytime you pull, just wait close to the entrance for them to appear (the pathing is bugged). You will get hit a few times, but just soak it up and your defense will raise. Pet kite after the dog attacks. Pretty simple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gamanae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">According to the old EQ mobs list (which was up to date as of Kunark, at http://www.geocities.com/ficticiousname9/ ), tundra yetis are from 31-35 and have 1300-1380 hps.</div></div><hr />
