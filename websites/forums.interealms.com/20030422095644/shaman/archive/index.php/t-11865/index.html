<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just thought I'd share a tactic that I've been using a lot lately that can be real useful. The trick is using /assist to get targets from other debuffers so you can better decide what you want to debuff. <br />
<br />
Here is a senario:<br />
<br />
If you are slower, a couple of mobs are INC, you can /ass the shaman that is on malo so that you are indeed slowing the mob that malo is on.<br />
<br />
You get the idea. You can /ass other shamans to see what mobs they have targeted so you can target another one. It is also useful to /ass an enchanter that just mezed a mob to get his/her target so you can quickly land slow on it without worrying about agro. etc.<br />
<br />
This probibly isn't new to a lot of you, it isn't even new to me. But I do find it a very useful tool as a debuffer to better work with everyone who is debuffing. <br />
<br />
Just thought I'd share!</div></div><hr />
