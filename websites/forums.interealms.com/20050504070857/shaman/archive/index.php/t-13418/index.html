<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Am I one happy shammy! :D<br />
<br />
Just bought Topor and all I have to say is WOW!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Still in debt 9kpp from buying this but first time I have seen for sale below 50K, let alone on sale at all! lol<br />
<br />
Must say, this opens up new sololing possibilities. Mobs that were a tad iffy, are now trivial with this baby woot!<br />
<br />
Now if I can get malo, Pox, Tigirs............ <br />
<br />
Contemplating if I should level straight to 65 or farm AAs at 63.<br />

Was about to get extremelly pissed off, then I saw in your sig that you were a troll and not a frog *whew*</div></div><hr />

Imagine accidentally pricing something at 1/100 of what you were considering.......   ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Congrats on your new found power, dont know what I would have done without torpor!<br />
<br />
Get your guild to kill Sontalak, we got Malo, Avatar, Pox and Talisman of Raptor off him in one kill the other night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Some Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">when i used to play a shadow knight I bought my Pre nerf CoS for 3000pp instead of the 30,000 that im sure they meant to charge. not quite as big as the 450 - 45,000 gap but still, its a funny thing when you see it isnt it? you kinda look at it trying to make sure its really what your looking for lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hehe yar. I bet the guy must be kicking himself about that one P)<br />
<br />
Anyway, I be an agile troll, dank yous! P)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">and I though I was lucky getting Avatar for 495pp in Bazaar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I imagine that guy will be buying a new mouse soon after he sees what he did.<br />
<br />
possibly a new monitor too, if his aim is good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">On the other hand, I have seen prices dropping consistently on EMarr.  I've been watching the price of Malos, my only PoP spell left, drop from 80k to 40k on the same vendor who apparently has been unable to sell it.  Heck, Bane of Nife is now barely over 1k on our server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">On Karana, BoN is under 500pp on a good day, no malo/torpor to be seen. Hell, some idiot is trying to sell VoB for 25kpp, and some other idiot is selling the Yaeth's 118 right side page for 1,000,000pp. Malos/Quin aren't seen either, and others like Blessing of Replentishment 15kpp+, Saryn 25kpp+, and other 63+ are all about 13kpp+.<br />
<br />
Kinda pathetic, but then again, what would you expect? :(<br />
<br />
Duurg</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Just to add to the &quot;I got a great deal in the bazaar due to someone's mistake when pricing&quot; thread hijack, I recently got boots of flowing slime (FT 3) for 15k (normally 100k plus on my server and last seen 150K).  No, it's not torpor for 495pp (grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!), but I'm still pretty stoked. :P<br />
<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>AtommWarbird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I managed to get Blessing of Replenishment for only 50pp!  <br />
<br />
Malo and Torpor are still 70K here on The Nameless<br />
<br />
Pox of Bert is 20K, and VotB is 15K.<br />
<br />
/sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Have seen a lot of copies of torpor and malo sold around the 20k range lately on Torv. Most of them by my guild. Sont drops them often and so do some other targets we hit regularly. Malos is about 30k and copies of seventh don't sell for more then 45k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">And here I was happy to get my Orb of the Infinite Void for 10k. <br />
<br />
In my four months of searching, I have yet to see a copy of Malo for sale. I finally gave up and spent my Malo money re-equipping the Paladin so I could duo Guardian Wurms when bored.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">and I though I was lucky getting Avatar for 495pp in Bazaar.<br />
You paid 10k more than it is worth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I was happy to get Canny 4 for 2k..<br />
<br />
**** all you and your good priced servers!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Malos is readily available in bzr on Saryn for 40k. thats about it though.</div></div><hr />
