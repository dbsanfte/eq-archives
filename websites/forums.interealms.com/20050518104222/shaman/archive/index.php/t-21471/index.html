<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It seems like most of us have neg rep'd ourselves into the grey. I get reps with nice lil comments but none of them matter cause everyone is grey hehe.<br />

I guess some things have a way of working themselves out  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No. Most people bump gray because they haven't received any feedback, either positive or negative.</div></div><hr />

Or the one where I agreed with someone who said the high end game is too much about raiding. The guy who reported me for that one left a nasty comment &quot;you are the weakest link, goodbye!&quot;.<br />
<br />
What is the point of the report post function if it's going to be abused like that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">postcount++ and rep check</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KumoeSpearbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">ok, so my one tick is default level for rep? (ie 10 is default)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I tend to post on fairly controversial topics, and I have strong beliefs on most of them. Therefore, I get quite a few hits. Luckily, the postives have seemed to outnumber the negatives, so I got a 2nd greenie :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Quite frankly, I'm amazed at the fact I have/had 3 green rep points.<br />
I used to tear a new one into a many posters when they asked fairly dumb questions like posting the 20th new thread on &quot;what's the best class to duo with a shaman?&quot;.<br />
I think my posts on shaman pulling and maybe a few other threads pushed me ahead, but I'm getting neg bumps again here and there for speaking my mind and NOT tearing into people anymore.<br />
But then there's posts I'll make, like my step by step walkthrough on how to fix up your elemental plane flags, that nets me no positive bumps at all, even though I know many many people have used it (I know I've personally walked about 40 people in game through the steps of fixing flags, as well as I don't know how many that just went off my posted guide on our guild board)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I got a lot of + reps for being funny.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Rep points are stupid, they only serve to boost someones ego. If you disagree with someone about something on the forums, people will give you neg hits. It does have a value though when they rate informative posts, but not all posts are informative.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">rofl, i didnt say everyone lost their green's they had. ;)<br />
<br />
Just thought it was funny. Im grey, everyone that gives me positive rep bumps is grey too. Though i dont neg rep anyone ;)<br />
<br />
Ok ok there was that one guy, but he was really stupid =x<br />
<br />
I just remember not long ago anyone that rep bumped me was either red or green, now its like no one has any effect on each other anymore cause the only people using the rep system are grey.<br />
<br />
Oh well just another fruitcake post from Litgruv, godi wish he would leave<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh wait...<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
<br />
<br />
Rofl, i just checked my rep on the way out of here to quake3, all new rep bumps all grey but 1  .  Ahh well, i guess the new people are loving me or something lol :D<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
i know green must = good, red = bad...whats gray?  I never, till this post, even noticed reps. <br />
<br />
Grey means your down the middle. Your not in red or green. No one loves you or hates you, your nothing, no one !!!  The horror of it all :(<br />
<br />
Seriously though, it just means people havent neg bumped you enough to red or pos bumped you to green. In my case im like blazz, i tend to have outspoken strong opinions on controversial topics and dont back down enough from things most people do. So i have earned the title of the middle way.<br />
<br />
Seems to be a theme in my life lately. &quot;The Middle Way&quot;. The path between both opposite extremes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Personally I don't really care about this rep system. It doesn't really serve any purpose, because rep points are often assigned based on the emotions, not for any real reasons. In most cases anyway. So it's just a biased point assignments serving no purpose. I don't personally think any less or any more about someone, who has less or more rep points then someone else. I don't care if someone's rep points are red. It may show that the person is spammer, yes, but it also may show that it's a person who stands for what he/she believes in and those who voted against that person, couldn't convince his/her in their point of view and then, as a last action, slapped negative rep points. So, basically, it's pointless point system.<br />
<br />
Didn't even know that it can be checked somewhere, or that they can be assigned to someone. Not gonna do it either, it's something I don't need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">poeple should give me positive reps.. cos .. erm.... i like green blocks.. its healthy right?<br />
<br />
some the comment on my feedback.. &quot;your a negative nelly?&quot;  .. erm eh?<br />
and &quot;i did your mom last night&quot;?  ..good for you.<br />
one neg for spelling Q  wrong , someone really didnt like quin:) which was fair enough.<br />
<br />
on the positive side , after a particular good assault on poor old tugela , i got a &quot;*wipes a tear*  just masterful&quot; :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I don't like the rep system because people use it to vote on what they think of your opinion.  I really don't care whether someone agrees with my opinion or not.<br />
<br />
What it SHOULD be used for is to slap down people who get out of line with personal attacks or inappropriate language, people who refuse to stick to the topic, etc.  and to encourage people who are going out of their way to post well-thought-out or well-researched information.  But in practice it's just encouraging demagoguery - say what people want to hear and you get good rep, say what they don't want to hear and your rep suffers.  /shrug.<br />
<br />
I think I have positive rep, but only because Glori was nice to me once after I got what I considered to be an undeserved bad rep post and complained about it in the thread.  I no longer complain about it, so take all the potshots you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Those green dots remind me of Pacman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I always try to at least leave a short note and my name when I rep somebody.  Anon neg bumps aren't very useful.  I make sure they know who I am, and why I think they're worthless :)<br />
<br />
But Ive only given maybe 2 negs?  <br />
<br />
Mostly give positives for when somebody is very informative.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">On another recent thread, I wrote about that, Snap, and I said almost exactly the same thing you did. I sign my name when I bother to give someone a rep bump. A man's opinion is worth nothing without his name behind it. Of course, for that post I got two grey rep bumps from nameless people. Worthless crap. I've given what was meant to be a negative rep bump to three people, and a lot more of what was supposed to be positive bumps. I think mine still show up as grey little buttons, I only have 45 positive points (which means ... well, I'm not really sure). The rep system isn't my favorite thing, but if someone has something particularly good I will bump them, let them know it, and encourage more of it.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Think on my post of my chat with the devs, i got something like 10 rep bumps, but most of them were grey, which as was explained to me, was because they didn't have enough rep/posts to give me a green bump.  Course, the next week someone posted something and I disagreed with them and got all those positive points taken back with 2 negative bumps hehe.  No biggie.  I actually go on there to see if I got any bumps, but I have never seen anyone that gave me a negative bump actually post their name.   Like I care if you gave me one,just don't hide behind your name.  It's okay to disagree with something, just don't be an ass about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Heh.  Yeah, I just got a neg rep bump on a recent thread with no explanation.  It's nice if they just occasionally put, &quot;You're wrong, you're an idiot&quot; or something--as opposed to no explanation at all.  :p<br />
<br />
Frankly, I don't pay much attention to rep.<br />

I am glad, because I would hate to think that anyone saw more than 1 green dot and thought I might have something useful to add because of it.<br />
<br />
EDIT: lol at the person who bumped up my rep with the comment &quot;TWO GREEN DOTS INC&quot;.... now my post makes no sense..... although.... it's not really any different than my usual ones. It did make me smile. thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I have a few bumps, most positive, one negative, and one grey. No comments at all except on the negative one it said dumb idea and one of the positive ones I suspect was from Sunmoon commenting on my oldschool RP name from some people we both knew together. Come on people at least put some funny comments! I could care less if someone puts their name. It's not all that meaningful really, don't take it too seriously.</div></div><hr />

<br />
one slightly jaded person gave me a good rep with  &quot;Rep points are irrelevant, here, have some&quot;  <br />
one with no message .. must have just felt i needed them:)<br />
and another with &quot;yer green blocks are good&quot;  quite how this person know what my blocks are like i not sure:)#<br />
<br />
anyway, if gloriana can just give me a bump that be good:)<br />
<br />
but on a serious note i do think that neg reps shouldnt be given just because you dont agree with what said. if it explained, fact pointed out and no good reply, but the same stuff posted then maybe.<br />
i must admit to not really bothering with rep, but even so it always nice to have more green blocks:)<br />
<br />

<br />
 You have given out too much Reputation in the last 24 hours, try again later.<br />

doh :(  Guess the lil rep party i had in this thread caught up to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">In a perfect model world, the rep system is a very good method of determining who might have a clue and who seems to be totally negative most of teh time.<br />
<br />
We all know this isnt a perfect world though. <br />
<br />
I never give neg reps (might gave Giac one, though, heh). If I like a particular post, even some I DISAGREED with, I give it a pos bump, and always leave my name and reason. THATS what I think the system is for. Feedback to the individual posters on specific posts, good or bad. <br />
<br />
Too many dont leave a message. Some who do just say stupid things like &quot;your an a##h@@@&quot;. My favorites are the ones who say stuff like &quot;Been there myself, nice post&quot; or &quot;Can you be more abrasive?&quot; on a neg, and when I re-read the post, sure enough, I was rude. <br />
<br />
While trolling and slamming other people seems to be a hobby of sorts for some, I find the main use of MBs like this is the dissemination of information, and the offering of various opinions based on that info. This board has some great posters, with strong opinions and well versed articulation of those opinions. Thats why I come, and thats why I use rep. <br />
<br />
I HAVE given good bumps for people that I disagree with. I DO NOT give a bad bumps for being firm in your beliefs. If I did use bad rep bumps, it would be to put the trolls into the negative, the ones who ALWAYS cause trouble.</div></div><hr />

I cannot give any reputation to anyone I have already given some too in the past. Not sure how much you need to &quot;spread around&quot; but its at least 10 other people before you can repeat the same person.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">I understand the reputation system's purpose, but seems it can easily be abused.  I have one neg and one positive rep point.  I have no idea why I was even given the neg rep, because it was a calm post mearly stating opinion, along with the many other posts in the same thread (heck, I think a couple even agreed with it).  This is where I see abuse.  Nobody should be given a neg rep for mearly stating an opinon, as long as there is no name calling or saying things such as &quot;You suck&quot; or &quot;Quit EQ/Go play another class.&quot;  The latter part I think is the rep system's intent to differentiate people who are constructive and those who are troublemakers.  <br />
<br />
The only reason I worry about my reputation, is because there are new people who come to this board and casual readers who may go by one's reputation for credible sources.  If someone see's a gray dot, one might think this person is some jerk or something, which in actuality probably contributes just as much as the average poster.</div></div><hr />

I got a neg rep bump for this lol, trying to help and get **** for it. Went through the trouble of copying it and searching for a host all so i could help the guy and i got red for it. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
I just wanted to reply here on it cause they were too weak to leave their name, only &quot;RED RED RED&quot; in the comment. Its all good though, i got a positive rep bump back. Infact everyone time one of you people rep bump me with a neg rep bump like &quot;&quot;RED RED RED&quot; or &quot;to the red with you&quot; or &quot; omg i cant take your posts anymore litgruv&quot; i get like 2 or 3 positive lol.

Well i dont like the system, but i dont see the harm in spreading a lil love to each other. Frankly i dont see really anyone in this thread that didnt deserve a rep bump. Most everyone on this forum is good people /shrug.<br />
<br />
Maybe this thread didnt analyze the HPS or DPS of a shaman, but it brought me to understand some posters a lil better and i got a chance to help someone out. All in all its a good thing in my book. Not to mention i thought it would get 1 -2 replies and die heh.</div></div><hr />

And what shandy said about rep about hits it on the head..its basically a different method of sending a PM to someone.  All my rep hits are gray dots with no comments...  <br />

Starting threads to bump each other's reputation isn't exactly what it was intended for, I might be wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
I like the system, but not in its current form, I guess. I think people should HAVE TO fill in some reason. Even if they hit . . . . . ., yeah ok, then I KNOW I can consider that a troll. <br />
<br />
As it is, a lot of greys are unknown. Of the last 10 or so hits I have gotten, 3 have been signed by the person, 2 or 3 others had reasons without names, and the rest were blank. <br />
<br />
As I said in a previous post, I actually LOOK at the post in question when I get a red bump, to SEE if their assessment is accurate. One guy who red bumped me said &quot;Could you be more abrasive&quot; and the post ini question WAS abrasive. Thats a neg rep I can appriciate and understand. Simply putting &quot;your a dick&quot; because of my opinion on Casual vs Hardcore, or my opinion on what direction Shaman should be headed in EQ, or whatever else I feel (and post) strongly about isnt cool. Thats the problem. <br />
<br />
And as long as those types of problems exist, the rep system REALLY cannot be taken too seriously. Yeah, this thread is a little tounge-in-cheek, but its not hurting anyone. I got 2 + bumps, works for me, makes up for the 2 &quot;your an a**h***&quot; reds I got. /shrug</div></div><hr />
