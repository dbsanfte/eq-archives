<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>rautonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">**Disclaimer: reading this MAY cause you to laugh and having a second pair of pants nearby is recommended.  And strange looks by people around you and the comment &quot;WHAT are you  laughing at?&quot; are in no way the fault of the author**<br />
<br />
OK to properly understand this story you sorta need to have a druid of level 24 or greater, or a ranger level 46 or higher..otherwise it MIGHT not be as funny...<br />
<br />
*keep reading it gets better, I promise*<br />
<br />
  So...yesterday I logged on my shaman (level 34 at the time) and half heartedly solo some cougars while waiting for my friend to log on his necro.  I note a level 37 druid (darn those quad kiters) and see a TON of corpses around the gnome pirates.  And, yes, the druid did train friend and I with 6-8 cougars on purpose (and no we didnt steal any of his kite, he was just jealous that us killing one at a time was faster than his kite :) )..but that isnt the point of this thread.<br />
<br />
*Don't give up; winners never quit, and quitters never reach the funny part*<br />
<br />
Just as I'm getting bored, friend logs in and we start massively slaying cougars (shaman+necro is VERY VERY nice).<br />
<br />
*almost to the good part*<br />
<br />
Fast forward about two hours..<br />
I log on after going LD and friend going afk to see the two that had left corpses on the ground by the gnomes (level 34 sk and warrior) getting torn apart by a very very bad pull of about 4-5 cougars almost right by me *GASP*...yes I could have tried to save them but they were at about 200hp each so no point in me dying too. <br />
<br />
*DONT stop! you're almost to what you came for!*<br />
<br />
Fast forward about one hour...<br />
Friend and I are still killing cougars and I see the SK zone in.  We keep pulling and pulling; trying to get level 35 was all that was on my mind :).  <br />
<br />
Note: I ALWAYS have pet up (hope I havent ruined it yet ;) )<br />
<br />
*OK! the wait is over*<br />
<br />
So friend is pulling while i'm medding and pet is sitting by me regening...and lo~ SK has finally retrieved corpse and is headed in my direction (ACK....MUST......HIDE............!!).  he stops several feet away (near pet) and.. (ACK DONT!) &quot;Hail, Garbatik&quot;<br />
<br />
I quickly check myself, and yes..still named Rautonim hrm...<br />
<br />
I change to third person and yap...just me and dog sitting there...<br />
<br />
At this point i'm almost sure he accidentally clicked pet; I know pet always seems to be in the way when i try to loot ( &quot;Garbatik judges you amiably blah blah&quot;) or else he is a roleplayer.<br />
<br />
He waits the (must be mandated by the EULA right?) 3 seconds before asking the dreaded question &quot;Could I bug you for a SOW&quot;.  At this point, I'm about to fall out of my chair laughing because Clueless_SK_01 has mistaken dog dog for a druid.<br />
<br />
I was totally shocked that someone could make it up to level 34 and NOT figure out that wolf (transparent at that) was NOT a druid.  I didnt know what to say, and typing was hard while trying to maintain my composure. I must have waited at least one minute trying to figure out how to break it to him that Gabartik wouldn't be performing any tricks for him today.  I maybe could have kept silent to see how long before he begged a port *snicker*.<br />
<br />
Instead, I said &quot;have you ever seen a shaman before?&quot; and /pet who the leader.  He did realize his mistake (luckily...) and claimed he was tired, haha.  I decided that after all that he was worthy of 40 of my mana, and a quickness, and a regeneration..hadn't had a good laugh like that for ages.<br />
<br />
Although i will add /rude for walking up to someone who is OBVIOUSLY killing stuff, and that sort of behavior NEVER lands you a &quot;sow plz&quot; or &quot;buffs plz&quot; whatever that is :D<br />
<br />
At least my day that started with being trained by a rude druid turned out to be so good.  ding 35! And FINALLY my REIF is proc'ing...no more seeing &quot;your will is not sufficient blah blah&quot; after whiffing :D<br />
<br />
Moral of the story Rocky and Bullwinkle style:<br />
Not all wolves can port you <br />
OR<br />
The transparant wolf don't do no tricks<br />
<br />
I'm sure other's have escaped LOIO/OT/DL and ventured far enough out to mingle and make marvels of intellectual comments/begs such as this..hope i meet more, could use a good laugh every now and then<br />
(apologies to those who do the kunark circuit and are intelligent, hats off for dealing with these people 24/7)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">lol quite the funny story there you have, sadly I've had it done to me too when a friend cast wolf form on me. I was glad I had the AFK thingy over me and waited until he left.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/cliff's notes version:<br />
<br />
an SK asked his pet for sow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As Sam Kinison used to say, &quot;I can top it.&quot;<br />
<br />
My 45 Monk dual wielding Canes of the Tranquil in a nice, bright, dark red Robe of the Lost Circle has been asked for<br />
<br />
1) Sow<br />
2) Locate Corpse<br />
3) Port<br />
<br />
<br />
I figure the Ebayers just mass spam and hope they eventually run across the class who can do what they need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wait -- here's a better short version of this thread: <br />
<br />
Hyberbole.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Starcat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">this was a very funny story and seeing how my wife playes a 53rd shammy and I a 54th warrior plus we have a 46th druid all secerat accounts this strikes me as very very , but you should play a barbarian Warrior, here i am standing at the entrance to a zone ( many times this has happened ) full plate armor and duel weilding 2 slashing weapons &lt;noobie lvl 1 thru 50&gt; could you SoW me? i look around no one but me &lt;Hail Starcat : could i get a SoW from you?&gt; Sorry I cant SoW I am a Warrior  reply 1 ) oh thanks, reply 2) well %$#@ you if ya dont want to SoW me just say so ( or something to this effect )  some peeps can be alot of fun. one day i will just tell them for me to SoW them they have to /duel me for the effect to take hold</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">About every other week my pet gets a sow request.... I always point out his name is a different colour than every PC character in the game... and then laugh at them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>HalimRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Oh, but you missed the best part. You should have said that your friend Garbatik just went afk to grab a drink, but will be right back. Then see how long he waits :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>rautonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">heh, to respond to almost everyone:<br />
<br />
Toshizo: to the true buff begger afk or not you are there to buff said begger, sometimes they will wait an hour til you return so they can really annoy you or worse, train you while you are afk &gt;&lt;<br />
<br />
Faern: I agree it's sad when someone begs you for something you cannot do..but begging the pet is worse :D and my halfling ranger gets asked for ports all the time..he's a druid right?..since when do druids wear reddish plate and carry around two weapons?<br />
<br />
Starcat: the people who give you a hard time for being unable to do something because it is impossible deserve a place on your ignore list..these sort of people usually disappear, and if they dont at least next time you wont be bothered :) you will just wonder &quot;why is that guy hovering around me?&quot; :D<br />
<br />
Drinnar: I wouldnt judge people if they didnt see overhead name was a diff color..i turned that feature off after my first day of playing heh, but am glad that i will have this to look forward to at some later point--ALWAYS good for a laugh, always..at least until named wolves arent assumed druids, like that will ever happen.<br />
<br />
HalimRN: he would have figured out Garbatik wasnt afk after first cougar pulled while he was sitting there..certainly wouldnt want to sit there keeping up the illusion as long as he was willing to wait for buffing lol...assume 20 minutes wouldnt be out of the question hah. Although i will have to think up something to do next time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've had people ask my pet for SoW, Buffs and Ports... and get downright mad because Kibekn is a d00d who won't answer them.<br />
<br />
Warg</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Forty-SoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yep, I always tell people his afk at the moment but should be back any second.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rikkardo Montalban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hehehe Often I will run around with Spirit Talker War lance and not in bear form.  As a troll, I look pretty convincing as an SK.  The requests for summon corpse are always funny.  Especially when I start casting Canni or something and they still don't get it....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Heh, that reminds me when I was sitting outside OS orb and this necro in smr walks up to me and asks me for rez.  <br />
<br />
Apart from that, shortly after Velious came and after I bought form the great bear, I used to run around Everfrost terrorizing the noobs with hotkeys and all.  &quot;You shall not defile our lands!&quot;  That often sent em packing hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Frost Giant Femur.  2hb, looks like an axe.  I get left alone a lot more when I'm wielding it.</div></div><hr />
