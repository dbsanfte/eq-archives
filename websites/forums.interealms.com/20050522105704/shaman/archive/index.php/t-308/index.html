<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Went to juggs again this weekend. Noticed shroom king was up on the way down and decided to pull him. He dropped the tunic. Since I was ML, I looted it and decided to wear it for the rest of the raid.<br />
<br />
Oh...my...God....<br />
<br />
Mana was simply no longer a problem with it on. I was amazed.<br />
<br />
At the end of the raid, we're rolling loot, and we come to the fungi. Thirteen people are rolling. I'm number 7.<br />
<br />
A seven was rolled. :D<br />
<br />
I guess you could say the fungi grew on me. :p<br />
<br />
Then I go back yesterday with some other people and bag Tigir's.<br />

<br />
Nah, that trip was kinda lean for me (of course, getting such a traditionally rare spell is better than 100 Talismans). We got one copy of the 55 pet from a shroom on the way, but that was it. Usually I'm neck-deep in Talismans.<br />
<br />
%$&amp;#$^ Bane! :(</div></div><hr />

Did however get tali cat while clearing 7 guardian wurms that were up in skyfire last night.</div></div><hr />
