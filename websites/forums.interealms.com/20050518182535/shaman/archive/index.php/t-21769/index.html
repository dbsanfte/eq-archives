<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Oukast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">From time to time when I am casting a spell with some form of levi on, I get an interupt message....Please fix this SoE!  No I didn't move, duck, or anything else newbs...not asking for help, I am directly explaining a problem.</div></div><hr />

Then maybe you should put this on a Sony board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This has happened to me often, and is one of the reasons I don't like to have SOE on in battles. Apparently the annoying and excessive bobbing is interpreted as movement and an interruption.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This happens to me a lot, but it's usually because someone has just run past me or bumped into me while i'm levitating.   Make sure there is no one around you or just click it off is what I do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes I have seen this also. And I have been interrupted as well trying to cast a spell AFTER a mob hits me, not moving, nothing, and he doesn't hit me agin but mysteriously I am interrupted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ragack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I found that when I'm in bear form back up against a wall I can often end up getting consistant interupts until I move away from the wall</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ziull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I dont think its a bug.. i mean you are moving up and down and most of the time you channel through casts when casting while lev. /shrug been this way since the beginning i thought it was meant to be that way hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Oukast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">hahaha ziull</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>mspeedie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I found it happens a lot more after the DX 9 upgrade.  i find it happens less if make sue I'm looking straight ahead (keypad 5).<br />
<br />
Some zones I need lev to kite, so I worked at.<br />
<br />
Walls are a bane too try to keep a small space away.</div></div><hr />
