Heard the encounter is pretty tough but it will get you to secondary planes(key wise)...goodluck, post more info if u have more. The trial will get you into the plane of valor i hear.<br />

if Mavuin doesnt respond ask him &quot;what information?&quot;  and follow prompts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
not to sure how mavuin is connected to the trials, but the 6 hammers are in one of the coolest areas ive seen in eq, you have to get a group of 6 people together and go into trial there...theres one yellow con mob in PoJ i think his name starts with a J but you have to go past him to get to the tribunal, literally track him and walk past him...when you get in if your just exploring, dont hail them to start the trial, easy to get back just pass one of the awesome looking guys and go into the portal to take you back to the previous room, word is on my server as the ubers were there that this isnt a place for a pick up group and it is one of the most challenging things they've done in eq as a 6 man group...post encounters if youve been and and enlighten us, success rewards you another flag taking you to valor plane i hear...  goodluck:)</div></div><hr />

No flags, just an item for each of us off the final encounter for our trial.</div></div><hr />

The idea of that test is to keep these shade looking turds from killing prisioners.  They spawn 3 at a time, fairly MR, mezable, dunno about slowable, also a couple of the fungus beast  models spawn, which are non-mezzable.  i'm sure we'll be trying these again tonight, as they're extremely fun, and damn good xp.  Even though we wiped, i got 4%(including death &amp; 56 rez)  regular 60 xp in the 5 minutes that we stayed alive in the trial. <br />
GL, post stories on other trials</div></div><hr />
