<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DMorlack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I've gotten my little halfling to 46 and am loving it with each passing level.<br />
But I have gotten to a point of unassurance.<br />
<br />
I would be in Jaggedpine hunting the griffawns but I get such graphical lag there that it's just a hinderance and quite annoying (as the same was with DSP).<br />
I grouped a little bit in DL but started to go insane after about an hour and a half of it :)<br />
<br />
So what I am wondering is if anyone has any suggestions of places to go and fear kite.<br />
Just can't get enough of panic animal :)<br />
<br />
My current gear is as follows:<br />

+Lupine Dagger for the GWF proc.<br />
<br />
Any information would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kyrviel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Don't feel bad man, I'm in the EXACT same boat as you.  just hit 47 last night...0% into it and searching hard for a place to hunt.  I went through 46 grouped in DL...I wanted to shoot myself.  <br />
<br />
So for everyone out there, help us out.  DSP and Jaggedpine are out due to grapics lag (and I'll speak for myself by saying I've tryed EVERYTHING to reduce the lag, nothing works, the new trees are too much) so where else is good for 46-47?  <br />
<br />
I'll go ahead and say about 50% or more of the walrus' in EW have gone light blue.<br />
<br />
Help us... please =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Daerian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i went through 45-49 in EW, killing mammys, wooly rhinos, snow griffons, and icefang. Pretty good xp and safe if you pull to where icefang spawns nothing will agro you there, just watch out for the manticores and the ulthork man-o-wars</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grimmy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you can stand it, Zelniaks and Wolves in DSP were good xp at this level.  Stay away from wolf form, however.<br />
