<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mmshah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone know why this spell is rarer then GRC?  Also can shaman scribe it yet?  I remember a shaman posting he got it, but when he tried to scribe it he couldnt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kialan Lecariuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I bought this in bazaar a couple months ago for 8k. I could definitely scribe it, and it has been a life saver on underwater/airless corpse runs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Shamans were always able to scribe it. The scroll was mislabeled as DRU-only, but any pure caster with Enduring Breath (Shaman, Enchanter, Druid) could scribe it even then.<br />
<br />
Now, why is it rarer than GRC.<br />
<br />
Well, it is. Unlike GRC and like Levitation or the level 39 Remove Curse, it only drop from a single, named MOB. And, like Levitation and unlike Remove Curse, that MOB is in an out-of-the-way spot requiring a moderately good group, one on the average higher than level 52, to get to and to keep.<br />
<br />
But unlike Levitation, the MOB that drops the Everlasting Breath spell doesn’t also have a chance to drop an ‘uber’, droppable, AC 35 shield/back slot piece of armor that sells for mucho plats or something like that. So groups only go kill it for the spell and leave when whoever needs it got his and or her copy, rather than trying the named spawn over and over until everyone in the group got a copy of the LORE scroll to sell.<br />
<br />
Plus, unlike Levitation again, there is so many EB items in the game, most of them easily obtainable by the low 40s (which is the cut-off point of that level 52 spell anyway) that very few people ever even bother to put together the group to get the spell. Not to mention that the vampyre castle in TM is just a pain to fight in… tons of ‘named’ vampyre, each with their own specific immunities and a wonderfully lousy pathing job that usually insure that half of the runners will poof without experience nor loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jeraem Gaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I really wanted to finish my spellbook so I kept clearing the vamp tower in tenebrous over and over. This spell finally dropped off trixy about 2 weeks ago after over 60 clearings of the tower. Only saw 2 copies of the beastlord spell in that period of time also. <br />
<br />
<br />
No frickin idea why those spells are so rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mirabilis Dictu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A little background on this one... Trilexior is one of half a dozen or so named vampires in the coterie castle in Tenebrous Mountains.  He's an enchanter who likes to gravflux, just to add to the fun.  There's also an underconned 58 SK named up there you might want to watch out for, for another quest.<br />
<br />
Some time ago there was a serious pathing bug in the castle where, when the nameds ran back into the castle from the back balcony at low life, they'd get snagged on the tombs and just poof.  No xp, no lewts.<br />
<br />
Verant claimed to have fixed this, but I don't know if they did.  We took a group up there and had a lot of problems with aggro through the floor below right after that patch.  Competent group, all the right levels, and it was a horror-show.<br />
<br />
Before this, we killed Tri over and over and over and never did get him to drop the spell (when we were able to prevent the poof, that is).  After the patch we stopped trying.  RvR dictated it.<br />
<br />
Good luck in your hunting of it, though.  Imho 8k for that spell would have been cheap for the effort, but hey... bat wings are cheaper.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm 0 for 133 on getting that spell from Trilexior, I'm to the point now where I only drop by if theres nothing else that interests me, cause its so stupidly rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Aye. I used to see it in the bazaar occasionally for 10k. 10k I said? That's rediculous! Now, after PoP? it is never for sale. I should've bought it when I saw it.<br />
<br />
Just one more minor annoyance about rare drops. I mean, torpor is one thing. EB and Levi are a whole 'nuther shebang. Not only are they PITA's, they're also druid and cleric usable as well, that's 5x the number of people to compete with.</div></div><hr />
