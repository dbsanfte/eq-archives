<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>degasvegas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi, new to these boards, but since I created a Shammy as my new main, figure I should join sooner or later.<br />
<br />
Basically me and a buddy just came back to EQ, he created a Human Monk, and I created a Troll Shammy.  So far we've been amazing together, the duo is just awesome.<br />
<br />
The problem is, even if we are the same place at the same level, he always gains more XP than me.  We figured this out for sure last night, both of us were 1% into level 25.  After a bit of hunting, he leveled to 26, and I was only 86% into 25.<br />
<br />
I thought they took out penalties to Races/Classes long ago, whats the problem here?  Is it my penalty holding us back?  Or do Human Monks get a significant bonus.  I'm kind of bummed at this.<br />
<br />
I know this won't affect us really at 51+.  But the thing is, we came back to EQ, but promised each other to stay out of Luclin, PoP, Loy, Ldon, and God.<br />
<br />
We are going totally oldschool, at lvl 25 we are doing Upper Guk, its always empty, but soooooo much fun.  Omg, I can totally see why I played EQ back in the day heh.  But either way, we won't be hitting level 51+ for a while.<br />
<br />
Any info would be apprectiated - thx. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There is 2 things to know.<br />
First is XP penalties due to the race. ( Some will tell you it is still here, I don t really think so )<br />
Second is the XP you need to level as your class.<br />
Shamans requires more xp than a monk for example, and Hybrids require even more xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>robxiii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There is no exp penalty for your class at all anymore, its only races.  Halflings level the fastest, Ogre's have a bit of a penalty, and Iksar/trolls level the slowest of all the races</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">thats correct race have exp differences. troll and iskar need 20% more exp (compare to a human) orges 15% barbarian 5% rest 0% (as far as i know) and halfing i not sure about but might need 5% less (but diff 0%).<br />
<br />
no class exp difference anymore</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My understanding is that it works out like so:<br />
<br />
Human, high elf, half-elf, dark elf, dwarf, etc. -&gt; no penalty or bonus<br />
Halfling -&gt; 5% racial bonus<br />
Barbarian &amp; Vah Shir -&gt; 5% racial penalty<br />
Ogre -&gt; 10% racial penalty<br />
Troll &amp; Iksar -&gt; 20% racial penalty<br />
<br />
In the past, there were also class penalties (e.g. 20% for SKs and Pallies, 10% for monks, etc.), although these were eliminated a long time ago (shortly after velious was released, if I recall correctly).  However, under that old regime, warriors also enjoyed a 10% exp bonus and rogues got a 5% bonus.  These class-specific bonuses were not removed along with the penalties and are still active now.<br />
<br />
Thus, a halfling warrior will level the fastest, while an iksar or troll of any class except warrior will level the slowest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Kitty has no modifier i think. But the rest is right</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have a cat rogue and a rl friend has a woody ranger, the cat burns through exp quite a bit faster than the ranger. <br />
they changed the class exp penalties because the penalty was getting passed off on the group mates of the class instead of the class itself...ok thats hard to follow.<br />
sk get a negX penalty, the penalty applies when soling but when grouped the entire group gets the negX penalty due to crappy code. <br />
<br />
I would love to see (well I have seen but cant remember where) the showeq charts of required exp per lvl/class they were interesting.</div></div><hr />

This is mostly how it is.  The thing I would add though is that you technically aren't getting &quot;less experience&quot; per kill, like a lot of people want to assume, it just takes you more experience overall to go from 1-65 and your % per kill reflects this since the total experience needed is divided among each level.<br />
<br />
If I had to do it all over again I would pick Vah Shir..simply because I'm always grouping with enchanters on raids to get the illusion. (I would make my own potions, but I can't find/buy the Vah Shir parts).</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes sorry thats per level. you get same exp from amob, just need more to level</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>spiritsofding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">&quot;There is no exp penalty for your class at all anymore&quot;<br />
<br />
that may be true with regards to hybrids, however its is virtually certain that different classes require different amounts of exp.....just as in d&amp;d which eq is a close copy of.<br />
<br />
If u think otherwise then prove it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Halfling Warriors and Rogues hit 65 faster than any other race/class combination that I know of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The only class-based exp modifiers are BONUSES.  Class-based penalties were removed.  Racial penalties are due to specific benefits.  The largest bonus is for regen, then frontal stun immunity, and finally the tiny barbarian penalty, because we're just so damn segzy.  So here it is:<br />
<br />
Warrior &amp; rogues:  +5%<br />
Barbarians:  -5%<br />
Ogres:  -15%<br />
Ikar &amp; Troll:  -20%<br />
<br />
These are really easily verifiable by starting a noob with a buddy and getting a level together, using a UI with a % measurement on the exp bar.<br />
<br />
So, for example, a barbarian (-5%) warrior or rogue (+5%) will end up leveling the same as a non-penalty or bonus character.  Hobbit warrior or rogue ends up with a 10% bonus.  Your troll is indeed going to level 20% slower than the human monk.  Just keep gate up so he dies more often than you, and you should come up even.  *grin*</div></div><hr />

I still don't think this is right.  I've read many sources that state that ALL CLASS bonuses and penalties have been removed, period.  However, the RACIAL penalties and bonuses are certainly still there, as you stated, however, I think what you meant was that there is a +5% bonus to Halflings.<br />
<br />
Therefore, from the research I've done, these are the only penalties &amp; bonuses currently in game:<br />
<br />
Halflings: +5%<br />
Barbarians:  -5%<br />
Ogres:  -15%<br />
Iksar &amp; Troll:  -20%<br />
<br />
Obviously, the Troll shammy is going to need 20% more exp each level to keep up with the human monk.  <br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>ginevra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Just let the monk die a couple of times and eat the xp loss. ;)<br />
<br />
Just kidding, just kidding! Actually, see if you can find a few quests to do on the side to keep your xp pretty much on track. For instance, if you go to Kunark, do the Sarnak braid quest with Captain Rottgrime in the Overthere. XP, faction gain and you can then nab yourself one of those 2hb that procs a port to the Overthere at 50, all at the same time.</div></div><hr />

I'd be curious to see a link to even so much as ONE of these &quot;many&quot; sources, since this information is totally false.<br />
<br />
Finally we have a use for Caster's Realm. The changes to the XP system went in on a patch on Jan 17, 2001. Prior to that, there was a producer's letter, and several posts on the official boards by Brad McQuaid and Abashi and Absor on the subject. The two most pertinent ones are here:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Hadina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I played my troll shaman solo a lot, and i've gotta say, it really sucks. In groups I didn't notice it as much, but solo pre 50 and into the 50's it is noticable and annoying. Once I hit 52 I was wishing I was a barbarian. <br />
<br />
But that's just me and I didn't get a lot of play time back then, so I wanted to level fast as I could when I did get to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">What LaughingWoman said is correct.  A ways back they removed all class penalties, but they said they were not going to remove the bonuses from certain classes (didn't want to nerf some while providing a benefit to others I guess).  Barb is 5% (large race, slam), Ogre 15% (slam, front. immune), Troll(slam, regen) and Iksar (ac bonus, regen) 20% each.  Hobbits get a 5% bonus.</div></div><hr />

OK, so by &quot;totally false&quot; you mean that the CLASS EXP penalties have been removed but you believe that the 5% CLASS EXP bonuses for the warriors and rogues are still in effect.  Well, since the posts you reference are over 3 years old, and Sony is notorious for making no notice changes, I would like to see something a bit more current that states that those two classes still have CLASS EXP bonuses.  Not being stubborn, it's just that it would go against everything Sony has said in the last few months about class balance.  Also, as soon as I find the posts and messages I referred to I will link them for you.<br />
<br />
However, I guess we do agree on the RACE EXP penalties and bonuses currently in game, and they are exactly as I stated.<br />

I appreciate the link to the source, however, I can't find any current info on class exp.  All the treads seem to go back to the old system when there were bonuses and penalties.  I would really appreciate it if you did find anything current there if you could post a link to it.  Thanks.<br />

You guys need to get off your butts and DISPROVE the class bonus and race penalties.  I'm all for requesting a link, but when you two are demanding 'current' proof or parses of something that is posted by SoE . . . that's a bit much.  Rather than demanding that the people nice enough to find links with official SoE/Verant responses start doing parses to prove them, how about you two get off your butts and go DISPROVE them?<br />
<br />
Honestly, guys, how about a little courtesy here!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Seriously, you don't need showeq for this.  *grin*<br />
<br />
The UI I regularly use shows exp in percent.  Find/buy a buddy, start a human druid and an assling druid - you'll find the assling levels 5% faster.  There's a reason why a lot of bot clerics (mine included) are hobbits.  It SURE ain't cuz I think they're cute....  That and hide is the bomb.<br />
<br />
Note, everyone gains AA at the same rate, which I think explains why a lot of people think that all exp modifiers were removed.  They just cease to matter at level 65 (until the next level-pushing expansion).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Saldaora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I can confirm the 5% difference between Barbarian and Human for sure.  In order to stay together my Human has to use 10% to aaxp about half the time to stay at the same level of exp as my wife's Barbarian.  So 5% penalty is spot on :)</div></div><hr />

Chutoi,<br />

If you read my last post I think you will find that I very respectfully stated that if anyone found any current info on this subject I would appreciate a link (almost my exact words).  I stated this after going to the link provided by someone else and unsuccessfully searching for any current relevant info.  I also am not saying that I am correct on this, I'm simply asking that anyone who may have current info on this share it with the rest of us, so we can all learn the truth.  I never demanded anything, or asked anyone to disprove my position.  Simply trying to get to the truth.  <br />
<br />
Since I two box, I will create a human war/rogue and a human pally and see if the war/rogue does level faster.  That is the only point on which I am unsure, if class bonuses still exist.  Even with the 3 year old Sony post I have read others (not from Sony) that are more current and claim otherwise.  I know what I read, however, the folks who posted that info my have been in error.  Therefore, I'll go ahead and test it for myself and post the results here over the next couple of days. <br />
<br />
So, how about you show a little courtesy and get off your butt and learn to comprehend and properly interpret what you read before you post a rant that adds no value to the conversation.<br />
