<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grizmonde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, I am an 11 shaman. What is the best way to get up those spell skills that are lagging behind? Is it better to cast the lowest level possible so you use the least mana or should you cast higher level spells as the greater difficulty should yeild faster gains.<br />
<br />
I have alter, evo and abj maxxed. Conjour is at 32 and div is a horrid 15. Thanks for the input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yep just find the spell with the lowest mana cost.. get a clarity.. and chain cast..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/nod<br />
<br />
Find a quiet, lag-free spot, preferably with something remotely interesting to look at, and chain cast the cheapest spell till oom.  Med.  Rinse, repeat.<br />
<br />
At your level they should go up fairly quick, so this won't be excruciating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grizmonde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks all. that is what I figured. Div is the one that just doesn't want to rasie up. I think I will have to make the trip to oasis and get good ol' flash o' light. cast that in battle and it should come up better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Don't waste your time in combat with Flash of Light.  Just find a safe place (any city zone you are friendly in) and cast either True North or Sense Animals.  They are both only 5 mana.  Cast them until you are maxed in your skill.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I found that I could raise Div faster by memming both sense animals and true north,  then I wouldn't have to wait for the spell I just cast to refresh, just cast the other as soon as the spell bar came up again.  Only save a second or two but if your casting 300 spells it adds up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">flash of light has such a fast cast time though.<br />
<br />
I just went to a nice, out of the way place and kept spamming myself with it over and over... or if you have a pet ... :)<br />
<br />
Either way it works fine.  Fido doesn't mind being nuked by burst of flame for Evocation either.<br />
<br />
Conjuration will ultimately take care of itself, but until then, lots of folks like free bread and water.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Load True North in spell slot 7<br />
Load Sense Animal in spell slot 8<br />
<br />
make a hotkey<br />
/pause 20,/cast 7<br />
/pause 20,/cast 8<br />
<br />
Adjust the pause command for the amount of time for those spells to refresh, 20 = 2 seconds.<br />
<br />
You can just mash on that button &amp; cast those 2 spells over &amp; over when you want to increase divination.  My wizard is currently doing something similar to keep Abjuration (fizzled too many times trying to cast greater shielding) and Conjuration (familier) on a similar scale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grimthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You can also cast on corpses if the spell demands a target (like burst of flame).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">one other skill to keep up is abjuration.  Inner fire is agreat spell for that.  Nothing worse then having to resist buff a whole raid with jacinth and shadoo and fizzle away half your mana.  Or giving up on the rage line because you fizzle 5 times each time you try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I did what Taladaen did, a macro for casting true north over and over... only it was more like<br />
<br />
/stand<br />
/pause 20, cast 4<br />
/pause 20, cast 4<br />
/pause 20, cast 4<br />
/pause 60, sit<br />
<br />
So every 6 seconds I'd sit and med for a tick, then I'd stand and recast. I'd hit this whenever I was waiting for a spire, for a raid to start, waiting for someone to meet me, etc etc.... I now have maxed div and abjuration (for some reason, abjuration was almost as bad as div to raise).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">ive had to max abjure that way id ususally cani down to near no hp's in a safe place and chain cast inner fire on me it worked fine repeated if needed  till i started going into the raid scene then id just use rage for my ac and skill ups that went slow but im maxed</div></div><hr />
