<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ioki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been reading these boards for a couple of days because I am going to start a shammy. I have read on other boards about battle shammys and casting shammys. I want to play a good races. ( Semi-retiring my Troll SK). So that leaves Barbs and Cats.<br />
What are you guys thoughts about Casting or battle shammys. And about my races choices. Just do not want to make any stupid decisions. Thanks for any insight before hand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krytog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">it all boils down to your play style. only you know that...<br />
<br />
However, you will probably do a mix depending on what your doing...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Honestly, they are one in the same.  Why you ask?<br />
<br />
<br />
1) You have X mana.  To recover X mana you need to be able to cannabalize.  Don't get me wrong a good wis base is nice (currently I'm at 201 but will be going down to 187 to add 14ac 165 hp and 25 mana) but you regen at the same speed from 201 that you do from 187.  So, to keep said base up, you need the HP to cannabalize from.  If your getting the snot pounded out of you you will have less HP to cannabalize from as well, further lowereing your effective mana base as well as your mana regen.<br />
<br />
2) More you get pounded on resists, the more your interrupted.  You can be FOM, still wont matter if you can't get a slow off.<br />
<br />
3) If you set up a cannabalize key to the minimum pause, hasted, you get off 2 swings.  Very nice to add 100 damage while cannabalizing (this just adding to the &quot;combat&quot; thing and a reason to max piercing/1hb/2hb)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now if all you want to do is root and rot, then yes, a larger mana base is probably in order.  Though if all you want to do is be a druid with dots which break their root.... ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck to you in whatever you do man and have FUN doing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">For me the difference between battle shaman and Caster shaman is what makes us unique.   If you are a Caster shaman, you essentially, root - rott.  This is something another class can do better plus they can quad kite, plus they can port (have you guessed what class that is...?)<br />
<br />
Battle shaman on the other hand are something that is unique to the shaman class.  Standing Toe to Toe with most mobs, dishing out and being able to take it makes this way very, very exiting.<br />
Just remember what a wise old sage on this board once said,<br />
<br />
&quot;it's not important how much mana you have, it's how fast you can get it back, that counts&quot;<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
&quot;show me a shaman that died Full Mana, and i'll show you a druid pretending to be a shaman&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm not sure those distinctions exist in the same way they once did.  If your concerned with bipolar gear strategies then the one you want to look at is the AC/HP shaman vs the WIS shaman.<br />
<br />
Depending on how you want to play your game, arguably the best combos for the 2 stragegies are troll for the AC/HP shaman and barbarian for the wis, maybe a kitty.  Personally, I prefer to try and find a comprimise between the 2 and I play a cookiecutter barbarian.  IMHO going one way or the other to any extreme opens you up to weaknesses.  Post 51, you'll have an easier go of it if you choose the AC/HP shaman as you stand a better chance against summoning mobs.<br />
<br />
If you're more concerned with melee vs. non-melee.  Most shamans love using melee but don't melee unless they solo.  Without the proper gear you just can't solo effectively enough to benefit a group or raid as well.<br />
<br />
edited for an incomplete sentence ...spelling still sucks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A battle shaman doesn't necessarily mean you're tanking mobs, or sitting there meleeing.  Some of you refer to battle shamans being only useful when soloing.  No matter how much they fix slow, it will always generate alot of aggro.  Slow is used more in groups/raids than anything.  You can get aggro from things for slowing, and take a beating, without needing someone to chain heal on you.  Try doing that with a druid, and/or a casting shammy (same thing).  My shaman's 49 currently, and I have a 53 druid, with standard druid equipment.  I'm fighting bloodgills currently, and I can sit there and JBB blast them unslowed/unrooted and channel through it 90% of the time, without losing more than 1 bub of life.  I've been doin this from lvl 45.  My druid on the other hand, has to heal himself if that same bloodgill got like 5 seconds of melee'n on him.  <br />
<br />
Before my upgrades I had decent ac, **** wis, but was never out of mana.  Unless you're doin group focus and ****, as a shaman you shouldn't have a problem with a smaller mana pool.  As you get higher in level your mana pool will get bigger. <br />
<br />
Like everyone said, if you want to play the root/rot shammy, make a druid.  You'll get ports/DS, and phat AE's.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I like grouping and rarely solo, but I have followed the advice of others on this board to work on defense skill and emphasize AC/HP even as a &quot;caster shammy.&quot;  However, there are so many useful things for a shammy to spend mana on in a group, I find I am always OOM trying to canni back enough for one more slow, haste, chloro or whatever.  I have never been able to understand how battle shammies can intentionally melee in a constant pull exp group and still keep up with their normal responsibilities to the group.  Maybe if you have both a cleric and a chanter, you could justify some melee, but otherwise it seems to me that you short the group on our most valuable contributions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">generally I only melee while soloing...<br />
<br />
how is it that you are always OOM?   are you usually the only healer, or are you grouping with a bunch of people that ask for str/agi/dex/sta/cha/regen/haste buffs all the time?    ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I find I'm constantly low on mana when I'm the only healer.

Hasted, the Shammy epic gets 2 swings in between the casting recycle.  This is the only time I melee.  Though I cann a LOT.<br />
<br />
You sit, you can't cann (please don't give me the &quot;get a horse answer&quot; as this is not the situation I'm referring to)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Who says you have to choose?<br />
<br />
At 35 my shaman has 870ish hp, 756ac, and 184 wis, unbuffed.  Gear isnt anything special, seb scale, ac/hp rings, etc. Tanks better than most hybrids when he needs to.<br />
<br />
Just pick and choose your slots wisely, you can have it all!</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I try to keep all the melees fully buffed, which could be cut way back to save mana.  If there is a chanter on board, clarity plus no haste duties means mana is usually not a problem.  But with no chanter, it seems like haste and major stat buffs on the melees and slowing the mobs keeps me pretty low on mana most of the time.<br />
<br />
I haven't tried Lunasombras trick of melee while canni, but I wonder don't you get whacked alot when you sit down in melee range of the mob you just slowed?</div></div><hr />

<br />
canni...not cannidancing.  You don't sit.  Basically, the mob isn't able to do enough damage to keep up with your regen, and you end up with MORE health than when you start the fight.  <br />
<br />
I canni/melee with Underbulks in Echo Cave.  After slow sticks, they usually don't do enough damage to keep up with my regen (Chloro + Iksar BP + bearform + Ogre = 17pts per tick).  If a fight is going well I'll canni in between swings, or at least back off to let dogdog tank, then canni 3 or 4 times real quick and jump back in.</div></div><hr />

If there is no cleric and no chanter, I used to tell the party &quot;I can haste and heal, haste and slow, or slow and heal.  Which two would you prefer?&quot;  I don't remember any group ever choosing anything but slow and heal.  As far as buffing melees goes, noone but the main tank really needs anything other than strength and billy (and dex if they ask), as they usually arent getting hit.  MT gets AC, str, agi.  Everyone asks for sta, but since shaman don't have complete heal, it's kind of pointless.<br />
<br />
I haven't tried Lunasombras trick of melee while canni, but I wonder don't you get whacked alot when you sit down in melee range of the mob you just slowed? What snapdragn said.  Also, if you aren't RIGHT on top of the mob, what you can do is slow, whack it a few times, then wait for it to complete its next swing at the tank and then sit.  Right next to it is fine, it won't be swinging for a few seconds.  If it pivots to face you, stand back up and wait a little longer.  If you've waited long enough it won't even look at you, and you can go about the business of cannidancing right there, just make sure you aren't in the melees way.  I actually find that this works better than trying to med away from the fight because even if I do draw aggro when I sit, the mob stays where it is.  Ping-pong=bad.</div></div><hr />

We believe in high AC/HP/Resists, we get smacked around freely and sometimes intentionally, and yet we don't really melee.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Flufy makes a good point.  Don't med/cann-dance right after you slow.  If you draw aggro your tanks will hate you, not because you draw aggro, but because those lazy bastards now have to chase the mob.<br />
<br />
Typically in a zone like OS or HS where the mob has a lifespan shorter than michael jackson's private parts, I move into melee range slow, then Cann (standing cann), JBB, Cann, JBB ... till dead.  In a slightly longer fight I'll toss in a second spell, dot, debuff, epic, whatever.  I rarely med or cannidance anymore unless I solo.</div></div><hr />

A Battle Shaman is a  Caster Shaman<br />
A Caster Shaman is not a Battle Shaman<br />
<br />
Everyone that posted above me has given you sound advice.  If you can get wis without giving up AC or HP, then do so.  I have collected a suit of druid gear (7 wis rings, gatorscale legs, ulthork arms, 10 wis book, split paw gloves, etc) that i use exclusively for tradeskills.   All other times I am dressed as a shaman should be (Totemic/JB armor everywhere I can afford it)!  :D <br />
<br />
When grouped as the only healer, my only concession to wis is to swap out my 2HB for my Spine Chill Spear and Shield of Falsehood.  Ironically, both AC and wis go up!<br />
<br />
Your road is going to be rough until you get to 24 (regen and cannibalize and a good poison dot), but still not a cake walk.  It gets better again at 29 (first good slow, quickness spell, Gr Heal, and form of the bear) (I use Bear Form religously, 5 wis at lvl 30 gives 30 mana-1 more root  ;)  unless I'm fighting caster mobs, then I dont use it becasue I need to slam).  The road really smooths out once you get 34 (pet and good disease dot).<br />
<br />
Level 34 is when a Shaman begins to fully come into his or her own as a class.  I'm still basking in the warm glow at 38!  :p <br />
<br />
I absolutley can't wait for 39  (choloplast-regen at 10/tick, awesome new poison dot, and better slow spell)!  My downtime will be cut in half!<br />
<br />
Last weekend I was grouped with a bard, ranger, enchanter.  we tried having the ranger pull, but she was too slow, and way too conservative.  I ended up pulling and tanking ulthorks (the ranger eventually would get aggro back though) for about an hour before the group spilt up.  As soon as the ulthork turned to run (or just stand there snared) I quickly canni-danced up to 80m, and ran out to pull again before the first was dead.<br />
<br />
Part of this weekend I went into the City of Mist with a 60 Monk and a 56 Ranger.  Too bad I couldn't get XP with that group!   :mad:   Anyhow I healed both of them for about an hour, never going oom, and never needing a med break!  What a blast!<br />
<br />
Part of what I love about being a Shaman is that there is always something for us to do!  Melees really appreciate us when they see us eating our own HP to canni enough mana for one more heal that keeps them alive, 30 seconds after we call OOM!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Very good points above on Melee/Canni tactics.  So the tradeoff becomes giving up whatever benefit cannidancing would provide over standing canni, in exchange for the damage you can do (and skill practice) in melee.  If you can pull off Flufy's tactic, the period of time when you are giving up cannidancing would be pretty short, otherwise it would be standing canni though the whole fight.<br />
<br />
In order to make this tradeoff pay, I assume you want to buff yourself up offensively like you were soloing, which adds to the cost of the tradeoff.  So it would seem like to make this tradeoff pay, you want to have a serious damage dealing weapon, and maxed offense and weapon skill for the weapon.  Guess that is part of the &quot;battle shammy&quot; spec.<br />
<br />
I dish out only about 26 damage max with my howling harpoon main weapon, so to me it seems like the damage I add in melee is trivial compared to the real melee characters.<br />

<br />
a shammy is never oom as long as he/she has HP :)<br />
<br />
and ive cannid down to 50HP just to save my tank...the mob kinda turned on me, but w/ sow i out ran it while the melees got it to the flee stage.  There was a healthy bit of downtime after that, but it was fun, and worth it :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Also Korman, 29-33 is just as bad as 0-24 :( I know, ive been stuck at 33 for awhile, but alot of that time was travel, i had forgotten scourge in EF, and then couldnt find a port, so i had to run to NK spires, then through DL to get back where i was :( (i had foolishly bound myself at EF cause some loser said he had the glacier bear on track, and he was lying.  that bastard =\)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, melee shammy is soooo much more fun =-) and its good to be able tomelee for soloing, because alot of shammy soloin is tanking the slowed mobs after all.<br />
<br />
<br />
oh yeah...Roxxanne, try buffing your STR up abit, your damage should increase.  I used to hit for 20 max w/ my spinechill, but i got a 50 something shammy to str buff me while soloing one day, and i hit for a considerable amount more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I dish out only about 26 damage max with my howling harpoon main weapon<br />
I can hit for 46 or so with a Centi Warhammer...when I'm using a Howling Harpoon I can hit 35 or more.<br />
<br />
Str is 214 self buffed, lvl 45.</div></div><hr />
