This was posted recently on Graffe's:<br />
<br />
Before anyone starts thinking that we're changing what spells will do, I'd recommend making sure to check with someone who's used them on test. <br />
<br />
We're doing some reworking of the resist system, and we're translating some existing spells to fit how the system now works. <br />
<br />
As for the 8th shawl -- Parsing doesn't give the whole story. Before just looking at that one effect and assuming something bad happened, it might be worth it to ask someone on test to examine their shawl and find out what other cool things happened to it, and items in general. <br />
<br />
I promise, the fact that this is a major improvement will be obvious to anyone who inspects one. :) <br />

Later a player made this announcement:<br />
<br />
..On Test..I looked at my 8th shawl and I found that it now reads: <br />
<br />
Effect: Flowing Thought III <br />
Focus Effect: Zephyr of Brell<br />
<br />
The major improvement is obviously that items can now have both a Focus Effect and a Normal Effect.<br />
<br />
Zephyr of Brell has been changed to no longer have a Flowing Thought effect, however the overall changes to the item now mean that it provides 1 extra mana per tick and 5% longer duration enhancement on beneficial spells 48 seconds or more in duration (excluding CH and Invuln.spells).<br />
<br />
The change to the item system does mean however that we can hope to see some very impressive high end items in the future.  More details on the revised resist system have not yet been announced.<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
Makes all the time it took a bit less painful with the ODS effect being put out around the same time=p<br />

+ <br />
20% to buff duration instead of 15%</div></div><hr />

and 100hps while your at it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ahpok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">5% or 20% ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sindaor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">5% longer than before, making it a 20% bonus on benificial buffs duration.<br />
I hope they will change the effect so that it affects the group buffs too...</div></div><hr />
