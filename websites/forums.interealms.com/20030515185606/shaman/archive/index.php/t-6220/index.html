<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KrintixXaneris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There is a little issue that has always somewhat bothered me regarding shamen velious quest armor effects versus other wisdom caster velious armor effects.  To illustrate my point I won't even go into the lesser armor pieces, I only want to discuss the respective breastplate effects.<br />
<br />
Universal velious quest/pog breastplate effects:<br />
<br />
Cleric: Mark of Karn, level 56, 125 mana<br />
<br />
Shaman: Rightous Health, level 54, 150 mana<br />
<br />
Druid: Regrowth of the Grove, level 58, 600 mana<br />
<br />
<br />
From mana cost of these spells, it would seem that clerics get the shaft, followed closely by shamen.  But, if one thinks about it, not only is the cleric BP effect a higher level spell, but a spell that must be cast once per mob, minimum, therefor creating a mana-conservation-over-casts kind of effect.  Now Druids, however, get a breastplate with an effect that replaces a GROUP effect spell costing 600 mana, an effect that must be recast every fifteen minutes.  Finally, shamen recieve on their breastplates an effect that replaces a 150 mana, single target spell that lasts over an hour.  Doing a little math by reasoning, who's left behind here?  Logically, all the breastplates have very equivalent stats (disregarding druid's cause, hey, its leather), so why not have logically equally useful effects?<br />
<br />
Obviously this subject is a little behind the times, considering that the armor sets in question came out two expansions ago, but I think the point has validity as long as the armor is still in wide use, which it is.  Forgive me if i'm bringing up an old/dead subject already discussed here, I just wanted to hear what anyone else might think about this . . . inequality?  Heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">99% of our click effects are cheesy and pretty useless.  It's the price we pay for the JBB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This is kinda going on assumptions but....<br />
<br />
I remeber when group buffs did not do as much as the single target buffs.  This being said we had talisaman of the brute since kunark but untill post Luclin it was not giving the same stamina as Rioutous health.<br />
<br />
Assuming the above is true, i would say that our breastplate was very very very nice because having to cast a single target buff on everyone, or just all the melees for a 50+ person raid is very tedious and just plain annoying.  Therefore being able to do it right click and not use any mana this seems exceddling nice.<br />
<br />
I did not get into high end raiding till group buffs had been improved but if what i have heard is correct i would have been very happy with the right click.  I still carry around my thurg quest BP just for the clicky.  when people die on raids, which they do all to much its one less spell to have to mem and cast. <br />
<br />
Why are we always having to compare ourselves to others and make it sound like we are getting the shaft on everything....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Pre Talis of the brute being useful, our right click was great since it was one of our core buffs, the cleric bp click is also somewhat nice since the actual mark of karn spell is quite rare.  The druid BP definately comes out on top though, free group regrowth = damned nice =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KrintixXaneris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's the price we pay for the JBB.<br />
<br />
I have scales.  No clicking for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">One factor in the relative values of the Druid and Shaman right clicks that you are overlooking:<br />
<br />
Right-clicks can't be /tgb'd... The druid BP can only be used to buff their own group. The shaman BP can be used to (very slowly) do a whole raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Indeed, a druid could theoretically hop round all the groups and get everyone with group regrowth in about the same time it would take us to do an entire raid with bp sta though =P<br />
<br />
Hence Talis of the brute making it redundant now =)</div></div><hr />
