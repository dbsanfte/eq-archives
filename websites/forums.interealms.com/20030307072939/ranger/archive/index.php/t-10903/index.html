<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>nekoken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'll be the first to admit it would be mighty convenient to have the ability to self port.  However, we don't need 'em.  We are rangers, not magic loving port monkeys who instantly get to where we are going.  To be a ranger is to range.  That means casting a SoW and getting there on your own two feet.  You don't even have to wait for a broken boat nowadays since you can use the spires to get to any continent.  Heck, we've already got ports via the spires, thurgadin gate potion, and sundry other port mechanisms usable by all.<br />
<br />
Anyone that thinks they deserve more port spells than the things we've already got should get 10 points knocked off of Defense and 20 off of Attack for each port spell.  We are a melee hybrid, not a magic hybrid.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Eoghan Blaidd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They should SELL port stones on the scions, buy a stone for 10 or 20 pp, and port the instant you step on the pad, NOT some inordinate gawdawful long time later.<br />
<br />
And ummm..... I HATE THE VELIOUS SCION ! I keep porting to Tox instead of GD cause I keep my &quot;others spells&quot; off for raids, its a crapshoot when I sit on that portal and wind up in Tox waiting to get back to try again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I like the idea of buying a port stone so you don't have to wait for the spires...I seem to be really good at getting to them right after they launch so I have constant 15 minute waits =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gavving</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well it could be worse....<br />
<br />
Remember when you actually had to /gasp ride the boat /gasp?<br />
<br />
Or /gasp, hoof it across 5 zones because you couldn't get a port?<br />
<br />
Or when the only way to get to Thurg was to take the boat from NRo, and run across all the zones to get your GD ring tooth...<br />
<br />
Well anyway, bitch if you want about the spires, but it's still WAY better than it used to be.  <br />
<br />
As for people who bitch about wanting Rangers to have 'class defining' ports.  Geeze, whatever.  I'm a chain wearing, nuking, arrow shooting, lightning blades wielding, melee badass - NOT a druid!<br />
<br />
I need ports like I need a hole in the head.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wwen Valimar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Damn skippy. Crap, I had to wait 30 minutes for the boat and then walk. *shudder*</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Telloran Treehugger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think the &quot;best&quot; thing about having to use the boat between BB and FP was going LD and wondering where the hell you were when you logged back in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>hebuorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">oh also way back in when you where taking the boat and zoning faster or slower than the boat and ended up swimming all the way to an island and unfortunately taking the boat back to where you  where comming ...i did once that 3 times in a row  got really  mad t miself hehehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Canson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well I think Rangers should get self ports, maybe I am the exception but SK's get fear and summon, Pallies get rezzes, Bards (if you look at them as a hybrid or not) get mez and charm. Rangers should get ports, as Pathfinders and such to use them to break new zones etc I think it would really define the class more if we had this ability.<br />
<br />
As it is when I need to go somewhere new with no clue how to get out I always take my druid.<br />
<br />
Just my opinion<br />

hehe, best thing ever said in this forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>jcdew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">After reading all the posts and seeing different views,plus doing some deep thinking on ports I agree that Rangers shouldn't have them. But one thing I think we should have is lesser succor. Even just a self only wouldn't be too bad in my opinion, but of course a group one would be even peachier. The old ways are a thing of the past, with all the changes to ALL the classes there is no such thing as a &quot; blah fits into this catagory&quot;.<br />
I dont think Rangers need ports but I also dont think Paladins should get LOH,Rezzes or SK's HT,etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Monk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think it would be great to self port but I don't think it is something that we have to have. In fact if given a choice I would choose more powerfull dots and nukes and hate reduction spells earlier in the game long before I would choose to port. Sure I may take more time then a druid to get somewhere but I'm still glad I can sow. I am used to running by this point in life. If given the choice I would gladly decline ports in favor of more dots that would allow us to solo more things rather then bieng able to travel more easliy from one place to another.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'd like an easier way to work up conjuration than sitting in Northern Ro one night blowing my Mana Bar on Dance of the Fireflies 20 times. Albeit my Conjuration is now 190, so I don't need it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dedolito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">No ports.  I'm not a wannabe druid.<br />
<br />
What I would like is an upgrade to the Feet Like Cat spell and some sort of nominal self dex buff.  More frequent or more damage on the self weapon buffs would be nice too, but then it is already right on the boarderline of generating too much agro =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>jcdew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Remember, Rangers are the only Hybrid that doesn't get spells correctly according to parents spells. To ask for anything like that would just be silly. lol</div></div><hr />

I have a gate to OT hammer<br />

and '<br />
<br />
can make port to thurg potions<br />
<br />
some day i'll get the port to fay bp *shrug* <br />
<br />
now with the PoP ports it's not like it matters</div></div><hr />

<br />
And to be a ranger who ranges in Plane of Growth is to be stuck there.<br />
<br />
Gogo ranger ports!   I want 'em.<br />
<br />
Honestly, nobody needs ports now that PoP's out.   Why the hell not give us a gate spell or something to get out of our own plane?  (For Tunare rangers, that is - but Karana rangers should get it too)<br />
