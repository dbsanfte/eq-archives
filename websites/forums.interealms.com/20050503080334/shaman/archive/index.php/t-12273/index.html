<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hail All!!<br />
First off, how's everyone doing?  I want to thank everyone for reading this, and telling me what you think. <br />
As stated in the title, this was my first raid, so I'm not sure if my experiance was normal or not.  I went on an open Naggy raid (sponsored by one of the local Guilds), we met at the druid rings in lavastorm at 9:00 pm (est), I didn't get back to the Nexus untill 1:30 am.  There were 46 peeps on the raid, and the average level was 49. <br />
I'm going to break up my experiance into pros and cons:<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
- It was really neat to finally see a Dragon, and participate in its death (even though I died also)(thank god for 90% res!)<br />
- I learned quite a bit about what NOT to do, and what to do (heheeh)<br />
- I have a new appreciation for the need for a dedicated MT, and to NOT attack/cast until told to do so! (see above for heheheh)<br />
- Found that I REALLY, REALLY need to go get those resist spell upgrades, the ones I thought weren't worth buying!!<br />
- and doing this with a few friends was a nice thing too<br />
- it was cool seeing new spells (to me) being cast<br />
<br />
Ok, so you can see that the Pros were mostly for learning the ropes, which is a good thing.<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
- Seemed very long, for very little action.<br />
- with so many peeps, when there was action, I saw/participated in very little of it.<br />
- no experiance<br />
- no loot (this part I sorta expected)<br />
- I had a VERY hard time tageting my group members durring final battle (due to lag) (I turned the particles off so that helped some)<br />
- Naggy only dropped a scroll (with 5 healing charges on it), and dropped 3 druid only staves, THE SAME ONE 3 TIMES!!)<br />
<br />
OK, I hope this doesn't sound like a rant against raiding, or the peeps who organized the raid.  I respect them for the time and dedication that went into leading it.  It seemed well run (they seemed to know what they were doing), but wow, there was a TON of waiting around.  Also, I now have a great appreciation for comments made about Buffing HELL!!<br />
<br />
My qusetion is.. Did we really need that many? I realise that this was an open raid, heck if it wasn't, I wouldn't have been able to go either) so I am NOT complaining.  I just wonder if other, smaller raids would be more fun (as well profittable).  As said before, I am not (or hopefully will ever be) a ranter.  I'm just trying to get some insight from the more experianced raiders here.  <br />
<br />
Thanks for reading this..<br />
And sorry for the typo's...</div></div><hr />

Either way you're probably dead by now.  You watch as the mob is being killed in the raid channel.  WOOT, dead dragon.  Get a rez.  Buff everybody again.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Good lord, you hadn't bought your resist spells?  <br />
<br />
Anyway, yes, you should always get your spells.  All of them.  Especially crucial ones like resists.  Of course, on most raids druids and enchanters are taking care of that, but you should still have them.  <br />
<br />
Yes, your experience sounds pretty typical of pickup Naggy raids.  <br />
<br />
For targeting groupmates, you sound as if you were trying to click on their avatars.  This is a bad idea.  Just use F2 through F6 to target groupmates.  It's much faster.  And F1 for yourself.  <br />
<br />
Running an open raid is a horror show.  Don't knock how it's run until you try running one.  You just got to ride the wave, and all the people who act like complete imbeciles.  If you got time on your hands, they are actually kind of fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bukbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Congrats on you first raid.  I have never been on a Naggy or Vox raid and now I'm too old to do them.  It sounds like you got the basic idea of what raids are like.  They are generally kind of slow to start and the action doesn't last very long.  However teamwork is very important, and you learned that.  <br />
<br />
There was one sentence that led me to believe you didn't know about on thing you can do for targetting group members.  So here is a tip I have for you.  Targetting group member can be done at the touch of a key.  The F keys (F1, F2, etc...) are also mapped to the members in your group.  F1 will be yourself, and you can hit it multiple times to cycle between yourself and your pet.  F2 will be the first person listed in your group box, F3 will be the second and so on with F6 key being the last person in your group.<br />
<br />
Congrats on taking down Naggy!  I've been playing EQ for near 4 years now and never accomplished it.  You definitely have something to be proud of.<br />

<br />
Gear also has a lot to do with how many people you need.  If the raid is average level 49 mains then you did it with the right amount.  If they are highly twinked you can get away with fewer.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks Guys,<br />
I really appreciate the responses.  I am glad that i went, and learned all that I did.  Nothing is better than doing it for real (as far as reinforcing the things I have read here).<br />
Gart, I'm not sure if I missinterpereted what you said, but I am definetly NOT knocking the leaders of the raid.  I realize that they put in alot of time and effort, and the raid was successful.  I was just wordering about other raid possibilities.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My answer to your main question is yes and no.  Yes, most raids are like that.  99% organizing and waiting around.  No, they don't HAVE to be like that.  If you're willing to take down smaller mobs more slowly, you can join a guild that tries to keep its numbers down and kill mobs with tactics and skill rather than what you've already experienced - called &quot;zerging&quot;.  Of course, open raids are great, and they give folks a chance to learn the basics of raiding, the really important things that you'll remember for every raid you ever participate in - and most importantly, what kind of raiding you prefer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats probably the biggest factor in how fast a raid moves. Pickup raids are generally extremely slow, and unorganized. I say unorganized in the sense that there are typically people who have never done that type of event before, and really arent prepared for it at all. The more organization involved, the more prepared people are, and the quicker the raid moves. <br />
<br />
I gets seriously fun most of the time, however I wont lie and say that it cannot be extremely frustrating. It has its ups and downs, for me its being around my friends that plays the most part in the fun-factor, not wether or not we accomplish the goal we set out for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why is any raid with more than the minimum possible people automatically considered zerging.<br />
<br />
From what he posted it sounded like a fairly well run and typical open raid. From the sounds of things they had a main tank with a heal chain probably and you standard strategies for the mob.<br />
<br />
While it might be possible to kill nagafen with 2 or 3 groups of lvl 52 twinks that doesn't mean 48 normal people averaging level 49 is a zerg force.<br />
<br />
But to echo what others have said it largely depends on the situation. If you've got a smaller group of people with higher levels and more aa's and better gear you can typically do things with less people, easier and quicker. Especially after you've done it a few times. It's really easy to do something when you've only got 24 people and they all know the plan already and don't have to be told every step of the way what to do.<br />
<br />
The smaller force is not with out it's drawbacks tho. There is usually less margin for error and each person is more important so if one person has to go or can't make it on that day it hurts more than if you usually have 48 people rather than 24.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">To be perfectly honest, Shandrillar, yes, that's a pretty typical raid for the situation you were in.  Some of the earlier posters hit the nail on the head.  The speed and effectiveness of a raid is dependent on how well you know each other, and how comfortable you are with each other's ability.  The cons you mentioned are things you will run into on every single raid until you find a raiding guild of your own that you like and merge into it.  The chances of you getting loot on an open raid are very slim.  Experience is abysmal, even with the raid feature.  It will be long and slow unless you have a core of experienced raiders that can move things along quickly.  <br />
<br />
As for the lag issue, there are several things you can do.  There is a file in the eq folder than I believe is datarate.txt.  I forget the default, but I believe it's 4.0.  If you have DSL or cable, I believe you can go to 9.0.  If you have a good and very stable phoneline modem, you can probably go to 6.  If you are at 6 and you keep going LD, you can lower it to 5 or so.  I believe that effects the speed of the packets of information sent, so that can SUBSTANTIALLY reduce lag.  Some other methods you can use to reduce lag are the following.  Turn all new models off except your own (for me, male iksar) and horses (if you have one).  If you don't have a horse, turn all the models off for raids.  Also, I recommend you use /shownames 1.  That reduces everyone to first names only.  You can experiment with /shownames 0-4.  Zero is no names at all, 4 is full names, titles, guild.  If your graphics card doesn't have to move the full name over every character, that will help.  As you noted, turning off spell effects will help a lot.  Also go into options and turn off particle effects and make them 0% opaque.  That helps a lot too.  Turn your clip plane to 0.  Set up your filters to only show bard songs and spells in group and if an NPC is attacking you.  Turn off critical hits and spells.  Turn off others hits and misses.<br />
<br />
Those options will substantially reduce lag.  In some cases nothing you do will help.<br />
<br />
One other tip that has proven very effective for me is to reload your user interface.  When you are lagging, sometimes reloading will help.  I don't know what buffer it is that fills up, but this has worked pretty consistently for me.  If you use the default interface, type /load default 1<br />
<br />
If you find a guild that you like, you can really improve your raiding experience.  I'd have quit long ago without raids.  Frankly, I'd argue that you are getting to the stage where EQ will start to lose some of its fun if you don't raid.  That's a personal judgement call, of course.<br />
<br />
Most of the good loot is off raid mobs.  If you like new toys, you have to raid.  My personal reason for liking to raid is just the juggling part.  Trying to figure out the speed of heal chains, the dps needed, the mana required for the raids, parsing the damage of the mobs, agro management (some mobs stun/mem blur), etc.   There are a lot of things to learn in running a raid, especially on new encounters.  As you get in a more experienced guild, the heal chains will be set up automatically, and the clerics will often have 2 or 3 hotkeys for different speed chains.  The shaman will know who is doing what and when.  As you get more experienced, you'll find you spend a lot more time waiting on mobs to path to the right spot, or more time travelling to the spots than you do just sitting around trying to get organized.  Higher levels and Mass Group Buff abilities do wonders for speeding up raids.<br />
<br />
You're at a fun point.  You have lots to learn, and will probably enjoy doing it.  Gonna be some frustrations, but don't give up.  Being a part of a team and watching those huge mobs fall is a lot of fun!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Oh yeah.  Forgot one other thing.  The better you work with each other, the less people you need.  Obviously some of that depends on equipment and other factors, but a really solid crew can do some amazing things with small people.  We've had a single group take down Greig, for instance, and it used to take an entire raid.  Similar things can be done with a lot of boss mobs now, with level 65 now available.<br />
<br />
2 groups of level 52 characters can probably take down naggy or vox if they are chosen carefully.  You can imagine it's a lot more exciting with 12 people than 40+ :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Pickup raids are horrible.  90% of people don't listen to what they're told to do - the other 10% listen only to find out what they're not supposed to do, so that they can go do it and be &quot;cool&quot;.  The only thing worse than attending a pickup raid is leading one.<br />
- I learned quite a bit about what NOT to do, and what to do (heheeh)<br />
- I have a new appreciation for the need for a dedicated MT, and to NOT attack/cast until told to do so! (see above for heheheh)<br />
Please don't be &quot;that guy&quot;.  &quot;That guy&quot; is infamous for ruining entire raids by not knowing what he's doing.  &quot;That guy&quot; played a cleric on one of my vox raids, we got her to 2% before wiping.  We would have won if &quot;that guy&quot; didn't go afk at the beginning of the fight.  &quot;That guy&quot; also played a monk on a Gorenaire raid I thought I'd attend.. I knew better.. but the lure of torpor called... Anyway &quot;that guy&quot; was told not to get near Gore, but he just had to look.. aggro'd her and pulled her to where we were gathering, and the ae killed everyone (about 15 people had showed so far).  Sorry if it sounds harsh, but people who don't listen are the main reason pickup raids suck.  Judging by your above quote, you're not helping the situation any :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">- with so many peeps, when there was action, I saw/participated in very little of it.<br />
<br />
I hate to say this but for us shamans, that really doesn't change too much, especially not soon for you. In my experience taking out one tough baddy is done by 3 character types. Clerics, Melees, and Nukers.<br />
<br />
The objective of a raid is to do immense damage to the target as quickly as possible and have nobody die. Nukers and melees cover the former, Clerics cover the latter. Even as the highest level shaman on a raid, your job is 1) buff everyone before the fight and 2) slow the mob. After that you really dont do much. You try to spend the mana you have left on damage (through dots or nukes) and patch heals (which really do nothing when a good CH wheel is in place. As a shaman of a lower level you basically have no job whatsoever except for covering the lower level buffs and again patch heals and damage.<br />
<br />
However when a raid must fight through crowds of mobs to reach their target, then your job becomes a little more defined, especially after level 58. Your Tirgirs insects along with enchanter AE Mez are one of the essential things for fighting through hordes of mobs. Slow becomes more of an active job when action becomes more speedy.<br />
<br />
But to be honest although the shaman's job in raids is without a doubt essential, it's kind of boring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hail<br />
<br />
I always hear people mention things like &quot;hosted by one of the local guilds&quot;  What exactly is a non local guild?<br />
<br />
Anyways, more on topic.  Congrats on the dragon.  I would say all players should have to go through a pickup raid on vox or naggy, just to see what its like.  They are great fun, especially when you spend lots of time preparing, and then wipe at the end because some bozo screwed up.  Just don't take it to seriously, and enjoy the sheer humor in the situation.  This will eventually give you a better appreciation of your guilds raids later in the game.  When you think things are going bad, you can always look back on your old vox/naggy pickup days and realise that maybe its not that bad after all.<br />
<br />
And go buy all your spells please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hail all,<br />
Thanks for all of the great advise, they are just annother example of why this board is so great!<br />
I bought all my spells! <br />
Schpleef: Pretty harsh words bud. I DID NOT peek at anything, I DID NOT ignore the orders of my group or raid leader, and I certainly DID NOT cause a wipe.  What happened was, I hit the assist key (for the MT) and accidentally started hitting the mob (a fire giant I believe).  It aggroed on me for a total of 3 hits. I was fine, and the MT pulled agro right back.  But it WAS a lesson for me, on what COULD have happened if it was the boss mob.<br />
I appreciate constructive feedback, not someone who assumes that becuse it was my first raid, I was a total screw-up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I led an open raid last week on Chardok royals.  It went well even tho we had no FD puller . . I was the puller lol!  We AE stun locked mobs instead of splitting them.  I pulled trains and they got AEed.  We AEed the King and his guards, and that was fun.  Didn't attempt the queen cuz had mostly under lvl 60 people and nobody very uber cept for me and a pally from my guild.  <br />
<br />
The end was typical.  The snare class person forgot to snare for the umpteenth time despite my numerous threats that he SNARE GODDAMIT and a mob ran in and trained the Library on us and both groups died after the enchanters ran outta mana stun locking.  Fun stuff eh?  <br />
<br />
Point is, even the best run OPEN raid will usually be a disaster simply because the people are sub par.  <br />
<br />
However, I participated in an open Grummus raid recently that went reasonably well.  Most of the non guildies on the raid ended up dying and behaving badly, but Grummus died and we didn't wipe or anything.  I usually live thru boss fights these days.  I know how to live and have the hps to do so while doing my jobs.  I don't have to get bossmob aggro and I know how to avoid doing so.  SO if I die that usually means we wiped.  Unless it was one of those critical-to-slow mobs that I hate.  Rather have a slow immune mob that I just heal AE dmg . . .  I'm rather good at that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Just raid as much as possible and if you are one of the rare (?) people that primarily play to have fun remember to do that :-)<br />
<br />
I think I understand what Landragoran is saying about the raid that didnt quite work out but if all the people at the raid had the same level of equipment that he has and the same level and the same amount of AAs then they would probably have done better - but then on the other hand they wouldnt have been on that raid at all.<br />
<br />
The most difficult part about a raid is finding something to raid.<br />
<br />
The secondmost difficult part is successfully raiding something with a resonable number of people that dont have uber equipment (because almost anything worthwhile in EQ is balanced towards people with top-end equipment). One of the very rare good balancing decisions Verant made was to make Naggy and Vox banish people with a level &gt;52. I personally think that it would be great if they implemented a lot more like this - banish people with too many AAs/too many uber items.<br />
<br />
Good luck raiding!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well with that solution, its great for the young players and players in very uncapable, low end, or low level guilds.  And its fine for the top 1% of players who don't leave the elemental planes anyways. <br />
<br />
But what about the rest of the players in EQ who would like to exprience all of the content, but wont get a chance because by the time they manage to find the mob up, and have a force online, that force is to uber for the encounter.  They could have done it earlier, but the uber guilds were perma killing it, so they waited, and by the time they got a shot, its trivial for them because of levels and AA.<br />
<br />
Under your system, you have to be incredibly uber (ahead of the game, get there first) or incredibly casual (stay level 50 forever get no AA, and dont bother killing something until its 5 expansions old).<br />
Oh and then you have to convince your entire guild to stay casual, not to level, dont get equipment upgrades, dont get AA points.   Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">For targetting other groups for group buffs, or people in other groups for singles - /raidwindow.<br />
<br />
You can also see the class and level of who you're targetting - all without looking up.  If you have group spells to cast - you can easily target the groupleader, since the window tells you who the leader is.<br />
<br />
Yes - raids are all about finding a mob up, getting the raid there (quick - before some other guild notices), and pre-kill prepping.  The kill is generally trivial if the tactics are known and adhered to.  Loot distribution is almost always anti-climactic, since the majority of raiders don't get squat.</div></div><hr />
