<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Would it be possible to create a pinned thread in maybe the tactics area for which classes are best to duo/trio/bot with your shaman? Every couple of days it seems like someone else asks that question and people just repeat themselves.<br />
<br />
Or is there a specific forum logic to not creating pinned references for that sort of topic.  I guess maybe because there is no hard line/straight forward answer to the question so creating a pinned topic isnt a good idea.<br />
<br />
I dont know im just tired of seeing the same topics over and over. :(  Or maybe i just suck and this is spam, if so then ignore it! ^__^</div></div><hr />
