<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>spiritsofding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been looking at the subscriptions rates as advertised on the sony station website and they are rather alarming!!<br />
<br />
Take a standard 1 month sub for a uk player......website says u pay £9.49 per month.  Which is $16.15  per month.<br />
<br />
THe bastards ARE ripping off the non usa players.<br />
<br />
rember the fact that eu memebers are charged by the *******s in brussels tax for playing at 17.5%<br />
<br />
9.50 x 1.175 =  £11.16<br />
<br />
<br />
Plz go chk ur credit cards and see the exact figure you are being billed.<br />
<br />
Am sure i was charged 15 quid for i months worth.....will try and find the bill!!<br />
<br />
plz post here actual figures for a comaparison....<br />
<br />
erm present curency rates are..... £1 to $1.70  roughly.<br />
<br />
$12.95 = £7.65   they are chargng Ukplayers ~ £2 permonth for not being a yank........<br />
<br />
Theres also the matter of whether the vat is applied to the $amount or the converted currency......gonna find the customs and excise website for clarity.<br />
<br />
eg $12.95 x1.175= $15.22 /1.7 =  £8.95  per month<br />
<br />
OR ?<br />
<br />
  $12.95/1.7 =  £7.62 x 1.175 = £8.95  per month.<br />
<br />
Id guess its the second method ??<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>drzoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm not sure what's alarming, I get charged the following:<br />
<br />
$12.95 + 17.5% VAT = $15.61<br />
<br />
This comes to £8.64 on my CC bill ($15.61 at a rate of 1:1.7604).<br />
<br />
This all seems in line with the subscription costs outlinedhere (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/accounts_billing/ab_pricing.jsp).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Simply put, it's cheaper to be a SOE gamer than a UBISoft gamer. I dont know what's so suprising about it. EU publishers have been ripping us off with high prices and cut down releases for over 10 years now... (that $40 game... costs us £40, that $299 console, £299 - call it lazy conversions)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">£8.52 I last paid which really isn't bad. In a way, we have an advantage with the currency conversions. The Pound is quite strong currently. 1 pound can buy 1.8275 dollars.</div></div><hr />

Double check your statement. I work with a company that does billing internationally, and we bill strickly in USD. The credit card companies are the ones that do the conversions with our billings. It should tell you on your statement if that line item was billed in a different currency and the card company did the conversion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The problem is that SOE isn't doing the international billing, UbiSoft is.  The europeans end up paying a &quot;surcharge&quot; to UbiSoft for extra profit.  Or to put it another way, adding one more middleman can't DECREASE the cost, can it?</div></div><hr />
