<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">DO NOT CAST PANTHER (and I assume leopard) on a shadow knight.<br />
<br />
For whatever reason, shadow knights when proccing this spell currently end up proccing this bad devil:<br />
<br />
[Thu Mar 03 20:52:30 2005] Kkorsis growls with the spirit of the panther.<br />
[Thu Mar 03 20:53:38 2005] Kkorsis begins to cast a spell. &lt; Banish Intruder<br />
[Thu Mar 03 20:53:38 2005] Yar`Lir the Mistress of Winds Gates.<br />
<br />
Banish Intruder (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=6781&amp;source=Live) <br />
<br />
I was trying to maximize dps on Yar'lir in the final 10% of the fight so I hit every person that I could see with it.  Kkorsis is a shadow knight so I hit him.  He procced it the first time three seconds after I gave it to him with Yar'lir at 1%, thereby gating him and instantly putting Yar'lir back at 32%.  I was wondering how the named stayed at 32% for that long, and basically Kkorsis procced gate on him about 15 times<br />
<br />
I did use it on Kkorsis earlier in the fight and didn't realize it happeend earlier till some guildees mentioned that he was trying to gate around 75% too (when I put it on him the first time)<br />
<br />
Anyways, I suggest that you bug this and hopefully get a quick fix of it live.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Leopard works fine on Shadowknights, it's just an typo with Panther. (Since, if you look at lucy, Panther Maw SK is spell id #6780. Banish Intruder, the spell that Shadowknights are proccing, is id #6781. So they were one off.) :o</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ill keep you guys posted as soon as I hear anything . Thanks for pointing this out :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks Sayoz for the initial post on this!<br />
<br />
I hadn't logged into eq but was browsing these boards last night while patching, and I saw the note. When I got in game my guild was saying that they had ditched raids on Chailak, Feratha, and Velikotor (sp) as all had gated.... Velikotor was apparently gating in place and healing. They were all annoyed with the patch...<br />
<br />
I checked with the only shaman on for those raids and he had an SK in his group. Of course he had been keeping Panther up on him......<br />
<br />
They did a test on a mob after I brought this up to them and sure enough, it was the cause.<br />
<br />
So, thanks for the quick posting on here, it meant my guild could go back and maul some RS mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Wow, some bright, shining stars on that SK board...  QQ</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lolanon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well soon enough I will be able to catch bugs like this before they go live... but atm no shaman on test has panther, and I am the closest to it /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">just so you know.. i also posted this same thread to the eqlive forums.  It's located under the shaman section of it with the same title.<br />
<br />
Kytherea has stated there that she passed it to QA and it is slated to be fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shlob</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">LOL on TP server we were taking down the queen and we were on last princess we casted on one of out SK's and could not find out why it kept gating when it never happend before.....well one of the shamans mentioned that they read about it and we all laughed. was funny but sucked ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Airwhale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Just wanted to say that SoL was not sticking on an SK I was using it on last night... no crazy gate proc =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">it's only workin right now for panther.  leopard doesn't seem to be affected by it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Itzkul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I was watching the spell names in a group with spell awareness and when I can panther on pets or PC (Non SK) the spell name that procs is &quot;Panther Maw SK&quot; from my understand the SK makes it proc less. Have they already cut back on the procs some?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I see both &quot;Leopard Maw SK&quot; and &quot;Leopard Maw&quot; in my spam all the time when I cast leopard on the melees in my group, usually I'm grouping with an SK.<br />
<br />
they may have linked a similar problem with leopard on the SK's that we don't know. but that started popping up around the last patch with panther maw SK.<br />
<br />
in my experience, it isn't any more or less than normal leopard. take note that pets ALWAYs proc alot more than PCs when buffed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">also, from what the bards are telling me panther is causing issues with their mezing.  seems when they switch to mez a target panther needs to proc before it will let them mez...  i don't play a bard so i can't conferm this for myself, but the last two bards i have grouped with are SUPER insistant that i not cast panther on them due to the mez issue...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ah, all is right with the world.  Sk's okay but outdamaged by summoned pets, bards broken so deep they might never get out of it.  Whole situation gives a nice cuddly Velious feel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">This little bug wiped us in Inku'ta last night at the cursecaller cycle :(.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">When they did the last patch, they fixed leopard so that when it's cast on a SK it reads as &quot;Leopard Maw SK&quot; when procced so that the sks can use it (something to do with their coding).  But, when they went to do the same fix to panther, they misscoded it.  What this means is that instead of having an ID of 6779 for everyone but sk (Panther Maw (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spellraw.html?id=6779&amp;source=Live)) they input 6780 instead (Panther Maw SK (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spellraw.html?id=6780&amp;source=Live)) and for SKs instead of 6780, they imput 6781 (Banish Intruder (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spellraw.html?id=6781&amp;source=Live)).  This is why when everyone that you see proccing this, you see &quot;Panther Maw SK&quot; and when SKs have it on them, they proc &quot;Banish Intruder&quot; instead.  All that this really entitles is that to fix it, they just need to change the ID codes to one before.  Should be a simple fix I'd think, but I'm not exactly a programmer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Oh, and BTW.. every shaman should already know about this bug, as should every SK.  It's been identified by many and talked about by more, so there really shouldn't be any real surprises concerning this happening to people, unless you accidently cast it on the person involved, to which I've done out of habit a few times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tyck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Was it just me, or did this &quot;typo&quot; sound like something that could actually be put to good use in some encounters?<br />
<br />
/ooc &quot;Wave 3 INC... Proc up those SK's, let's send em home boys!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">it really only lands on a mob if the mob is under 32%.. so anytime under that and it won't have an effect on the mob (at least.. i think)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Whak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Anyone tested this after yesterday's patch?  <br />
(I would have by now but work, work, work ...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">It's fine now.  Was fixed last patch.</div></div><hr />
