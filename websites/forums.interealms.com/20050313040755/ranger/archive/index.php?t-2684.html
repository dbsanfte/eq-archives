<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hawkwind</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, while it would be nice to be able to fletch an amazing bow, the difference between fletching and smithing are not even on par. Once you hit 175 in smithing, you have to skill up on fine plate or Shadowscream...both which are timesinks trying to gather enough components (or buying them, and for Shadowscream one item is no rent) then the cost of skilling up is high (esp if you buy the leather padding) Fletching can be done at the vendor up to 250 theoretically (no idea on Darkwood trivials) <br />
<br />
Yes the cost of trying to skillup on Darkwood is high, but I am pretty sure if you averaged out the cost of skilling up, smithing would be a significant amount more than fletching not to mention the time it takes to skill up. I know when I skilled up Fletching (I am 202) it was VERY fast, smithing on the other hand past 175 is much slower than Fletching. Factor all that in and there is a reason why smithing &quot;rewards&quot; are greater than Fletching. Also the cost of being able to smith the Velious Cultural armor is enourmous never mind the time it takes to get the skill to have a chance to smith it.<br />
<br />
On a side note I really wish they had put out the Ranger and Wood Elf fletching at the same time so as not to leave any Karana and Human rangers out in the cold.<br />
<br />
Oh and would I love to be able to fletch something &quot;worthwhile&quot; (besides the 10 dmg arrows) I sure would considering I haven't fletched anything in over a year and a half,  but someday it may happen ;)<br />
<br />

20/60?  Lol, VI strikes again...  at least fletching is useful for arrows.  Now if they'd just get around to fixing bane dmg on them...</div></div><hr />

Tradeable stat bows:<br />
This one<br />
Raincaller -- quest require high fletching, drops all over the place, and at least one longish camp.<br />
Talisen, Bow of the Trailblazer -- drops during 9th ring war, sells for a fortune<br />
Anything else?<br />
<br />
So this is the second best tradeable bow with stats that can be used by non-ranger.</div></div><hr />

Also, i dont know why anyone would use this. Just tag along for a tormax raid and you're almost garaunteed a 20/30 bow for yourself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We know there ius at least one higher. That one (like the 51AC BP) requires a BD. I expect it to be better, though nobody has finished it yet.<br />
<br />
That's what we KNOW. The fact is, the NPC that gives the bow recipes is kind of messed up. After she gives you this recipe she is still talking but the text is cut off.(Like the fletching kit untill this mornings patch). There could very well be a 3rd bow.. Especially when you think of the Planar Oak from PoG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KelaanNorgale</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 11:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm hearing reports that this bow can be used in PRIMARY or RANGE slots (Fletching board ant EQ traders http://pub126.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfletching.showMessage?topicID=351.topic).  You can even have one in primary AND one in range.  This means that you can melee a mob with your bow, using the archery skill and getting &quot;target was hit by non-melee for ...&quot; messages.  This also has the potential for archery skill raises while meleeing.   Looks like this is definitely a bug.  <br />
<br />
BUT ...<br />
<br />
 Does this mean Verant may have been trying to implement point-blank archery when you have a bow in primary???   Hope so!<br />

<br />
For a &lt;40 woodelf Rogue, Paladin or Warrior this bow is pretty good.  So it's got the new graphic. Whoop de do.  <br />
<br />
The ratio is on par with other player made bows. It's got pretty good stats for a range slot item. The overall cost of fletching is low, so theres little reason an enterprising fletcher couldnt make one in their 20s. (trivial seems to be below 180 so why bother making an expensive darkwood/shadewood *shrug*).<br />
<br />
This bow is one of the best things thats happened to the fletching tradeskill, since silver arrows.</div></div><hr />

You could get these PoS in 1 kill solo...<br />
<br />
Spectral Bow<br />
MAGIC ITEM  LORE ITEM  NO DROP<br />
Skill: BOWS   Atk Delay: 50<br />
DMG: 19   WT: 8.5   Dmg/Sec: 7.80<br />
DEX+3  <br />
Class: WAR RNG <br />
Race: ALL  <br />
<br />
Sure the range is 50 less but come on it takes 2 minutes to get....<br />
<br />
And a 30+ ranger with SoW / Invis could get there and loot one for free almost any time, with zero skill in fletching.</div></div><hr />

The reinforced sylvan oak is a lil better already (on par with raincaller I think).

Sorry, I don't remember stats atm. If you want to keep up to date, visit www.EQtraders.com<br />
<br />
P.S. :  the blessed faydark stinger is trivial way below 200 skill apparantly. It is on par with the skill required to make it.</div></div><hr />

Hehe you saw that too? I went threw 40 arrows in like 10 seconds. Kinda sucked cuz I just made em and had no more components. Closest vendor was on the moon. Talk about an Uzi.</div></div><hr />
