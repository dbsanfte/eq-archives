<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hotarri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I wanted to know if the Griffons in JP still agro on you if you are kiting them in wolf form (haven't tried since I got it). I have seen people suggesting EJ, Trak and DSP. I tend to get too many adds in EJ and Trak. DSP is where I have been doing most of my leveling lately and it is starting to get real slow and lots of times the Sambatas are up. I am even willing to bow kite non animals if they don't have an excessively high HP (firestrike + KEI is my friend). Any and all suggestions are greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nift Trailhunter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have never gotten a add when kiting Griffons with wolf form up.  Even with kiting them over each other.  Sometimes even without wolf form the same is true depending wether you are kiting a griffon or griffawn.  Also with wolf form I get no adds kiting annacondas and black panthers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Albadia Fii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">And I have the opposite experience.<br />
<br />
From what Ive been able to tell. Griff's will not aggro you if your sitting down, walking around, whatever. But they will assist other Griff's. At least thats my experience anyway.. who knows eh?<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Yuma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">lol, thats if you can find a Griff in the first place, DSP i find is the best exp IF the Rockhoppers are up i used to get a quart/half a blue a kill sometimes more on higher ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've never gottan an add while fear kiting as a wolf in JP.<br />
<br />
If you would rather melee solo, try the Hole entrance.  With KEI to kep mana for heals/anti-summoned-nukes, you should do well there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Oneiros</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Griffons don't aggro if you are in wolf form, unless you are fighting another one. Seldom a problem though, there just aren't that many of em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Warriox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Above, Nift talks about kiting black panthers.  First time I was in JP I stuck an arrow into one of these, thinking that (like cats elsewhere) they had no particular fondness for rangers.  Much to my surprise, a bear then attacked me, and so I haven't messed with the panthers since.   Is there a faction hit for the panthers, and was my experience just a glitch or is that how aggro works in this zone?</div></div><hr />

If you are snare, fear kiting and see one geting near you, just back off and keep your distance from the other.  I found as long as I stayed away and resumed fighting after he passed they wouldn't social agro.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The panthers give bad faction with the animals and the residents of Jaggedpine.  Of these two, the one to be concerned with is the residents.  The animals is bottomed out at amiable lol.<br />
<br />
Hurt the residents by hunting the animals.  Fix it by hunting the poachers and/or the gnolls.<br />
<br />
The faction hits, in either case, are rather tiny.  So don't worry too much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Stanton Bowmaine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've had griffons path right thru the one I was fighting with no agro. When I was doing griffawns however, then they would social agro. Just my exp there...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tromor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I just dinged 57 in JPF huning black panthers and anacondas the entire level 56, and part of 55.<br />
<br />
At 55 and 56, black panthers don't attract any adds, even if you path right over something else.  I didn't kill them earlier, so I don't know if they get adds at 54 and below.<br />
<br />
If I knew then, what I know now, I would have hunted the panthers much earlier.  They are only slightly tougher than the Griffons, and fear kite along the same pathing.<br />
<br />
The faction hits are Critters of Jaggedpine Forest, and Residents of Jaggedpin Forest.  Your critter faction bottoms out at amiable pretty quickly.  I started them with warmly Residents faction, and after killing at least 300 panthers, I'm still warmly.  I've killed a few dozen gnolls and every named poacher that pops up, so I suspect thet the good faction from named poachers is much higher than the bad panther faction.<br />
<br />
The absolute best thing about the panters is that no one else was ever killing them.  I managed to find things to kill while other 56 Rangers in zone were complaining about no anacondas.  Another nice thing about them was they went down about twice as fast as anacondas, for what seemed like more exp.</div></div><hr />

The gnolls only give Protectors of Pine, Guardians of the glade,some Qeynos Guard Factions and lose darkpaw gnoll faction....the only way that I know of to be Non KOS to the animals is to be a ranger, druid or Bstlord.....I seem to remember a quest in surefall that was a mail delivery to qeynos that I did waaaaaayyyy back in the day; it seems to me that it gave qtrg protected animals faction, which is the same faction the panthers and bears in JP are on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Belthurman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I was doinga little check on the JP faction just yesterday.  Killing the paochers has a positive hit to the residents of JP while the Panthers give a negative hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Acacious Isengrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">How fast is the exp in JP...i noticed it seemed to really slow down when i hit 52</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>entilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">In LP (Lagged Pine) at 50, I got roughly 1% xp per griffon which was faily nice.  5 sessions killing 20 to 25 griffons = ding.<br />
<br />
At 52, it looked more like 1% per 3, maybe 4, kills which is better than nothing and by some accounts still respectable.  Panthers and anacondas were better exp (maybe 1% in 2 to 3 kills) but since they took a bit longer to kill would average out to almost the same amount of time, worse for anacondas.<br />
<br />
Hunting in JP now gives me a headache and makes me depressed.  I still hunt there too often because I can't find groups regularly but when I do I feel like a bottom feeder.  It's the second to last great zone (DSP hoppers being the greatest save for the overcampedness) for pre-pop-capable rangers to fear-kite solo trouble-free for good exp and that makes me sad.  I have trouble keeping up with cler/chant/bard/sham (and even plate-tank) friends and acquaintances who zoom past me since they can get PoP yard trash groups fairly regularly.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I had problems with addsin JP pre-50, almost none post-50, esp with wolf form.</div></div><hr />
