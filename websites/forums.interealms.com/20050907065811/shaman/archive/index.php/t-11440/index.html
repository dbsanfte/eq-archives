<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Luthe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thank you all for your help.<br />
<br />
The ascending dawn site is exactly what I was looking for.<br />
Basically i just find it silly when people send tells on a raid any time a piece of loot drops for their character, without any sense of an item they might want later that their guild is capable of dropping.<br />
<br />
I have a couple of weak areas gear wise and want to be aware of what mobs drop pieces that would be feasible upgrades and or end all (if there is such a thing) upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Uloff Bonecracker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Boo, as soon as I think my gear is getting better I go and see other peoples profiles and it makes me sad.... but then I eat some icecream and it fixes everything! Yay!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Basically i just find it silly when people send tells on a raid any time a piece of loot drops for their character, without any sense of an item they might want later that their guild is capable of dropping. <br />
<br />
This is why I love DKP systems so much, it sort of forces people to actually think what goals they have for their gear and to not make on the spot impulse buys that later may end up rotting in the bank.  With DKP people are a bit more thoughtful in their purchases and generally loot gets spread around to those that need it most.  If someone foolishly buys stuff that they soon will want to replace, they most likely won't have the points to buy it because of their wasteful spending.<br />
<br />
If you look at my profile I try to keep a short term, long term, and dream profile set up so that I can know which items I want to get to work towards maximizing my character without wasting loot that others in my guild could use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Morrighan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">mine's in my sig. I &quot;think&quot; I have about average gear for my level. Next on the shopping list is the Solstice Earring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Rubadub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hi,<br />
<br />
I decided to set up a magello profile, but am confused about what to do.<br />
<br />
I logged onto the site, and downloaded a Magello program.  When it runs a Qucik View Plus screen appears, with a file magelo(1).  When I go back to the site, it automatically loads the file, and I cannot get to any forums.<br />
<br />
I am probably missing something obvious, but I can't figure out what to do next.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Mine is in my sig.  Hardly uber, but decent, I think.<br />
<br />
My #1 need is HP gear.  I got a lot of Kael quest armor due to a major guild effort in WToV.  Kael armor has great AC but little or no HP.</div></div><hr />
