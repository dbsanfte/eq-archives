<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kilhunh the Wise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just some thoughts about slows in GoD.  Please confirm if you have these same ideas or thoughts, or let me know that I am just blowing smoke out of my ass.<br />
<br />
1st.  Balance of the Nihil is more agro vs. Malos and then Turgur's<br />
2nd. Tanks have a harder time keeping agro cause some mobs resist their taunt (some tank was telling this to me today, and I cant remember what they were saying was being resisted, but it happens alot in Qvic)<br />
3rd. Tanks just suck at gaining agro, and should pull their heads out of their own asses and stop blaming us for pulling agro.<br />
or 4th.  SoE is playing a cruel joke on us shamans by making anything we do gain more agro in GoD compared to other expansions.<br />
<br />
Now, I am not some lamer who waits tell 95-90% to slow cause I am not afraid to get hit.  Just there seems to be alot of issues in my guild with warriors not being able to grab agro from mobs and keep it during raids.<br />
<br />
So, I have told my shamans in my guild to try several things.  First is to stand near the MA.  Second is possibly stop using BoNihil and just use malos and then Turgur's.  Any other ideas besides having a paladin or sk be MA for all the trash?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snt_asher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">well theres a few thing's i take into consideration when im slowing<br />
ferst is how hard the mob hits for and 2nd is wether the clr are on top of things and wether im gona get a heal or not.<br />
<br />
war taunt basicly puts them on the top of the hates list +1<br />
so theres a few way's to play with that if you slow on INC and the wars are on top of things i jeneraly dont get hit since thay use there taunt on INC and just pull right off me, then there are times were i will malos then slow and will have agro for lots longer then if i slowed right off the resen behind that is the wars already used there taunt and have to wait on procs or for Taunt to pop for get agro back.<br />
<br />
there are a few good things to slowing right off i find that when some one with a high agro spell like a SHM slow chanter tash pally stun or SK snare on INC and the wars Taunt off them our clrs die less since it puts our wars verry high on the agro list, but when no one agros at all but the war on INC war gets heald and the mob gose right for the ferst CLR.<br />
<br />
i find that since i got BOTN i tend to use that on INC since it has a resistcheck on it and i would much rahter has a slowed mob beating on me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Warriors can have a hard time getting agro if they dont have some good agro weapons, anger augs and hae taunt faila time or two.  Paladins and Shadow Knights usually dont have much trouble gaining, regaining and holding agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am not sure that you are actually seeing more aggro with Balance than with Malos/Turgurs.<br />
<br />
I think what you are seeing is that you are no longer giving the tank 10 seconds to build aggro before your Slow lands.<br />
<br />
I do not know that this is the case, but in looking at the cast time on Balance, I'd say this could certainly be the case, if not at least a contributing factor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Foradce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well it does have 8 more disease counters than Turgurs, but I think Sudedor is right about the cast time being a major part in it. <br />
<br />
I haven't found the aggro any worse with BoN. If it has any extra aggro it's offset by the fact that you don't get resisted and pounded as much :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good agro weapons? I wish :)<br />
<br />
My regular MT is a Warrior with BoC and other top of the line Bazaar equipment, Anger augments, all kinds of AAs and so on. And I still get agro in XP groups like LDON and BoT after Malos/Turgur. On the other hand, when the MT is a 62 SK with low level Bazaar equipment (cultural at best), I can't steal agro with DOTs, much less slow.<br />
<br />
Perhaps things change when you get high level NO DROP weapons that put BoC to shame, but until then it's the price that warriors have to pay for being much better tanks on really nasty critters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ghwerig-AO</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Figure I would mention that my guild has used a Paladin as main tank for trash clearing for a long time now.  I rarely get smacked around even when slowing early.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Agree.<br />
<br />
I can't remember the last time my SK buddy let me get popped for Slow aggro.<br />
<br />
Now, I will play aggro pong with him using BoS sometimes.  It's amusing to us but sometimes people who don't know us start to panic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>garguren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Personally i've found that the new slow seams to be less aggro imo then turgers,  judgeing from how much i get beat when i go to Vxed.<br />
<br />
as far as tanks go i think there is somethen with your taks if your constently getting aggro.  I slow in vxed on inc (before tank even engages) and most i get is a swing or two,  given my guild has some good warriors.  But i hardly belive that they are far supieor to the average warrior in gear they just know how to tank imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>JaeredMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">From what I've seen there are a few different ways to explain what you're seeing.  For warriors their only real way of gaining &quot;snap&quot; aggro is with the Taunt ability, which puts then 1 higher than the highest person on the hate list.  The Incite line helps to some extent as well, but alone the Incite line isn't enough to grab immediate aggro over most casters.  <br />
<br />
The problem with Taunt is that it fails alot, especially on mobs higher level than the warrior.  Taunt fail rates on red con mobs is something on the order of over 50%, so in high end zones with lots of high level mobs Taunt isn't very reliable.  On the other hand Pallies and SKs have spells that virtually guarantee them immediate aggro from mobs regardless of their level.<br />
<br />
The aggro difference between Balance and Malos/Turgurs is noticeable only because of the time it takes for each one to be done.  Since Balance is so fast we get alot of aggro very early, which the warrior either has to successfully Taunt off or we take a few hits until they can generate enough aggro to out-aggro Balance.  With Malos/Turgurs taking several seconds longer to land on a mob (even Malos'ing on inc and TA Turgur's right after takes a couple seconds more than just Balancing it), that time is used for the warrior to establish more aggro via melee/Incite ticks which makes it a bit harder to pull aggro off.  <br />
<br />
With knight tanks we don't have to worry about it because they generate most of their aggro before the mob is even in melee range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">So much of this is timing related that it's really hard to respond to a lot of your questions.<br />
<br />
As noted, if you malos/turgurs, the mob is usually in camp and the warrior has hit it a couple of times.  Base cast time (before haste) is 10.2 seconds, or 8 seconds with a TA.  Few mobs are that slow.  Thus, even if you malos on inc, the warrior has hit him a couple of times and built at least some agro.  Balance, on the other hand, is 1.5 seconds--and often cast with no malos.<br />
<br />
That's one difference.<br />
<br />
Spell casting subtlety may also explain the differences others are having.  It helps a LOT on slows (huge difference)--just not DoTs.<br />
<br />
Warrior equipment, augs, and AAs help as well.  Not to mention GoD abilities like incite.  Our guild MT, for example, needs about 1-2 seconds on a mob, and I'd have to chain cripple to get a mob off her.  I can triple DoT and not pull agro.  She generates absolutely insane amounts of agro (couple of anger augs, massive agro proc weapons, AAs, incite, etc.).  I've never had a problem getting agro with her tanking.<br />
<br />
There are also some other questions as to timing.  If the shaman is pulling, and slows before the mob gets to camp, the longer it takes the mob to get to camp, the less the agro seems to be.  If I slow to pull, then run back to camp in say, 10 seconds, I've had a poorly geared warrior hit once (no proc) and take agro (no taunt).  I'm not sure what happens there as far as agro.  Perhaps no-damage hate is reduced over time to near 0 (which makes sense in regards to some other gameplay issues).<br />
<br />
Another suggestion, if your tanks can get a GoD jekli rune (incite) is to slow around incite.  It's a slightly longer cast time disc than taunt (takes about 3-4 secs I think), but will almost always take a mob off a shaman.  Try to land slow on inc before the warrior gets his incite off.<br />
<br />
Still, I don't think that balance is much more (if any) agro that turgurs.  I honestly think it's more a question of timing of when the spell is cast.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I recently recieved the GoD slow and I can see why people might think it is more aggro. I group with the same tank all the time and he has no problem keeping aggro. Usually what I do if we are at a &quot;camp&quot; is cast malos from as far out as my ER will go while the mob is coming in. Then I wait for him to hit the mob, and as soon as I see him swing I click TA. That gives him a good 3 seconds to proc, swing, incite, do whatever. However, with the GoD slow, I find myself wanting to cast it before the mob is even in the camp yet, and since its only a 1.5 sec cast, it hits really fast. I know that I have pissed the tank off a few times because I have aggro for the first 20% of the mobs life off just a slow. But to answer your question, I don't really think its more aggro, just the different way you can use it might make it seem that way. If you factor in the time it usually takes to cast malos + turgur's and you wait that long to cast GoD slow, I doubt you would get any more aggro then normal, or at least that's my opinion. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
So... wouldn't it be viable if we got a spell to help our tanks increase their taunt ability?  The way I see it, if tanks (esp warriors in this case) could hold aggro better, then this would increase our desirability in raids and groups?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Don't let Sony see that or they'll add it to the new FA spell.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>takk the silent one</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have to agree with everyone else... its probably a timing issue. Normally malos takes 5 sec, tugors takes 3 secs.  nihil takes 1.5secs. Thats not much time for a warrior tank to gain agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You might try having warriors cycle tanking trash.  That way, incite is always an option also.  Its a 30 second reuse time, so you might need 3 tanks to cycle thru MT and 3 tanks to cycle thru SA depending on how fast the trash is coming in.  Typically, I don't see tanks engaging a mob in my guild unless their timers are up and they are sure to hold aggro.  <br />
<br />
Also, if you are taking about trash.. is it really that big a deal whether you slow instantly or not?  If this is raid slows your taking about, I'm assuming you have tons of healing power sitting around also.  If the tanks aren't dying, and the clerics/dru are staying FM, its not such a big deal to slow instantly.  <br />
<br />
But yeah, if you wars don't have dual aggro proc'ing weapons, and aren't using incite, and NOT tanking when incite isn't up, and aren't holding aggro over slow, then Pally's and SK's are always a good option.<br />
<br />
Another thing, if your wars insist on tanking trash, then they need to let you know when they are sure they can hold that mob.  I'm assuming they are calling for assist on trash.  If you are slowing after assist is called, and still gaining aggro, then its the wars fault.  Its the MA's job to know when he's in a position to hold aggro and call assist.  <br />
<br />
If your wars aren't the best equipped, and you're slowing before assist is called, well, then, you deserve to get smacked.  About the only time I slow before assist is called is if A) I'm close to the mob and it wont' run, B) I can take a few hits from it, and/or C) I know the tank can get aggro back fast.</div></div><hr />

Eh I dont know if that would be a really good idea. Adding a taunt factor to Ferine (or an upgrade) might make a few DPS classes a slight bit upset :D<br />
Plus, SKs have a aggro modification spell line that adds a straight +% more aggro, its a shorter duration buff, but it supposedly works well.</div></div><hr />
