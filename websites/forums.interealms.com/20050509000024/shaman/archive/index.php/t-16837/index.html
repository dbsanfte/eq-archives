<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>vladislav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">How does that explain the nerf?<br />
My main is monk but only because I just love the whole idea of a monk fighter and I am fairly well equipped, other monks I've seen around are pretty useless in groups if there is any other class available.<br />
War/Mnk and to some extent Rogue really need something, since they have been getting nothing for the last few expansions.<br />
I solved this problem by dual-boxing a shammy with a monk, otherwise I would probably just quit until melees are looked at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brodda Thep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually those items were put in during/after a monk revamp.  Before that monks were using the same weapons as warriors for the most part at the highend.  They were also doing less damage than a warrior due to crits and triple attack.  Monks didn't always have triple attack during that time.  <br />
<br />
Monks were hurting pretty bad in early velious.  And doing too well due to itemization in NToV/Doze at the end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Korbis Catchaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well you'd have a point, but even with these nice at the time weapons, monks in uber gear were getting outdamaged by rogues in normal gear.<br />
<br />
Monks were nerfed because of people crying, that's all. I played a monk in a high end raiding guild at the height of monk ability, and I died less on pulls than after nerf. Being a RT meant I died faster. What did it fix? Other than dying more while performing my class role, there was zero impact.<br />
<br />
You could give monks their old defensive abilities and then some and they still would not replace actual tanks in exp groups or raids. They were just balanced before and now worthless. <br />
<br />
That said, I'm glad monks are nerfed. The monk community as a whole is a whiney bunch of morons that don't understand the game. I'm glad I woke up and realize there is no need for monks and made a fun class to play.</div></div><hr />

I dont know why I posted this here but its just something I realized and I wanted to have someone hear it.<br />
<br />
The monk nerf was aimed at mitigation/avoidance of some high end monks on rampage mobs. It had nothing to do with dmg output, weapons, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You guys talking about the monk damage-avoidance nerf are missing the point. He's not talking about that nerf. He's talking about the &quot;implicit nerf&quot; where monks went from being the super-uber-in-the-face-damage-dealers due to superior weapons to a warrior with fewer hp, fewer crits, and no defensive discipline. <br />
<br />
The avoidance nerf was a bit of a slap in the face to the monk community, but is not the biggest thing that they are upset about. The main monk objection today is that they brought only two things to the table - DPS and FD - and now FD is mostly unnecessary and their DPS is lagging other classes. Monks are generally not needed or wanted when a wizard/mage/ranger/rogue is available. <br />
<br />
Just to avoid predictable misinterpretation: I like monks. They can be played well. They can be productive in groups. I'm just saying that right now, the system is stacked against them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Korbis Catchaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Saying monks are useless is like saying a wizard is useless 'cause they can't tank.<br />
<br />
No, I said monks are useless because they do less damage per mob than a lot of classes, and their only utility is fd and dps. Now there are better pullers, so where is their utility? <br />
<br />
Right now if you're a monk the smartest thing you could do would be to reroll as a rogue and get reflagged. Otherwise, you're just another mediocre dps class with rare usefulness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ueauvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">monks use 2hb for most dps nowadays dont they? ranger use 2hs for max dps as dual wield is broken<br />
archery is situational</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Rogue backstab is based off the main-hand weapon damage value... so as piercer's get continually harder-hitting and faster.... rogue DPS continues to climb.  The monk special attack flying kick isn't based off a weapon, it's constant, so their special attacks haven't improved proportionally.<br />
<br />
I personally believe that monk defense is where it's supposed to be (before the nerf monks could be preferred over warriors for high-end raid tanking)...  monks aren't supposed to be a tank, they supposed to deal damage.  I would like to see Sony focus on damage output when they look at re-vamping monks.  If they do anything to monk defense, I'd like to see their avoidance capabilities upped maybe a little bit.  So many tanks and semi-tanks are based on mitigation and having tons of hitpoints and AC...  I think it'd be cool for a class (see monk) that could at least be a half-assed tank based on avoidance rather.  And in a way, they kinda are right now... but maybe it could use some improvement.<br />
<br />
My first toon was a monk (right when Kunark came out), and I quit him back in Velious when monks became a powerhouse class and everyone flocked to the class, including *******s.<br />
<br />
I supported the mitigation nerf when it happened, although Sony might have gone a step too far, or didn't work with avoidance enough.<br />
<br />
But monks aren't doing too good anymore.  Most monk friends I have generally don't enjoy the class too much, and people pass over monks for groups all the time.  I don't get in groups with a monk very often, especially in PoP.<br />
<br />
Right now there are a lot of classes that can out-damage a monk without breaking too much of a sweat --- wizards, mages, rogues, rangers, beastlords, etc...  and most of those classes offer a lot more utility to boot, so why play a monk who has little-to-no utility?  How often do monks play the part of main-puller anymore?<br />
<br />
Despite the shortcomings of the class currently.. I've recently gotten back into playing my monk, got him re-equipped, and I'm duoing with my shaman.  This truly is a classic duo relationship, and I'm finding that playing my monk is fun.  I don't know why.  I guess the concept of the class attracts me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Devnull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">... but this is just blatantly wrong.<br />
<br />
before the nerf monks could be preferred over warriors for high-end raid tanking<br />
<br />
Monks were never, ever main tanks on high-end raids. In some situations, the best equipped monks in the game were used as rampage tanks. This wasn't because monks somehow tanked better than warriors. It was highly situational and only useful in cases where the monk would only take periodic damage.<br />
<br />
Now monks take it in the shorts from both sides. They're given gear with ridiculously low stats in comparison to other melee classes and they have an innate mitigation penalty.<br />
<br />
 monks aren't supposed to be a tank, they supposed to deal damage<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but every step of a monk's life up until The Nerf, they took damage just fine. Saying this is just a retroactive rationalization for a poorly thought out, poorly planned nerf that helped destroy a class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My personal favorite change is the start of &quot;type&quot; armor, ie, plate type, chain, leather type and cloth type.  Seeing RNG ROG SHM on a piece of armor usually rocks, as a shaman I love benefiting from the AC/hps on the armor for the RNG/ROG.  <br />
<br />
Now we come to the lovely DRU MNK BST armor...  ummmm.... yeah.  Makes a lot of sense for a monk to be attired the same as a druid.  As if that's not bad enough, they're also given an innate AC penalty on top of the garbage armor they're given to wear.  Right on!<br />
<br />
So let's see, we don't need you to pull, you bring no utility to the group, if we bring multiples you're only able to offtank while your stonestance disc (12 secs) and mend are up (after which you're FD or dead), and your dps is laughable compared to a rogue, ranger, necro, wizard, mage, beastlord or any charming class.  And unless the'yre raid equipped or have a 70k+ SoFW (best droppable monk 2hb that is also BST usable) they will be lucky to outdamage an sk w/ a Windblade and pet, who brings a helluva lot more utility to the group.<br />
<br />
/sarcasm on<br />
Man, I just can't figure out why I retired my monk, they rock so hard!<br />
/sarcasm off<br />
<br />
From the comments posted at the fan faire I get the impression that EQ2 = monk fix.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zera</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I don't know about Elemental exp groups, but I know monks can off-tank decently pre-Elemental.  That doesn't make them the best class for it, but they do ok.  They're double penalized with low AC elemental armor and an AC penalty, I think it should be one or the other.  Their damage needs work too, though, from what I hear from top end monks, they're not outdamaged by beastlords, etc.  They were masters of sustained damage from any angle, I don't know how true this is anymore.  I duo box a shaman and monk, and the class can be frustrating, as the monk usually has a hard time getting groups on her own, worsened by LDoN, because I don't have it.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Pinepath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Monks were always designed to have weak armor though.  Go back and look at the original class planar armor.  Shiverback had less AC on some pieces than the caster armor.<br />
<br />
And monks were balanced for that.  Even pre-Kunark, monks made great tanks, but it was because they wore all all armor better than what the game designers calculated as their class armor.  I recall there being a bit of a petition started by monks when fearplane was the place to raid.  They wanted shiverback AC raised, because no one wore it, instead wearing things like azure sleeves.  Was quickly squelched when a game rep replied that monks were not really supposed to be wearing stuff with that ac, and they'd more likely make azure sleeves unusable by monks, rather than raise shiverback sleeves to 12ac, heh.<br />
<br />
Monk tanking was always just itemization out of control, because of ignorance on the part of folks putting in all all stuff, or special ignorance of game devs with no knowledge putting in stuff like 60ac monk pants.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Devnull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Those are the same people who thought that Strength, Dex, and Agility would actually make a difference in melee performance.

As a side note, The Nerf didn't come about because of any actual gameplay experiences. It was based on a mathematical model that SoE ran. Alchemy is working as intended, anyone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Mathematical model?  .. and here I thought they nerfed monks because everyone and their brother was playing one :P<br />
<br />
But seriously, monks could use a damage upgrade for sure.  Tank-wise I don't really think they need anything,  a monk with average AA will ahve LR5 and they do just fine.  I'm not talking MT for a BoT group or anything, but they are balanced in that department based on personal experience.  <br />
<br />
They really need a damage upgrade though, kinda sucks when I'm out dps'ing a monk in VT gear =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Verant has always had such a huge can of worms with the way they setup some things. For dps for example. How to balance and consistanly keep things where they said they wanted them (ie knights at ~80%, warriors 100%, monks 120% and rogues 140%) when you've got things like some classes getting tripple attack and others not, or monks with thier special attacks that are skill based for dmg, or rogues with backstab for a special attack where dmg is based off of weapon dmg but refresh is independant or 2 hders vs 1 2hder vs 1 1hders for knights. Its just one huge mess. How do you have a knight doing 80% of the damage of a warrior with the same 2hder. Etc etc etc. There are some solution like creating seperate weapons but that then means you've got all these limited use items in drop tables which is always a pain in the rear. Sucks to have a pally only weapon rot because your 2 pally's already have one or none are there for example. Not to mention verant tweaking with the combat system it's self for example to add the bigger min dmg bonus for 2hders to make them more useful which has now swung things the other way and made 2hders better than dual wielding. Then there's trying to balance things with different amounts of aa's. How do you balance weapons so that the ratio holds for people with little to no aa's and for people with esentially maxed aa's so that classes are balanced on both ends.<br />
<br />
Same holds true for ac/mitigation/avoidance.<br />
<br />
Too many differences between classes and skills and too many additions and changes made with out enough preplanning have made things a huge mess.<br />
<br />
CH has the same problem. How do you make shaman and druids less effective but still viable healers when what a cleric can heal is a moving target like ch is. Just making ch for shaman and druid cost more probably isn't sufficient but neither is leaving shamans &quot;compleate heal&quot; at a 2k heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>pyne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">... it all started with Furor whining about how bad the warrior class had it. If you look at SW he has begun the whining again this time with regards to Pallys and SK's. He won't be satisfied till the Warrior class is the only viable class for tanking for raids or xp groups. <br />
<br />
Shame he didnt stay retired.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">It's a shame he didn't play a shaman.   We need a whiney ass bastard to make things more fun for shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Aggogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I have a monk, a druid (bot), and a new shaman.<br />
<br />
I used to like two boxing with my monk and druid, but with the mitigation nerf, it became more difficult and sometimes impossible. I don't have any NToV/VP gear.  Some fights my druid would end up at 80% mana, and others he would be 20% mana all the time fighting the same mobs.  These same mobs that they were duoing non-stop prior to the nerf.<br />
<br />
Now that my monk is 61 and my druid is 59, I can no longer XP anywhere worth getting XP. Sure I can go to FG or even do trash mobs in PoI, but the xp is just barely flowing in and camping the same mobs over and over is just boring as all getout. Mobs in the other planes just hit too hard and too randomly to make it viable to duo.  <br />
<br />
So now, in comes my shaman.  He is still very low (level 24), but I am hoping that by the time I get him up to level 55 or so, he will be able to 2 box with my monk.  I am guessing that the key will be the ability to slow the mobs so that the streaky damage will slow to the point that I can play in areas that have reasonable xp mobs without worry of a badly timed fizzle.<br />
<br />
I really like the shaman so far, and can't wait to get to pet levels.  Until my shaman gets up into his 50s though, my monk will be semi-retired, and my druid had only been kept alive as a healing/gate bot for my monk, so he will reach full retirement even sooner.<br />
<br />
Who knows, maybe if they fix melee (warrior, rogue, monk), I will even pull out my old 52 warrior for a few romps in the planes.<br />
<br />
Scelestus 61 Monk (Semi-retired)<br />
Aleator 59 Druid (Healer/Gate Bot)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I think a substantial part of the reason for the monk mitigation nerfs hasn't been mentioned yet. <br />
<br />
Back before that nerf, back before PoP, monks were one of the uber solo classes. I remember lots of monks in places like FG solo'ing like mad.  I realize that a lot of classes could solo the FG shrooms at L 60. But monks could do it far better than any other melee class, and probably better than almost all classes period.   And moderately equipped monks could do it. Monks with high end gear at the time could solo substantially stronger mobs. They could solo stuff that a warrior, for example, had no shot against solo, due to their equal mitigation, better avoidance, and much higher damage output. Not to mention their healing ability. Monks were intended to be the highest damage in-your-face melee class, NOT the most efficient overall tanking class for exp mobs. Which they were. <br />
<br />
Now, the part that's screwy about all this is... the developers of EQ, all the way back to the 989 Studios days, have had a hate on for the concept of anyone above, oh, L 15 or so, being able to melee down an exp-giving blue con mob solo. Why this is, I don't know. Numerous caster classes can kill many blue cons solo at any level. But EQ has never been friendly to solo melee classes. It's apparently a disaster for the game if someone melees a blue con to death in a fair fight. Except for levels less than maybe 15, you don't seem to be supposed to be able to tank a blue con mob and melee it to death (exceptions abound such as shamans with slow, druids porcuping, pet casters, etc..., but none of them really involve melee tanking mobs solo). <br />
<br />
Now, it happens at high level, but only for those with lots of AA and uber equipment, and even then you can't dream of it in a lot of places (hi hi PoP zones!). <br />
<br />
So I really think a big chunk of the monk mitigation nerf was due to the fact that they were the best EXP tanks in the game - took the least damage for the amount of damage they did. That was never the intention for the class. <br />
<br />
I never thought monks needed any help, at any time in EQ's history. But now, I think maybe they do. The pace of LDoN adventures, and the fact that lull spells actually work now, have largely removed monks from the role of pullers. If they're not going to be exp group pullers, they do need something more to help them out again.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Eqphreak is right basically I think.  Monks were overpowered tanks, and everyone and their brother and grandmother were making up monk twinks.  It was crazy.  <br />
<br />
Monks were running around with AC very nearly equal that of warriors, leading a lot of warriors wondering why that was.  They could simply tank more than they were meant to.  <br />
<br />
SOE lowered the hammer on them, that's for sure.  I don't really think they need a special boost now, but maybe some marginal dps upgrades I suppose.  Certainly they can't hold a candle to a seriously powerful class, like the Paladin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The monk nerf was. and is, ridiculous. We've just finished a thread where warriors are having trouble getting XP groups because taunt is underpowered. And you really think a class with less HP, less mitigation and no capacity at all to taunt is a challenge? PoP would have spelt the end of a monk tank without the nerf.<br />
<br />
Monks could solo in FG because the shrooms spent most of their time casting an easily resistable spell, during which time you could maul them. This was fixed / nerfed long before the monk nerf.<br />
<br />
But really, monks got nerfed because a lot of cretins with minimal understanding got a major case of class envy. With Furor being their spokesman (although I think he wanted warrior upgrades, I doubt he ever felt threatened by monk &quot;tanking&quot;, lol).</div></div><hr />

<br />
A BST, Mage, Wizard, Necro, Ranger, Rogue with only bazaar gear and ~50AA can all provide more sustained damage than a Ssra level monk with maxed offensive AA. This is without mentioning the HUGE amount of utility those classes bring to a group. Monks have FD. What's the point in escaping death if you can't really accomplish anything while you're alive?<br />
<br />
I know this because I've played a monk. There is no point to them. Maybe in LDoN raids where lull is super resisted and death numbers actually matter they'll be useful again...<br />
<br />
What monks need is a nice DPS increase and the ability to attack from the front (HUGE innate strikethrough and riposte immunity). In a nice controlled fight where a Rogue has the back 100% of the time they should out-damage a Monk, but in a chaotic fight where mobs are spinning around everywhere Monks should be able to out-damage Rogues. If they're going to be reduced to pure DPS why not actually let them post nice high DPS numbers?</div></div><hr />

Monks were never that overpowered (check the DPS comparisons sometime), but even so, The Nerf was a ridiculous excercise in hyperbole.

This isnt about rogues and I dont know much about the monk other than I had a twink to level 20 ages ago, but remind me again what HUGE amount of utility the rogue brings to a group that you are talking about.  Rogues are one trick ponies for the most part that do decent dps.</div></div><hr />

Another good friend quit his monk and switched to a beastlord because it's similar and most gear transferred.  Like all my friends, he's a bazaar geared player.  We parsed him today in PoV at same level as his retired monk (w/ tons and tons of aa's) and his dps destroyed, flat out destroyed, his monk's dps.

<br />
Well, you might want to hold off on saying that they're one trick ponies for a moment.<br />
<br />
In addition to their damage (the 1 trick, presumably) they also provide a group with excellent scouting ability in LDoN, the ability to disarm those annoying traps that cause so much trouble in LDoN, and the ability to open those rather useless chests.<br />
<br />
Rogues may not be the best utility class in the world, but they do bring something to the group aside from a dagger.</div></div><hr />

To get back on topic in a sense... this is just one more reason monks need a bit of improvement. Back when feign pulling was the shiznit they could afford to be two-trick ponies. Now they're down to one trick (for exp groups anyway) and it's not quite good enough. This illustrates another way that they're not the best pullers anymore, and how they may need something back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm afraid you really don't understand the current monk situation, Jhar. Yes, the GUI does display a higher AC for a naked monk than for a naked warrior... does this mean anything? No, not in the least. The Nerf hit monks so severely that they tank as if they had hundreds of points of AC lopped off their displayed value. There is unquestionably a nasty AC penalty for playing a monk.<br />
<br />
As far as the Velious items go, yeah, they were poorly planned out at the time. However, they don't come close to making up the AC disparity found on all the other slots of current gear. The funny thing is, those 'broken' Vellious items aren't even being worn over the current low ac gear from PoP. They're outdated and using them as any sort of argument to justify monks' current plight is fallacious at best.  <br />
<br />
Monks do need improvements, but it's in the dps department.<br />
<br />
The thing is, unless a monk outdamages a rogue, they're almost always an inferior groupmate. Obviously, monks shouldn't be outdamaging rogues in most situations, so just as obviously they need some other boost elsewhere.<br />
<br />
It used to be that monks were incredibly useful for pulling and made decent secondary tanks. Now neither is true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Why do they need a boost elsewhere?  I don't get it.   When a group wants dps they usually think wizard first, so should rogues get a boost as well?  No.  Neither should monks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">You be way off on monk AC, Devnull, kinda like you were off on your first reply to me.<br />
<br />
The AC value you see in the GUI is their AC value, plain and simple.  The monk nerf attacked their mitigation ability, because at one point they mitigated like warriors.  You're assuming AC = mitigation.  A rogue with 1400 AC will not take damage like a warrior with 1400 AC.  Whole different animal.  Monks don't mitigate very well, which is kinda part of the concept of a monk... a class who's apparel consists of leather, not hard steel..  They do block and dodge well (read: evasive defense), and generally make the mob miss them.<br />
<br />
When a mob manages to actually hit a monk, the monk doesn't mitigate well at all, that's why he takes so much damage per hit.<br />
<br />
But back in the day, a monk mitigated like a warrior, and evaded damaged way better than a warrior.  It was indeed viable for a monk to take less damage than a warrior.<br />
<br />
Okay, now your claim that monks tank as if they had hundreds of points of AC lopped off, I don't agree with either.  Monks are *not* that bad.  I've been playing my fairly normal, average 55 monk for the last week, and his tanking ability isn't too far off from a lot of tanks I've fought with.  Let's put it this way --- I've been clearing the KC jail area trying to get a Tranquil Staff for him.  I buff him up with my shaman buffs, and set him loose on anything that moves.  The mobs are of course slowed.  But I can clear the jail, every roamer, the hands room, the warlord room, and the skelly tower, and never heal my monk once.  One mend can take care of any lost health during that cycle.  He can finish the cycle at 100% health.  His evasive defense, block, dodging, regen, etc...  coupled with the shaman slow and the mobs can't touch him.  He's got a mediocre 1000 unbuffed AC...<br />
<br />
Now I know he's got 65 shaman buffs on, but if monk tanking was *that* bad, I really doubt he'd be able to do that.  KC mobs are very weak to today's mobs (but weren't weak back in Velious/Kunark days), but remember he's only 55 (and started the week at 53), and these mobs do hit for 100+.  And he's only got about 2000 hps unbuffed.  He's far from being supremely equipped (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=545860&amp;resize=true), his SCHW are probly his best piece of gear... so think about the monks who had fungi's, TStaffs, CoFs, and then their epic with the spell haste (these types of monks were *everywhere*), and then consider that their mitigation was on par with warriors... does that give you a clue how ridiculous monks were before the nerf?  At that time my main toon *was* a monk (and not in the aforementioned gear), and I was the first to admit that our defense was out of wack.<br />
<br />
**********<br />
Fast forward to now... the issue is mostly with monk offensive capabilities, imo.  They need improvements here because in the one thing they're built to do well... they're out-performed by quite a few classes rather handily.  Of course you're gonna have the level 65, 400 AA, PoTime geared monk who's just incredible to watch.... I sure as hell ain't that guy, and most monks can say the same thing.<br />
<br />
I'm not concerned about tanking with my monk.  If he can settle as a emergency tanker, fine with me.  But that's not my focus.  If his utility is going to be next to nothing, then he better be a blender of a machine on the battlefield.<br />
<br />
The defense nerf was just screaming to occur... they might have gone a tad past where they should have, but I see all these folks screaming &quot;the monk nerf so totaly fookin screwed their defense&quot;, and I'm like &quot;what are you smokin'? it's not nearly as bad as you're saying it is&quot;.  I think people say it because they see other people saying it, so they say it too.<br />
<br />
They could use a minor increase in defense, but I think what monks need is DPS increase, and to be returned to the role of puller as they were in the days of old, because in history it's the only role a monk could identify with, and that's been mostly removed from them.  And they lost ground in damaging capabilities... so now they offer no utility and even-for-the-course damage, relatively speaking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Ungerargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">All arguments about the monk nerf will invariably fall into two camps:<br />
<br />
1) I've played a monk, and...<br />
2) I haven't played a monk, but...<br />
<br />
With VERY little travel between the two camps.  I have a 64 monk, I have a 63 shaman.  As a shaman, I pretty much feel the monk class is worthless.  It's hard for them to get a mob off me after I slow it, and even after they do, they probably take more damage than I would have had I tanked it (assuming same level of CA/CS/LR/ID).  As a shaman, it's really hard to care about the monk plight, because I can always just get another class for dps.<br />
<br />
As a monk, I find it rather upsetting that sooooooo many people just don't understand how bad monks have it now.  Would any of you EVER take a monk over another dps class, given the option?  EVER?  Answer that question honestly, and you'll begin to understand why monks are so underpowered right now.  <br />
<br />
There is literally no reason to invite a monk into your group over another dps class, or, if needed, another offtank melee.  If you can't understand that this makes a monk underpowered, then you have a problem.  Yes, you may pick a wizard over a rogue, but there's a difference between being picked second and being picked LAST.  Monks almost unilaterally have not only the lowest dps of any of the &quot;dps classes&quot;, but, in addition, the least utility.  THIS is why monks are in such a poor state right now.<br />
<br />
The monk nerf itself is absolutely moronic.  Let's look at LDoN, or any other expansion where a full suit of mid-high end gear can be obtained and is nearly exactly the same for beastlords and monks.  Anyway, buy the beastlord and monk the exact same full set of gear, same augs, etc.  Now, have those two melee tank the same mob, that has the same debuffs on it.<br />
<br />
The beastlord will take SIGNIFICANTLY less damage than the monk, on the order of 20%.  Why?  They don't have a mitigation penalty, that's why.  Coupled with the same defensive skills as a monk, albeit at slightly lower caps, they make great comparison tanks.  Yes, you can go ahead and filter out ripostes so double attack doesn't become a point of contention.  Beastlords tank far better than monks, IN THE SAME GEAR.<br />
<br />
Monks *begged* to just have their AC &quot;bonus&quot; (which was never NEARLY as large as what the nerf took away) taken off so that they would just be on a level playing field with other classes, rather than being the *only* class in EQ to have an innate mitigation penalty.  The AC bonus is not avoidance, btw.  It's mitigation (or was, heh).  Tests have been done both before and after the nerf that conclusively show that a monk does not avoid (a mob tries to hit you, but MISSES!) any more than any other class with 252 defense.  The *only* difference in monk avoidance is that block fires ~2x as often as parry.  That's all.  Block fires around 8% of the time, parry 4%.  Wow, that really needed to be nerfed!<br />
<br />
Yes, monks were able to solo in velious and luclin at level 60 very well.  That was a function of a few factors:<br />
<br />
1) Decent tanking ability (but, let me reiterate, only infinitesimally better than any other class with 252 defense).<br />
<br />
2) Decent DPS (but certainly not the highest melee dps out there overall, but the best from the front, because, at the time, monks could actually survive in front of mobs).<br />
<br />
3) Fungus-Covered Scale Tunic.  I don't think I need to remind anyone that this is available to ANYONE.<br />
<br />
4) Mend.  25% self-heal every six minutes is the *primary* reason monks solo so well.  Warriors eventually run out of HP.  So do monks, but they gain it back faster.<br />
<br />
5) Feign Death.  Albeit a small part, FD guaranteed the monk would not be making any reverse xp movements. :)<br />
<br />
6) Bandages.  Perhaps the only class in EQ that regularly carries bandages.  Why?  I don't know.  Warriors are FAR superior at bandaging (with the proper AAs they do something like nearly 200 HP per bandage), and yet they never have them, and never tried to solo with them.<br />
<br />
When it all comes down to it, the primary limitation for melee soloing is keeping the HP bar up, and the reason monks soloed better than other melees is because they got a free 25% heal (and upgradeable to a chance to crit for 50% heal) every six minutes.  They didn't tank better than warriors.  They did tank about as well as warriors, did more damage, and had more toys.  Even if they had never been nerfed, monks would now be balanced in that regard, because the itemization post-Luclin has been consummate with the current vision for monks.  <br />
<br />
A monk in 1400 unbuffed AC is NO THREAT to a warrior with 1800+, even if the nerf was removed.  Why people continue to refuse to acknowledge this fact is COMPLETELY beyond me.<br />
<br />
On raids, monks were never main-tanks, just rampage tanks.  They were rampage tanks on mobs that hit for max damage most of the time.  Why choose a monk over another melee for this job?  Because that small difference between block and parry is the *only* thing differentiating a monk rampage tank from, for example, a knight.  You could put a paladin as rampage tank, or a monk, and the monk takes slightly less damage because of block.  Big friggin' whup.<br />
<br />
FYI to Poguk, taking a 55 monk to Karnor's in 1000 unbuffed AC gear and noticing that he doesn't take much damage when fighting those level 45-~50 mobs is just screaming how ignorant you are of the monk situation.  First of all, 1000 unbuffed AC is *very good* for Kunark content at level 55.  You're above the curve that content was designed for.<br />
<br />
Personally, if a 55 *wizard* couldn't tank a 75% slowed karnor's with replenishment (although your monk likely has a fungi as well), I'd be surprised.  We're not talking about 4 expansion old content.  Yes, monks are balanced compared to old world and Kunark, and possibly even Velious.  But their tanking is absolute crap when brought up against Luclin, PoP, LoY, or LDoN.  You know, the places people xp in now?  The places that are actually RELEVANT now?<br />
<br />
When you get of level, take your monk to a 51 point normal adventure.  Twink him out nice and good, get him to 3000+ HP and over 1150 unbuffed AC.  Then watch his ass get TORN apart for 372, 372, 276, 372, while the warrior with 1050 unbuffed AC is taking 276, 112, 134, 179.  Then, come back and tell me monks are balanced with regard to damage mitigation.  <br />
<br />
Monks should mitigate less than warriors.  I don't argue that.  But, it should be through itemization (AND IT ALREADY IS NOW, AND HAS BEEN SINCE POP), not an innate penalty.  Hopefully I've gotten through to some people today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">You didn't read my post did ya?  I don't meet too many monks as badly equipped as mine.  No I don't have a fungi (I even provided a link to my magelo).<br />
<br />
The point was I could take out the entire upstairs of KC without needing a heal.  My (at the time) 59 ranger couldn't do that 3 months ago, and he has much better gear.  He'd need a heal here and there.  You're talkin out yer ass if you really think a normal equipped 55 *wizard* could tank in there.  It sounds funny, but it's not gonna happen.  Do you see my signature?  I happen to *have* a 55 wizard.<br />
<br />
I'm fairly certain only 3 or 4 classes can actually effectively tank in the Planes --- warrior, pallly, SK.  I've done groups that went against that grain and was somewhat successful, but *any* class besides those three these days gets their butts ripped by those mobs in the &quot;normal&quot; exp places (PoP).  Unslowed I've seen 65 tanks get smacked down real fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Ungerargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I apologize for my hyperbole, I was just trying to point out that your example is flawed, as Kunark is not a very good proving grounds for testing of the monk mitigation nerf.  I'm sure that if your ranger had an innate 25% heal every six minutes, you would not have to heal him either.  That's not a function of the monk tanking better, it's just a class ability.  Monks *should* tank better than rangers, in my opinion.  Were they both dualwielding?  Ripostes can be a bitch, even when the mobs only hit for low 100s.<br />
<br />
I stand by the assertion that monks should be able to soak damage a lot better than they do currently.  The playing field changes quite rapidly if you go from Karnor's to Valor.  If nothing else, monks need a *true* avoidance advantage over other classes to bring their damage intake down to a more tolerable level.  There is no justification for them being the only class with an innate class penalty to mitigation; said penalty is in place already with the lower armor class of monk armor in relation to chain and plate classes.<br />

He has decent enough gear, nowhere near uber, but fairly well equipped.  He could probably take KC on unslowed without needing a heal.  That doesn't mean his mitigation is in-line, because, as I said, Karnor's is 4 expansion old content.  If I were to try to fight virulent arachnids in plane of nightmare, WITH slow, I would need quite a few heals.  I also have a Staff of Flowing Water (2HB, 42 damage 34 delay).  The ripostes are much lower with that, of course.  He would STILL need quite a bit of healing using that.<br />
<br />
Versus 51 point LDoN adventure mobs (around level 60, max hit around 372), he is an extremely inefficient tank vs. slowed mobs.  Imho, the inefficiency of monk tanking should be more due to their lack of taunt, not due to an innate penalty.  There are more ways than one to balance a perceived probem with a class, and SoE took the easiest one, and in the process have been killing the monk class.  <br />
<br />
PoP already changed the rules for the requirements of a tank; no further adjustment was needed.  Do monks have quick aggro?  No.  Do they have high HP?  No.  Do they take damage well?  Even without the monk nerf, the answer to this would have been no.  That is why I feel it is unjustified.  Disagree if you like, but you have to at least acknowledge the validity of my assertions.  I'm not talking out my ass when it comes to saying that monks are in a very bad situation right now.  I experience it firsthand.</div></div><hr />

Upstairs of KC being hand room, warlord  and roamers? Unslowed, decent gear and no funghi? Sounds unlikely to me. The mobs up there are fairly gimpy, but they should still land enough hits to mess you up.<br />

There was never a day that a monk mitigated damage as well as a warrior.  PERIOD!  They have always mitigated at about a 10% worse clip but would dodge/block more often to sometimes make up for their lesser mitigation (this is not a made up number but something that has been parsed to no end...close to 10 =D).  With that said... Monks were NEVER threats to take warrior tanking responsibilities.  Equally equipped warriors and monks (back in the day) werent very close on HPs.  Monks never could hold aggro consistently.  Monks would never be a raid tank due to the fact that they dont have a defensive type skill (they do but it only lasts 12 seconds...cast a slow during that time BLAM...they lose aggro)  Take away the nerf and leave the monk with the crap gear that is dropping for them now and that is nerf enough.<br />

I honestly quit caring for this crap about oooh 3 days ago when I retired out of EQ.  But sometimes people's ignorance or class envy makes me want to say something sometimes.<br />
<br />
Monks were NEVER (allow me to repeat myself, NEVER) better or more effecient tanks then a plate class tank (War / pal / SK).  Yes you might know of ONE monk that has 5k HP unbuffed and whatnot that can outank joe-blow war who is equiped in his newby gear he got from the quest with his guild master and is still wielding Fine steel short swords.  But then again when you compare the top 1% of one class to even the middle of the bell curve of another class guess who will win on top (and in monks vs warriors not by much).<br />
<br />
Warriors need taunt fixxed.  IT is just plain sad when a level 65 warrior with 200+ AA's is passed up for a tank in Bastion of Thunder for a level 63 Paladin with NO AA's and casting his level 9 and 14 stuns for agro.  Yes I was in this situation where we were looking for a replacement tank and the enchanter and shaman out right refused to group with anyone other then a blue bar tank.<br />
<br />
Monks don't have it AS bad but fall in pretty closely.  Call me Biased all you want, your perception of reality does not equate truth to me either.  Either one of 2 things need to happen...either up our DPS where we situationally beat out a rogue sometimes or up our mitigation where we can atleast offtank just behind a paladin's effectiveness.<br />
<br />
When it comes to grouping most people look at 2 things.  <br />
<br />
One: can they do the job.  <br />

Warriors are not good Crowd Control so for that you either get a Chanter, bard, or Necro in some situations.  Monks are not that good of slowers so they can't fill the slot of a shaman / chanter / beastlord / bard / necro (in undead situations).  Once the main 3 roles are accomplished (slower, Healer, CC) then you throw in 3 various classes.  <br />
<br />
Two: What do they bring to the group outside of the 3 main duties.<br />
<br />
Melee bring nothing more then DPS/tankability.  (this exclused the Rogues situational usefullness in opening doors/chests.)  Hybrids and pure casters bring all kinds of utility (snare / root / dispell / cure diseases or poision / mana regeneration / pets / back-up healing / dispells / buffs).  And most of these Hybrids actually rip out the same if not more DPS then their pure melee counterpart.<br />
<br />
Ok now situation time<br />
<br />
You are in a group in Bastion of Thunder or any outdoor exp zone.  Monk is pulling with the added aid of the enchanter pac'ing every now and again.<br />
<br />
65 cleric<br />
65 warrior<br />
65 shaman (for most of you this is you)<br />
65 enchanter<br />
65 monk<br />
65 rogue<br />
<br />
Warrior says he has to leave<br />
<br />
65 Warriors shouts '65 warrior LFG PST'<br />
62 Paladin shouts '62 Paladin LFG PST'<br />
63 Shadowknight shouts '63 SK LFG PST'<br />
<br />
Who do you choose as your new tank?<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------<br />
ok same group but the monk leaves.<br />
<br />
65 Monk shouts '65 monk LFG PST'<br />
64 Bard shouts '64 bard LFG PST'<br />
62 Ranger shouts '62 Ranja w/ EQ and AM3 LFG PST' (they always add that to their LFG)<br />
63 Beast_lord shouts '63 ShaMonk LFG PST'<br />
62 wizard shouts '62 wizard LFG ready to fry some giants PST'<br />
<br />
Who do you choose as your new puller / DPS class?<br />
<br />
Situation 1 most people would choose the SK. (group buffs / mob debuffs / pet / insta agro)<br />
<br />
Situation 2 most people would choose either the bard or the Ranger (Pulling in outdoor zones + the Utility they bring (snare / mana song / overhaste)<br />
<br />
<br />
And people saying this always urk me...<br />
<br />
Single monks solo'ing an area that is was a one group encounter. It was un-balanced. The initial nerf was way far and beyond what needed to happen though.<br />
<br />
So its fair to assume that Bards/necros/Druids/Beastlords/Wizards/{Insert any other class that can solo} are out of balence and should be nerfed as well?<br />
<br />
But honestly I hope I have tought someone something and shown a few people the light.  Pure melee need a boost...thanks<br />

Who cares? Me and every other group member in EQ unless said monk is a good friend or guildie.  What would you invite one for?  They are detrimental to have pull, they do mediocre dps (unless totally raid geared) and they can't tank worth a damn.  They can't even offtank worth crap- think warrior w/o the AC, hps, hate proccing weapons and taunt button, and we all know how sweet warriors are for holding aggro (haha).<br />
<br />
If I had unlimited playtime, I could afford to build groups consisting of 4 clerics and a monk, but like many people I want to maximize my productivity for the time I have.  And, sadly, that means avoiding classes that don't bring anything of value to the table.  <br />
<br />
Monks have a legitimate reason to be bitter.  My personal feeling is that monk fix = EQ2.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Monks were NEVER (allow me to repeat myself, NEVER) better or more effecient tanks then a plate class tank (War / pal / SK).  Yes you might know of ONE monk that has 5k HP unbuffed and whatnot that can outank joe-blow war who is equiped in his newby gear he got from the quest with his guild master and is still wielding Fine steel short swords.  But then again when you compare the top 1% of one class to even the middle of the bell curve of another class guess who will win on top (and in monks vs warriors not by much).<br />
<br />
<br />
I disagree, in the Kunark/velious era monks were always the best tanks for an exp group. My 50th lvl Iksar monk didn't have a problem breaking 1000ac in getto gear. <br />
<br />
Between 50-60, my shaman often had monk as main tank in our groups and there still wasn't much that they couldn't tank. <br />
<br />
... but that was long before the monk nerf back when a warrior wearing Cobalt or Thurg quest armor was pretty uber so it doesn't really matter any more. <br />
<br />
These days, there's better armor for low lvl plate tanks and at the high end monks can't hold agro worth a damn so I also don't see why they can't just do away with the mitigation nerf. <br />
<br />
As for groups, in PoP I probably wouldn't take a monk unless he was a friend but in LDoN I'd take one in a heartbeat. Nice DPS and the ability to offtank adds is a nice combination. Granted, beastlords do it better but I'd rate a monk as good as any of the other DPS classes. Monks also make pretty good pullers in LDoN as long as they aren't hung up on feign splitting every mob. Agro pulling works well in LDoN and a monk has the ability to bring 2 or 3 (which your average LDoN group can handle) but still feign off a bad pull. <br />
<br />
I don't do pickup groups much these days but if others really aren't picking up monks for LDoN groups, I'd take em all. Shaman and 5 monks would rock any standard LDoN dungeon! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Devnull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">You be way off on monk AC, Devnull, kinda like you were off on your first reply to me.<br />
<br />
No, no I'm not. In either of the cases you mention.<br />
<br />
The AC value you see in the GUI is their AC value, plain and simple.  <br />
<br />
No, not all AC is created equal. It's fairly obvious you don't play a high end melee.<br />
<br />
The monk nerf attacked their mitigation ability, because at one point they mitigated like warriors.  You're assuming AC = mitigation.<br />
<br />
Yeah, a monk with x AC will be missed the same amount (within experimental error) as a warrior of x ac. The monk just gets hit significantly harder then the warrior does. So yeah, the monk tanks like he has hundreds less AC then the warrior. The only advantage a monk has is that block fires off about 8% of the time, as opposed to parry firing off 4% of the time for a warrior.<br />
<br />
 A rogue with 1400 AC will not take damage like a warrior with 1400 AC.  Whole different animal.  Monks don't mitigate very well, which is kinda part of the concept of a monk... a class who's apparel consists of leather, not hard steel..  They do block and dodge well (read: evasive defense), and generally make the mob miss them.<br />
<br />
A rogue with 1400 AC will actually take damage in an awfully similar fashion to a warrior with 1400 AC. Again, it's fairly obvious that you don't play a tank class. Monks dodge no better than any other melee class with a comparable Dodge skill cap, and I covere the four percent advantage that block offers already.<br />
<br />
When a mob manages to actually hit a monk, the monk doesn't mitigate well at all, that's why he takes so much damage per hit.<br />
<br />
True, very true... which is part of the problem.<br />
<br />
But back in the day, a monk mitigated like a warrior, and evaded damaged way better than a warrior.  It was indeed viable for a monk to take less damage than a warrior.<br />
<br />
Again, Block fired twice as often as parry, giving monks a 4% advantage. Go them.<br />
<br />
Okay, now your claim that monks tank as if they had hundreds of points of AC lopped off, I don't agree with either. <br />
<br />
Feel free to be wrong. Parse it sometime. I have. Others have. Our conclusions vary wildly from your anecdotal evidence. gee, wonder which carries more weight?<br />
<br />
Monks are *not* that bad.  I've been playing my fairly normal, average 55 monk for the last week, and his tanking ability isn't too far off from a lot of tanks I've fought with.  Let's put it this way --- I've been clearing the KC jail area trying to get a Tranquil Staff for him.  I buff him up with my shaman buffs, and set him loose on anything that moves.  The mobs are of course slowed.  But I can clear the jail, every roamer, the hands room, the warlord room, and the skelly tower, and never heal my monk once.  One mend can take care of any lost health during that cycle.  He can finish the cycle at 100% health.  His evasive defense, block, dodging, regen, etc...  coupled with the shaman slow and the mobs can't touch him.  He's got a mediocre 1000 unbuffed AC...<br />
<br />
<br />
One thousand AC is a ridiculously high number for a 55 monk fighting in Karnor's. KC was designed for a level 55 toon with 800-900 AC. Throw in the fact that he's regenning 25 hps per tick, has 60% haste, and taking one quarter the normal damage of those mobs, and I'm not surprised he didn't need a heal. No other melee class in that situation would either. <br />
<br />
<br />
Fast forward to now... the issue is mostly with monk offensive capabilities, imo.  They need improvements here because in the one thing they're built to do well... they're out-performed by quite a few classes rather handily.  Of course you're gonna have the level 65, 400 AA, PoTime geared monk who's just incredible to watch.... I sure as hell ain't that guy, and most monks can say the same thing.<br />
<br />
So if a monk is going to be all offense and no defense, why the hell not just get a rogue? better damage, better utility, and they can tank as well as a monk, better in some cases.<br />
<br />
I'm not concerned about tanking with my monk.  If he can settle as a emergency tanker, fine with me.  But that's not my focus.  If his utility is going to be next to nothing, then he better be a blender of a machine on the battlefield.<br />
<br />
So, like a rogue but with more suck added?<br />
<br />
The defense nerf was just screaming to occur... they might have gone a tad past where they should have, but I see all these folks screaming &quot;the monk nerf so totaly fookin screwed their defense&quot;, and I'm like &quot;what are you smokin'? it's not nearly as bad as you're saying it is&quot;.  I think people say it because they see other people saying it, so they say it too.<br />
<br />
Evidence? Didn't think so. Play a monk instead of powerlevelling one, against content that's current, not five expansions old, and grab some parses.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>lenardo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Monks, high end low end tank like crap now<br />
<br />
in Actual parsing a monk tanks like a warrior - yes they do- if the warrior has ~300 less ac than the monk's ac is at. <br />
<br />
a beastlord in the same gear as a monk tanks better than the monk- again parsing and actual game play examples prove this<br />
<br />
The problem occurred due to 1 simple thing, that could have been ENTIRELY avoided.<br />
<br />
ITEMIZATION in NTOV, Dozeker and to a lesser extent ssra &amp; VT.<br />
<br />
i'll toss in the AoW legs there too.<br />
<br />
what occurred in those spots<br />
<br />
HIGH AC -  ALL/ALL, monk, melee type/all items.<br />
<br />
thus a monk was able to get equal/almost equal ac than a warrior.<br />
<br />
it was the itemization of ntov dozeker - aow legs- ssra and vt that caused the problem and made the nerf happen, the main problem NOW is.....<br />
<br />
PoP itemization FIXED the imbalance against Warriors, thus a warrior NOW has ~3-500ac MORE than a comparably equipped monk in the Elemental planes.<br />
<br />
so warriors(and paladins and shadowknights and bards ~1700) have 1800-2000ac in eplanes or higher...monks have ~1500.<br />
<br />
thus just by AC monks will now tank worse.<br />
<br />
add in the mitigation nerf which is equiv to about 300 ac monks have an effective ac of around 1200 at the high end vs the  tank classes that are at ~1700+</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have done a lot of xping in Sol B; I liked killing bats and kobolds. Anyway, by 52 all the kobolds were either light blue or green to me, so I had graduated to bats. I had a Fungi Tunic, BTW.<br />
<br />
Day after the nerf, I logged in to putter around Sol B for awhile. Got aggroed by some kobolds; big deal. They were all green and light blue, and I've taken down 4 at a time before. This time, I went down to one bub of health in about 25 seconds. FDed. Got up, ran for the zone, made it at less than half a bubble of HP. THAT is an overnerf. I realize that half the monk nerf has been repealed, but that is not enough.<br />
You say that you are equipped in crap, not even a Fungi. Well, I too am equipped with crap, even WITH a fungi tunic, and I am one gimped monk.<br />
<br />
Went to an LDON adventure the other day (its been about a year since I played), and we didn't have a slower. So I said I'd be offtank if I accidentally pulled an extra mob. I figured, I can probably tank these guys alright.<br />
<br />
I can tank for about 20 seconds without a heal, and then I die. I just keep getting hit for nearly max all the time now. Know what my AC is? Just shy of 900. 900!!!! WHAT A BUNCH OF CRAP. Its insulting to know that I've played the game for 4 years, and just like that I can be made obsolete. Its like getting fired from your job for no frickin reason, and then finding that you can't ever find another job. So just hold your tongue about monks AC not being too bad.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>trmonk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">You know there was an issue with Monk tanking.<br />
<br />
The problem was.<br />
<br />
It wasn't monk tanking ability that was the issue. Though this was the fix that was applied.<br />
<br />
The above poster is correct in some of what he says, mitigation levels where the same.<br />
<br />
The problem was with the game, inherent problems.<br />
<br />
For instance, extremely HIGH AC items, Flayed Pants for instance, 60ac on a pair of pants for a monk.<br />
<br />
Why? PoTime monk pants only have 38ac on them, why on earth did a Pair of Pants from Velious have 60ac on them?<br />
<br />
The same can be said for many peices of gear, that allowed a monk to reach warrior levels of AC.<br />
<br />
There was another problem though.<br />
<br />
That was the AC Softcap.<br />
<br />
Not only was it quite easy for the highest end monks to reach warrior like AC, but even IF the warriors were at the same level of play, and had AC numbers much higher then the monks, it was meaningless.<br />
<br />
The softcap at the time made higher levels of AC completely redundant, so you had 500 more ac, so what, it changed nothing about the mobs max hit or its DB DI.<br />
<br />
<br />
After this is where me and the previous poster diverge.<br />
<br />
I don't want to be a rogue lite.<br />
<br />
What is the point of that? Even if you brought my Offensive levels up to Rogue levels, how have I gained anything from being a monk.<br />
<br />
I don't want to be a rogue, if i had wanted to be a rogue I would have choose to make that class.<br />
<br />
I want a tanking ability, similar in levels to that of warriors and paladins.<br />
<br />
Now with the game changed as it is, that warriors are reaching 2200ac at PoTime levels, where that AC actually has a meaning, and a PoTime equipped monk, like myself, is reaching only 1700ac fully buffed.<br />
<br />
There is no reason I should not mitigate like a warrior with 1700ac.<br />
<br />
That means I would be mitigating like a warrior, WELL below my level of play.<br />
<br />
I put it to you like this.<br />
<br />
A PoTime equipped warrior does about 135-140 dps whilst tanking, with the right AA.<br />
<br />
A monk at a lower level does about 135-140 dps whilst at the back of a mob.<br />
<br />
No one considers it 'wrong' that a very very high end warrior should be able to match a lower end monk for damage.<br />
<br />
Yet somehow, everyone gets up in arms when a very very high end monk, is able to tank like a lower end warrior.<br />
<br />
I personally find this strange, and difficult to deal with.<br />
<br />
Should I tank like a warrior 2 or 3 teirs below the level I am playing at.<br />
<br />
Damn straight I should.<br />
<br />
Or else what would be the point of working to these high levels?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>trmonk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Also as a quick addition, to give you an idea of how 'well' a monk takes damage now.<br />
<br />
I did a LDoN Raid last night with a mob that AE rampaged, in Quads, for 2k a pop.<br />
<br />
This is the damage string a wizard took.<br />
1290 0215 2005 1485 1810 = 5175<br />
This is the damage string I took.<br />
2182 1012 1532 1662 1727 = 8115<br />
<br />
My comment to the group, after we were talking about the max hit the mob was doing..<br />
<br />
god i hate being a monk sometimes 2182, although handy for finding max hit sometimes :P<br />

<br />
So then, should monks outdamage rogues?<br />
<br />
Obviously, the instinctive reaction is 'hell no!'. So if a monk isn't going to outdamage a rogue, and you don't want to let a monk tank, why the hell would you ever want a monk along?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">In my opinion the debate over the huge monk nerf isn't over, but it should be.  The monk class is destroyed, the fact that people continue to play it never ceases to amaze me.  I'll let others speak to the raiding game but for the casual, bazaar geared game, monks have no role whatsoever.  They are absolutely worthless.<br />
<br />
To put it in perspective, if I have 5 slots in my group and need one more, I will wait and take any class over a monk, even though the monk isn't taking any exp.  A cleric nuking provides more utility than a monk, because the cleric is a better puller than the monk.  <br />
<br />
For the casual player who exps and LDoNs (is that a verb?), let's see what monks bring to the table:<br />
- FD pulling = not needed in PoP due to lull/pacify being more efficient and not needed in LDoN because you WANT 5+ mobs in camp.  AE slow + mez = the rule.<br />
- dps = hahahahahahahahahahahaha, *catches breath*, hahahahahahahahahahaha!  Even w/ a Staff of Flowing Water a monk's dps is still garbage compared to anyone w/ a spellbook.  To do any reasonable damage at all the monk has to have an insane 2 hander AND be behind the mob along w/ the rogues.<br />
- offtanking = not gonna happen in bazaar gear.  I let my shaman offtank adds in LDoN/PoP because slow + Q + root is WAY better offtanking than a monk can ever provide.  Not to mention a bazaar shaman takes less damage than a bazaar monk.  chain &gt; leather, yes, it makes no sense.<br />
<br />
So in summary, if you like the idea of a monk, right on, just be warned that if you don't raid your class is 100% worthless and the only groups you get will be friends who have pity on your gimpness.<br />
<br />
And don't get me started on how gimp warriors are...<br />
<br />
That is all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>trmonk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">I saw someone in this thread earlier make the most ridiculous claim that monks were a support class.<br />
<br />
How the hell we can be a support class when we can do NOTHING to aid any other class in the game, is way beyond me.<br />
<br />
How do I support the cleric? The chanter? The magician? The necro? The ranger, the warrior the bard....etc etc etc.<br />
<br />
With no spell book, the monk class bring NO utility.<br />
<br />
With no utility and every class and their red headed step child coming VERY close to or just plain matching/out performing our DPS and having no tanking ability at the 'average' level of play.<br />
<br />
Where is the monk class?<br />
<br />
What is it good for?<br />
<br />
FD splitting in LDoN is too time consuming considering the time limit, and in most cases irrelevent, in PoP the mobs are well spread out over decently large enough distances that a monk doesn't need to FD split, and in that case, anyone can pull.<br />
<br />
Anything outside of those two places is quite frankly irrelevent, no one exp's outside of PoP but those people &lt; 55. The pre-60 game isn't in as much of a shambles as the 60+ game, it isn't perfect, but it isn't the mess that the game is 60+.<br />
<br />
60+ is where most casters gain their real power, with PoP spells. <br />
60+ is where the mobs went from hitting at 120ish (Fungus Grove/Velk's) for the XP yard trash, to hitting for 580ish (PoV/BoT) for XP yard trash. A near 5 fold increase in offensive damage.<br />
<br />
The game changed drastically for 60+ and it was at this time that Sony decided in their infinite wisdom to change monks.<br />
<br />
You can tell how good their foresight is, because now, after messing with the a class that was deemed in luclin to be a great deal of fun to play and a great class to have with you, has turned that class around so it is the least fun to play in the game (it is very frustrating being weak as those around you are strong) and a class that people are begining to finally understand is completely useless for groups.<br />
<br />
Monks knew the moment the nerf hit what it would mean.<br />
<br />
It is why it is a well known fact that monks have been whining for the past year solid.<br />
<br />
The fact is that monks saw what the future would hold, we knew that when we were hit that people would begin to see the difference and begin to ask why they brought along a monk.<br />
<br />
Parses would start to be taken, tanking would be seen straight away, people would begin to notice that the monk they brought along wasn't killing mobs any faster and tanked very badly.<br />
<br />
As time passed, this is what has happened, when the nerf hit, many said it makes no difference because they were still being chosen for groups, this was because people didn't realise what they were picking.<br />
<br />
Now people are begining to realise exactly what they get when they chose a monk, and they are begining not to.<br />
<br />
Now every class board discussion on balance holds one common theme, despite there being no monks in the discussion.<br />
<br />
Monks are hurting more then any other class and is in need of some serious attention.<br />
<br />
Even the developers at recent events have agreed that whilst all melee is hurting in the game, that monks are in need of the most attention.<br />
<br />
Something monks have known, and been begging for, for a year solid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Kiljaedon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">They could use a minor increase in defense, but I think what monks need is DPS increase, and to be returned to the role of puller as they were in the days of old, because in history it's the only role a monk could identify with, and that's been mostly removed from them. And they lost ground in damaging capabilities... so now they offer no utility and even-for-the-course damage, relatively speaking.<br />
<br />
In reading quotes like this it reminds me back when bards were primary pullers.  Monks literally had taken the puling job away from the bard after the first few months of EQ and even back then bards had the only form of mana regen in which enchanters are best known for in support which is a different subject in itself.  It should be that monks are not the primary pullers of groups because that job should be for the bard.  But I do agree that monks should be the second best sustained melee class for total dps output.</div></div><hr />

You've got to be kidding.  Someone who is in that level of guild should understand that's not proof of monk tanking at all.  You must be a follower.  Max dmg rounds are going to happen at some point in an encounter like that.  The only thing that is proof of is that if you can meet a minimum level of hit points and your healers can keep up with some certain frequency of healing, anyone can tank anything.</div></div><hr />

I suppose about the same time that Shaman started making comments about monks.<br />
<br />
Like the other thread where a Shaman posted the blatantly false information that a monk was tearing thru PoM mobs solo.<br />
<br />
Absolute rubbish.<br />
<br />
Is it surprising that a few monks come and try and point that out? We are not exactly on speaking terms with the Dev's ourselves, Absor refuses point blank to even post on our message boards, so instead he reads others.<br />
<br />
Do WE the monk community REALLY want Absor to come to the Shaman boards and here some shaman spilling forth with a load of crap?<br />
<br />
Is that what we want Absor to be walking back to the Dev's with?<br />
<br />
Absor: So you guys working on the Monk fix?<br />
Devs: Aye we doing that now.<br />
Absor: Well according to the Shaman board a monk can solo in PoM without downtime, so whatever you do, take it easy.<br />
Devs: Ok Boss.<br />
<br />
yeah thanks, we really need that.<br />

As to Vabtoo tanking Fenin, so what, any class with 7khp and a competent CH chain can tank fenin. It has no bearing on Monk tanking ability and is more a showcase for great clerics and the fact that Vabtoo has more Quarm loot then any other single character in EQ...strange that, Vabtoo, Guild Leader of a Merit guild just happens to have more Quarm loot then any other single character in the game.<br />

My reasonining is that in over a year, 3 expansions and many patches later, the monk nerf remains.  It didn't take them over a year and 3 expansions to nerf monks, but all this time and new development and still no fix.  I don't think they know what to do at this point balance wise- if they did it would already be done, even though there's no money in bug/class fixes compared to expansions.  It's not like the monk nerf specifically or the plight of the gimp pure melee in general is costing them money, people just complain, then reroll and start anew (myself included!).<br />
<br />
There are so few non-raiding monks left that I don't think they even care to address the issue anymore, it's not that big of deal to them apparently.</div></div><hr />

No it's not. Consider the classes who can do equal to or better damage than a monk (assuming it's a pickup group with the expectation of reasonable gear and AAs... nothing from Time, some elemental gear).<br />
- Rogue<br />
- Ranger<br />
- Beastlord<br />
- Warrior<br />

The interesting thing isn't that the a monk could tank fennin.<br />
It's that the guild chose a monk to try.  <br />
<br />
POT Uber Guild 01 &quot;Hey fennins such a joke mob.   I wonder for ****s and grins what could we manage to tank it with.&quot;<br />
POT Uber Guild 02 &quot;Hmmm lets do a monk.  We all know they suck and are wet paper bags.  That will be fun.&quot;<br />
POT Uber Guild 03 &quot;Yeah look we're so uber that we can beat fennin with a friggen monk&quot;<br />
POT Uber Guild 04 &quot;Lol.  we rock.&quot;<br />

--------------------------<br />
<br />
Tanking is all about 3 things.<br />
1) Having enough HPS to survive a Damage Spike ((or reasonable now a days having enough Clerics with UD3 that they survive the spike))<br />
2) Having enough healing per second &gt; mobs damage per second<br />
3) Holding Agro.<br />
<br />
I don't find it that hard to believe that any class with enough UD3 Clerics behind them can take fennin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Sharkus Greenfang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">&quot;A BST, Mage, Wizard, Necro, Ranger, Rogue with only bazaar gear and ~50AA can all provide more sustained damage than a Ssra level monk with maxed offensive AA. This is without mentioning the HUGE amount of utility those classes bring to a group.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, different classes peak at different levels and for people with different playing styles.  Wizards for instance are one of the worst damage dealing classes until they break into the 60s, grind a ton of AA's and equip top tier raid gear.  Unless a wizard breaks into that bleeding high end they'll never outdamage a monk with bazaar weapons-- which are incredibly cheap nowadays.<br />
<br />
I'll agree on the pet classes though.  My necro's 61 pet can easily equal or exceed a paladin/SK in group DPS--which is not including the damage I can do with spells on top of that.  Without dropping thousands of plat in the bazaar, farming AA or wearing high quality gear either.</div></div><hr />

You do realize that priests mitigate better than monks and can generate aggro more reliably, right? I'd be willing to bet that a cleric or shaman with 7k unbuffed hit points and full Time gear could pull it off as well. <br />

- So why didn't a well buffed rogue tank it? Or shaman? Because monk's avoidance played a good part in the win.<br />
<br />
Ok, I'm gonna make sure this is loud and clear. MONKS HAVE NO AVOIDANCE ADVANTAGE! Well, at least not insofar as avoidance implies being missed more often than other melee classes. The only reason a monk sees less red spam on their screen is because block fires about 8% of the time, while parry only fires approximately 4% of the time. This has been parsed extensively.<br />

Ummm, why? This is more like a monk, with full NToV armor and Flayed Barbarian Skin Leggings, tanking a named in ToV. The Avatar of War was the toughest single mob in the game at that point. You'd have to be using a monk to tank Time these days to compare. <br />

&quot;Let's put it this way --- I've been clearing the KC jail area trying to get a Tranquil Staff for him.  I buff him up with my shaman buffs, and set him loose on anything that moves.  The mobs are of course slowed.  But I can clear the jail, every roamer, the hands room, the warlord room, and the skelly tower, and never heal my monk once.&quot;<br />
<br />
First, I frankly don't believe this, can any others who plays a a monk do this?  I know I couldn't when my monk was 55.<br />
<br />
Second, How can you compare a 55 monk who has 65 shammy buffs to ones without them?  Try playing your monk without PL'ing him and see in you can find a group in PoP or LDoN (average for me is an hour).  If you do find a group in PoP, try fighting in front of the mob and see how ripostes affect your mitigation-nerfed butt.  My monk has tried to tank in KC and PoP with 5-20kpp worth of gear and was frequently referred to by healers as a mana sponge.<br />
<br />
My monk is my first in EQ and my main, coming up, I had a lot of fun in UGuk, S. Karana, Crystal Caverns and LGuk.  The last nerf came while I was in SolB (around 48) and since then (almost 64 now), I haven't had as much fun playing.<br />
<br />
I would like to see monks and warriors with more useful skills, being nerfed sucks because it takes fun out of the game without making it more fun for anyone.  If SOE believes that monks are overpowered compared to warriors, they should make warriors more powerful.<br />
<br />
I'll probably move from EQ to another game if I can find one that I like mainly because most others think the class is useless and I'm tired of being in &quot;lfg hell&quot; in PoK.<br />

They got nerfed because they could tank better than most plate melee classes due to their ability to avoid a lot of damage.  I have read that monks could buy or loot a lot of all/all items that had tons of HP on them to the point that they could tank better than hybrids =)<br />

Nope, monks never had the hit points of the plate classes. Monks never tanked as well as hybrids. Monks did take damage like hybrids, and were occasionally used as rampage tanks, since they could lose aggro at will.<br />
<br />
Monks do not have some magical avoidance boost. The only reason monks get hit less than plate tanks is because block fires off 8% of the time, while parry fires off 4% of the time.<br />
<br />
This is one of those cases where someone said something about monks having massive avoidance and it sounded reasonable. It was then picked up and repeated until many people started to take it as gospel. Sadly, actual data doesn't back this up.<br />

It was never about hit points. Plate classes always had significantly more hitpoints than monks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Long story short ... If the average monk had &gt; 1k less HP than most plate tanks they wouldn't have been nerfed.<br />
<br />
<br />
The average monk did have more than 1k fewer hit points than plate tanks.<br />

<br />
I was reading about a monk in PoM on these boards somewhere .. he had &gt; 6k HP self buffed .... umm thats a problem.  I think mend is 3/4 heal also ... thats a lot of healing =)<br />
<br />
Mend is a 1/4 heal. If you spend 33 AAs on it, you can make it a 1/2 complete heal that may or may not work (it's about a 55% chance).<br />
<br />
So, for a monk with 6k hit points, you're talking about a 1500 hit point heal once every six minutes. That's equivalent to 25 hp/tick regen. Nice, but hardly game breaking.<br />
<br />
If your magelo is correct, and you're at 55, I can see how you'd think that 6k hit points was absurd. If you look at the level of gear that TRMonk is sporting, he's still behind all the plate tanks by a fair margin. A time geared warrior can run 8-9k hit points self buffed, and have an extra 200-300 AC to boot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People who say monk were overpowered were envious of the few ubber monks.  That is a very small percentage of the monk community.<br />
<br />
Folks focused on the elite while they kicked the teeth in of the &quot;average&quot; monk.  The nerf bat did not hit the elite hardest, it hit the mid level monks.  I HAD a monk.  The nerf had the biggest impact on mid-level (60) monks with low AA and moderate gear.  That was me.  <br />
<br />
I retired, leveled my shaman to 65, and now have a useful and fun class to play.  I miss my monk, they were special, useful and if played well added value ot a team.  But now he can't solo most mobs, was lfg for hours, and added the least value to a group compared to all other classes... Well I can bind wound to full hit points... would that be my ticket into a group?  :rolleyes: <br />

Aye, I know.  But, just like every class, they overdo it.  Others have gained more than monks, but only the nerf actually reduced monk effectiveness.  A monk on the day after the nerf did exactly the same dps as they did the day before.  Monks haven't gained what the others have, but they didn't loose it either.  This is exactly the same issue warriors have, this is the same issue with clerics and druids.  And this is the same issue with shaman and every other slowing class.  Everyone got upgrades to slow except the prime slowers.<br />
<br />
But, I'm just not buying it.  As of level 61, I simply cannot beat monk/rogue/beastlords for dps.  If I blow off my mana pool on a single pull, I can spit out pox, bane of nife,e-bolt and hit spear of torment till the mob is dead.  At the same time, I'm grouping with monks who can come close to that(I wont talk about the guy who hit in 200's constantly) and keep going, and going, and going.....</div></div><hr />

I believe we've already covered that Time geared monks are a) in the minority and b) not having the troubles that the average-geared ones are.<br />
<br />
Monks with the best weapon available before the &quot;wall&quot; of solro, great staff of the 4 winds, are doing about 100-110 with full haste and FA.  So can we stop with the ridiculous dps examples plz, or at least clarify that you are not talking about monks in general with those numbers, but a very small subset with the best weapons available.<br />
<br />
PS:  GSo4W is warrior usable as well.  You know the difference between a warrior using it and a monk?  Monks hit for max of 283, warriors hit for max of 279.  So much for monks outdamaging warriors by 20%.<br />

Tweadle, this is exactly what I was talking about, there is no reason to pick monk above other dps.  By the same token, there is NO reason to take shaman above other slowers.  There is no reason to take warriors above other tanks, etc...<br />
Just last night doing pov razors, we had a beastlord tanking, two monks and a sometimes ld mage for dps and myself healing with a enchanter slowing (he insisted).

<br />
Right, 'cause chain casting Turgur's with no mana cost and a three second cast time won't build up any aggro. A tanking monk spends a good chunk of time stunned and unable to generate aggro as well. Regardless of whether you have a shaman or a monk tanking, your guild members will have to *gasp* control their aggro! <br />
<br />
Dunno about you, but with maxxed channelling and the appropriate AAs and positioning, I manage to get off spells though a metric assload of damage taken. If you should happen to be an Ogre, then things are much, much better of course.<br />
<br />
Neither class makes for a good raid level tank, and either would only be used as such in situations where your raid force is insanely overpowered compared to your target. Period.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u108"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p108">No it's not. Consider the classes who can do equal to or better damage than a monk (assuming it's a pickup group with the expectation of reasonable gear and AAs... nothing from Time, some elemental gear).<br />
- Rogue<br />
- Ranger<br />
- Beastlord<br />
- Warrior<br />
- Necro<br />
- Mage<br />
- Wizard<br />
- Enchanter (provided he has his charm AAs)<br />
<br />
Now consider what else each of these classes bring to the table...<br />
I think I'd add sk to that list of classes to take over monk for dps slot.  If your group is caster heavy, Zevfeer's provide FT10 to the group which ups all the caster's dps/efficiency.  If the group is melee heavy, Aura of Hate adds roughly 87-130 attack to the group (it has a recourse so it degrades), which ups the group's aggregate dps.  Those two spells alone I would think would push the group's efficiency/dps higher with the sk than it would w/ a monk.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u109"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p109">Monks WERE unbalanced, but SoE did it's typical nerf and overdid it by a long shot.  I'm tempted to say the later correction was adequate as far as retuning monks tanking abilities to where it should be but I don't know enough to be sure about it.  The NEW imbalance is that monks no longer hold a solid DPS advantage over warriors due to stupid itemization in PoP and on top of that pacify changes made FD pulling obsolete in a lot of areas thus further reducing the need for a monk in a raid or xp group.  <br />
<br />
Monks don't need better tanking abilities, they were never meant to be main tanks.  They wear leather for a reason.  Monks need help with their DPS and some sort of specialty role to fill the gap left when FD pulling went out the window. Whether that means changing things around such that FD pulling becomes a more viable tactic or some new ability, I dunno... but as is a monk doesn't really offer anything special to a group in most cases.  DPS wise their not solidly enough above warriors in many cases and rangers/rogues certainly offer better DPS and/or utility.  As already mentioned FD pulling is pretty much dead anymore with pacify being so powerful (a mistake IMO since ENC and CLR certainly had plenty to offer any group or raid without pacify)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u110"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p110">Sometimes, I wonder just how much of the balancing issue is the simple fact that we're playing three different games.  The solo, group and raid games are so much different that I'm not sure that they CAN ever be reconciled.<br />
I will agree that monks, along with warrior &amp; rogue, need some work.  But, 'balancing' them against that 5k crit nuke that just scrolled by simply isnt reasonable.  A wizard in raid conditions gains vastly more power than an average wizard in a group.  A melee player might gain a couple more buffs, but basically they are the same in both situations.  Upping melee to match what a raid wizard is capable will make then overpowered in groups.<br />
The perception of powerlessness, however the reality, is based on the damage shown by top damage dealers in (at least near) ideal circumstances.  For a pure melee, simply having a shaman in the group means you're already at or near peak power.  In that circumstance, a wiz will throw his nuke or two and med, a melee keeps generating dps.  Not as much, true, but continuous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u111"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p111">The original FD nerf should probably be re-examined considering the changes to pacify.  I think the nerf to monks was correct at the time - when hit, they should get hit hard (they're wearing leather pajamas).  BST's should fall under the same restrictions as monks AC wise.  Both classes should take damage, when they get hit, like a Druid.<br />
<br />
Monks should block, parry, dodge, riposte (especially with a buck-and-a-quarter staff) better than they do currently, though - that is supposedly their specialty.  The slight advantage they have in this area over other classes isn't providing that &quot;master&quot; effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u112"><b>Rgallnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p112">Whoever said that monks werent supposed to be tanks?  Hmm...I think that I missed that memo.  They were supposed to be a soloist class...kinda like a necro.  The only way for a monk to be able to solo was to be able to take damage.  Now...Monks...even if their role was changed to be the 4th tank in the game (really thats the only role they can have now that would make sense anymore)  they would still be the worse tank to have in any circumstance.  They have absolutely no way to gain aggro...even warriors have Taunt (albeit taunt is a failure).  <br />
<br />
Dont talk about realism to me either.  There is no freaking way that your justification for monks not being able to take damage like another class is because they wear leather armor.  So EQ is realistic now?  We could cast spells at one point?  We could go to another plane and fight gods in RL?  This is a freaking fantasy world.  I cant see another role that a monk can have aside from being the 4th tank anymore.  I played a monk for almost 3 years...not so fun anymore because I loved soloing.  Of course once I hit 60 those days were long over...that was around the time of the nerf.  Now my monky sits at 65 with 76AAs and I cant seem to get motivated to continue to play him.  Now to the description of what a monk is for the people that didnt make their character based on what the book told ya.<br />
<br />
Monks devote their energies to the pursuit of physical perfection, shaping their very bodies into deadly machines.  Monks are a melee class with the ability to wear leather armor, weild blunt weapons, and use narmed combat styles.<br />
<br />
Monks forego heavy armor and almost all weapons in order to hone themselves into masters of combat, using their fists and a stout staff to make their mark upon Norrath.  Monks can learn many special attacks to enhance their damage dealing abilities, including the dragon punch and the legendary flying kick.<br />
<br />
In their martial studies monks also learn other useful skills, including the ability to move silently and fall safely from great heights.  Experienced monks also learn to feign death, slowing their body's functions enough to fool most observers into believing them dead - this trick often allows the monk to escape dangerous situations as monsters wander off thinking the monk defeated.  <br />
<br />
Monks are a specialist class, focusing on physical combat to the exclusion of all else.  Monks provide a powerful ally in a group, thought its not unusual to see a monk adventuring alone.  The monk is a good choice for players who enjoy a strong offensive role in combat and leading groups in their dungeon adventures.<br />
<br />
Sounds like a pretty fun class eh?  Now to pick this apart a bit.  FD is great but it sure as hell doesnt make the mob believe we are dead.  Stand up before the mob gets back to spawn point once you FDed and he comes a running from holy hell...even though he cant see you...to kill you.  Hmm...something wrong there.  But I forgot ...EQ is realistic lol.  Not unusual to see a monk adventuring alone...maybe early in his life but ANY class can solo early on.  Being a good choice for players who enjoy a strong offensive role in combat?  Sometimes...but for the most part everyone has caught up to the monk in dps.  Leading groups in their dungeon adventures???   This is certainly no longer the case.  Now I play my monk as a puller/offtank.  Thats the role that I have learned to play and like.  Take away those and what are we left with?  A company that has lied to us. <br />
<br />
On the other hand I would hate to see any other classses get nerfed.  I think reversing the monk nerf completely would be the best thing Sony could do period.  Itemization has fixed what was broken with the monk class.  Monks should take damage better than just about any other class aside from plate classes.  We focus are bodies to sustain this damage.  We focus on physical combat to the exclusion of all else.  Beastlords dont do that...rangers dont do that...hell...shaman dont do that either.  Thanks for reading my post.<br />

- I'll take high avoidance vs unnerfed mitigation ANY time of the day. Having block and double dodge and monk HP is far better than having virtually no defensive skill and a bit better mitigation. With avoidance you can actually live through rounds that will be a one rounder for a priest. Erm ogre cleric. If Fennin wouldn't be dishing out a metric crapload ton of damage than I'll say yeah, maybe a plate priest or extremely well equipped shaman could tank it. No wait, he couldn't hold aggro, lemme rephrase that, he could tank it until someone gets aggro and wipes raid. Call me crazy but when CH lands every single round, I rather prefer avoiding that 3k melee hit instead of getting hit for a mitigated 3k.<br />
<br />
Right, 'cause chain casting Turgur's with no mana cost and a three second cast time won't build up any aggro.<br />
<br />
A tanking monk spends a good chunk of time stunned and unable to generate aggro as well.<br />
- Swinging weapons = aggro. Most melee can use 2 thus automatically generating a ****load more aggro than a priest meleeing. Not to mention melee damage you can't even compare and 2x the procs the melee gets in vs priest ... erm ogre cleric. Melee side holding aggro is trivial for a dual wielding double attacking melee. However, in your brilliant example, the shaman will be using a 3 sec cast spell and praying whatever God he beleives in that it will actually be able to channel it. Your entire priest argument starts to shift towards ogres. Ogre cleric eh? Oh wait, clerics don't have mana free Tugur ... Not to mention, the other day I  didn't pull aggro of a warrior tanking Air boss in Time despite after being 2nd on aggro list and ~4000 mana worth of casts of Tugur until it landed. Tugur is not the be all end all aggro builder, infact any class doing good damage can pull off aggro from you and then you die, raid dies and you look funny because a 7k pries...erm ogre shaman can tank Fennin.<br />
<br />
 Regardless of whether you have a shaman or a monk tanking, your guild members will have to *gasp* control their aggro! <br />
- Where is your cleric building aggro in your situation?  Oh yes, he is going to use his uber 10 hour cast time 30 week recycle time nukes eh?<br />
<br />
 If you should happen to be an Ogre, then things are much, much better of course.<br />
- Ogre cleric?<br />
<br />
Neither class makes for a good raid level tank, and either would only be used as such in situations where your raid force is insanely overpowered compared to your target. Period.<br />
- That's the only thing I can agree with, not to mention I still find it ridiculous to suggest a 7k cleric/shaman could tank Fennin.<br />
<br />
<br />
To sum it up, your 7k cleric has to be ogre and chain cast Tugur's Insects and hope it actually lands and that he can hold aggro by letting everyone in the raid do 1 dps. Great plan. On the other hand, a competent guild with an extremely well equipped monk tanks Fennin, a situation that in a month or 2, every time guild could replicate.</div></div><hr />

Monks are generally not needed or wanted when a wizard/mage/ranger/rogue is available.<br />
<br />
i usually always welcome a Monk if we have room, even with all of those in grp (tho don't do much w/o Cleric  :D ) because sure, Mages and Wizzies can nuke for lots. sure, ROgues have BS and do ltos of dmg, but it takes a while for timer to refresh (not a LONG time, but too long IMO). and sure Rangers can do very good dmg with AA Archery and the rite gear. alot of classes can do uber dmg with killer gear. It's the DPS that i like. <br />
<br />
i feel that Monks can do ALOT of DPS, but some classes CAN out-dmg then. take 1 toon of each class, give them even gear, so they have same stats (or about same) and i guarantee a few would DESTROY the others. i'm not saying that gear is evrything, but it DOES HELP. i have lv 51 Shammy, and kno that with my gear i could out DPS a Monk fairly easily (i kno it's not great but a 24.sumtin dps DoT isn't bad. and with Slow, pet, Haste, buffs, and evry other spells, we could do better than Monks and alot of other classes) i myself played a monk for a while, but didn't play him much, and ended up making him a Rogue after i played my uncle's 8P (was fun hiding/sneaking/pickpocketing in PC) and also saw that BS is quite nice, but not high dps. dps is wut kills the mob IMO. if u take any other melee class that does about 2dps (but really nice hits, at slow atk rate), and a monk that does 50dps, which fight would last longer ? the Warrior. that also means less mana cast on heals, slowing the mob (go Shammies), and all that good stuff.<br />
<br />
my point here is (yes there's a point) is that i see nothing wrong with having a Monk that could solo Naggy and Vox in the same week, or solo some uber Dragon. that's jsut faster exp in groups for us 8). besides...are the classes really balanced NOW ?<br />

No wait, he couldn't hold aggro, lemme rephrase that, he could tank it until someone gets aggro and wipes raid. Call me crazy but when CH lands every single round, I rather prefer avoiding that 3k melee hit instead of getting hit for a mitigated 3k.<br />
<br />
Right, because everyone knows how uber warriors are at aggro generation! Surely there's no way a class that relies on spells for aggro could ever outaggro a warrior! <br />
<br />
<br />
- Swinging weapons = aggro. Most melee can use 2 thus automatically generating a ****load more aggro than a priest meleeing. Not to mention melee damage you can't even compare and 2x the procs the melee gets in vs priest ... erm ogre cleric. Melee side holding aggro is trivial for a dual wielding double attacking melee. However, in your brilliant example, the shaman will be using a 3 sec cast spell and praying whatever God he beleives in that it will actually be able to channel it. Your entire priest argument starts to shift towards ogres. Ogre cleric eh? Oh wait, clerics don't have mana free Tugur ... Not to mention, the other day I  didn't pull aggro of a warrior tanking Air boss in Time despite after being 2nd on aggro list and ~4000 mana worth of casts of Tugur until it landed. Tugur is not the be all end all aggro builder, infact any class doing good damage can pull off aggro from you and then you die, raid dies and you look funny because a 7k pries...erm ogre shaman can tank Fennin.<br />
<br />
Tell ya what, you dual wield two proccing weapons. I'll chain cast turgur's. We'll see who gets aggro. I find it extemely funny that you would even argue this, given all the fuss over the current state of suck that is warrior aggro generation. I mean, if you can pull aggro off a class chain casting turgur's simply by dual wielding, than surely warrior aggro generation is just fine. Obviously, holding aggro is not trivial for a quadding melee. If it was, Knights wouldn't be the preferred tank.<br />
<br />
Just for the record, I never specified &quot;cleric&quot;. Clearly an y priest chain casting Turgur's or existing as an Ogre would be a shaman. Druids and Clerics aren't exactly hurting for aggro generation either. <br />
<br />
The question is not whether or not a melee class could pull aggro off a priest, but whether or not a priest could hold aggro. I'm quite certain they could, given a modicum of discipline amongst the raid force. Yeah, rogues and monks would have to evade, wizards would need to use concussion, but holding aggro shouldn't be that big of an issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
- Where is your cleric building aggro in your situation?  Oh yes, he is going to use his uber 10 hour cast time 30 week recycle time nukes eh?<br />
<br />
<br />
Right, because Clerics don't have any fast casting spells that draw aggro! They don't have blind or fear, or anything like that!<br />
<br />
<br />
- Ogre cleric?<br />
<br />
<br />
Ogre shaman?<br />
<br />
<br />
- That's the only thing I can agree with, not to mention I still find it ridiculous to suggest a 7k cleric/shaman could tank Fennin.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why not? Better mitigation, comparable AC, and hit points. No big deal. You act like this is some sort of ridiculously uber feat. It's not.<br />
<br />
<br />
To sum it up, your 7k cleric has to be ogre and chain cast Tugur's Insects and hope it actually lands and that he can hold aggro by letting everyone in the raid do 1 dps. Great plan. On the other hand, a competent guild with an extremely well equipped monk tanks Fennin, a situation that in a month or 2, every time guild could replicate.<br />
<br />
Ummm, no. It's entirely irrelevant as to whether or not any of the spells the hypothetical tank priest lands. A bounced slow generates plenty of aggro, as any shaman should know. Any competent monk, rogue, ranger, or wizard can do plenty of DPS and draw minimal aggro. Hell, a monk can do max DPS and never even come close to drawing aggro- Feign Death may not be all that for pulling these days, but it's tough to beat as an aggro reducer.<br />
<br />
The only guilds that can replicate this feat are the ones that award a monk all the Quarm gear he wants. I don't see this happening in most guilds, do to there being a variety of methods in place to distribute loot instead of concentrating it on a handful of toons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right, because Clerics don't have any fast casting spells that draw aggro! They don't have blind or fear, or anything like that!<br />
- I would pay to see Fennin running amok your CH chain after blind and AEing the raid because of blind. That would be great to see! Funny you mention blind, a few month ago a monk pulled a mini onward Fennin and the mini ran off because it was blinded. <br />
<br />
Ummm, no. It's entirely irrelevant as to whether or not any of the spells the hypothetical tank priest lands. A bounced slow generates plenty of aggro, as any shaman should know. <br />
- I am not talking about resisted slow. I am talking about interrupts. Whenever you like to admit it or not when you get quadded repeatedly nearly ever 2 seconds for 1K+ a pop you are going to get interrupted a LOT. This is where you will lose aggro and wipe the raid because your ONLY means of aggro generation is a 3 second cast spell that does ZERO damage. When you compare it to Vabtoo, he has 2 weapons (lots of aggro from swings alone), probably some procs on them (spell + damage aggro) not to mention melee damage aggro. He has THREE methods of building hate, you have one and a half. Thus a shaman or cleric can't pull off the same feat as Vabtoo. This shaman and cleric will need a significantly better CH chain and a much much lower raid DPS. Lower raid DPS = zerg^2 numbers or more or your clerics are going to run out of mana.<br />

When guilds were done farming VT, most core players in them had 10+ VT items, out of it 3-4 Aten items. Seeing that next raid expansion is out in ... 5-6 months, that will give guilds more than enough time to have every member with 12+ Time loot and probably 5+ Quarm.

Yep, avoidance is entirely, 100%, utterly irrelevant! If Fennin isn't doing enough damage, even with a full round of max hits, to kill his target, and you have a CH landing every round, then it doesn't matter at all whether or not you avoid every hit, or none at all.<br />

<br />
Well, obviously a warrior can generate enough aggro to tank Fennin, without any LDoN augments. It's been done in the past a few times. So, you're saying that a priest can't outaggro a warrior if the priest tries? <br />
<br />
Please at least try not to descend into absurdity.<br />

Please, please tell me that you have a better understanding of game mechanics than this. I'd hate to think that elementary, low level spells were so woefully misunderstood. I'm going to chalk this one up to you being deliberately obtuse because you couldn't find a rational response.<br />

- I am not talking about resisted slow. I am talking about interrupts. Whenever you like to admit it or not when you get quadded repeatedly nearly ever 2 seconds for 1K+ a pop you are going to get interrupted a LOT.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately that's not what you said. &quot;Landed&quot; implies that a spell took effect, not simply that it was cast.<br />
<br />
This is where you will lose aggro and wipe the raid because your ONLY means of aggro generation is a 3 second cast spell that does ZERO damage.<br />
<br />
Damage is irrelevant. Only aggro matters for the tank. Shaman have a few other spells they could use as well. I simply chose clickable Turgur's as one example. Believe it or not, you can channel through that much damage with a reasonable success rate. Yes, as I mentioned before, your guild will have to work harder to control aggro. As I also mentioned before, you're not using a monk or a priest to tank Fennin for the sake of efficiency. You do it because you've reduced him to a trivial fight, and are messing around.<br />
 <br />
<br />
When you compare it to Vabtoo, he has 2 weapons (lots of aggro from swings alone), probably some procs on them (spell + damage aggro) not to mention melee damage aggro. He has THREE methods of building hate, you have one and a half.<br />
<br />
Well, a monk can bind wounds, mend, AND cast healing spells. That's three methods of healing! Clerics can only cast spells and bind wounds! That's only two methods of healing! Don't be silly.<br />
<br />
Thus a shaman or cleric can't pull off the same feat as Vabtoo. This shaman and cleric will need a significantly better CH chain and a much much lower raid DPS. Lower raid DPS = zerg^2 numbers or more or your clerics are going to run out of mana.<br />
<br />
I'm assuming you're being deliberately obtuse again. Of course you're going to be less efficient doing it this way. If Fennin was even remotely challenging for your guild, you'd use a warrior or maybe a knight to tank him. You goof around with monks and priests tanking when an encounter is so ridiculously easy for you that you can win with hideous efficiency.<br />
<br />
Note that your monks can still operate at max DPS, your rogues can do the majority of their DPS, your rangers can plink away to their heart's content, and your wizards can still do the majority of their DPS.<br />
<br />
I'll say this one more time for the cheap seats: TRIVIAL ENCOUNTER.<br />
<br />
It doesn't require zerg squared forces, and your clerics won't run out of mana because you're vastly overpowered compared to your target.<br />
<br />
<br />
- Thus my comment that in about a month or two, maybe a tad bit more, guilds can easily have Fennin killed and tanked by a monk, beastlord, knight or maybe even a ranger.

Just because a guild did it early doesn't mean others won't/can't do it in a few months.<br />
<br />
So, in a timeframe of the next two months, how many guilds per server do you expect to be farming Quarm?<br />
<br />
I'd venture to guess that at most an average of two guilds per server can afford to goof around with Fennin. Sure, down the line this will become more and more common, but not in the immediate future. Of course, druids can tank NToV with ease these days too. Perhaps they're a godly class now that they too can tank old content!</div></div><hr />

Sure thats 1 Expansion, but I'd say thats Vindis trivial level<br />

to a guild that farmed Time through Quarm.<br />

<br />
2ndly, I find your judgement of comparing old content vs new content strictly in Expansion terms some what flawed.  There is pure time dimension and AA grinding dimension.<br />
<br />
Given Elemental Level XP, the other way of looking at this, is POP is already HUNDREDS of AA's &quot;old&quot;.  More than Velious was old compared to<br />
end of luclin by a long shot.  When you can grind AAs 5* faster than Luclin.  You are growing in power by leaps and bounds.<br />
<br />
We're also not even talking the power of those added AAs, and spells yet<br />

Umm, yeah. Even with that uber block firing off at a full 8%, the monk is still going to see full rounds for max damage. The key is the ability to survive one such round. Once you have that capability, it's just a matter of supplying sufficient healing.<br />

Right. Just tons of upgraded gear. In Velious, I suppose that it was just wrong for a shaman to tank Yeldema, then? After all, it's a Velious dragon! <br />

Just because you say it's wrong for a monk to tank an underpowered mob doesn't make it so. The fact of the matter is that Arch Overseers was going back and clobbering content that they were significantly overpowered for.

Umm, the only 'flaw' you pointed out is in your own knowledge of the game's mechanics. Blind and Fear are both perfectly viable methods for maintaining aggro, as long as you know how they work.<br />
<br />
<br />
Then when I point out your obvious hypocrisy you no longer think I was being a bad evil mofo:  I'll stand by every one of them, except the part where I assumed you were being deliberately obtuse<br />
<br />
<br />
I never thought you were a 'bad evil mofo', just horribly wrong. You've done nothing to dispell this belief thus far.<br />
<br />
<br />
Then of course back to cleric again: What Vabtoo did could be done by a comparably geared cleric or shaman.<br />
<br />
It's not like I ever abandoned the idea of a cleric being able to tank. I just happened to use a shaman as a specific example. I coudl do the same thing with a cleric. <br />
<br />
<br />
When you actually learn the basic concept of Integrity and Consistancy, give me a call will ya? Oh and make sure you understand YOUR OWN POSTS too. All right?<br />
<br />
There's no inconsistency in moving from the general to the specific when using an example. Just because I mentioned a shaman specifically at one point, doesn't restrict my argument to shaman and only shaman throughout it's entirety.</div></div><hr />
