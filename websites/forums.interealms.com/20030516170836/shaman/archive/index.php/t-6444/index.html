<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mmshah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was hoping someone had a mod to display the Can V tiimer countdown that is displayed when u check on it in ure AA window, displayable in a window thats always up.  <br />
<br />
Ive seen the timer mods out there but I dont want to have to reset it every time I use Can V, would rather just see the countdown at all times that resets automatically when the ablitiy is used so I know ahead of time that I need to use up some mana etc.<br />
<br />
Anyway if someone has mod like this plz respond.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">check this timer you may like it.......<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mmshah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ya ive checked that one out, but not really what I was hoping for.  Just want that AA timer countdown that I see when I click on Can V to displayed by itself somewhere on my main playing area without having to open up the AA window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The timer currently can not be removed from the aa window. The game is hard coded to look for it there and update it there. Anywhere else and you just an empty text field.</div></div><hr />

This was one of the first things I tired to do when the new UI came out. No way it can be done unfortunately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>mmshah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Could one hack the AA window to bits, throw out all the other stuff and just display the timer part?  If it was a small window that would mimic the effect of what Im describing could just load up the default ui whenever u wanted to train a skill then go back to the hacked one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You cannot designate which AA ability is selected on startup of the EQ client, so this wouldn't be possible.<br />
<br />
It might be possible to do something like this if you didn't mind doing some clicking to get it set up every time you started the client.<br />
<br />
I wish there was a way to do it where it would default to a specific timed AA, but it just can't be done in the current UI environment.<br />
<br />
If they assigned a type number to each timer based AA  then it could be done easily.</div></div><hr />
