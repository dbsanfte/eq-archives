<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just got 59 and my guild had 2 malo's drop. they will go to the next oracles , so im going to level hardcore to get them cause there is a few other 59 shaman.  Chardok i was pulling 1 blue a hour at 58, seems my soloing ability is leveling off. Zones like CT give me about the same XP. Problem is finding a group in those zones. <br />
<br />
Is there a way to make more then 1 blue a hour at 59 ?<br />
<br />
I dont care if its grouped or not. Infact bolth methods would be cool.<br />
<br />
this is just 59-60 mind you ;) <br />
<br />
I promise this is my last sub 60 level question  =x</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grimthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did 59 in a week, played probably about 20 hours.  Mainly doing longish sessions in upper spiders in Velks and Juggs/Crypt in Sebilis.  You need a group for both - go heavy on melee in Velks, you will need some form of crowd control in the Sebilis camps.  The reason you need to do long sessions is that it will take you some time to get the camp, and to get bedded into a good rhythm.<br />
<br />
If you can get there, a duo/trio in Juggs can work wonders (with a rogue and monk ideally).  Get the monk to pull, then you slow, and root tank for the rogue and monk.  Once they are slowed they don't do that much damage (I have a fungi, and was buffing with bear form and regrowth) and since the monk and rogue are both attacking from behind, they take the juggs down quite fast.  You can also throw some DoTs in if you have the mana for it.<br />
<br />
If you really feel brave grab a strong monk and go duo in the castle in Velks.  I was getting 1% of level 59 per kill.  We broke in with a group, and then camped in Velketor's room (he was not up) and pulled to there.  We handled single and double pulls easily, triples with a little bit of thinking.  There is a passage behind the throne that leads to the Crystal Eyes camp, so you can get to the zone fast if you need to.<br />
<br />
I found 59 MUCH easier than 58.  But I was racing against a rogue guildie to get to 60 first.  You have a similar incentive - go for it, and good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jenoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Try to fight mobs that are 55 and up (the exp bonus on these are sweet, bout 3% aaxp per kill)<br />
<br />
Deep chardok (group): Got a friend that swears by this, lots of weak high level mobs, get some decent dps buddies and turn the place into a cemetary<br />
<br />
Maidens eye (solo or group): Go south from the dps ent until you have a field with lots of bones on your left. Several static spawns of skellies on the ground, alot of which are 55-56. Get a druid/necro/chanter partner and have them charm things.<br />
<br />
The Grey (solo or group): Skellies in the southwest corner, stuff at the temple or sun revs at the pool (always lvl 55, fairly high hp)</div></div><hr />

I believe so.  Don't ask me what it is though!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It &quot;doesn't&quot; have an exp bonus, but there is the affect that it does. I really wanted to go to deep chardok before PoP but it doesn't look likr that it gonna happen</div></div><hr />

<br />
a couple of weekends ago, i did 4 yellows of 57 in two sessions - an 8hr on saturday and an 6 hr on sunday.  <br />
<br />
this comes from someone who ding'd 56 in february, then ding'd 57 in september and spent most of the month in the first yellow.  <br />
<br />
druud, shaman, pally, ranja, chanty, warrior...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Haack90</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">doing katta graveyard I was about to get 1 blue every 22 minutes there are 8 gargoyles there on a 11 minute timer I would do 4 at a time by slowing epic and letthing them rot I would get between 2 and 2 and half blue per hour at lvl 59.  I had a cleric sitting on the side lines doing a complete heal between groups of 4 with out the cleric I would guess I could get between one and half to two blue a hour there<br />
<br />
it is late and grammer doesn't mean much to me right about now<br />
<br />
lvl 60 shaman slavage povar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Litgruv, what was your method of getting to 60 quick? <br />
<br />
Haack90, I have been trying to gargoyles alast couple times and I have a question.. You only use epic on them, no bane or e-bolt? My dots get a lot of resists but with epic it seems like it would be pretty slow. I got about 1 blue an hour so I must be doing something wrong.<br />
 <br />
I am 58 now BTW</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Does that mean your Jagged Pine camp is open now Largus?  Woot got somewhere new to solo! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">yeah xertt, you can have JP. Too many LB at 58. About half of the warriors are LB now. Send me a tell in game sometime and I will tell/show you good spots in there.</div></div><hr />

dang thats three.<br />
All  1st tier planes are pure heaven as far as exp goes, Disease getting a slight edge. Just look up all the people LFG, get a group together and kick some ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Arctycwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I was getting crazy exp in PoN duoing with a druid.  They charm a blood raven to tank.  Then they pull with snare, I would slow and they would root while the raven tanked.  I would throw on dots as mana permitted.  I was getting like 2% per 3 kills in reg exp in level 58.  Not sure how the exp is in 59 duoing yet, haven't had the time to try it since hitting 59, but I would recommend it.  I had a guildie shammy go from 55 to 61 in about a week and a half duoing with a druid.  Would probably work with a chanter pretty well to.</div></div><hr />
