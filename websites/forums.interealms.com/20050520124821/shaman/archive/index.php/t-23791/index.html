<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For some stupid reason, my log-in to SOE is not being completed. It says I am logged in, but then I cant get to the Forums. I wish to post this information.<br />
<br />
Gonna run some rough numbers, based on that post on Steel Warriors about the group that ground their way to lvl 70 in PoFire, and counted the mobs. Here is the post, first of all:<br />
<br />
A group of Altera Vita guildmates and myself just completed a 21.5 hour exp grind to ding us all level 70. So i thought i'd post and share some data with everyone that's interested in what they can expect.<br />
<br />
First, the entire grind was done in PoFire in teh second castle. All mobs were level 68. The exact time of the grind took 21:38:40 (rounded to the nearest :05). We killed 1255 mobs. That averages to 0.3195% reg exp/mob and 0.30877%exp/minute.<br />
<br />
here's teh breakdown in # of mobs it took to ding each level.<br />
<br />
67 - 261<br />
68 - 291<br />
69 - 332<br />
70 - 371<br />
<br />
Additionally, AA exp on these mobs at lvl 70 was right at 4%/mob as compared to 5%/mob at 65.<br />
<br />
I hope this information proves useful and informative to those heading out this week to grind it out.<br />
<br />
Kakgumu<br />
<br />
So, assuming the poster was a no-penalty class/race, for the sake of ease. The 261 mobs it took for him to get to 67, x 1.2 = 313 mobs for me, a Troll Shaman to go to 67. At 5% AA XP per mob, thats 2.6 AA's worth of XP EXTRA it costed me. 67 to 68 is 2.9 AA worth. 68 to 69 is 3.3 AA extra. 69 to 70 is 3.7 extra. Lets add it up. <br />
<br />
It will cost me the equilivant of TWELVE AA POINTS to get from 65 to 70. If there is a SINGLE person in this ENTIRE game that thinks this is even REMOTELY fair, then I would be totally flabergasted.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tracce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm sorry, but if I understand you properly, you want the racial xp penalty removed from the game, possibly at the high end, perhaps for all levels. I do not support this petition. Racial xp penalties are in place due to certain races having certain benifits that other races do not. For example, Iksar have improved vision, higher natural ac, regen, and the inate ability to forage. Ogre's get improved vision, and the inability to be stunned from the front. I'm not going to list all the benifits that the races that have an xp penalty recieve, but I'm sure that you are all aware of them. The reason that I can not support your petition is that the penalty is how you pay for these advantages. Perhaps they are not as strong in the high end game as they were when you were a noobling, but you still have them. Think of it this way, you are paying for the advantage that you had when you were lower level. I don't know how many time i got lost in the dark tunnels when I was low lvl, trying to go from Everfrost to Black Burrow. You would have had no problem accomplishing such at low levels. Now you must pay for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hey Trace,<br />
<br />
As you posted in the other racial penalties post that mearly discussed the topic, you stated - I'm sorry, but if I understand you properly, you want the racial xp penalty removed from the game, possibly at the high end, perhaps for all levels.... <br />
You also stated - I did read the thread. Both before AND after posting..... <br />
To you all I have to say is, impossible.  You couldn't have read all the posts and arrived at your conclusion unless you hadn't taken the time to read all of them and try to understand them as well.  Getting lost in level 6 in Black Burrow in no way constitues paying 12-15 AA more in level 66-70 alone.  Would you pay that to have avoided that hastle in those early levels?<br />
<br />
I mean you no direct insult, but I am assuming that you made your desicion in haste.  The truth of the matter is that the racial penalties are in fact outdated and at some point the knight XP penalty was reviewed and revoked.<br />
<br />
We are NOT asking for the penalty to be removed, just re-thought and scaled according to the value of the cost.<br />
<br />
I hope that I have opened your mind a little to our cause.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It should be fully removed.<br />
<br />
Tell me why, as a Barbarian, I level 10% slower than any halfling in the game? Because I can slam?<br />
<br />
Why should a trollish guildie level 15% slower than I do, when his regeneration has been nerfed due to regen changes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">/concur Brother.<br />
<br />
The racial penalties are out of date and no longer accurately represent the benefits once received.<br />
<br />
Good luck Blazz!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Iksar get a great benefit of AC and regen. Most people would pay alot of AA for those same benefits. The XP penalty is more than adequate payment. The only way this would be remotely fair, especially after most of us have levelled, is if you gave the regen and AC to everyone, or took it away from Iksar/Troll completely. Yes I do want that regen and AC and think it would be ****ed up if they completely removed the payment you had to pay for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The argument is that certain races get benefits that enable them to survive better, and therefore die less, and therefore level faster.  To keep things balanced, these races should pay an exp penalty.<br />
<br />
But there are plenty of inherent racial benefits, all of which can be utilized to level more quickly.  Why is it that some of them are singled out for the exp penalty?<br />
<br />
Halflings get innate sneak/hide:  which means they can avoid dying in certain places, and therefore they can level faster:  and they pay no exp penalty for this.<br />
<br />
Wood elfs get innate forage:  which means they can gather items to sell to other players, make money earlier than other races, and buy better armor sooner, and therefore they can level faster:  and they pay no exp penalty for this.<br />
<br />
Humans get good faction most places:  which means that the guards are more likely to step in and save them from dying, and therefore they can level faster:  and they pay no exp penalty for this.<br />
<br />
Vah shir get innate safe fall:  which means that they can jump off walls and escape from mobs in certain places, and therefore avoid dying, and therefore they can level faster: and they pay no exp penalty for this.<br />
<br />
In addition:  twinks get lots of regen, armor, great weapons, and they can level up incredibly fast compared to any genuinely new player:  and they pay no exp penalty for this.<br />
<br />
In addition:  All races now get improved regen while sitting.  All races now get improved bind wound (while seated, to 70 pct of health).  So the advantage that 2 extra regen gives you is a smaller advantage than it used to be.<br />
<br />
So why is it, exactly, that various races get certain advantages, and they should not pay any exp penalty; but other races get other advantages, and they should pay an exp penalty?<br />
<br />
It is just bogus to say, &quot;When the game started five years ago, the racial exp penalty was the rule:  so live with it.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Because:  the game has changed 1000 other rules in the meantime.  The rules in this game change with almost every patch.  Because the reason for the racial exp penalty rule is no longer valid, it's one of the rules that should be changed.  <br />
<br />
If you disagree with that -- if you think the reason for the exp penalty rule is still valid -- then you have to say why.  And not simply point out that it is an old rule.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have posted on this subject at great length.  If EQ was a solo game the penalities might make sense, but that is not what the overwhelming majority of players do - we group.  If there is ANYONE who feels that 15aa's to be a slightly better group player is warranted they are a fool or an ass. Especially after we who have the penalty have already spent another 15 aa's worth of time (and I'm being conservative here, I really think 100+ in the old world leveling 3-4 years ago) from 1-65.<br />
<br />
This subject really gets my temperature up - it is totally unfair for Sony not to address it #1, peeps who don't have the penalty make stupid postings all day long #2 without thinking.

<br />
If you aren't willing to give up the racial advantage, then you are basically agreeing that it is worth the experience penalty.<br />
<br />
Another option would be to introduce racial AA and make the racial advantage from other races available for a certain AA cost that somehow reflects the exp penalty from 1-70. <br />
I know I'd get stun immunity in a second, no matter how many AAs it would cost.</div></div><hr />

Thats a great idea, because 15 AA is nothing for the benefits some races receive. The benefits you get are ALWAYS on, you only have to level once. 15 AA nowadays is like a few extra hours of playing. If XP penalties were applied to AA I would understand your frustration, but I think that its asking for too much just to be given free stuff and get to level a little tiny bit slower (15 AA is nothing in the grand scale of things. I know for a fact pickup groups can get atleast 2 AA an hour. )</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reasons halflings have the Xp bonus is simple. It was a mistake.<br />
<br />
Humans were supposed to get the bonus but there was a typo that keyed halflings to it in the first place and Once it was discovered the game was already released and into full swing. <br />
<br />
They didnt nerf it because of the ramifications of all the numbers going kerplop. And there we are today with the fastest levelers in the game being Halfling warriors.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ahh well. Eq was supposed to have sold 50K units. They blew that number skyhigh. And after 5 years Many of the bugs are now features.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Unoeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Correct me if I'm wrong but only Trolls and Iksar suffer any racial xp penalty whatsoever anymore.  Apparently the regeneration ability is the key factor.<br />
<br />
Now that regeneration ability is open to all races/classes through AA to some degree.  The game has changed and therefore I think the racial ability should change.<br />
<br />
Please put away the nerf bats.  After 5 years of playing a troll shaman, I have no desire to see my racial ability wiped out and given back in the form of AA (Though I'm greatly tempted by the thought).  That racial ability no longer has the impact it once had however.<br />
<br />
I propose the ability be adjusted to reflect the blood sweat and tears put into it by upping the regen ability at higher levels to keep it more in balance with the current state of the game.<br />
<br />
Hey!  How about giving trolls a city of their own while you're at it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I'm all for that! We paid for it, we are still paying now give us what we paid for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">When Kunark came out, hybrids still had an xp penalty. It was removed. Clerics needed peridots to cast their buffs, that just got removed. Necros had a peridot component to their high level pets... that was also removed..... Why .... Why ????? These were part of the class they chose when they created their characters.... It was the price they paid for their abilities...... Could it be that somewhere, someone figured that the system should evolve with the rest of the game ?<br />
<br />
When Kunark came out.... <br />
<br />
Regen actually meant something.... now it doesn't. Being blind meant you had to bust your arse getting one of two rare items that had night vision effects.... Now it doesn't. Races that didn't exist now do, they also have racial advantages and yet don't pay an xp penalty for them. Slam meant being able to interrupt spells, now almost everything is immune. Stats used to be hard to come by, now they're capped at high levels no matter what you started with. An AC bonus used to mean something... now the softcap is easy to reach with halfway decent gear. Ask any monk what that extra ac means to him... I'll bet you he won't say mitigation. Forage &quot;might&quot; have been usefull.... capped at 50, it's basically good enough to do your racial quests and hope to god you never have to use it again. Faction used to mean something. Now it means jack. <br />
<br />
The one ability that is still generally considered worthy of respect is ogre unstunnability. <br />
<br />
The context has changed. Looking at the system and recalibrating it to restore consistency between racial advantages and prices paid to get them is a no brainer. Just maybe, after looking at it, these bonuses would be turned to race specific aa's aquireable at certain levels..... Maybe they'd be removed alltogether, maybe they'd realise that they no longer justify a 20 % penalty. Maybe the end result would be ogres,trolls,iksars -10 %, everyone except humans -5 %, humans +5 %. Maybe they'd just decide that at 65th, the penalties have been paid for in full and cap it there. Maybe it would be determined that some abilities are just wondow dressing and don't warrant a penalty while others do. Maybe they'd scale the regen to the point where it's worth the 20 % penalty past 65. There's plenty of possibilities. Is it asking too much to have at least some sort of consistency between races ?  <br />
<br />
The one thing that has remained constant is the nay sayers and the holier than thou's who think that because it's allways been this way and they're not affected by it, then it must necessarily be right. If this was one person complaining, then maybe it might just be whining, but in all the people that have posted on these threads I have yet to see even ONE high level troll or iksar who didn't think the penalties needed to at least be looked at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'm sorry, but the benefits so many of you are so keen to point out matter very very little in today's environment.  Back in the day, before mudflation, their relative benefit was much greater.  But right now, you're all making mountains out of mole hills.<br />
<br />
Simple fact of the matter is that they need to re-evaluate racial experience penalties.  This should have been expected when they increased the number of levels and it will only get worse when they keep upping the levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If the benefits matter so little, take them away along with the XP penalty... im all for that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The thing is, you can't do that.  You can't take away the &quot;benefit&quot; because people already have paid the penalty.  And taking it away would make it where they had leveled with the penalty, and got NO benefit at all.<br />
<br />
I am all for a penalty reduction over time.  Because truly, once you get stoicism now, regen does not matter.  It is so incredibly efficient you don't need regen.  All regen would do is allow you to do one or two more Canni IIs tops before you cast stoicism.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">If the benefits matter so little, take them away along with the XP penalty... im all for that.<br />
Great plan. Stop charging me a penalty, and stop increasing my regen rate as I level! /snicker.<br />
<br />
Duh man, are you reading this? We PAID the penalty for the benefits we have now (I am talking regen here, not Frontal Stun Immunity). Now, I have to PAY a ton more, and will get . . . ALMOST NOTHING NEW, NO ADDITIONAL BENEFIT. <br />
<br />
So, keep the 1.75 hps/tic extra I was gonna get between 65 and 70, and set my XP penalty to 0. Or, keep the penalty at 20%, and reward me with a benefit that comes CLOSE to equaling that cost.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Enough of a &quot;bonus&quot; to warrant earning an entire extra level over most other races?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hope that I have opened your mind a little to our cause.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but you all made your decision at level 1, you should have to live with them. I will say that Sony is at fautl for not being specific enough about the races when we are told during character creation that a certain race/class is difficult or very difficult to play. Sony should have spelled out how they are difficult, ie. 5% penalty, 20% penalty etc. However, certain things should not change. The penalty is one of them. I play a (currently) level 66 Barbarian Shaman, and I also play a lvl 40 Iksar Shadow Knight. I have an inkling of an idea about where you are coming from, due to seeing the slower xp on the SK, but I still don't believe that the penalty should be lifted or rolled back. We pay for the decisions that we make. Lets bring this topic into the real world so to speak. Say that you enlist in the military, for the first few years, the job is ok, and you can live with the pay. Then, after re-enlisting, you are offered a job that will pay you 3 times what you make in the military. You can't just toss out your decision to remain in the military, even though something better comes along. We must stick with our decisions.  <br />
<br />
That said, I will agree to support the removal or roll back of the XP penalty when: All races recieve enhanced regen, equal stats, the inability to be stunned from the front, enhanced swimming at start, natural enhanced water breathing, infravision, higher natural ac, and inate forage. I may have missed a couple, but I think I covered most of them.<br />
<br />
If you ammend your patition to reflect the above changes, then I will support you, however, untill such time, I can not concure with your statements, as these elements without a racial penalty are in my oppinion unbalancing.<br />
<br />
So aye, to a degree, you have opened my mind, but not much.</div></div><hr />

Your totally full of it, and you know it. If I buy a car, and finish making the payments, thats it. I dont pay for that car anymore. If I wish to upgrade the car, yes, its going to cost me. <br />
<br />
Wheres my upgrade please. Finished my payments. Paying newly for an upgrade. Where is it. <br />
<br />
Just be glad I get a &quot;free ride&quot; with AA? LOL your entire thought process is completely laughable. If penaltys were being applied to AAs, the whole racial system would have been HEAVILY adjusted long ago. But in the end, its just not worth it. It affects some people a week, or a month, or whatever, but in the end, we all got to 65 despite the penalty, we all will get to 70 despite the penalty, and the whole topic will go back to the mothballs until the next level increase expansion.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">That said, I will agree to support the removal or roll back of the XP penalty when: All races recieve enhanced regen, equal stats, the inability to be stunned from the front, enhanced swimming at start, natural enhanced water breathing, infravision, higher natural ac, and inate forage. I may have missed a couple, but I think I covered most of them.<br />
Gosh I just do not get some people, honestly.<br />
<br />
I dont want immunity to stun, well I do, but I certainly not free. While I would love to have that as an AA, I do not see it happening, nor am I asking for such a thing. I am not an ogre, but if I was, I woudlnt be NEARLY as upset about the racial benefit vs cost. I am a troll, and I am saying that the amount of regen I am getting now is not worth the amount of XP I am paying now, and that SOE changed the game this way, but didnt bother to adjust the penalty. How is this confusing? <br />
<br />
BTW the regen stats you see on your magelos are inaccurate, because they cannot show you the new, progressive regen that ALL races now recieve. combine that with the massive amounts of increased regen available in items and spells (compared to when I made my &quot;choice&quot;) and you will begin to understand that this is an entirely different game now, and certain elements of this game SHOULD be adjusted.<br />
<br />
Sheesh, I woulda though Shaman, of all the classes, could understand and relate to this principle, but I guess since theres nothing &quot;in it&quot; for some of you, its just another something to be &quot;against&quot; so other people dont get anything reasonable.</div></div><hr />

I would accept that if the &quot;work&quot; I were doing on the car was better than the work your doing on your car, but its not. We are basiclly both going in for a new set of tires, same brand. Mine shouldnt cost more because I am putting them on a more valuable car.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps the box did say that, but it did not say &quot;and stop paying for the decisions you made when you created your character&quot;.<br />

Good lord, what is wrong with you people? You made a decision, albeit possibly a long time ago, but a decision all the same. When the upgraded cultural armor was first made, there was no cultural armor for Agnostics, did I cry and moan? No, I sucked it up, pressed on, and things worked out eventually.

OK, not tires. Whatever, widgets, for all I care. Point is I am getting EXACTLY the same things as you are. Nothing new, nothing &quot;extra&quot;. Again, aftter 2 new levels, I didnt get an extra point of regen over you, that I am aware off, with a rough check.

I'm sorry, but you made your decision at level 1, you should have to live with them. I will say that Sony is at fautl for not being specific enough about the class when we are told during character creation that a certain race/class is difficult or very difficult to play. Sony should have spelled out how they are difficult and unballanced <br />
(this was edited abit though)<br />
<br />
so basicly you picked your own class now live with the unballance and stop complaining about that and go play another class that is more usefull <br />
<br />
maybe you dont think that raceballance means anything ... and 15aas in a day is easy ... but to some1 who is only able to play a max of about 6 hours a week it does indeed mean allot <br />
<br />
and dont use the unchangeable argument about race penalties ... i dont know if you were playing at the time but a few years back ( about 4 or somthing ) players were told that we could never ever get more than 8th spell gems  ... gess what now you can buy and extra if you have OOW</div></div><hr />

I do not regret rolling a barbarian. BTW, the Agnostic that I was refering to is my warrior. What I can't figure out is how you think that you have paid your xp debt for your inate abilities. Apperantly SoE does not think you have. I'm betting that SoE is the one that will have the final say as to when your &quot;debt&quot; has been payed off. But as of yet, lol, they still own the pink slip on your &quot;Lexus&quot;<br />

I play my Troll with an inate fire resist of 5, the lowest wisdom and charisma of all the shaman, evil faction, large size and as of reciently, not even a home city of my own anmore.  I get pidly regen and because i was lucky i can get a quest for a clicky snare neck and the ever usefull enhanced night vision for my journeying in Black Burrow.  For this bit of 'balance' i pay +20% XP.  I was to stop paying for the benifit, and stop getting anymore that I HAVE NOT PAID FOR.  What I have paid for, I get.<br />
<br />
How can I play my race any other way??  /boggle<br />

May have been Verant then, but it is SoE now. I wont discuse the xp penalty removal due to the fact that it could be considered &quot;Class Balance&quot;. Aye, times do change, but the amount of hp that I regen does not. Over time, you get extra cannies in due to the &quot;Worthless&quot; enhanced regen. BTW, lol, I am over Black Burrow, passed that many seasons ago. I know how the shaman class works, better than some, worse than others, but I do know this, for a shaman, HP = Mana. Lets not even bring the Flowing Thought into this, in order to keep it simple. You can canni a tad faster due to enhanced regen, I can not.</div></div><hr />

I suppose that I should just take your advice, accept whatever is thrown my way from SOE and play or not.  <br />

<br />
Fact, when EQ was released, the level cap was 50.  If you accept the argument that people chose classes and races and knew the penalties (excusing those who started early enough that there was no such information), then let's work from there.<br />
<br />
A troll knew that the max level was 50.  That was all that he had to get up to.  Then his exp penalty didn't matter.  Verant knew that too.  Arguably, that's why they set the penalty to 20%.  Thus, 20% of the experience required to get to level 50 is the price to be paid for troll regen.<br />
<br />
Enter Iksar.  Verant said, okay, max level is 60.  Let's make the penalty for a bit more AC and regen to be 20% of the experience from 1-60.  Again, a discreet amount of experience.<br />
<br />
Now, SoE or Verant (I forget which) puts AAs into place.  Note, THERE WAS NO PENALTY ON THE AA.  If they didn't think that the trolls or iksar hadn't paid the price, then there would have been a penalty on the AA.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I don't even know why I'm arguing with you.  Your responses mostly consist of, &quot;You picked it, live with it.&quot;<br />

The benefits are decreasing in proportion, and the costs increase with every expansion.  For some reason you don't think there is a break even point.  By your standards, when we're level 100, and trolls have 'paid' with 1000AA, you're response will be, &quot;nope, still some benefit.  too bad you had to pay 1000AA for 14 regen.  live with it.&quot;<br />

Aye, my responce will be live with it. Remember, I have to deal with a racial penalty also, albeit a smaller one.

I'm sorry, but in my oppinion, this is not a case of cost and price, this is more of a case of cause and effect. If you have the inate abilities that are the cause of the xp penalty removed, then I would understand there being a justification for your xp penalty to be removed.<br />

If I stop leveling and stricty grind AA XP, I still get all of my unbalancing racial abilites, yet i will no longer pay any penalty whatsoever as I grind away.<br />

I'm really sorry, but I feel that you didn't really explain anything there other than to state the basic facts of the discusion.  What constitutes an increasingly expensive penalty, not in tandem with the reward?  I believe that we are talking about here. <br />
<br />
And if you must know, I am posting from a remote location away from my 'gaming comuter' and am unable to grind those extra meaningless AA XP.<br />
<br />
Oh, yeah.  One fact that should be explained correctly is that the extra XP from level 66 to level 70 is an estimated 12-15AA.  The additional XP to get from level 1 to level 65 are entirely another story.  So, if you are arguing that 12-15 AA is worth ALL of our regen, your agrument is a little out of perspective.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its not surprising to me that all our post lvl 68 folks are human or halfling in the guild, whereas, ALL the trolls and ogres are lvl 66 still.  <br />
<br />
The racial bonuses used to be balanced with the level of experience that they nerfed, now, gear by far outweights those bonuses.<br />

Quick, whats 20% of 100,000,000.  A friggin lot.  <br />
<br />
The higher we go, the bigger this nerf becomes.  I would be in full favor of racial expeience penalties if the bonuses continued to scale.  But they've stopped.  I get no more regen.  I've paid my dues in levels 1-65.  <br />

If you want to increase my regen X number of points from level 65-70, then sure, tax me.  But until I see my innate fire and regen go up in level, screw exp nerfs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The voice of reason would proceed this way.<br />
<br />
1.  At this stage of the evolution of the game, there should be racial experience penalties to offset certain racial advantages, but not other racial advantages, because ...<br />
<br />
2.  The way of assessing which advantages bear penalties and which do not should be ...<br />
<br />
3.  When a racial advantage has been deemed to require a racial experience penalty, the way of deciding how large a penalty to assess should be ...<br />
<br />
4.  The process for further review of these things, as the game continues to evolve, should be ...<br />
<br />
You have not presented anything like this.  So you are not (yet) this voice of reason, weighing the various factors that would go into devising a process like this.<br />
<br />
Instead, so far you are merely the voice of stubbornness, repeating over and over, &quot;This was the setup when the game started, and you knew it, so be responsible enough to face up to that.&quot;<br />
<br />
But this wasn't the setup when the game started, and you know that.  You need to be responsible enough to face up to this.<br />
<br />
When the game started, there were indeed penalties for certain races, along with penalties for certain classes, maximum level of 50, maximum available equipment, maximum available spells, mobs no higher than a certain level, only 3 continents, no such thing as aa, and so on.  That was the setup.<br />
<br />
All of that has changed, for everybody.  Except for the penalty stuck on certain races.<br />
<br />
So.  All these other things have needed to be changed and have been changed as the game has evolved.  I have not heard you insist that all of these must remain as they were when the game began.  If you want to be the voice of reason, tell me this:  What is the reason that makes you insist that even when we change dozens of other factors around it, this one specific aspect of the game must never be changed?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wheres my upgrade please. Finished my payments. Paying newly for an upgrade. Where is it. <br />
<br />
Just be glad I get a &quot;free ride&quot; with AA? LOL your entire thought process is completely laughable. If penaltys were being applied to AAs, the whole racial system would have been HEAVILY adjusted long ago. But in the end, its just not worth it. It affects some people a week, or a month, or whatever, but in the end, we all got to 65 despite the penalty, we all will get to 70 despite the penalty, and the whole topic will go back to the mothballs until the next level increase expansion.<br />
Blazz I understood your argument the last five times you made it, I just don't agree with it. I honestly wouldn't have a huge problem with them adjusting the penalty down by like half or something, but I just don't like your logic. It boils down to there actually being other possible methods for penalty in the universe besides a pay-once-use-forever system. Using a car analogy, you picked a faster car so you get worse gas mileage. You will never be done paying you &quot;gas debt&quot; as long as you drive it. and uh as we all add mods to our cars your advantage will possibly get smaller but you still have it. meanwhile your huge butt-scratchin engine always burns more gas. unless you're driving through aa-land where you get a free ride. there you go, finest analogy ever and it's free.<br />
<br />
gear and aa's are available to all so get factored in the next expansions, unlike racial benefits. which can't be factored in except by the exp penalty. also I might point out with every expansion levelling gets faster because of better gear/spells/zones so the cost of all the prior levels gets lower, though that may not help you personally it obviously can't be ignored.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">Aye Blazz, thats the way to do it, start attacking a persons morals when your points have been repeatedly blunted by sound logic. Lol, if your gonna stoop to that childish level, then you win, I dont want to argue with someone that has to resort to name calling.<br />
<br />
Actually the feeling that you're beating your head against a wall when trying to communicate with someone who is being intentionally obtuse or extroardinarily slow will bring out the urge to strangle something in real life after a while no matter how patient you are.<br />
<br />
You have consistently answered the same thing in one form or another to every post on the subject while refusing to even aknowledge the points raised. Here's a quick recap.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1. The abilities have not scaled proportionally to the price. The racial penalties and abilities should be looked at to see if they need rebalancing. <br />
<br />
-Trace : You made a choice, live with it.<br />
 <br />
2. New races were created with racial advantages but Verant has seen fit not to exact a similar penalty. The racial penalties and abilities should be looked at to see if they need rebalancing. <br />
<br />
-Trace : You made a choice, live with it.  <br />
<br />
3. Circumstances have changed, what used to be a penalty from 1 - 60/65 is now being extended to 70 with no added benefit to reflect the added price. The racial penalties and abilities should be looked at to see if they need rebalancing.<br />
<br />
-Trace : You made a choice, live with it.  <br />
<br />
4. Knights had their xp penalties removed because at high levels the classes are equivalent, the same is true for races. The racial penalties and abilities should be looked at to see if they need rebalancing. <br />
<br />
-Trace : You made a choice, live with it.<br />
<br />
5. Regen was upgraded for every race and in certain respects broken for the regenerating races. The racial penalties and abilities should be looked at to see if they need rebalancing. <br />
<br />
-Trace : You made a choice, live with it.<br />
<br />
6. The racial abilities have been farmed out as aa's. The racial penalties and abilities should be looked at to see if they need rebalancing. <br />
<br />
-Trace : You made a choice, live with it.<br />
<br />
7. If we're going to keep paying these penalties from 65 - 70 then the regen we're paying for that has scaled from levels 1 - 65 also needs to scale up from 65 - 70 to remain balanced. <br />
<br />
-Trace : You made a choice, live with it.<br />
<br />
8. The game has evolved. Perhaps the very need for racial penalties should be reexamined. <br />
<br />
-Trace : You made a choice, live with it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We'd probably get more meaningfull communication standing on a corner arguing with a fire hydrant. What surprises me isn't that Blazz finally lashed out in frustration, it's that it took so long to happen. Your logic doesn't blunt anything, it just ignores whatever arguments are on the table in favor of what you want to hear so that you can feel good and rightous pretending to &quot;win&quot; the argument happening in your head. I mourne the waste of patience, bandwidth and time spent figuring that out. <br />
<br />
<br />
For the people arguing that the regen,even capped is still worth the ongoing xp payment. I can respect that as one of the few valid arguments I've seen here. My answer is simply that regen has scaled up from 1 - 65, it stands to reason that it was supposed to keep scaling up from 65 to 70 if we are to remain consistent and keep paying for it. Just because it's been overlooked doesn't mean it's right. We could double that regen and still the effect would be negligible at those levels so there is no reason for the present situation. If this isn't something you can take into account then we will have to agree to disagree. <br />
<br />
The game is 5 years old already. The everquest you play today has very little to do with the game we played 4 or 5 years ago. Contrary to other games where the rules are fixed and never change, EQ evolves, adapts, hopefully gets better with time. Pretty much every part of it has been brought into question at some point in time with good reason. Racial penalties are no exception.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Tracce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">I bet Tracce can slow time.<br />
<br />
Never been there to tell the truth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>TainwulfSilverwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">I can remember being pissed when I got past my newbish nature and learned about racial benefits and what I could have had as an Iksar.  Sadly that was still pre-Velious and leveling was far slower then it is now, so rather then re-roll I kept on as a Barbarian.  I made a choice, and even though I have a 15% less penalty the defining choice of my race, the good faction, is totally moot now.<br />
<br />
Anyone remember back when Barbarians had the same penalty as Ogres/Trolls/Iksar?  I did 18 levels under that penalty so I can appreciate the difference in 5% and 20% penalty.  At 18 I noticed a huge difference after the patch that took them were they are today!<br />
<br />
The biggest problem most would have with reduced or removed XP penalty would probably have to do with the relative power of these benefits pre 50+.  The penalty does make sense for the benefits gained at those levels, however the problem lies at the 50+ end where it scales badly.  So with that in mind, I'd have to say it would be unbalancing to touch the penalty at the low-mid game at all, and only change it for the end game.<br />
<br />
Some possibilities....<br />
<br />
1. Improved racial regen scaling.  With the penalty as is, the level 70 Troll or Iksar Warrior should have a significant and noticible edge in HP regen.<br />
<br />
2. Leave benefits as is, but reduce the XP penalty to 10% somewhere around 60.  I totally agree that as long as you have the benefit it should be paid for, and agree that its too much in end game.<br />
<br />
3. XP bonus Leadership Skills!  That would make anyone popular thats willing to give up 20% xp!<br />
<br />
Basically to balance out anything in a game, you should receive something equal for everything that you give up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Tracce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">The argument is that certain races get benefits that enable them to survive better, and therefore die less, and therefore level faster.  To keep things balanced, these races should pay an exp penalty.<br />
<br />
The game has changed 1000 other rules in the meantime.  The rules in this game change with almost every patch.  Because the reason for the racial exp penalty rule is no longer valid, it's one of the rules that should be changed.  <br />
<br />
If you disagree with that -- if you think the reason for the exp penalty rule is still valid -- then you have to say why.  And not simply point out that it is an old rule. (Condenced)<br />
<br />
It is not due to it being an old rule that I disagree. I disagree because the races that recieve the heavy xp penalties will have abilities that are greater than those who do not have the xp penalties. While these abilities may not seem great in the now, you still have them, while others that are the same class as you do not. Even if I were to max out my AA regen, I would still fall short of the mark that Iksar and Trolls can achieve. Why should the penalty be lifted when a non regen race will never be able to reach the same standards that the penalty race can achieve? Even if one loses 12 - 15 AA grinding from 66 to 70, you can still go out and grind out more. When the dust settles, and people have maxed their AA out, others who have accomplished this same feat will be lacking to a degree.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are taking your stubborness to the point of stupidity, glad that it looks like you are making a turn for the better rather than the worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">The problem with the racial XP penalty is that you have to pay it EACH level. That means iksars / trolls have to fill 6 yellow XP bubbles each level compared to the 5 one for cats / frogs. I can't safe the XP penalty up and get them at level 70. For the ones saying 15AA takes only few hours: How long does it take to get 15AA at level... 50? I'm affraid you can't XP at C2 / WoS / PG at level 50 to get these AAs.<br />
<br />
I'm an iksar. Let's see what I got:<br />
<br />
- forage 50 at level 1: Wow, I don't have to buy food and can forage some tradeskill stuff (btw my forage is successfull about 1 out of 4 attempts). Didn't increase even level 60 was max when I rolled an iksar. Not caped at 75 at level 65 nor caped at 100 at level 70. I pay for something that doesn't get better.<br />
<br />
- armor bonus: I think it's caped at 40AC at level 50!!!  No increase since 15+ levels. Again it doesn't increase and I still have the penalty.<br />
<br />
- improved vision: yup, still have it and would say I payed enough XP for this. And with all the spells / items granting better visions out there...<br />
<br />
- can't wear plate: Means no JBB too. Ok, this penalty has not much meaning since Velious / higher levels. <br />
<br />
- improved regen: So it comes down to this advantage. Paying 20% more each level should result into 100-150 standing regen (+regen from items +AA regen). Even 100regen means nothing when mobs hit you for 800+ 2 or 3 times each round. Oh, for the canni thingy... Quiec / BoT heals WAY more HPs then I canni away.<br />
<br />
May be this example helps to understand the problem: Let us say you had a +1 to melee damage as a racial advantage and get a penalty of 10% for it. +1 melee damage at level 1 is a HUGE advantage. You were ripping the mobs at lower levels apart! Wow. You were THE battle priest. Right as you were thinking of the shaman class, the battle priests. Now you are level 60. You still have the +1 melee damage bonus. But you don't melee often and hey, the +1 bonus isn't so huge anymore when you look at your 30 / 30 hammer and your 250+ str. But you still have the 10% penalty and still 10 level to go... And you think back to the days when you were level 10 and killing all the mobs with your hammer / spear.</div></div><hr />

If something is still having a effect on gameplay like ogres and stun, then perhaps there is no problem with the penalty. However, barbarian, troll and Iksar shouldn't really have a penalty at all after.  I mean I don't actually see why Barbarian does have a penalty. I mean look at Frogloks they have infravision and 150 in swimming as well as an innate ability to hold their breath longer and yet they have 0 penalty. Cats have safefall and have no penalty at all. Dark Elves, and Halflings I think in the scheme of things should have a minor penalty for having hide.  I fully agree with Blazz's petition.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Kapakx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">I hate to be the one to burst the bubble on Ogre &quot;unstunability&quot;, but since I have both an Ogre war and Ogre shaman I play, I have some insight on it. <br />
First off, if you think being unstunable from the front is useful, then try playing an ogre and see where it helps. &quot;Unstunable&quot; does not mean uninteruptable. It equals exactly sqaut at pretty much any level.<br />
Second off, the &quot;unstunability&quot; goes the second I A: Shrink, yeah, that's what I said, Shrink. B: Get on a drogmor/horse. And C: change forms in anyway. And since I spend 90% of my time either Shrunk or on a drogmor....well, you can see that one for yourself.<br />
Personally, I'd give my left nut to have back all the xp that I've wasted to level my shaman up, but that's never going to happen. And we all know it. So take away the ability and the penalty. I'm more then fine with that. When I started my shaman 5 years ago, everyone was on equal terms. They knew their penalty and accepted in. Then comes a new race and another and then some tweaking to everyones penalties. If I could, I'd play anything but the ogre.<br />
It seems to me that it would only be fair to remove the penalty. When the racial abilities were unique things, they were worth the trouble. But now, no race has a unique ability. They can all be gotten with gear or AA's. And if you think 15 AA's is a worthwhile cost for &quot;Unstunability&quot;, then I'll be more then happy to trade you. And those are just the 15aa between 65-70. Doesn't mention the HORDES or aa worth of xp wasted from 1-65, nor the AA grinding in between expansions. 15aa may not be alot to some of you, but I don't have the ability to play like I did in the beginning, 15aa could take me a month to make anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am sorry, i didnt want to jump in this.  All heal spells post Stoicism (Torpor / Q / BoT) make regen on a shaman totally pointless.  Yes, if i am clicking canni and i am somehow stupid enough not to have a heal memmed, i guess i may get a few more cannis out.  But at this end of the game, no matter how much I canni, i always have a heal up and my regen does nothing to heal me back to health.  I dont canni down and sit there 60pct health for the next 10-20min waiting to regen it back, i will canni down, heal canni more, heal...just like anyone else.  <br />

Just to restate, regen on a shaman after he has a very mana efficient heal is pointless.</div></div><hr />

Exp calculations at some point should reasonably reflect that these advantages are becoming obsolete.<br />

I think the ogres present a problem because stun immunity is not close to obsolete.  In fact, I would certainly pay 12 AA for that.  <br />

<br />
You are taking your stubborness to the point of stupidity, glad that it looks like you are making a turn for the better rather than the worse.<br />
<br />
I appoligise (spelling?) for not stating it earlyer, it may have caused less frustration on both sides, but I have never been opposed to the regen continuing to scale as you continue to level after lvl 60 up to where ever the level caps will someday end. I would even support a patition for SoE to go back, and give Trolls and Iksar increased scaling where it was not included, ie. 61 - 70. What i do not support is the scaling back of the penalty when certain races do not recieve the benifits that said penalty is the result of. I have been coming off very rough on this subject, I just feel very strongly about it. This does not excuese my choice of wording in possibly a majority of my posts, however, I will attempt from this point on to word my posts in a non offencive mannor, and will attempt to give better reasoning for my oppinions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>Tracce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">I am sorry, i didnt want to jump in this.  All heal spells post Stoicism (Torpor / Q / BoT) make regen on a shaman totally pointless.  Yes, if i am clicking canni and i am somehow stupid enough not to have a heal memmed, i guess i may get a few more cannis out.  But at this end of the game, no matter how much I canni, i always have a heal up and my regen does nothing to heal me back to health.  I dont canni down and sit there 60pct health for the next 10-20min waiting to regen it back, i will canni down, heal canni more, heal...just like anyone else.  <br />
<br />
Just to restate, regen on a shaman after he has a very mana efficient heal is pointless.<br />

Wouldn't it be better if EQ had genuine differences between races rather than devolving into a one-dimensional game where race denotes only your choice of graphics?<br />
<br />
For instance trolls: there has to be a point at which regen becomes significant again (a character that regens a million points per tick would be pretty hard to kill) so perhaps you should argue what regen level would make a reasonable reward for the penalty.<br />
<br />
And ogres: make unstunnable = uninterruptable.  And give them a higher stats cap that reflects their sheer size.  Give them extra hit points too, rather than just a lil bit of stamina.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">the races that recieve the heavy xp penalties will have abilities that are greater than those who do not have the xp penalties. While these abilities may not seem great in the now, you still have them, while others that are the same class as you do not. So your argument is not <br />
<br />
1.  &quot;You made your choice, live with it.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Instead it is <br />
<br />
2.  &quot;If you receive certain racial advantages, these need to be balanced by having having a certain racial experience penalty.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Is that correct?<br />
<br />
If you are making the second argument, that's interesting.  But you can see, first of all, how frustrated you got people when it seemed like you were trying to make the second argument. <br />
<br />
If you are indeed intending the second argument, it still leaves some unanswered questions.<br />
<br />
A.  What racial advantages should have penalties, and why?<br />
<br />
B.  Should all penalized racial advantages have the same penalty?  If some advantages should cost more, how do we decide how much more they should cost?<br />
<br />
C.  If a certain amount of penalty was assessed at the beginning of the game, is that still the right amount of penalty?  or should the penalty now be higher or lower, in the different game environment today?<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
Take barbarians as an example.  Very early on barbarians had the same racial experience penalty as ogres and trolls.  Later that got changed:  barbs now pay a smaller exp penalty.  Should that adjustment have been made?  Or should barbs still pay the same penalty as from the beginning?  <br />
<br />
Is always having slightly higher regen more of an advantage than a DE always being able to see in the dark?  More than a Vah Shir always having safe fall?  More than a halfling always being able to hide and sneak?<br />
<br />
Arguably barbarians sometimes live while other races die, because we have a tiny bit of extra regen per tick.  But I know for sure that I've died because I could not see in the dark, did not have safe fall, could not sneak.  <br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
I'm not ready to disparage other racial advantages as worthless, btw.<br />
<br />
When I started my barbarian shaman, I met a guy who had started a halfling warrior.  We were both true newbies, with no armor, equipment, or money.<br />
<br />
After a week or two I had levelled up a little, and I had some tattered armor,  a cracked staff, and maybe 2 platinum pieces.<br />
<br />
He had levelled up a little bit more, and he was wearing banded or better in every slot, he had decent weapons, and had nearly 1000 plat in the bank.<br />
<br />
At level 3 he had figured out how to use hide and sneak to make money.  He went to the ice giant camp in Everfrost, keeping invis all the way.  He'd check round about him to make sure the orcs were at a safe distance, and then he'd loot the fine steel weapons and miscellaneous junk that people left rotting on IG corpses.   <br />
<br />
He'd sit at his desk doing his homework, with the computer on in the background.  And every few minutes he'd pay attention to the screen for 15 seconds, and make himself another 5 plat.  <br />
<br />
Eventually I made it to level 20 and was beginning to work on how to get totemic armor.  By then he was level 40, maybe higher, had thousands of plat in the bank, and some very impressive equipment:  because he had figured out how to make good use of his racial advantage.<br />
--<br />
<br />
So.  If your argument is this:<br />
<br />
2.  &quot;If you receive certain racial advantages, these need to be balanced by having having a certain racial experience penalty.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Then I have these questions for you:<br />
<br />
A.  What racial advantages should have penalties, and why?<br />
<br />
B.  Should all penalized racial advantages have the same penalty?  If some advantages should cost more, how do we decide how much more they should cost?<br />
<br />
C.  If a certain amount of penalty was assessed at the beginning of the game, is that still the right amount of penalty?  or should the penalty now be higher or lower, in the different game environment today?<br />

Can't remember if I had a good reason or it just sounded more in line with how they do such things in eq. Also I seem to remember gnomes and dark elves get the small penalty.<br />
<br />
I honestly thought anyone would be able to get racial advantages temporarily by drinking illusion potions (this would be a decent way to balance out removal of the penalties for 65+ btw). Knowing what I know now I'd have picked iksar in a second. Im a nut for piling on every scrap of hp/ac/regen/ft humanly possible, as I'm sure the rest of you are despite your claims of the worthlessness of regen suddenly. Its about wanting your character to be the best possible. the same reason I spent a week working on that nadox ring quest for one extra pt regen. <br />
<br />
btw both sides have gotten frustrated and out of line in this arguing and I don't necessarily agree with you on who the worst offender is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>Ganbal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">What everybody seems to be missing is this:<br />
<br />
The xp penalty was put in place because Verant reasoned that having the extra regen, etc would make races level faster, which, to anyone who has played a troll or iksar, is obviously NOT true.  If so, it would not take us so much longer to gain levels as it does other, non-penalized races. <br />
<br />
As far as other ablilities, Iksar may get an AC bonus, but for that they get penalized with inferior armor choices.    Don't talk about swimming, please...how often has swimming ability saved some's life?  Can't see at night?  Buy a torch.  Or should that cost an xp penalty, too? Other, non-penalized races get innate forage, night vision, etc, so troll/iksar have no real advantage there.<br />
<br />
So, basically, we're paying 20% for regen because it was supposed to make us level faster that non-regen races........guess what?  IT AIN'T SO !!!<br />
<br />
Sorry, but it is time to rethink the regen xp-penalty.  Either remove it, at least at higher levels, or increase it to the point that trolls/iksar actually DO level at the same rate as other classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">I've always thought the exp penalties were 6/13/20 %. <br />
Trolls and Iskar = 20%<br />
Ogres = 15% (no regen, just frontal stun immunity, which is NOT frontal uninteruptable immunity)<br />
Barbs = 5% (basically for better starting stats and slam, no other benefit)<br />
Halfling and Human = -5% bonus<br />
<br />
These are the only racial penalties/bonuses I am aware of. If there are more, please let me know. <br />
<br />
As for class penalty's and bonuses, I think there is only:<br />
<br />
Warriors = 10% bonus<br />
Zerkers = 10% bonus</div></div><hr />

If you are making the second argument, that's interesting.  But you can see, first of all, how frustrated you got people when it seemed like you were trying to make the second argument. <br />
<br />
Yes I do see how frustrated that people became, as I was frustrated as well. I should have been more coherant, concise and to the point, while CLEARLY stating my entire oppinion.<br />
<br />
As to your question, here is my answer:<br />
<br />
To a degree, yes that is correct. I would support a petition to increase the regen for Iksar and Trolls, but I do not want to see the xp penalty removed. Not for Iksar, not for Trolls, and even though it is a lesser penalty, not for my own race, Barbarians. I do not use slam, I think my skill in it is something like 10. But even though it is an ability that I do not use, and at lvl 66 is something that I consider to be useless due to it never being used by myself. I'm willing to take the xp penalty that is assigned to me. I realize that it is more difficult for the races that have a 20% penalty, but as I have said in the past, it is not right in my oppinion for other members of my class that are a different race to be superior in anyway to other members of the class, without some balance being in place. I am not refering to better gear and such, that is something that is theoreticly attainable by any member of the same class. As I have said in the past, take a barbarian and place him/her next to an Iksar or Troll that is the same lvl, has the same AA abilities and gear as the Barbarian, and the Troll / Iksar would be to a degree superior, albeit a minor one with the regen lacking as it is at the moment. While I can not support the penalty being rolled back or lifted, I would whole heartedly support the regen being scaled forward to a more reasonable amount. I would prefer not getting into how much is a reasonable amount at this time, it could cause more hasle than it is worth at this point, and I have not had the oppertunity to examine the current level vs. what would be the proper amount.<br />
<br />
One could consider that this was not my original arguement. I can see why. I never stated that I would support scaling regen forward post level 60. If people just want the penalty removed, without giving all other races the benifits of the race that is having its cap removed. To people that want to keep their racial abilities, and not have an xp penalty, to them my answer would be &quot;Deal with it&quot;, but to the people that are willing to keep the penalties that are currently ingame, I will be more than happy to work with them to have their abilities improved, to be more in line with the penalty incured, be it better regen for Iksar and Trolls, or frontal stun/interuption immunity to Ogres.<br />
<br />
If I was unclear on any of my statements in this post, I will be more than willing to clarify my position</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">Although I have been a huge proponent of just wiping out the racial experience penalities post 65 because they have been paid for many times over (and are negligable in todays EQ), I would be fine with adjusted regen and ac for my Lizard proportional to the total grinding penalty I have encurred.<br />
<br />
But even with the token additional benefit scaling it will not help Iksar and Trolls to get a group (more so than other shaman) so it would just make me feel better if nothing else.  Sony would be wise to throw a bone to the screwed races, BTW in case any SOE person is trolling.  Customer satisfaction or lack thereof is going to bite Sony as soon as real competition is out.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">Just a note on the Vah Shir - with the inate Safe Fall that is offset with a need to feed more often, Vah Shir also get Sneak as a racial bonus which will in fact save your life yet slow your movement down a little... to bad that we have to wait untill level 9 to get a movement bonus spell or this may be considered unbalancing... at least a little.  For these bonuses, the Vah Shir pays no penalty.<br />
<br />
While it is not HP regen that will keep you alive much easier until level 9ish, it will help out over the corse of a Vah Shir's life, possibly even save a CR or two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u99"><b>Ganbal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p99">Everyone seems to act as if this xp penalty affects only SHAMAN of the xp penalty races.  It in fact, affects EVERY class.  It's intention was to offset the supposed advantage that it would give those races.  It was ASSUMED that it would help them survive during battles more often.  However, even at low levels, I have not found this to be the case.  The regen bonus while standing is NOT great enough to markedly improve survivability during melee.  Not to mention it would really only be a factor when soloing.  When grouping, the amount of hp regained through heals is so much greater than through natural regen as to make its effect negligible.  The amount of hp regened naturally is NOT enough to give a warrior or sk a significant advantage over other races when soloing.  <br />
<br />
Non-penalty races seem to have this illusion that the extra regen is a big difference maker in the game.......it's NOT.  It was assumed that it would when implemented, but it DOESN'T.  It's nice, but even back in the day, it was more than offset by poor faction and lower starting stats.  Nowadays, with hp totals doubled or even tripled over what a good shaman had when I came into the game (Dec. 2000) and spell costs through the roof, its effect is even LESS noticible.<br />
<br />
So what I'm saying is not that the xp penalty is no longer valid, I'm telling you it was NEVER valid.  Not 20% anyway.  MAYBE 5%.  Barbies should have never had ANY xp penalty.  Slam (which caps at 1, btw) is NOT a 5% advantage to anyone.  The ASSUMPTION that these things would be an advantage when levelling was a faulty one and SHOULD have been fixed LONG ago.<br />

And, btw.........REAL shaman DON'T wear skirts......... ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It appears to me that you are now agreeing with most everyone else here, that the current racial exp penalty may be out of line with current racial benefits, and probably ought to be re-examined.<br />
<br />
Your intuition is that the racial experience penalty should not be outright removed, but that it might well be adjusted downward, or else the amount of benefit received could  be adjusted upward, to make the balance better.<br />
<br />
And even though you yourself don't want to get into the fussy details of an argument about how much adjustment would be the right amount, you seem clear on the fact that some such fussy detail argument would be necessary, to figure out what that right amount of adjustment would be.<br />
<br />
If that's what you mean, then I appreciate your thoughtfulness on the matter, and I'm sure that others do as well.<br />
<br />
You still haven't responded to provide a reason why certain specific advantages deserve an exp penalty while other advantages do not.  I would honestly look forward to your thoughts about that.<br />
<br />
But to sum up, for the moment.  We seem to have come to an agreement concerning the racial exp penalties that certain races are currently paying:  these should not be considered carved in stone, but should be open to reconsideration and adjustment.</div></div><hr />

You are mostly correct, with the exeption of rolling back the xp penalty. I believe that all penalties/bonuses should be left untouched. It is the adjusting of the abilites to a level befitting of the punishment that I agree with.<br />
<br />
I will not go into the arguements about the amount of regen that would be fair becuase quite frankly, I would be talking about a matter that I have no idea about. I will get arround to testing out regen in game a bit better so that I can be better informed on that topic, and so that I won't be opening my mouth and inserting my foot. I have done enough of that on this and another thread to last me for quite a while.<br />
<br />
As for the advantages deserving of a penalty and others not, again, I am not informed enough on said topic to begin. However, from what I can figure, every advantage and disadvantage has a % value assigned to it. I am guessing that some races have enough disadvantages that they actualy qualify for an xp bonus. I believe that halflings have an xp bonus, that one I can't figure out, may be due to them having such large feet (J/K).<br />

<br />
Seriously, though, don't you wonder about that.  What disadvantages to halflings have that means they should get a 5% exp bonus?  If its size or initial low stamina or something, why don't gnomes get that bonus?  Actually I kind of think being small is an advantage:  ogres get stuck in doorways when they're trying to run for the zoneline, but little races don't.  <br />
<br />
Someone decided long ago, for whatever reasons,  that certain races would get exp penalties, other races would work on an even-exp basis, and one race would get an exp bonus.  Did those reasons make sense at the time?  Maybe.  Do they make sense now?  Maybe.  It would be helpful to know what the reasoning was back then.  But we don't, so we have to dou our best to discern what it was.  And maybe we come to the conclusion, as many people have, that the thing is not presently balanced correctly.<br />
<br />
I think you are in agreement with the notion that racial experience allocation is probably not balanced correctly at present:You are mostly correct, with the exeption of rolling back the xp penalty. I believe that all penalties/bonuses should be left untouched. It is the adjusting of the abilites to a level befitting of the punishment that I agree with.<br />
<br />
I will not go into the arguements about the amount of regen that would be fair becuase quite frankly, I would be talking about a matter that I have no idea about. I do have two further questions, then.<br />
<br />
1.  If it might be ok to raise the level of the benefit to balance against the present penalty, why wouldn't it also work to lower the level of the penalty to balance against the present benefit?<br />
<br />
2.  If you &quot;have no idea about&quot; how much regen would &quot;be fair&quot; to balance against a given amount of penalty -- then isn't it possible that the present amount of regen would end up balancing against a reduced amount of penalty, or perhaps even against no penalty at all?</div></div><hr />

I have already conceeded that your arguement has merit. The amount of regen that you recieve is not worth a 20% penalty. As I have said earlyer, I will never support having penalties removed, not even my own races. I will support Trolls and Iksar recieving more regen to make up for it, however, here is not the place to post that discution, as it will inveriably lead to more argueing, something that I wish to avoid. <br />

Actually I kind of think being small is an advantage:  ogres get stuck in doorways when they're trying to run for the zoneline, but little races don't.  <br />
<br />
Someone decided long ago, for whatever reasons,  that certain races would get exp penalties, other races would work on an even-exp basis, and one race would get an exp bonus.  Did those reasons make sense at the time?  Maybe.  Do they make sense now?  Maybe.  It would be helpful to know what the reasoning was back then.  But we don't, so we have to dou our best to discern what it was.  And maybe we come to the conclusion, as many people have, that the thing is not presently balanced correctly.<br />
<br />
I think you are in agreement with the notion that racial experience allocation is probably not balanced correctly at present:I do have two further questions, then.<br />
<br />
1.  If it might be ok to raise the level of the benefit to balance against the present penalty, why wouldn't it also work to lower the level of the penalty to balance against the present benefit?<br />
<br />
2.  If you &quot;have no idea about&quot; how much regen would &quot;be fair&quot; to balance against a given amount of penalty -- then isn't it possible that the present amount of regen would end up balancing against a reduced amount of penalty, or perhaps even against no penalty at all?<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, I will try to answer questions 1 and 2 at the same time. I don't think that penalties should be removed or scaled back due to the fact that there are still bonuses that other races are not recieving. The penalty for having an advantage over another race is fair in my oppinion. After level 60, if im not mistaken, SoE stopped adding power to your advantage. So you have paid for a subpar advantage for 10 levels now, assuming that you are level 70. That is not fair. The only way that I can see that would be fair to all parties involved is to increase Troll / Iksar regen from level 61, and continue to increase same every time that the level cap is increased.<br />
<br />
I bet that this post sounds a bit hazy, so, again please feel free to ask me to clarify my position on this post if you need me to.</div></div><hr />

Now while I may be incorrect, I believe that the regeneration is the same from level 1 to level to level 50, then at level 50 the regen goes up a little every few levels, and again into the 60's, up to what +9 regen over the other non inherant regen races at level 65.  For that we get a 20% penalty.  I am not debating wiether or not I should pay a penalty, I get regen and it is in fact a benifit, therefore I pay.<br />
<br />
Of course, I get enhanced regen and you don't.  So in a duel, I would have a slight advantage over you, but since i do not duel and my benifit does not help get me a group faster... Brothur shouts &quot;LEVEL 62 SHAMMY LFG... &gt;&gt;&gt;I'M A TROLL I REGEN +9 PER TICK MORE THAN THE BARB &lt;&lt;&lt; ...&quot; ( yeah right, that's gonna work ).  Then why do I still pay +20% more?  For the benifit that was primarily usefull when I was a n00b?  For the benifit that is grossly overpriced and underuseful?<br />
<br />
I do not mind paying for something, when the price fits with what I am buying. <br />
<br />
To follow the tire analogy.... If you spend $1000 on a set of tires for your Viper then that may be OK, If you spend $1000 on a set of tires for your Pinto then you may feel a little ripped off.  Even if you want to say 20% difference in difference in tires, $834 for tires for a Pinto and $1000 for your Viper tires equation for similar quality tires still doesn't seem all together right.<br />
<br />
Once again, I do not mind paying for something, when the price fits with what I am buying.<br />
<br />
If my inate regen does not scale up as the price does, then at some point I am paying too much for what I am getting.  (You don't pay 8k for a centi longsword anymore because it isn't worth it.  That is what they were being sold at in the begining.  Times change and so does the price.)  At the point that I am paying more for the benifit than it is worth, I can safely say that I am getting ripped off.  No arguement, it is a fact.<br />
<br />
Did I Mention that I do not mind paying for something, when the price fits with what I am buying?<br />

It is that simple, the system is outdated and needs adjustment.  That is the purpose of this post, to fix something that is broken.  It wasn't meant to get rolled back a pile of XP or remove the penalty all together.<br />

<br />
In the past for a mid level shaman, regen + slow actually made a noticable difference in fights/mana production.  In modern EQ, mudflation has made regen an moot point.  The 20% exp penalty is by no means a moot point.<br />
<br />
Either the regen should be high enough to make a difference in high end EQ fights (no way they are going to give several hundred hp a tick regen), or the cost penalty should go away starting at the point where the regen bonus stopped scaling at the same rate... be it level 60, level 65 or whatever.<br />
<br />
I don't think it will happen, but thats my opinion.<br />

I have yet to see a regen race ask for anything even remotely close to a couple hundred moer hps of regen (I know you were just using this as an example, not trying to pick on you). <br />
<br />
Myself? I think a total of 70 over the &quot;standard&quot; regen rate would be a number I could be content with, 1 per level for my 20%. But I am NOT asking for this. Personally, I would prefer a reduction to a 5 or 10% penalty and leave everything else as is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u113"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p113">Trolls and Iskar = 20%<br />
Ogres = 15% (no regen, just frontal stun immunity, which is NOT frontal uninteruptable immunity)<br />
Barbs = 5% (basically for better starting stats and slam, no other benefit)<br />
Halfling and Human = -5% bonus<br />
<br />
These are the only racial penalties/bonuses I am aware of. If there are more, please let me know. <br />
<br />
As for class penalty's and bonuses, I think there is only:<br />
<br />
Warriors = 10% bonus<br />
Zerkers = 10% bonus<br />
Class penalties and bonuses went away as far as I know.  And humans don't have bonus or penalty I believe.  It was assumed, a long time ago, that humans should have gotten the bonus for being so average and that halflings should have never gotten it.</div></div><hr />

No flames from me Gorgos. You have a racial advantage that is actually fairly useful from level 1 through level 100. I am certain MOST of us would gladdly pay a bundle of AAs to get Frontal Stun Immunity. That is why I have tried to limit my arguement to the Troll penalty. I am not even sure how to &quot;rate&quot; the additional AC that Iskar get into the equation, so I have tried to avoid including them as well.<br />
<br />
My main arguement is that for the race of Trolls, the penalty is much harsher than the benefit provided ini exchange. Thats it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u117"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p117">I think Iksar have to pay the penalty for looking so sexy and cool.  Just my opinion though.<br />

I've noticed I don't bother using Q after Cann5 in a lot of cases.  Assuming I'm nicely buffed that is.  I regen it back real quick.  The AC bonus is laughable though.  It's like an extra 40 or 45 AC.</div></div><hr />

I will support regen being increased. I do not fully understand why you are willing to support one and yet see the other as something that must never be considered.<br />
<br />
Here's an analogy.  (I'm using 105 for convenience here; part of the question of course is to decide what percentage benefit we should count for things like regen, slam, having large halfling feet, and frontal stun immunity.)<br />
<br />
Mary receives $100 worth of benefits each month and pays $100 a month for them.  (What kind of benefits?  Hell I don't know.  Health club membership points, restaurant coupons, vacation time shares, I don't care.  Benefits.)<br />
<br />
John receives $105 worth of benefits each month and pays $120 a month for them.  John complains and says this isn't fair, it would be right to make the ratio the same for everyone, a dollar's worth of benefits for a dollar.<br />
<br />
Tracce looks at this and says, &quot;You know that's right, John is being overcharged for the benefits he is receiving.  If he pays $120 he should get $120 in benefits.  I would fully support him getting $120 in benefits for his $120 payment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Macnair listens to this and says, &quot;Hmm, but the important thing is the ratio.  A dollar in benefit for a dollar in cost.  So if John is getting $105 in benefits, why not just charge him $105 for what he is currently getting?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tracce shakes his head.  &quot;No, no, no!  I will never support reducing John's cost here.  It's fine for him to get $120 worth of benefits for his $120 cash; but it would never be right for him to pay $105 for his current $105 in benefits.&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it seems to me that this is what you are telling us.  If we can figure out that the amount of regen an iksar gets is worth 105 points, for example, it would be ok to increase that regen so that the new amount is worth 120 points, and this balances against the iksar's 120 % exp cost.  But it wouldn't be ok just to say if the iksar is getting 105 points worth of benefit, lets charge him 105 % exp cost.<br />
<br />
Isn't this the thing that makes the business fair:  if everyone ends up paying at the same ratio for whatever benefits they receive?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u121"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p121">Who said that we had to pay a penalty for XP let alone keep on paying and paying and paying whenever a new set of levels is added?<br />

That's the wrong question.<br />
<br />
The question is who said the penalty would ever end?<br />
<br />
No one.<br />
<br />
Just because you feel intitled because the benefit no longer meets your expectation of the penalty is no reason to remove it.  You had the benefit when it did make a difference and you're still paying for it.  your buyers remorse does not entitle you to change the rules that existed when you started.<br />

These types of arguements against adjusting this feature are totally irrelevant. I can make a list a mile long of stuff EXACTLY similar to this that HAS changed. <br />
<br />
Want to know why I think this hasnt been adjusted? The same reason that halflings STILL get a 5% bonus (which was a mistake, it was supposed to go to humans) and that reason is they dont WANT to re-code it. Why else would the halfling bonus STILL be there? And why else wouldnt this penalty be adjusted when its obviously &quot;in the spirit of the game&quot; to do so? (again, I am not asking for removal, just adjustment). SOE has decided not to put the resources into this change, ever, period. Otherwise, Humans would have gotten their 5% long ago and halflings would be where they are supposed to be, no +/- at all.</div></div><hr />

I'm really sorry you wasted all that time posting something so stupid and didnt reinforce your point.<br />

That's great.  Whoever you are out there, thanks for the concern.  Let me report to you that the time doesn't feel wasted to me; I was having fun then and am still having fun now.  I hope you're having a nice day.</div></div><hr />

You had the benefit when it did make a difference and you're still paying for it.  your buyers remorse does not entitle you to change the rules that existed when you started....<br />
First off, I rolled up a Troll because I loved to look of the toon, and thought that the roleplay aspect was fun.  I wasn't trying to min/max everything to get the cookie cutter best Shaman out there cost to benifit.  I was NEVER once told that the cost was +20% (6 yellow per level baring XP deaths and the like).  Honest.  No where ever did I see the pay 20% more tag.  Do I feel buyers remorse now... well a little, and the only reason why is that I am paying so much more for so little.  ANYONE  that finds out later on that they got ripped off in a deal feels buyers remorse  (I thank you for this term, and will contine to use it as it complys with my theory, +rep bump for you).  <br />
<br />
Second, I never once asked for the penalty to be removed (please look at all of my posts to see for yourself) and I am not certain where you got this idea.  I am pretty sure that I can be quoted saying &quot;I do not mind paying for something, when the price fits with what I am buying.&quot; on more than one occation in regards to my buyers remorse.<br />
<br />
Third, the rules that existed when the penalty was made have been altered, ask the barbarians who recieved a 20% penalty before, and the knights back in Kunark.  The fact that the rules have been changed regarding the validity of these penalties in the past only empowers me more to keep this discussion about buyers remorse going.  I am indeed asking for the rules to be changed as I feel that the current system does not accurately reflect the cost.  All I want is a fair reward for the price that I pay... Is that really so much to ask??<br />
<br />
Ok, to be crystal clear here, I will never support the Iksar / Troll penalty being reduced by any amount. I will support regen being increased. I think that I am being open minded here, and am working with y'all, but you just don't seem to ever be satisfied Brothur.<br />

Ummm, OK so my response will determine if you are going to react civally or not?  So I have to disagree with you the way that you want?  Please do go back to the &quot;Deal with it&quot; policy, or better yet lets roll out the race / class balance comment again.  :rolleyes: <br />
BTW, the price has never changed, it has always been 20%. This means that your statment is in correct.You are paying what you always have, 20% of your xp income. <br />
OK, I'll make it simple for you.  Every level requires more and more experience before aquiring the next level.  The actual number of experiance required per level is increased by 20% for me, so in fact the cost does increase.  It is not a set amount added to the end (ie. +400XP per level) +20% is not a number.  :rolleyes: <br />

Your penalty is also for the greater starting stats, but that is prety moot at this point.  <br />

I am still very confused at how I raised my voice at you.  Well if you want to ignore me that is purely your right to do so.  I am just disapointed that when you are challanged and you own sarcasm is tossed in your face, why you behave like a child and throw a tantrum now? /boggle.

The fact that the rules have been changed regarding the validity of these penalties in the past only empowers me more to keep this discussion about buyers remorse going.  I am indeed asking for the rules to be changed as I feel that the current system does not accurately reflect the cost.  All I want is a fair reward for the price that I pay... Is that really so much to ask??<br />
Brothur,<br />
You make a good point.  While EQ, like life doesn't have to be fair, I do see that adjusting the penalty to appropriate levels would help sustain the fun factor.  I'll have to think about this for awhile.<br />

IE give iksar and trolls another 10-15 points of regen over normal races 65-70, bump forage to 100 instead of 50, Iksar AC another 20 point bump, ogre stun resistance slightly from any direction -- etc.</div></div><hr />
