<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cubman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">65 shaman here, most of my spells, was wondering how feasible it is to get past PoV PoS solo?  I am in a good sized guild, but my schedule prevents me from being online weekends when the big raids happen.  I know I actually have to kill AD to get past HoH, but was wondering how difficult it is to do the alternate key quests for HoH and CoD.<br />
<br />
Any help would b emost appreciated...Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
p.s. Although I don't post often, I do wander around these boards and have for years.  Thank you to all the contributors that have helped take some of the guesswork out of being a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vikor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The CoD key can be done solo with enough patience. The various named larvas all have known placeholders and you can run around invis to find those. Search the Safe House for all the exact names. Personally, I invited a bunch of high 50 people, I set them up smack in the middle of the north section and I chain pulled all the larvas to them. We usually managed to gather 10+ larva skins of various type per 2-3 hours.<br />
<br />
I don't see how you are going to solo the HoH key though. The Luminii Crawler isn't rootable which makes it pretty hard although possible. The prellium is rare as hell and only seems to drop from the 'broken prototype' mobs (not sure of the exact name but they are the thin humanoid ones with the circular saw). The difficulty is going to be the Archaic mobs you are bound to encounter; unslowable and unrootable. <br />
<br />
Finally, the agony mephit might be the worse to solo. For one, you can get on the plateau by (1) going through the whole hobgoblin cave, (2)doing the die/pull corpse trick with a SoS rogue or (3) by using the cheesy camp trick. Even assuming you can get up, my understanding is that one and only one agony can be up at the same time and therefore if it's already up deep in, you need to fight all the way to it. The respawn is too fast for you to go deep solo. If the agony is not up then you can simply kill the few mobs near the plateau and hope it shows up with the repops. Also, the agony mephit is an enchanter mob and that makes it pretty painful.<br />
<br />
Once you have all 3 items, the PoJ part is trivial at 65. I got all three souls in about 5 hours.<br />
<br />
All and all, I wouldn't do the HoH quest solo but you can most likely pull it off with a partner or two.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I find the &quot;crawl&quot; through the tunnel to get to the lower mephit area to be an insane amount of fun.  It's pretty boring once you get down past the second dropoff, because then it's just a bit too easy with the force you needed to crawl through the caves quickly enough to make it there.  But it's easy to find people to bring with you.  The blood sells pretty easily still on xev, everyone in the group will get that stinking earring the agony always drops, and the heart seems to drop a little mroe than half the time.  If you can convince a couple of extra people to help you get down there, I've known people who could do nicely down there with just 3 folks.<br />
<br />
Interesting idea on the agony - I decided to keep tash cured on the paladin after she got charmed, killed the ranger, and beat the crap out of me.  The agony instantly recast AE tash.  So I cured again.  Again with the tash.  May have been coincidence, but it really seemed like I could keep the agony chain casting tash the whole fight if I did nothing but cure.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually LaughingWoman, I have had this experience with enchanter mobs as well.  In particular one in PoJ.  I was just curing tash as quick as she casted it and sure enough the next thing she cast would be tash.  Every time I cured she re-tashed me.<br />
<br />
Hmmmmmmm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The Vampire on the top floor of the TM castle (Trixy Fancyfants or something ;) ) Also chain casts tash as soon as it's cured.  Makes for an easy fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>jadce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Chanter mobs are notorious for doing that, (chain tash after cureing) but one thing you have to know about agony mephit, he casts (cant remember name of spell begins w/ D) its unresistable charm, it sux<br />
<br />
Only one agony up at anytime aswell.. so if he is up deep in, thats where you have to kill him.<br />
<br />
You might be able to duo him....maybe...a group can kill him<br />
<br />
Block of perillium does only drop on those Prototype mobs that were mentioned before, its pretty rare, and spawn is rare...<br />
<br />
Get a group at the Dragon gate to kill the luminii crawler he spawns near there frequently...<br />
<br />
Bot flag requires a couple parties, or 2 charm classes, and a mixed group of clerics and such..<br />
<br />
Other than that my advice to you is...get tons of AA, Join a good guild, and get flagged, cause you arent going anywhere with key quests.  Key quests only provide you with acess to the plane, but does not allow further flagging, limiting your progress to tier 2 zones, and cod/hoh keys are huge time sinks.</div></div><hr />
