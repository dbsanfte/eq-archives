<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay i did a search before this on Katta but didn't really find what i was looking for. Atm at level 53 i'm in Dulak where loot is nice but exp is slow. Iv'e tried rats in PoJ but ZO is often camped and it hard to get to sentries/rats before other groups. <br />
<br />
Now heres my question, can i hut in Katta for good exp with similar ease as dulak or PoJ rats? If so can you give me a little guide r point in the direction of one? Also iv'e heard you can kill guards in an area where theres no adds or faction hits, if this is true where? Ty for help in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">SD Exit is where you can kill with no adds easy if you're a semi decent puller. Theres 6 static mobs and 2 wanderers. Just pull to the tunnel near the exit and you'll be fine. You will occasionally get two on your first pull once you're KoS if you don't pull well. <br />
<br />
Natyn's is good if you don't want to ruin your faction. Its harder to pull and doesn't drop as much cash stuff though. <br />
<br />
Either would be painfully slow before you get bane of nife though, but the exp is good if you can do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hamenu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you're worried about faction in Katta, Nathyn's guards are on a distinct faction. These targets become single-pullable at level 56.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think 53 is a bit early to hunt Katta guards spolo.  Grouped would be great exp though.<br />
<br />
If you want to solo at 53, go to HHK (Highhold Keep).  At 53 you can do nobles on second floor with ease.  See the excellent guide posted on these boards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think 56 was magic number for single pulls on guards in katta. Darkpaw: did you mean TS zone line? With the two sets of two around the 3 doors and the two walkers down the walkways?<br />
<br />
   Katta can be a little work at lvl 53 because of the fact i dont know if you'll get single or not. Pulling at TS zoneline though is safe enough to zone out and see if you can do it. Guards arent so tough but they do repop on their own far as i know. (meaning i havent heard it changed) think once 12hrs game time they do a kind of shift change. I dont know if its intional or not but its makes it difficult to do like a normal camp where you break it up and just keep ahead of respawn and pulling in order. <br />
   You'll find full spawns happening every so often but its steady exp if you can pull it since you wont be waiting for stuff to pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Astraa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not sure about at the TS zoneline, but at the Graveyard the mobs do have a shift change, only mobs that are up at the time despawn and new guards spawn in their place. This is mainly just annoying when you are killing a mob and it disappears, but once you get used to it you don't notice it. Not sure if that all made sense, pretty much the guard shift change is an annoyance, but nothing drastic.<br />
I wouldn't try Katta at 53 mainly because of the problems you'd have with pulling singles, I started there at 55-56 on my necro and dinged 60 there within a week and a half.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Getan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Try Nadox Elements at zone line. At 53 I was making 2.5 % xp every 3 kills solo. Only troubles are trains and waiting for respawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shaft</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'd say HHK or velks.  HHK is the best exp in the game 45-55 or so, but everyone and their brother know it, and its hard to find it uncamped.  Velks is nice, mobs are all 45+, hit 90-110 max except names, and have 6-8k hp, except names.  There is also a chance at actual loot here, unlike the planes, hhk, katta, SD, etc...  I did 58-60 here, but wish I'd thought of it earlier.. I did HHK till 55, then drifted around for 3 levels, about 1 of those was in Katta and I was unimpressed.  In my 2 levels in velks I picked up a few SCHW's, SCWB's, crystal spider eyes, CC gaunts, arms, and boots, etc..  Nice haul considering its pretty damn good exp as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah I meant TS zone. Head was a little garbeled from constant raiding when I posted that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>starlite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">good post shaft)<br />
<br />
Nice to see solid info from personal experience, not just someone spouting off, but really being a clueless blonde just like me  :P<br />
<br />
yeah HHk cant be beat for exp, very BORING camp tho.<br />
<br />
Think at 54 you can switch to pop tier 1, i gonna try duo with a lvl 60 who can charm mobs....<br />
<br />
Managed to get charasis key other week so at 55+ that maybe potential for exp...never been yet tho!(ever in 3 years)<br />
<br />
Tdeep dino isle is a maybe at 53 54 ish, but very camped with druids and such like scum at peek time....the usual kiter infestation!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">IMO  I hate loy mobs. they give good xp/loot. but their HP is way too high if you ask me. Best bet would be HHK. hands down great exp though a bit crowded at times. I tried katta at 54. wasnt too hard. HHK was just better xp =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>rezipps</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Katta is compareable to the inzone of chardok.<br />
<br />
All in all katta is good exp, i started there around 52 with a rogue friend. Im now 56 and solo pulling is not a problem now so its alot faster, and new pet(55) helps much more. <br />
<br />
I personally stick either to the guards near the graveyard, or near the bank. There are also more options, those are just the more favorite ones. And as mentioned above, the change of the guard is just an annoyance, waste of mana at most. Ive hardly ever have it effect a broken spawn too badly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Is the faction hit you get from killing bank guards more a problem just in Katta? Or is there other zones that will make you KoS?</div></div><hr />
