<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Damaged</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmmm level 18.  If you can get a group there, either Lake o' Ill Manners or Lake Rathe are both pretty good.  Maybe South Karana with a group as well.. I think you may be able to do the warrens as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On mine, while HPH is empty, HHK still has people fighting in the basement.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mrchiss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">High Pass Hold/High Keep is good experience from 15-21/21-35.<br />
<br />
Banks, merchants, bindable, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Albadia Fii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">At 18, and depending on how crowded it is on your server. Go to Paludal Caverns in luclin. Kills are easy, and XP is awesome. Grab a group at the bandit camps, or solo phlarg's/shrooms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Draavin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">For best exp, hunt in group. , the best group places I've found are 1) Aviaks in So. Karanas<br />
2) Highpass Hold East Gate (Orcs)<br />
3) Highpass Hold West Gate (Gnolls)<br />
4) Blackburrow Lower Level<br />
5) Befallen (upper level only for now)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The best guide I've seen so far is that given at WWW.allakhazam.com, but the website is a little difficult to navigate. Each piece of armor requires different items to fabricate, meaning different quests to complete. I would guess that 15 or so, unless you wait for dual wield at 17, would be a safe start. It's not that hard to take it one piece at at a time, but don't expect to get it all quickly. Set your goals, one at a time, then make it so. Good journey and may the blessings of Karana go with you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Draavin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm not preaching, but I personally feel that any person interested enough to dedicate the time and effort to build a character in EQ, should have the patience and dedication necessary to do it right. To me, power leveling is sonething that should be reserved for alts (your characters other than your main or first character. Passing on information to encourage &quot;newbies&quot; to twink to extremes and power level is akin to buying a complex video games and immediately going out to buy cheat code books so they don't have to experience the whole thing. We are in this for the experiences, both good and bad, the fate of the game brings us. If you don't die, how will you learn from the mistake or misjudgement  which caused your death, thereby making you more valuable to the game and to future group members. I know personally of 40-50s PCs that I would only group with if there were no other alternative. On the other hand, I know of lower level PC's that have been playing since the begining. What they can teach me is more valuable than blasting through a level just to go higher, with no idea of what a ranger, or other character, of that level is supposed to be able to do, to experience. When I was only level 7, I travelled the world, getting killed all over Norrath. By the time I was 11, I knew how to sneak around, evade, avoid and generally keepmyself alive through my own experiences. I was in every high level zone at least once by 9, and before 10 was travelling the Karana's by myself...verrryyy carefully, but without dying, for days on end. I didn't take on level 50 MOBs, but I taught myself how to keep away from them, just as a real ranger would have to do...just as the US Army Rangers, or any other Reccon unit, or insurgent unit would have to do in real life. An EQ Ranger should dedicate his early career to learning Evasion first. When you get sneak and hide skills, you'll just be that much better and MORE SURVIVABLE.<br />
REMEMBER: Improvise, Adapt and Overcome<br />

Karana protect The Protectors of The JaggedPine<br />

<br />
When not in the game, live your real life, not your fantasy life.<br />
But, when in the game, get the most out of it.<br />
Live your Ranger life as if it were real. Be what you are, Kill only with a purpose, kill  neutral mammals (yes even Grizzleys and Mammoths) only when necessary to save a life or complete a Ranger Quest. Accept your fate and your responsibility and, when you reach LVL 65 (and you will), you will have learned as much about your real self as you have about your character self.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nephyrbreeze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hmm, try Kerra Isle, The Throne room in the Warrens, and Stonebrunt. All pretty decent.</div></div><hr />
