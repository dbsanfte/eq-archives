I wish I wrote the name down, and if I see it again tonight I will. I often do searches in Bazaar of different spells selling, etc. I tend to track some drop rates based on the amount of spells being sold.<br />

Well last night doing a spell search on Shamans, one came up in the list I had never seen. Another odity was, it didn't list as others have starting with &quot;spell:soandsoname&quot;. It started with an &quot;N&quot; though and was 2 words. It listed as a lvl 39 Shaman/All race, Alteration 1 charge, all just like a spell we mem. The person selling it was not responding to tells as to where it dropped, etc. What I do remember is the first name in the spell started with an N and the second word I believe a G. I'll search again tonight and get the name written down for posting unless someone else has seen this and adds to the thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>SneakyB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The only spell I know of that is not the actual name of the spell is McMerrin's Feast, which is Canni 2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Genine Goosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What you saw was probably McMerin's Feast. That is what the scroll is called for Cannibalize II.</div></div><hr />
