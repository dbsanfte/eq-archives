<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mudders16</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys, can anyone gimme any info on camping lodizal or where i can find a guide on it, my 65 shammy friend gonna help me get a shield for back slot :P thx , also if a 65 shammy cant take lodizal say so, im pretty sure they should be able to if a 60 necro in the velious era could do</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Can't really offer too much in camping advice, other than to hang out by the gnolls and plan to be there for a long time, and to expect to see some people pop in to kill him right about when he's due to spawn.<br />
<br />
Shamans could solo him at lvl 60 in velious era too, so I reckon a 65 could with little effort.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't remember exactly what his spawn time is.  I think it is either 12 or 18 hours, with a window.  He'll spawn out in the ocean near the kobolds.  He's an easy solo for any 65 shaman that knows how to solo a summoning mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">65 shaman with Q/Torpor = can kill Lodz<br />
<br />
Info on camping: Sit and wait until he spawns, aggro+damage him asap and kill... will be competition there to try take it away from you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mudders16</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">so, where exactly is this camp been a while since i been to iceclad? he just spawn in water, or on ice chunk or what? lol ill look on eqatlas too maybe that'll help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Lodizal spawns on a small island/chunk of iceburg out in front of ToFS in Iceclad; there are several minature walrus running on the chunk that get wacked by the gnolls there from time to time, so its not hard to miss it.<br />
As to spawn times, me and a paladin friend camped him this time last year for approx 1 week, netting him 7/15ish spawns (rest were KS fiascos).<br />
Lodi spawns every 11hrs +/1 1 hr, my friend and I were there at the 10 hr mark every time and it happened exactly on that 10-12 hr time period, usually closer to 12 hrs; he spawns directly on the island and will aggro the closest sitting PC. Once Lodi spawns and isnt aggroed (or on a failed kill) he wanders towards the gnome pirate island, and despawns approx 5 min later, and respawns around 5-10 min later and heads back up the coast, he then despawns if not aggroed and waits till the next scheduled spawn time.<br />
Sure a 65 shaman can solo him, hes slowable, if a tad bit resistant to magic. He(she?) is a level 60 spawn and summons, turns to run at 22ish % and enrages (iirc on the enrage, I seem to remember him rampaging too).<br />
Again, yeah a 65 shaman with Q and alpha pet can solo him easy, stuff in Tier 2+ hit harder, faster and have more hit points and the typical LDoN mob is as tough; the main problem with Lodi is KSing. On most servers KSing him is a way of life, and some guilds perma camp him for EB items, shields for alts, Belts for melees, etc.<br />
If you really want the shield, bring a rogue and a wizard/mage and let the shaman tank w/ Incapacitate for aggro purposes; just have him keep Q up on himself (or torpor, both work) and spot heal with Tnarg; add a KEI and a Virtue and its trivial.<br />
He always drops one shell piece (sometimes up to 2), and the map piece for the Eyepatch of Plunder quest; I have seen 2 Belts and 2 Shields from the same spawn, along with varied level 60 Velious era spells (PoTG, Aegolisim and Focus to name a few).<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Only possible problem is KSers, other than that a 65 shaman can fairly easily solo him.  The KSing isn't as bad is it has been in the past; he's been made to no longer skip spawns and that in combination with better gear from later expansions has really driven down the price of his drops, and with less competition comes less KSing.  Still happens, of course, and a shaman isn't the best DPS machine out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Also if you do get KSed there's absolutely nothing GMs will do even if you have proof to /report. Best thing to do if you see other people waiting is to try to make an agreement before he spawns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">In 3 consecutive Lodizal camps, the time was 11:40 between spawns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Preecher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Spawn time is 11 +/- 1 hour</div></div><hr />
