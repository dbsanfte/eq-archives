<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Islowem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">**Edited the post title, to reflect the new spell reward**<br />
<br />
I posted the following in the other Pure Blood Thread, but starting a new one so it's easier to find.<br />
<br />
Had to do this bloody quest three times, before I finally got my spell. Here is what I have learned, hope it helps someone.<br />
<br />
1) Gunthak Gulf Water - Drops off any &quot;pirate&quot; around the troll fort in Gulf of Gunthak. Uncommon to Rare drop.  To find the fort, go to the tunnel at the back of the beach.  Follow tunnel.  Take first left.  You will come to an area with alot of small houses surrounding a wooden fort.  Any mob, in any of these houses, can drop the Gulf Water.<br />
<br />
2) a blackened vial - Drops off &quot;a Broken Skull adherent&quot; in Nadox (least the three I got). Shaman type mob, dark blue at 61.  Invis up.  From zone in from the luggald castle in the gulf (not the one with the lava river), go left.  Go up the slope, and past the first room off to the left.  Stop at the hall to the right.  I set up camp here.  There are two guard roamers, and one sycophant (green to 61, shaman type) roamer.  Kill those three.  Then looking on down the hall, you see three mobs.  Two guarding a door, and one roaming back and forth.  The two guarding the door can drop the vial.  Either can spawn as a named also, that drop caster gloves, and not sure what else.<br />
<br />
3) broken skull clan blood - Drops off any &quot;furious&quot; or &quot;vehement&quot; Trolls in Nadox. (50 / 50 on light blue to blue, at lvl 61).  There is one in the above mentioned camp spot (the roamer that goes back and forth in front of the door).  But a better spot full of them is as follows.  Invis back up, and go down to the room where you was pulling the two door guards.  Go thru that room.  Just past the next hall to the right, and before the next room, I stopped and set up camp again.  Two roamers at most (both sycophants), and the room directly ahead is full of furious and vehement.   There is also a named LT. that can spawn in that room.<br />
<br />
4) pure blood - Drops off the luggald over the bridge, in Nadox. Got all three of mine from the initiates, but I imagine any of them can drop it. Dark blue at 61.  From the last camp spot, for the broken skull blood, continue thru that room, you will enter a cavern.  To the left is a bridge.  Go across the bridge.  You will see three halls.  Right hall is the &quot;incubator area&quot;, full of luggald that apparently are making more.  Center Hall is full of luggald.   Left hall is full of undead looking Trolls.  WARNING.  Some are undead, and will see thru invis.  Make sure to con everything.  I set up camp by going thru the middle door, straight thru the room full of luggald, and setting up camp in the middle of the next hall.  No roamers here, so was a good spot.<br />
<br />
Combine gunthak gulf water, a blackened vial, and broken skull clan blood in a brew barrel. Take result and combine with the pure blood in a brew barrel. Give the final result (glowing black potion)to the quest NPC (Grennik Neltrin).<br />
<br />
Some important notes !!!<br />
<br />
1 - The drops are tagged Magic, and No Drop, but NOT Lore<br />
<br />
2 - I had AA exp on 100 percent, and when I did turn in, I got exactly 20 percent (or a full yellow) of AA for final turn in/ spell reward. (Nice bonus)<br />
<br />
3 - The hardest mob/ part, to me, was the luggald. They dont cast, but have a ton of hit points, and sometimes hard to single pull at 61.  The named Shaman (when getting the blackened vial), was dark blue, and the very hardest mob, ended up having to ask some passerbys for help cause I underestimated him. :)<br />
<br />
Good luck to you all, hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Slow</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Islowem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I am talking of the zone in point, from the castle full of luggald/ mutants/ pirates, in Gulf of Gunthak (not the one from gulf that leads to the lava river)<br />

And yes, they are no fail now, forget to edit it before i posted.  Thanks. :)</div></div><hr />

from Gunthak, enter caves, then it's 2nd cave on the left, and 1st on the right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>dennman007</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">good guide :) i got mine in 4-5 hrs. i have to add that having a DS potion helps alot. not easy even when you are 65 hehe. oh make sure you have lots of room to loot the racial meats for illusion potion!<br />
<br />
thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">A blackened vial can also drop from a Broken Skull initiate.<br />
<br />
And the most important point of all -- the spell scroll that Shamans get is now Blood of Nadox, not Pure Blood. After handing the potion in to the quest NPC, I think you need to hail her again to receive the spell scroll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just did this yesterday and I gotta say this is a good walk through.  I found the hardest mobs to solo were the initiates and adherants for the blackened vial.  I had to bring a few friends along as I definitely understimated them.  The Blackhands were cake to single pull and solo, I actually just invised and ran into the corner of the room, made a pet and soloed about 5 or 6 before respawns.  This was at level 60 no torpor/malo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Islowem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">aye, the reward is now Blood of Nadox.  I did the quest before the last patch, and got Pure Blood.  Have since went back, hailed the npc, and she gave me Blood.  So currently have both scribed.  Read somewhere (forget where), that they will be removing shaman from the Pure Blood scroll.  Anyone know what will happen to the one i have in the book?  Will it disappear, or will i just not be able to mem it? :)<br />
<br />
Anyways, good luck to you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Innatook</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The vial can drop from any Adherants, even the first two by the hallway. Got mine on 2nd kill, the 2nd night (after about 30 kills)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Not to nitpick but there are 3 zone ins (4 if you count Hates but thats just silly) Two from Gunthark, one from mines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jkana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">a blackened vial can also drop from the named in the camp mentioned above.  I forgot the name, Duselin or something.<br />
<br />
I camped pure blood from the safe hallway past the large luggald room.  I duoed with a warrior for about 12 hours (65 warrior, 57 shaman) and was able to keep 7 spawns clear (was camping for the fecund luggald flesh too).  The drops seemed streaky.  It took about an hour to get my drop.  I had 8 drop in an hour at one point and then did not get one for 7 hours.  It was so so xp, but I did get a few good loot drops.  All but one of the pulls come single.  The named can pop from any mob corpse, Garozin Razorfin.  He can be a bit rough if you have mobs in camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>zolexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Not sure if this has been mentioned, but the Gunthak Gulf Water can be foraged also.  Yesterday while completing my Stoicism quest in GoG, a druid /ooc'd asking what it was for, saying he just foraged it.  Nice for the iksars out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well, I must be doing something wrong ....<br />
<br />
I am 61, and had a 61 necro with me, and we got to the 4th camp, for the luggald.  Two came from the entrance to the hall, and beat us down pretty quickly.  Root would not stick, and even slowed the luggalds ate my lvl 61 pet and his pet and him.<br />
<br />
So - should I look in the next room for a single pull, or is there a way to get just one from the entranceway to the hall described as the 4th camp?<br />
<br />
PS - if you go to Torg Mines to try for the charm from the Broken Skull Seer, and Ganthak Whisperwind is hanging out at the camp - just leave.  This light blue con killed the pets, me and the necro in less than the time to type &quot;This mob is immune to changes in attack speed.&quot;   The fun part was guiding the necro through the zone from my bind point, so he could drag my corpse  8)'</div></div><hr />

I have been here for the last couple days 2-boxing with my Shaman and Druid.  It is tough and you have to be careful, but it is doable.  I get my pup out and get fully buffed, then med back up to full.<br />
<br />
The first pull, the ones just outside the tunnel, you will always get both.  I haven't found a way yet to not get both.  I just get them both slowed ASAP.  This is a tough fight.  I dot with Plague and Bane and JBB.  Stoicism myself as necessary.  Druid keeps them dotted, occasional DD and keeps me alive.<br />
<br />
Once they are dead it gets easier.  If you look straight out into the room, there are pillars on either side that you can see.  The luggald by the right hand pillar will come solo.  The one on the left will bring a Treasure Sorter with him/her/it, whatever they are.  The luggalds will not run, but the Treasure Sorters will.  Make sure they are snared or rooted, they run right out into the room.  There is one other solo pull that I have found so far that is easy.  If you ease just outside the tunnel and look left.  Down along that wall is another one.  From in front of the tunnel, you can single-pull him.<br />
<br />
As I said, its not easy, but its doable.  So far, I have got 3 Fecund Luggald Flesh, 1 Pure Blood, 1 new research item, some cash loot (Sapphires, etc) and 1 quest item that I can't find any info on (Bag of Mail, or something like that). I have also died twice.  I managed to get a rez both times though.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I got my Pure Blood from a luggald just past the bridge. We went in by the lava zone entrance, did the hot swim (ouch ouch ouch), and surfaced in the corner by the bridge. It was my first venture into that zone entrance, so I don't have any other reference points. For some reason, I couldn't climb the slope by the bridge, so got CoH'd out of the lava (a little embarassing, but it's hard to mem shrink when swimming in lava).<br />
<br />
I (57 shaman) was grouped with 61 magician, 59 monk and 50 druid. The magician and monk could both single pull (though the monk needed FD to do so). When the monk went afk a while, we could still kill them comfortably with the mage air pet tanking. With the mobs slowed, the druid was fine with healing with his new LoY 45 heal, with me keeping group regrowth up.<br />
<br />
I got my blackened vial a couple of days after the extension came out, from the camp described above. The named guy at the camp dropped a nice shaman only weapon, which the other shaman won the roll for. It seemed to be an easy camp with a monk pulling, but when the monk left, a 57 ranger could not single pull and the group ended in a wipeout when we got a string of mobs on a weird pull which the enchanter couldn't quite cope with.<br />
<br />
Now I need to go get the other bits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Thanks Tarelan - it appears that we should be able to do this.  Doesn't sound like I will be able to solo it tho  8(<br />
<br />
Kianor mentioned problems climbing out of the lava river.  I get in bear form before swimming - the bear climbs much, much better than me troll form!<br />
<br />
and yes - this needs a sticky.  same as Stoicism.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Just finished this rescently and thought I'd add my notes. This is as a fairly well equiped lvl 65 shaman. Did it all solo and it was all pretty easy.<br />
<br />
<br />
1) Gunthak Gulf Water - Drops off any &quot;pirate&quot; around the troll fort in Gulf of Gunthak. Uncommon to Rare drop.  To find the fort, go to the tunnel at the back of the beach.  Follow tunnel.  Take first left.  You will come to an area with alot of small houses surrounding a wooden fort.  Any mob, in any of these houses, can drop the Gulf Water.<br />
<br />
These guys are jokes to say the least. Started off pulling singles, then chain pulling and then just said screw it and pulled 4 or 5 at a time and slowed with tigirs and let dual wielding pet rip em apart. Fairly rare drop from what i saw killed quite a few before I got it. Not to big a deal tho since they are so easy. The also almost all drop a weapon of some form that sells for a couple gp to 3-4pp so don't need to worry about weapons for fido really.<br />
<br />
2) a blackened vial - Drops off &quot;a Broken Skull adherent&quot; in Nadox (least the three I got). Shaman type mob, dark blue at 61.  Invis up.  From zone in from the luggald castle in the gulf (not the one with the lava river), go left.  Go up the slope, and past the first room off to the left.  Stop at the hall to the right.  I set up camp here.  There are two guard roamers, and one sycophant (green to 61, shaman type) roamer.  Kill those three.  Then looking on down the hall, you see three mobs.  Two guarding a door, and one roaming back and forth.  The two guarding the door can drop the vial.  Either can spawn as a named also, that drop caster gloves, and not sure what else.<br />
<br />
Was right where you said they'd be. Got one of first kill so no clue on rare they are =)<br />
<br />
3) broken skull clan blood - Drops off any &quot;furious&quot; or &quot;vehement&quot; Trolls in Nadox. (50 / 50 on light blue to blue, at lvl 61).  There is one in the above mentioned camp spot (the roamer that goes back and forth in front of the door).  But a better spot full of them is as follows.  Invis back up, and go down to the room where you was pulling the two door guards.  Go thru that room.  Just past the next hall to the right, and before the next room, I stopped and set up camp again.  Two roamers at most (both sycophants), and the room directly ahead is full of furious and vehement.   There is also a named LT. that can spawn in that room.<br />
<br />
This was my hardest one. Kept this room cleared solo and sometimes had to wait for respawn. Got the named LT 3 or 4 times before I got the blood.<br />
<br />
4) pure blood - Drops off the luggald over the bridge, in Nadox. Got all three of mine from the initiates, but I imagine any of them can drop it. Dark blue at 61.  From the last camp spot, for the broken skull blood, continue thru that room, you will enter a cavern.  To the left is a bridge.  Go across the bridge.  You will see three halls.  Right hall is the &quot;incubator area&quot;, full of luggald that apparently are making more.  Center Hall is full of luggald.   Left hall is full of undead looking Trolls.  WARNING.  Some are undead, and will see thru invis.  Make sure to con everything.  I set up camp by going thru the middle door, straight thru the room full of luggald, and setting up camp in the middle of the next hall.  No roamers here, so was a good spot.<br />
<br />
<br />
Never did these guys looted one of someone else's kill whil camping the broken skull clan blood.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Thanks a million for the great guide.  Made three trips of an hour or two each, none of the drops were TOO bad, though I had some nasty moments with getting too cocky and pulling that room full of trolls.  ;)<br />
<br />
Turnin was worth 3% real exp in 62, btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Baz finished it Sunday, all in one day.<br />
<br />
Gunthak Gulf Water - very easy camp.  Saw shaman level 43 duo'ing here with a druid.<br />
<br />
A balckened Vial - I got this where Islowem describes, but mine came off of an Initiate, rather than an Adherent.  4 kill from the spawns Islowem targets, and maybe 5 or so roamers.  Like most in this zone, a lot of hp, but not hard kills.  At one point I had a a Sycophant (green) add to a roaming blackhand, then another Sycophant as I finished the first - so three with no break, and still not that tuff.<br />
<br />
Broken Skull Clan Blood - this took the most kills.  But all are Dark Blue to me at 61, so some exp at least.  We were at the bridge, and only got vehement/furious occasionally - maybe a dozen of those before we got one, and six more for a second drop for a friend.<br />
<br />
Pure Blood - <br />
We did this from the bridge area.  killed the trolls by the door, and pulled luggald out to the bridge.  There are a couple of roamers that come out to the door and can be pulled single.  the two luggald that guard the entrance to the big room (the one Islowem says to cross to the hall with no roamers) coem together, and were tough with a 60 war and a 61 shaman - but we were really not ready.  I would not enjoy doing two by myself.  We got three on one pull, and lasted a couple of minutes before they wiped us out - root just would not stick long enough!  Got the Pure Blood after only about 6 kills, from an Abomination.<br />
<br />
I have Zero (0) in brewing skills, so I was worried about the combine.  Now I know that &quot;no fail&quot; means just that -no skill required at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Shandy finished it in 5 hrs.  Blackened vial was quick, Clan Blood took a lot of kills, camped the luggald from the corridor between the 1st room past the door and the incubator room and took 2 hrs.<br />
<br />
It was fun wiping out hundreds of pirates with my friends.  Pull a side of the fort, I'd kill 2 while my buds killed a dozen =(  Darn things have a heck of a knockback.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>DarkSidhe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Curious as to exactly what the benefit for this is? I see from Lucy that it's a group spell, but is it tgb'able? Seems like a lot of work for something...redundant.</div></div><hr />

Based on all of this is it stupid to even try to do this quest. Disinfecting Aura decreases Poi and Dis by 10 counters each and Pure Blood and Blood of Nadox only do the same but for 9 counters.  Am I reading this correct?  Is Blood of Nadox now a group spell?  If this is the case it would be worthwhile to get.<br />

Please help me clear the confusion.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I don't have this spell as of yet.<br />
<br />
But how many times are you in a group and people get slowed?  I have seen this in PoJ, Seb and Dulak.  A group version of this spell will be nice.<br />
<br />
I need to make the effort to get this done.  Trying to get to 56 and more Tae Ew blood first.  The off to Nadox.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">For some reason, I couldn't climb the slope by the bridge, so got CoH'd out of the lava (a little embarassing, but it's hard to mem shrink when swimming in lava). <br />
<br />
This happens exclusivley to barbarians as far as I can tell. The same problem happens in The Deep when trying to climb up on the other side after dropping off the invisible bridge. Other races can simply run against the wall and climb right out, while barbarians have a heck of a time and have to zig-zag back and forth against a wall.<br />
<br />
The best solution I have found is to bearform. Then you can run right up the wall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Thograk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">This happens exclusivley to barbarians as far as I can tell.<br />
<br />
I think it's a large race thing. I couldn't do it as a troll either. I had to run back to the zone-in and shrink myself then was able to run up the wall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Islowem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Yes, Blood of Nadox is a group spell.  Yes, Blood of Nadox removes 9 counters, and Disinfecting Aura removes 10, BUT, Blood of Nadox is very nice for Trials, CT, and.. ummm.. any other spots where more then one group member is poisoned/ diseased/ slowed/ tashed.<br />
<br />
I tried to change the title of the post, so it displays the new (current) reward for this quest, but it wont allow.  Perhaps a kind board admin can do for me? :)<br />
<br />
Hope that answers your questions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Just a little update on drop locations within Nadox:<br />
<br />
As I mentioned above, I got the pure blood from near the lava bridge. Last night I got the broken skull clan blood from the same area, but the other side of the bridge over the lava. We camped in the corner, right by the lava river, and pulled to there. There were several furious and vehement spawns nearby.</div></div><hr />

First, the guide.  Used this along with a downloaded map to easily find and kill all the mobs -- worked like a charm.  Never had any problems identifying the mobs to kill.  Thanks!<br />
<br />
Second, the quest.  WOW.  First, you get to kill mobs that give awesome experience if you're in the right level range.  Second, the mobs drop tons of loot -- we made our chanter very happy with the belt drop off the named in the adherent section, then she got gloves...  We never saw the shoulders, but we didn't expect to.  And the coin/gem drops, oh my!  You don't mind getting that treasure hunter add when he drops a  ruby. :)  And then you complete the quest... one a 62nd level char was a full orange AA bubble, on a 52nd level char was a full orange real experience!!  One thing I'd add.. while you're killing luggalds save that fecund flesh, 3 of those and you've completed the 'tough' part of a quest for a decent ring.<br />
<br />
Third, the spell.  GROUP cure disease/poison.  I really hate hunting chanter mobs when the first spell they cast is group tash -- this cures it on your whole group.  And I hate group slows even more -- hunting in Cazic used to be frustrating.  This takes care of that, too.<br />
<br />
All in all, a fun quest to complete for a decent reward (both for the spell and the experience) -- and a lot of toys and coin along the way.  Someone at VI screwed up, I think. ;)</div></div><hr />
