<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xawl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is there a chart showing the XP required for each level up to 65 for the various races? I searched but couldn't find anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xawl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xawl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Geoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The last one I saw was really old.  I don't think it had been modified for the new 51 to 60 exp and certainly not for 61 to 65.  I think that because of changes in the code of the game it is no longer possible to sniff exp and therefore chart out the exp needed to level.<br />
<br />
Did a google search and found the one I was thinking about.  It's out of date but might give you a ballpark idea.  Also note that this calculator was made before the class penalties were removed so you would need to use class of cleric, druid or shaman.<br />

Hope this helps,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Akhasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I really don't mean to sound condescending, but why does it matter? AFAIK, you cannot see numerical exp values in EQ without a 3rd party program (showeq), so I'm not sure what good even having that information would be.  In fact, even getting that info would probably require ShowEQ.  I recall seeing the values a long time ago, but wondered what good they would do anyone.  If you are looking for the quickest way to level, a better question might be to ask what mobs give the best % of experience at a given level, since thats fairly easily attainable.<br />
<br />
I'm sure someone knows the % bonus/penalty for the various races, and maybe thats what you are looking for, but it wasn't clear by your post.<br />
<br />
Again, not bashing at all, just curious.  Sorry I can't provide any better info.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Temuchin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">it matters because the guy wants to know how much exp he needs to level<br />
<br />
however he wants to slice it, the actual numbers will be the best way for him to digest the info as he sees fit<br />
<br />
I'd expect he'd also want exp values and mods for specific mobs and zones but there's nothing wrong with that either<br />
<br />
many of the maps you used to help you play this game as well as hard info on where to level was derived directly from use of showeq or emus<br />
<br />
and many people who actually directly benefited from showeq or things along those lines, but only in a degree of separation that allowed them to &quot;keep their hands from getting dirty&quot; will go off on other people... that's annoying<br />
<br />
one of bartle's segmentations on types of players who play MUDs and mmpog references players who strive to find out everything about how a game works... inside and out, from interesting glitches in the geometry of zones, secondary uses of spells etc... incidentally these are the people who end up designing other games or being the most capable beta testers<br />
<br />
Akhasha, please don't stifle Xawl's natural tendencies, let us both be open-minded and support and nurture his interests for the benefit of all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Akhasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was asking what difference it made, because I was curious also..to &quot;digest the info as I see fit&quot;...how is that any different than his question? <br />
<br />
I'm genuinely curious what good the info would be.  I have an extremely open mind, and would love to have my perception swayed by an intelligent response.   I certainly wasn't stifling, I too was just asking a question..although, obviously, in the exact tone I tried to stay away from. <br />
<br />
Lastly, its sort of silly to ask me not to stifle Xawl's natural tendencies.  He's not my offspring, and thus I have no control over what questions he asks.  I questioned his question, but other than that made no inflammatory remarks whatsoever regarding it.  In fact, to be brutally honest, I have no problem with SEQ or those who use it - their perogative.  I am not sure what in my post made it sound like I had any problem with his question at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xawl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">First, I want to know because my level 48 shaman is my highest char and I'm curious how the XP requirements scale vis-a-vis the significant increase in spells/level.<br />
<br />
That is what initially spawned the question. There are probably a dozen other reason I could come up with for asking the question. <br />
<br />
Responding to this is more important though:<br />
<br />
&quot; He's not my offspring, and thusI have no control over what questions he asks&quot;<br />
<br />
Wrong. Your argument implies that parents are the only people who can 'control'. First, as a parent of three, I can assure you that 'control' is something that parents assuradely DONT have.  Second, even if you substitue 'control' with 'influence', it could be argued that peers have much more influence than most parents, especially at certain ages. <br />
<br />
Asserting that your virtual annonymity absolves you of all accountability for your words is sophistry ... and lame.<br />
<br />
Peace though, I hear the sincerity in your claim that your are &quot; not bashing at all'.<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Akhasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Your reason is perfectly reasonable...you just didn't state it earlier, and thats why I questioned you.<br />
<br />
I'm a parent also..and I most certainly have control what they do and say, if not beforehand, then after the fact.  Temuchin made it sound like I was somehow squelching you, or at least attempting to, and I was telling him that that was not my intention and not in my power.  You are correct about peers, but that was, as I mentioned, not my intention.  If I were trying to play the peer-influence card, my response would have been more like &quot;go ask on the ShowEQ forums, cheater&quot;...certainly not my intention.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure where you got the virtual anonymity line.  I'm not making any attempts at hiding who I am, nor am I hiding behind anything, nor do I have a reason to.  what is there on this forum but anonymity? Is your RL name and address posted somewhere? Mine's not, but I guess if it were necessary, I'd do it.  <br />
<br />
I am sincere that I am not, and was not bashing.  If I had a tone, it was just because you'd posted a question that, in my mind, doesn't get asked all that much, and when it does it usually has different connotations than you've outlined.  Maybe its years of dealing with some of the people in this game, and maybe I am a touch offensive when it comes to something like this.  Maybe its a leftover of my earlier days as a monk, and the nasty fights i'd jump into over twinks, and iksar vs human, etc.  I guess my response is lined with alot of bad blood in general, and for that I'm sorry you felt the edge...it truly wasn't intended.</div></div><hr />
