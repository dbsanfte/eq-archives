<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I want to say thank you to a whole whack of people for a variety of things today.<br />
<br />
My day started in Eastern Wastes, getting lost in the snow and waiting in a hut with Arbor, the Lord of the Rings, for Gloridain to spawn. Arbor was pretty sure if we were careful we could do the 8th ring war on our own, but when we asked if anyone wanted to come help, the response was overwhelming. We probably could have won the war ourselves, with response we got. Net result Wulfie got his 8th ring and some lower level alts got some gear. Thank you to Imas, Rommie, Coatie, Spec, Jlove, Infie, Arbor, and VB for the help and others for the encouragement.<br />
<br />
Shortly after that, we headed for Seb to go whack some Juggies. But as we were getting ready, The Word went out that Seb was up. We raced there to find a small force of FoH ready to pull him. I sent a few tells to Pilferr and he referred me to Ruluvien. I told them why we were there (primarily the green scale) and they wanted to try Sev with their force to see if they could take him. He was really cool to talk with and said they weren't after a scale and we could have it if one dropped. We could also take our crack if they failed (which I don't think many of us thought would happen). On the whole I was pleased with our discussion and offered him some support if he wished it (which was declined: they really were out for shits and giggles :) ). Unfortunately, they somehow pre-aggroed and were wiped out with Sev at 25%. Their bad luck meant we were up and we took out Sev, with a very nervous Wulfie trying to get people grouped and ready (with various degrees of success). It wasn't the cleanest take down of a dragon, but he didn't kill very many (aside from those he summoned early) and we won :) . We ended up with a truckload of spells but no green scale... ah well. It was a confidence booster to us :). Thank you to FoH for being so cool about the whole thing and for our guys for the response once we learned Sev was up :)<br />
<br />
After that, a bunch of us decided to go into Seband take our turn with the Juggies. Inifie, Sinfutura, Lelwen, Adelrune, Jlove, Falino, Blumgan, VB, Arbor, Meiwyn, Spec, Neverflee (the dead doorman), Mawafu, Aolwenye, Row, Kly and Vhela were all there at various times to  romp through the ever-adding shrooms and then the Juggs, Protector and finally Jumpy :) A pretty decent day for KOE's spell bank when all was said and done (/bonk Blumgan for dishing leadership of it from himself to me :p ).<br />
<br />
Thank you all for a great day :) It was a lot of fun :)</div></div><hr />

Congo Rats(tm) to all on the great job and response to a Sev call....:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Infinate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I had a blast. I actually really enjoyed being the only cleric on a juggs raid. Thanks to all the wis casters for making my job easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vhela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It was a lot of fun, I actually laughed when I died.<br />
<br />
As far as getting Sev.....how incredible that we had 2 groups formed, buffed and ready to click the bubble as the call went out. It was Sev up.....bam! 12 people running like maniacs for EJ zone LOL.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jlove Fizzboom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yups, great day:) -- later on we killed a Thought Stealer wormie type deal in Maidens Eye - a little sloppy first go around as people showed up in waves and we had about 15 adds while the Sarcman kited him - but we rezzed up, cleared, and killed.<br />
<br />
Gratz Rizz on (I think) a Stone Ring - 5ac, 5 to all stats and resists - we gotta figure a way to get this guy to take stuff without a general boycott and refusal to accept trade windows from him :)<br />
<br />
Arbor had told me about Shadewood bows, so I tried and was successful (albeit 5 attempts at 390pp per...) at a Shaped Shadewood Compound bow for Colbain - 21/39/200.<br />
<br />
Then I noticed Zirog in Kael, and asked to head over.  I got a little contingent of non-koe as I ran along towards Kael (including one Dragon Dancer par Excellence) and even tho I don't think I was yet ally to cov - I managed to MAX FACTION while there :)<br />
<br />
Fun days to be had in Norrath lately (/rude Severillous) .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Meiwyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Glad I could join up in Seb :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Neverflee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">First time I had ever worked the door for Juggies, infact only like my 3rd Jugg Raid ever. Wulfran send me a tell &quot;all you have to do is click on that pot there and if I get more than a fightable amount just stand there&quot;. I open the door to see Maw fall down, then Wulfran shoots his bow and all you see is a mountain of Clay coming after you (sigh-lol), pow pow pow boom boom and CRUNCH, Loading please wait.......That was all I seen lol. I had a blast!!! Hopefully I get better at door man duties, is alot harder to keep that thing open all the time, than you would think :)</div></div><hr />
