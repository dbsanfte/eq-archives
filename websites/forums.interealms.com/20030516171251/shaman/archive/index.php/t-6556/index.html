<br />
Was toying with my new SK at lvl 8-12 in Upper Guk the other day near the zone and had 4 reds on me &amp; was poisoned. Hmmm, time to zone I think.<br />
<br />
Zoned at 1 bub hps and got pleasant suprprise on the other side.<br />
<br />
Due to the buff stripping and my hp gear being more than base hp when I zoned out the other side I had &gt;50% hps and poison dot was gone.<br />
<br />
Obviously only any good for a twink with good hp gear but in case anyone wants to try it you can easily solo/split red con spawns using this. Obviously not much use if being PL'd either :).<br />
<br />
Probably be counted as an exploit also so if you get banned/get a warning for doing this don't come crying to me :p<br />
