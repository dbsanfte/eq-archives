<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>atcMickey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Any help would be greatly appreciated. I know the basics of moving em, scribing em, making hot keys, etc... Just want to get maybe a list or something that shows me where most people put what spells at each lvl etc...<br />
<br />
THANKS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There are several basic methods that I have seen people use for organizing their books:<br />
<br />
1)They go in in whatever order they got scribed and never get moved. Not real an organizational plan - just mentioning it for completeness.<br />
<br />
2)Alphabetical. It works for some people, but I personally can't see it.<br />
<br />
3)Broken up by spell type : Example : Buffs on page 1/2, Heals/Cures on 3/4, DoTs on 5/6, etc...<br />
<br />
4)As #3, but with page 1/2 holding the most commonly swapped in spells (those spells are not with the others of their type).<br />
<br />
5)As #4, but with the 'basic' post-rez spell lineup on 1/2<br />
<br />
6)A combo of 4 and 5<br />
<br />
Those are all I can think of off the top of my head, but there may b some others I have missed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Here's an old thread, I think it's a tiny bit out of date and still has the same spells per page as the old UI, but the concept of spell organization should still be the same.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">personally I went with putting the stuff I use the most at the front of my book.  though I didn't really do this until lvl 50 or so. just keep the BEST version of that spellline in the front and throw the rest to the back somewhere<br />
<br />
mostly buffs/auxilary type spells on the first 4 pages (heals buffs, group buffs, gate etc)<br />
<br />
debuffs/dots/sight spells/levi/eb/ root type things on the next few pages<br />
<br />
resist buffs,cure disease/blind/etc on the next few pages... <br />
<br />
I think my first 10 pages or so are spells I use fairly often, and everything else is just thrown in the back somewhere.  and then there's the quirks where I only had room for one DD on the page with my dots, so I've got my best ice nuke there, and my best poison nuke is on page 13.  and I just have to remember it's there<br />
<br />
Just decide what you think would be most function, Zyphyr did a pretty good writeup.  just find something that you will think will work for you and spend the 30 minutes it will take to organize the book.  They'll all work the same once you get used to them anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Talsondar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I keep it simple.  I put the spells I typically will scribe every night on pages one and two, pet spell misc secondary spells (my other roots, second poison DoT, Second Diseae Dot, Togors, on page 3, buffs on page 4, my utility spells (levi, enduring breath, etc..) on page 5 and every thing else is a hodge podge from there.<br />
<br />
One thing that helped me immensely was deleting spells from my spell book.  Deleted all my old DDs up to a certain point (save my level 1 DD to practice Evo), old buffs, all slows less than Tagars, old useless DoTs etc...cut my spellbook size in half and made it much more manageable.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I never delete any spells; you never know when something might come in handy.  Last night with my enchanter I almost used wake of tranquility.  Now THERE is a spell I never expected to use, but there it was on page 50 (or whaterver the last page of the book is now).<br />
<br />
In general, I do:<br />
<br />
1) Most Frequent Buffs/Heals = Page 1, 2<br />
<br />
2) Page 3,4 = Damage<br />
<br />
3) Page 5, 6 = Group Buffs (incl. Talisman Of Tribunal, for convenience despire #5 below).<br />
<br />
4) Page 7, 8 = Utility Spells (bind, gate, lev, eb, etc.)<br />
<br />
5) Page 9 = Resists Buffs<br />
<br />
6) Page 10 = Cures<br />
<br />
Thats about all I can remember at the moment.  Basically the spells are divided into categories, but  with the most commonly used categories (buffs &amp; healing &amp; pet) all on the first two pages.  I want to be able to recover from a death quickly, and also want to be able to find spells based on what they do instead of what they are named or when I scribed them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Personally I guess I fit pretty well into #3.<br />
<br />
Page 1) All 5 single target sta buffs + group sta + sow and VoB<br />
<br />
Page 2) Focus, group focus, KM, TM, torpor, regen, group regen and SLTW<br />
<br />
Page 3 + 4) cann 4, acumen, group acumen shrink, gate  invis, resists and other misc spells like that.<br />
<br />
Page 5) Debuffs- malo, malosini, turgurs, tigirs, cloud etc.<br />
<br />
Page 6) Dots and nukes.<br />
<br />
Page 8 ) Cures, Call pet other assorted less used spells.<br />
<br />
I actually tend to even keep all my old spells in my book and memed in the back end of the book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Page 1/2 = Healing/regen spells, Canni spells.  Latest and greatest versions of each at the front.  Older versions get swapped to page 3/4.<br />
<br />
Page 5/6 = Shield-type spells (HoS, Spirit Shield, Resist buffs).  Old get moved to 7/8.<br />
<br />
Page 9/10 = Buffs (Stat buffs)  Old get move to 11/12<br />
<br />
Page 13/14 = DD spells.  Old to 15/16.<br />
<br />
Page 17/18 = DoT/Rain spells.  Old 19/20<br />
<br />
Page 21/22 = Speed (SoW, slow).  Old 23/24<br />
<br />
Page 25/26/27/28 = Misc (Summon food/water, Invis, Summon dogdog, etc.) <br />
<br />
Page 29/30 = Vision spells (Ultravision, See Invis) [I'm a big dumb barbarian..'fraid of the dark].<br />
<br />
Last pages filled with very ver low level stuff that I'm too lazy to delete.<br />
<br />
Have on my 3rd hotkey bank 8 hotkeys set up:<br />
<br />
1.  Heal = /book 1<br />
2.  Shield = /book 5<br />
3.  Buff = /book 9<br />
4.  DD = /book 13<br />
5.  DoT = /book 17<br />
6.  Speed = /book 21<br />
7.  Misc = /book 25<br />
8.  Sight = /book 29.<br />
<br />
When I need to swap out Alacrity for Gate, for instance, I forget Alac, go to my 3rd Hotkey bank (SHIFT-3), hit 7 (/book 25), and mem Gate.  Took about a half hours worth of work to set it up, and if you're switching between the new UI and the old UI (as I had to do once or twice right when the new UI went live) it'll take you forever and a day to reset your spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm essentially type #4.  Page 1/2 is commonly used but not always memmed stuff like Charisma, Lev, EB, Regrowth &amp; Group Regrowth, Acumen, Cann, Bind, Shrink, Grow, etc.<br />
<br />
Page 3 is Buffs, page 4 is Group Buffs.<br />
<br />
Page 5/6 are offensive spells.<br />
<br />
Page 7/8 are a lot of miscellaneous stuff, like imbues, annul magic, cures, creeping vision.  This is also where my always-memmed spells go, like Gate, Root, and Chloroblast.  <br />
<br />
Page 9/10 are the level 49 and under buffs for casting on folks too low to take the 50+ versions.  <br />
<br />
Then way in the back are all my old spells sorted by school of magic (abjuration, alteration, etc.) and then grouped by spell line (each stat buff together, all the rage spells together, all the DDs together, etc).  I'd never delete any of them as I still find every now and then that I can use something I never thought I'd need again.  <br />
<br />
This has worked very well for a good 10 levels now.  The new UI messed up my archives in the back of the book and I've got a few miscellaneous things stuck where they don't really go but I'm waiting till 60 to do an overhaul since I know those new ones are going to require a big rearrangement anyway ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>darkfox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Wow, Valrick that is cool! I didn't know you could set Macros up like that... man that will save me time :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Firinn_mt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have a blend of what Tarradar and Valrik setup.  I have it very ingrained that if i need...<br />
<br />
HP/AC/resist buf  type /boo 1<br />
stat buf type, haste or DD/cripple /boo 3<br />
heal/cann  and cures /boo 5<br />
SoW/root/slow  /boo 7<br />
Dots  /boo 9<br />
vision and pets /boo 11<br />
misc /boo 13<br />
<br />
I type fast enough, that I didn't do hotkeys (would take me longer to switch banks anyway, just outta habit)<br />
<br />
the lastest spell in a spell line (and maybe one back for certain types like dots for stacking, or single + group bufs) is on those pages.  Old spells get moved to the back of the book, but are still organized the same way, so I can get them if I were to need them (buff beggars).<br />
<br />
I keep new spells in the front of the book, most heavily swapped spells on single number pages (cuz I don't hotkey), old spells in the back of the book so I can forget them.  =)   Also, if I need to get to several diff spells, I can open to the first one I think of, and then just click around quick enough since the other spell lines are on adjacent pages.<br />
<br />
Using this technique, i mean, its soooo ingrained, that I can swap spells in combat, after slow, even with aggro (just a little timing).  I don't recommend it, but til you have a horse, sometimes its needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Wake of Tranquility is a good spell now that they base Lulls off CHA.  I have been using it a LOT since they made that change, and with a 255 CHA (270 if I ever get high enough to take advantage of it), I have yet to get aggroed.  (55 chanter)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>DarkSidhe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm curious...why do people keep spells they don't use (ie, feet like cat, lv 5) when they have a much higher version that works on anyone (agility, lv 44)? I recently looked at my spellbook and decided I hated flipping through 4 pages of buffs to swap stuff around and deleted everything that wasn't within one circle of spells.<br />
BTW, my method is frequently used spells on pg 1/2, and everything else is scattered through the book. I know where to find everything  I cast frequently, and the rest is within a flip or two either direction from 20 (buffs) or 1. I'd condense them down to the front of the book, except then I'd have to re-learn where my buffs were. :)</div></div><hr />
