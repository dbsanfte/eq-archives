<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Akinwande</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Please, someone who knows shaman much better than me (as I'm only lvl 36) tell me if I'm wrong, or if I need to get a hold of whatever the other person was smoking...<br />
<br />
Got into a &quot;debate&quot; with a guildee last night in reference to the Uber shaman in our guild.  I won't go into detail, but it centered around him claiming that a shaman could farm Natimibi as quick, if not quicker than a Chanter with a Mastruq Warfiend, fully buffed with pet equip.<br />
<br />
When I mentioned to him that I had parsed the Mastruq doing 350+ DPS on average and I didn't think that a shaman could put out enough DPS to kill a quick as the charmed pet with the chanter nukes added.  He lauged at my comment and so the Shaman in the guild was putting out around 700 DPS.  After I told him I could assasinate a line of green mobs for 32K of damage (main is rogue), but that doesn't mean I can claim I do 30K+ DPS; he claimed that the 700 DPS figure was sustained over time.<br />
<br />
Please, someone tell me what's what.  I just don't see it.  I'm not saying it's not possible, as I've only been playing EQ for a little over a year now; however, I just don't see the numbers adding up.  I don't see ANY class soloing and putting out that kind of DPS over a realistic parsing timeframe.<br />
<br />
Just figured I'd come here where I know there are people that know the shaman class for clarification.  Am I failing to see the true power of the shaman class, or had my guildee taken one too many puffs from the happy pipe?<br />

700 a TIC - sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Wow.  700 dps for a shaman isn't even possible for a short term dps, let alone a sustainable dps.  Maybe he's confusing 700 a tick with dots as 700 dps when it would actually be over 6 seconds which is about 115 dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">to be as euphemistic as possible your guildie is a dumbass.<br />
<br />
Shaman maximum sustained DPS hovers at around 250. This requires chaining rains on mobs that are weak to poison and AA's in crits. It's incredibly mana inefficient and the shaman can do nothing else while sustaining that dps. 700 dps is absolutey ridiculous. I dont think any class can do 700 dps with the possible exception of an uber-ass wizard that doesn't care about aggro.<br />
<br />
EDIT: yeah ask him if he is confusing DPS with damage per tick. 700 damage per tick is possible for the shaman, but unfortunately ticks are 6 seconds apart meaning 700 dmg per tick roughly equates to 115 DPS. There is absolutely no way a shaman can compete with the DPS from a COD'd mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I thought that Alpha Dog-Dog did 700dps on his own.  Bah, I feel so mislead!  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm sure he meant 700 per tick.  After all that is what most, regular players measure damage in, it's only the parsers and analyzers who get into per second.  If someone asks me how much damage I do on my shaman I say about 950 per tick without pet while soloing - Bane + Ulthor + Saryrn + BA4.  But I have no idea how much dps I do and don't care, the game is measured in ticks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I won't go into detail, but it centered around him claiming that a shaman could farm Natimibi as quick, if not quicker than a Chanter with a Mastruq Warfiend, fully buffed with pet equip.<br />
<br />
First, in Natimbi, unless you have the zone to yourself and are moving from area to area the pace of killing is moot since the mobs die fast and you will be waiting for respawns much longer than you will be killing them. At least that is how it is on Luclin with just the Way Camp beach, area across from Way camp and the undead being camped by either groups or soloers.<br />
<br />
Second, 700 dps? Someone had to misunderstand the conversation, as it is not possible. And why someone would want to dump massive dots/nukes on mobs of that level makes me wonder. Turepta and hynids are green/light blue with the very occassional blue. Undead tend to have more blue with 40% or so at light blue. Slow, dot for aggro and let dog dog chew em up. Toss on epic if you are bored. Heal your damage with Q. For the named add another dot, refresh BoN (or not) and heal with Q again. These things are not tough mobs.<br />
<br />
To get an understanding of the mob difficulty, I xp camp/farm the turepta/hynids/stonemites with my 56 necro. Snare, EB, Splurt, sick pet and 30 seconds later mob is dead (toss in BoD every other one to regen health lost due to lich.) For named it takes a double cast of snare, eb and 2 BoDs to bring em down. The Way camp has 6 spawns on a 15-20 minute respawn. If no one is on other side of water, I can do 12 spawns (6 + 6 from other side) and still have time to refresh buffs, med to full and click of lich to get full health before beach respawns.<br />
<br />
At 65 dick waving about these mobs is not hard ... saying you can do so at 700 dps is just ignorant. Pretty close to laying waste to Freeport newbie area and /oocing about how uber you are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">... the Shaman in the guild was putting out around 700 DPS.<br />
<br />
Wow. I betcha he was fully CHA buffed and was facing southeast ... <br />
Pudding, anyone?<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Actually, 700 dps over a TIC is remotely possible.  He'd be dumb as a stump to try it, especially on any mob in Natimbi (except maybe the cragbeast queen if someone could actually hold agro).<br />
<br />
To do it, if I ran the math right, you'd have to have 5 DoTs running and then tears, then nuke.  If everything hit at the same time, you could get (with focus items, assuming no crit DoTs or spells) a damage of somewhere near 825 dps for that single tic.  However, that's horribly misleading--dps is best viewed as an average, not a number to be picked at random from the best tic in a fight.  It's not even close to sustainable.  That line of spells will cost a well equipped shaman probably 40% of his mana, and absolutely insane agro.  (if you're just picking your best tic, a wizzie with a focus could probably get 1200 dps in a particular tic--with a crit--that's why dps is best considered an average over several fights, and not in terms of a particular tic).<br />
<br />
For about a 3-4 minute max sustainable dps with a time equipped shaman, you could perhaps reach 500-600dps, maybe a little higher with some crits on DoTs and nukes.  That is ONLY in a situation where agro wasn't an issue, no interrupts, no summons, no resists (HA! since we have no resist modifiers on our spells!).  It also assumes a mob that will last long enough for you to land 4 DoTs and start nuking.<br />
<br />
Basically, I can think of about 2 mobs in EQ that we could do that on--and we'd have to have a particularly beefy tank with tons of agro procs and augs, and who fired reposte at the start to hold agro.<br />
<br />
So, yeah, he's lying through his teeth, misunderstood the question, or is just flat out wrong!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It's amazing how something as simple as DPS can be misunderstood.<br />
<br />
If a fight lasts 4 minutes and you did X amount of damage, then you just divide X by the 240 seconds(4 minutes). Voila, that's your DPS for the fight. It's not hard, it's not misleading, nothing.<br />
<br />
People tend to be stupid or ignorant, that's all. I have seen plenty of times people claiming how they did 300+ DPS, because they were keeping 1800 damage per tick up on some mob, totally neglecting the cast time of the DoTs and the time it actually took for the DoT to &quot;start&quot; doing it's damage(i.e. time till the first tick after the DoT was cast).<br />
<br />
A Shaman will have a hard time(read: close to never) to do 150 real DPS in ANY fight, short or long. If you don't believe me, parse your damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grimdreg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Pudding, anyone?<br />

<br />
<br />
Yes, please!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Akinwande</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">OK...thank you all for your repsonses.  I thought he must have had a REALLY good weekend and still hadn't come down yet.  As we were &quot;discussing&quot; the issue, I did ask if he was sure he meant 700 DPS and not DPT.  He never really answered that question completely, but he kept right on trying to argue with me over it.  I too can only surmise that A) He was gravely mistaken and meant DPT or B) He's higher than a weather balloon.<br />
<br />
Had he corrected himself or even said 700 DPT I could have believed it.  I figured by the end of the &quot;discussion&quot; he pretty much knew he was wrong...because that's when he decided to cap an attitude and resort to calling me a newb and other name calling.  From my experience, that's usually the last resort of a dying argument.<br />
<br />
While I am pretty much an EQ newbie (relativley compared that is), I do like to think I have a rather good grasp of EQ dynamics.  As far as measuring damage in DPS vs DPT, as I said before, my main is a Rogue, so that is pretty much the standard for us to measure.  I know the guild shaman he was talking about, and I'm will refrain from allowing my opinion of him to drop, and assume the other person was horribly mis-representing the shaman's claims.  Hopefully the shaman doesn't actually make these claims, or else I may be looking for a different guild (as the shaman is the co-leader of the guild) :P.<br />
<br />
Again, thx all for the clarification.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yea but the dumb stick who claimed the 700dps was kindof in refrence to soloing and doing that dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">1k per tic? sure, 700dps ? not even if hell did freeze over. <br />
<br />
if you stack every dot known to shaman kind you can break 1k per tic easy enough. but unless you are soloing a non summoning mob you are gonna die. noone can hold agro against that much shaman loving without being in frenzie range (as in low low hp)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Frighten</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It would be possible (although highly unlikely and incredibly dangerous) to do 700DPS, but not as a Shaman. I think the only class that could do it and sustain it would be a bard AE kiting and huge amount of mobs. This would give him the DPS, but not to one mob. Other than that, it just isn't possible with anything that is currently out there. I doubt even a wizard could sustain it for more then 30 seconds (I may be wrong in this). <br />
<br />
<br />
Frighten</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">i don't know.. i can see it happening dps wise in certain situations.  Meaning, certain areas in Time phase 1 you can prob bust out on some huge dps parses.  Meaning, you have 3 - 4 mobs that are being tank mezzed, that you can just load up on every dot.  So, keeping Pox, Ultor, saryn, ancient bane, bane of nife, bane, anethema (bane and anathema on one mob), you can literally get 700 dps over a sustained prob max 3 min period.  Of course, this will also lead you to be oom quickly and more than likely, also tanking.  And there is also what Giac said and a point where if you took the time that you first started casting on the mob, thenyou could get 700dps, but if you took the point where the mob was engaged you wouln't be<br />
<br />
But, who parses dps from the second that the mob starts until the second that the mob dies?  Casters can't, because they can't nuke when he's at 100%.  Neither can rogues.  Only person that can really parse that way is the MT/MA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">It's amazing how something as simple as DPS can be misunderstood.<br />
<br />
If a fight lasts 4 minutes and you did X amount of damage, then you just divide X by the 240 seconds(4 minutes). Voila, that's your DPS for the fight. It's not hard, it's not misleading, nothing.<br />
<br />
Everyone forgets to factor in the &quot;beginning&quot; parts of the fight. Bottom line is this. Even if you pull with VP then IMMIDIATLY cast Bane, you are still only getting about 60 that first 10 seconds. Now later, when you have Bane, BoS and BoU all running for about 1K a tic, you can get it back into the 120-140 area FOR THE FIGHT. Maybe.<br />
<br />
Typical assling Zorro on wall in POM. <br />
<br />
VP, Bane, BoS, BoU, canni up, watch Bane light back up, wait 1 tic, hit him with it again, immindiatly cast BoS. Both usually dont miss more than 1 tic that way. VP wears off with mob at 12%, Bane and BoS are off, BoU is ticking, chase him with Sharkey and proc him dead. <br />
<br />
How much DPS did I get for that mob? Probably not even 100.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I have had about 250 DPS with melee, proc, spells and dogdog. Course that was on a high HP mob. Usually get about 120 on standard mobs. They just don't last long enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">There are a dozen posts like this.... mind you i'm not saying &quot;use the search feature&quot;.  I'm just saying it's been kicked over quite a bit on the board as to how much DPS shaman can kick out.  The biggest thing with stacking our dots is that you cant keep them up forever, you have to recast BoS every x seconds you have to recast Bane every y seconds.  So to say &quot;I have so many dots, they will do 50, 80, 90, 120, 130, 140, 200 and 240 a tick!  not to mention i can cast 2 wave spells AND 4 nukes!&quot;  the Reality is you can only keep a couple of those dots running at once and one wave spell with one nuke.  If you are going for the biggest single tick that is.<br />
<br />
Folks have done the run down on it and even did the breakdown of:<br />
0 seconds - start casting BoUlth<br />
5 seconds - Ulth lands<br />
7.2 seconds - start casting Plague<br />
etc. etc. etc...<br />
<br />
You'll find that after a bit you get into a cycle that one dot is always dropping and you have to re-apply it if you want to keep the sustained dps up.  <br />
<br />
In summary... yeah your guildie is a complete moron.  link him this thread and tell him to come back with another &quot;newb&quot; insult.<br />
<br />
By this moron's estimation, my Wiz can crank out 100k dps in 5 Easy steps:<br />
1- Load up 1200pt AE<br />
2- Have tank pull all of LGuk<br />
3- Start &quot;/log on&quot; 3 seconds after cast starts <br />
4- Crit AE nuke 50 mobs for 2800 damage each<br />
5- Quickly &quot;/log off&quot; the second the damage registers<br />
<br />
Now your parser will show you cranking out 100k dps! YAY.  OH forgot a step<br />
6- Tell the stupid people, that dont talk to pink elephants wearing your mom's bra and wearing your dad's umbrella as a hat, that they are all stupid for doubting your powers!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Personaly DPS needs too factor in a LOT of things ... Saying Im running Bane + BoS + Dog for an east 100+ DPS is incorrect . Yes it may LOOK like that on paper BUT its really not .<br />
If you really care too know your DPS download and run a parcer .. outherwise your mathmatics are most likely wrong ... also parsing any lenghth of time less than maybe 5min is also pretty useless .</div></div><hr />

I don't have that particular one anymore, but here is one from Jan with with just a few spells. No dogdog, no procs, no crit affliction, no dd crits (or DD for that matter), no melee. Just using 3 or 4 spells from our arsenal.<br />

Now how hard do you think it would be to get over 180?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">None of your initial casts are in here, we simply see this log pick up with BoU already running.  I don't see where you Slowed or Mal'ed and I don't see any resists of Bane . . . <br />
<br />
The log certainly shows the DPS you posted, but it appears to be a tweaked log.<br />
<br />
I know Shaman can do DPS over the long fights, but I think I still agree that anything over 200 is highly situational and doesn't represent the reality of Shaman today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">At the same time, it is damage per second . . . damage.  It's obvious when a fight starts, but if you pull with malos, or get an add and malos the mob and root it to deal with it later, the dps numbers are just plain skewed because you left it along for so long.<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't mind people cutting off debuff stages.  If they start when they start casting an actual dps spell, I think that's a decent measure of dps.  Sure, it may not be the purist view of exactly when the mob is agro'd, but I think it's good for what the statistic should be--an average aggregate of damage.<br />

<br />
On top of everything else that comes to my mind of why this isn't a &quot;realistic&quot; parse, just by adding the damage displayed in your log and dividing it by the number of seconds the fight lasted, I came up with a DPS of ~153.<br />
Can somebody double check?<br />

I am in no way insinuating that you were trying to skew DPS numbers btw, just to be clear.</div></div><hr />

There are many ways you can define DPS. To avoid that, people generally use a parser to have a Standard of judgement. This is why I used EQcompanion as it is the mostly widely used and accepted.<br />

parsers seperate DPS per person or pet. First damage - last damage.<br />

I don't believe anyone claiming more than 180 DPS over 2 or so minutes unless I see logs.<br />

This is fun as a best case scenario but it assumes you'd be tanking cause when you add the second dot, most tanks will lose aggro. I've never found a tank capable of reliably keeping keeping a mob off you with 3 dots running, including knights. In practice, this never really happens.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Your parse was not exact and the DPS achieved is just incorrect. You might have to adjust your parser. I use a different parser so don't really know EQcompanion<br />
<br />
2. The fact that it lasted less than 2 minutes isn't to your disadvantage as the mob(another non-realistic aspect as no one is going to group in Droga for exp at this stage of the game and DoT resists are not an issue) allowed you to run your 2 highest DPS DoTs till very close to the end by just refreshing them once(you didn't lose any tick of damage which certainly is bound to happen in longer fights) and totally neglecting the healing aspect. You basically ran a parse against a mob that was standing there taking your damage.<br />
<br />
3. Your pet did about 34 DPS in my calculation. You could easily halve that damage against a mob that is more realistic. In this case the pet did ~25% of your total DPS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Note also that as the fight durations go down, the DPS drops like a ROCK. 90 second fights I can see sustaining an average of 120-140 DPS if the mob can't 1-round you and you have healing behind you (you WILL be summoned). Cut that number to 60 seconds, though, and the time spent with Malos-Slow cuts DEEPLY into the numbers. At 45 second (about the average for an EP XP mob in my experience, with an average, balanced group) you are barely getting 100 if you Malos-Slow. At 30 seconds or less (Gates anyone?) its not even worth parsing.</div></div><hr />

Well I am too busy to get you logs, but with all dots stacked on a fire tables mob it isn't hard to do more than 200 DPS.<br />
<br />
Bane is 420<br />
Blood is 320<br />
Ultor is 131<br />

Anathema is 278<br />

Now that is 1260 damage a tick, or 210 DPS. Many people then have a focus effect on top of that adding vengeance of eternity or burning affliction 4 (or even higher ones like burning magic/poison). Don't forget DOT's also crit. Yes, for the first 3 or 4 ticks you are most likely debuffing/rooting but DoT crits and focus will make up for that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sure, its not practical in many circumstances, but it is possible.<br />
<br />
<br />
Forgot to say its sustainable for 10+ minutes depending on your mana pool/ buffs, but the mob probably won't live that long.</div></div><hr />

Fire tables is a great place. As VP basically allows you to go all out well knowing your root will run the full 2 mins. However, even there you will have a hard time to exceed 180 DPS, believe me. What on paper looks like cake, is not.<br />
That Pox will have to be refreshed before VP drops, Bane or Anathema will be resisted on top of the good 20 seconds before your first DoT actually starts ticking.<br />
Shamans are simply too optimistic when considering their DPS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree.<br />
<br />
Saying that you aren't counting debuff time because you aren't actually doing &quot;damage&quot; in that time won't fly.  Does a melee have to wait before he starts damaging a mob?  No, he starts wailin away as soon as the mob arrives.  DPS starts when the mob is aggro'ed.  By this logic, a melee would be able to eliminate the ticks in the fight where he misses a mob because he isn't actually doing damage to the mob.<br />
<br />
And yes, dear god, fight something that isn't trivial.  If you don't see any resists on Bane or Anathema it's pretty clear that the mob is trivial.  I can do pretty ($*@ nice DPS on a mob in ToFS . . . but that doesn't in any way represent my real world DPS on a mob that is of some value.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Please, someone tell me what's what.  I just don't see it.  I'm not saying it's not possible, as I've only been playing EQ for a little over a year now; however, I just don't see the numbers adding up.  I don't see ANY class soloing and putting out that kind of DPS over a realistic parsing timeframe.<br />
<br />
Most charm classes can put out this kind of DPS pretty easily with the right pet.  I regularly duo with a druid in tactics; we charm pigs, and while they aren't even a particularly bad-ass mob, they still parse at about 300ish DPS.  Chanters can charm several of the mini-nameds in tactics as well, some of which can probably hit 800+ DPS with haste and the right pet weapons.  (In fact, theres a guy on my server, Flaen, that regularly farms Glycus and other ornate droppers in Tactics this way.)<br />
<br />
Among us mere mortals, however, the following are probably fairly typical raid DPS numbers for characters in elemental guilds.<br />
<br />
Rogue - 225-275ish<br />
Wizzy - 200-300ish, depending on resists, aggro, etc.<br />
Monk - 200-225ish<br />
Mage/Necro - 150-200ish, depending on resists, aggro, etc.<br />
Warrior - 125-175ish<br />
Pally/SK - 100-150ish<br />
...<br />
...<br />
...<br />
Shaman - 75-100ish<br />
Cleric - 0-100ish.<br />
<br />
Please note that these are just general ranges for each class, based on what I have seen/read/etc.  Obviously, actual DPS will vary with gear, skill, raid role, the encounter and lots of other factors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I dunno about you, but when I do Fire Table mobs, I need to land Mal Decay, Malos, and Sinia before I am confortable that my DOTs and VP wont get resisted.

I don't have EP legs, so maybe I could toss that on too, but the risk of breaking VP would make me nervous. Better safe than sorry, I will stick to my 120ish for 3.85 minutes and watch em fall without risk.<br />

<br />
That is not a DPS parse. It is not even a DPS calculation. That is shaman DPS in a world without cast times, resists, debuffs or MOB movement.<br />
<br />
It is like calculating wizard DPS without figuring in the cast time of their nukes.<br />
<br />
Look at how it might look in the game.<br />
<br />
0.0 - MOB is incoming<br />
0.5 - cast VP<br />
2.0 - cast malos<br />
7.0 - cast ultor<br />
14.0 - cast pox<br />
21.0 - cast blood<br />
26.0 - cast bane<br />
31.0 - cast anathema<br />
<br />
at the 40 second mark you have done<br />
5.5 ticks of ultor<br />
4.3 ticks of pox<br />
3.1 ticks of blood<br />
2.3 ticks of bane<br />
1.5 ticks of anathema<br />
<br />
for a total of 3600 damage or 90 DPS.<br />
<br />
That means to hit 180 DPS overall you will have to do significantly more damage during the rest of the fight - for a 3 minute MOB you have to do 210 damage for the rest of the fight just to reach 180 DPS overall.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that the above does not reflect any resists whatsoever after Malos and not one inch of movement on the shaman side.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This thread was not started to establish WHAT the dps of a typical 65th level shaman is, but rather what dps CAN a shaman do. i.e. the claim from the original posters friend of 700dps on GREEN mobs in Natimbi.<br />
 This being said I'm thinking 160ish on a droga mob isn't too off. As a matter of fact ANY casters DPS is going to be dependant on group make up and mobs so it is a moot point anyhow. As for the kings of DPS, it is going to be wizards. AE group, nuff said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">/em points to the coffee machine.<br />
<br />
Anyway, one thing to keep in mind is that Natimbi mobs are not your typical mobs.  Yes, I know they were gimped a bit ago.  But, even in their gimped state, they still have very significant resists.<br />
<br />
I don't have any numbers to back it up, but I'd suspect that if you were to compare a Natimbi mob to a Droga mob of equal level you'd find the Natimbi mob to be a much stronger beast, both in melee and the magical persuasions.</div></div><hr />

There are a few widely used definitions of DPS.<br />
<br />
a) DPS is the amount of damage you do from the moment a MOB is aggroed until the moment it dies, divided by the amount of seconds this took.<br />
<br />
b) DPS is the average damage you do over a certain large span of time, including downtime.<br />
<br />
c) See A except you instead take the average for a large number of MOBs, preferably while maintaining a constant level of mana.<br />
<br />
C is what is most often used. B contrasted with C is a nice way of gauging how much downtime affects you. A is what is usually used to compare 1) burst damage and 2) DPS on bosses.<br />
<br />
I have never seen anyone seriously attempting to parse DPS from the first time they did damage. That is always going to be skewed.</div></div><hr />

Your parse shows 153 DPS *including* your miracle of a pet. You are 27 DPS short, if we want to be precise.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
here you are just simply ... well... WRONG! More time give you more dots to stack here. After all which is going to have a higher number here. Bane + BoS/6 or Bane + BoS + BoU + BoN/6?<br />

<br />
Now you are being stupid. You seem to be assuming a lot of stuff, fact is I don't pull 180+ DPS regularly with every AA and Burning Poison and Magic, so I pretty much know what I am talking about.<br />
<br />
The more DoTs you have to stack, the more time will you spend on casting and reapplying them early in order to not lose a damage tick, which results in less nukes. <br />
Likewise the more times you will have to reapply DoTs the more likely is it that you will get a resist on our crappy DoTs which will bring your DPS down noticably.<br />
<br />
Go read previous 1000+ posts on dogdog's DPS, then come back.<br />
<br />
Where are those 1000+ posts saying that dogdog's DPS is 34+ in any semi realistic environment, i.e. not Droga. Even in a hard LDoN my pet has a hard time doing 20 DPS(something several posters have been confirming btw).<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;There are many ways you can define DPS. <br />
<br />
Actually, there is not. DPS means Damage Per Second and it's just that. A figure of one's damage over the length of a fight divided by its duration.<br />
<br />
<br />
To avoid that, people generally use a parser to have a Standard of judgement<br />
<br />
So basically everyone's parser starts 22 seconds late? <br />
A wizard using your wonderful parser nuking twice within the first 22 seconds and killing your Droga mob would have an infinite DPS...way to go.<br />
<br />
<br />
So please tell me, Oh knowledgable DPS master, what is the proper way to measure DPS? Where are your logs and parses so we may learn YOUR way?<br />
<br />
I have explained how DPS is measured at least twice in this thread and use a parser you know how to use in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">I parsed it in beta against some plant mobs, and was averaging over 200 dps for the fight, which usually lasted just over 2min if I remember correctly.  From about the 45 sec mark until the mobs death, I was getting if I remember correctly just around 300dps in that short span).  I was using Bane, Blood, Ancient Nife, Ultor, Pox, Plague of Daluda, and I think that I added BofNife instead of Anathema.  Also had pet up, but he was usually more hassle than he was worth because he was taking serious riposte dmg for a while there.  I was using Saryn range item which has an up to 30% extra dmg per tick for each dot.  Also, at the time I was running with critical affliction 3.  Did not have my pet dmg turned on so I don't know what he was doing.<br />
<br />
If I didn't destroy most of the log than I would put it up to show it and i really wish that I could. <br />
<br />
Let's just put it this way.  A shaman can do 200 - 300dps on a mob, but he most likely will tanking it by the time that he gets that high (as well as the fight would have to last &gt;&gt; 3 min).  He must also have all his spells (meaning Ancient Nife and be using Anathema and/or BofNife).  He would prob also need to be timing his casts and reapply the dots when they run off.  He would also prob need something with a detrimental focus extension, crit dots 3, something with burning affliction and maybe even need a bard in the group with echo of the truisk going (or call of the muse).  Oh, and last thing he'll need, is 2 CH rotations going on him :)<br />
<br />
I've seen myself run bane casts of over 5k damage before (using Burning Magic item plus bard in group).</div></div><hr />

10311 (my damage) + 2816 (dog damage) = 13127<br />
Note this does not include dogs proc damage cause I had that filtered out.<br />
and 13127/80 = 164.0875 dps and 80 seconds is from the mob AGGRO til mob DEATH. but it is a moot point since combat didn't last over 2 minutes.<br />
<br />
Actually, there is not. DPS means Damage Per Second and it's just that. A figure of one's damage over the length of a fight divided by its duration.<br />
you might want to edit this to also be specific to certain mobs in certain zones. Since you are talking about realistic, don't forget to add in the pull time of a mob, any splitting that may need to be done, and the mob sitting there mezzed getting no dps at all. How about the difference in Soloing, grouping and raiding? How about different zones you are flagged for? Using Elemental mobs isn't realistic to a Shaman who doesn't have elemental access.<br />
<br />
So you see, this is why you are frustrating me so much. You say it is simply one thing and then put restrictions on what you are saying.<br />
<br />
I will give you one thing. I don't like that EQCompanion calculates based off of first damage. So what parser would you suggest?<br />
<br />
...and just one more question Giac. If you are so experienced in this, how come you have not shown any parse logs or logs for people. Why are you sitting back and letting parse noob like myself do it while you sit back and make &quot;knowledgable comments&quot;?</div></div><hr />

Are you seriously asking me to post logs of damage parses of mine below 180 DPS?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do still log on for raids(4 out of 5 raid days, I am taking weekends off now) and I keep soloing challenging stuff from time to time when I get home early, but you are right, I can't get myself to logging on and getting guild groups or other stuff for several hours anymore.<br />
<br />
The virtual roadblocks have worn me out. I have been waiting for something new and exciting for my class for so long, just to watch it actually losing old strengths without gaining *new* ones that it isn't easy to keep going and being motivated.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">It is like calculating wizard DPS without figuring in the cast time of their nukes.<br />
<br />
Look at how it might look in the game.<br />
<br />
0.0 - MOB is incoming<br />
0.5 - cast VP<br />
2.0 - cast malos<br />
7.0 - cast ultor<br />
14.0 - cast pox<br />
21.0 - cast blood<br />
26.0 - cast bane<br />
31.0 - cast anathema<br />
<br />
at the 40 second mark you have done<br />
5.5 ticks of ultor<br />
4.3 ticks of pox<br />
3.1 ticks of blood<br />
2.3 ticks of bane<br />
1.5 ticks of anathema<br />
<br />
for a total of 3600 damage or 90 DPS.<br />
<br />
This is the most significant information in this thread, folks. I would even add in the cast time of Malosinia between Malos and Ulthor (although I lead with Bane, then BoS, then BoU, I think thats slightly more DPS). I have found Sinia almost a MUST for consistant Bane lands, because 1 resist on Bane and you may as well put your DPS in the toilet. (NOTE: This applies mostly to Fire Table mobs, pulling with Mal Decay for consistnt full duration VPs)<br />
<br />
Table mob also = no summoning. I struggle when grouping with kiters there to keep the mob from charging me instead of the snarer. I get Bane, 1 BoS, and then I have to nuke (inefficient). <br />
<br />
The overall point here, I think, is that while on paper you can do 200+ DPS vs trivial content, you just are NOT near that on cutting edge (or even &quot;regular&quot; higher end XP) mobs. You arent going to 150+ on summoning mobs or your dead, unless its trivial content. You arent going to 150+ on ANY mob that dies in under a minute unless someone else is debuffing. <br />
<br />
Period. End of story.</div></div><hr />

Looking at your list I'd say Shamans can do about...700 DPS.</div></div><hr />

According to your definition every class does infite DPS. If you just arbitrarily pick a slice of your fight time why not go all the way and reduce that time to the 0.000000001 secs where your nuke crit lands?<br />
<br />
The very shortest DPS comparison that makes sense is a single fight - and even that is close to useless unless you are not going to fight anything after you are done (i.e. bosses).<br />
<br />
Comparing &quot;lucky string of DoT crits&quot; theoretical scenarios (with a bard helping you no less) to &quot;what a lazy unbuffed rogue can do&quot; is a little silly.<br />
<br />
Can a shaman reach 700 DPS? Sure, you can always land a nuke, start parsing a second before it lands, and stop parsing after that.<br />
<br />
Is it at all helpful when comparing shaman capabilities with what other classes can do? Not in the least. It is not even helpful in trying to find out what a shaman can do.</div></div><hr />
