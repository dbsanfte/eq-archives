<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xeryus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i got a couple of questions:<br />
<br />
A Chant Rock, LORE -  is this the one thats needed for the poition making? its not tan colour its green from gobby rockchanters in nurga<br />
<br />
Pouch of Dust, Magic, Lore, No Drop : Is this the sarnak night dust? got it of my first Sarnak Partisans FM<br />
<br />
<br />
Gorge Moss and Sponge Mushroom are they no drop?<br />
<br />
cheers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Neither the gorge moss, nor the sponge mushroom are no drop.  You should be able to forage a mushroom really easily while trying to get chant rocks in Nurga.<br />
<br />
The pouch sounds like the right one, if it's from a partisan in FM.<br />
<br />
The Chant Rock MUST be tan.  There are blue, green, and tan ones, I probably destroyed 40 each of blue and green before I found a tan one.  Try jumping down the waterfall when you come in and fighting the ones around there, it's where I finally found one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xeryus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Cheers for the info. have all the items now cept for the tan stone going back to nurga</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xeryus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">got my TAN Chant Rock. do i combine all 6 items at once? i have the following<br />
<br />
Sarnak Dust<br />
Gorge Moss<br />
Sponge Mushroom<br />
<br />
Friona Drixie Dust<br />
Stone Emerald Plume<br />
Tan Chant Rock</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Monssantiss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No...to create Xinth you need two items: Opal Slush &amp; Dristilate<br />
<br />
Thus you'll need to combine Sarnak Nightdust, Gorge Moss and Sponge Mushroom first to create Opal Slush.<br />
<br />
Then combine Drixie Dust, Emerald Plume and Chant Rock to make Dristilate.<br />
<br />
Once you have those two items, combine them to create Xinth...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xeryus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">hehe was being careful what i was doing. didnt wanna **** it up ;) got cudgel of the heriophant and have all my hs skulls so iam ready to go for 7th and 8th</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sutog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Can someone tell me just how long it took them to get the darn Drixie dust?  I've killed more drixies than I care to think about, yet still no dust.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xeryus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">10 drixies got mine about 30mins</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">About the same on # of drixies, though about 4 trains nearly killing me in that blasted zone trying to find them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sutog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Did you have to kill any specific drixies?  What area did you kill them in?  I've been pulling ones over near the cliffs sort of near the FV enterance.  Just wearing on my nerves with those annoying pilgims that see invis!  Bah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xeryus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">at the beach near the waterfall is where i hunted. made a pet had blast of poison and ice strike up. and had C3 <br />
<br />
just killed anyone Drixies that came close. pilgrams didnt last long either</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i remember the drixie that finally dropped the dust for me cast shaman spells...hope that helps!<br />
and yes the beach by the waterfall under the big statue seemed the best place to pull to. got mine in about an hour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Azhdarkhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">For the Drixie Dust I parked wonderdog at the statue above the waterfall and looked towards Firiona Vie.  There are numerous Drixies flitting around in that immediate vicinity.  It took me 64 Drixies before I found a dusty one.<br />
<br />
The inhabitants of Firiona Vie outpost are not very happy with me at this point ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Lorwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I went through killing over 30 of those little beasties for the drixie dust, finally got it.  Managed to collect the rest of the items fairly easily.  The chant rock is a pain, but I've been living in Nurga, so I have a few saved on other characters.  Went to do my combine.  Made the Opal Slush, made the Dristilate, failed on the Xinth.<br />
<br />
Alchemy is currently at 65, received &quot;you can no longer advance your skill from making the item&quot; message on the first to two combines.  So I'm wondering if anyone knows for sure what the trivial level is on the final combine.  Are the any stats I should have super high when attempting the combine?  Wisdom was at 210 when I tried.  Just really disappointed on the failure. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">ouch!<br />
/comfort Lorwen<br />
my alchemy was 65 when i made my attempt, with a 150 ish wis i succeded on all 3 combines, dunno what to tell ya =(<br />
didnt check to see if xinth was triv, was so exited that i made it i forgot to look.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>JukaTZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You know, I've seen so many tan rocks - the ones we want - I could tile a road between  Freeport &amp; Luclin 10 times! My problem has been foraging that damn shroom! omg, did I just flunk out of foraging school or something? I've spent hours in Nurga, got everything but that. Killed Overlord whats-his-butt over and over. It isn't foragable only in a certain location is it? Anyone else have this problem? Jukasaza<br />
PS - yeah im hitting Forage every time it comes up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Xeryus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">fall down the waterfall to your left with lev of course. i foraged one down there right after i had a druid foraging :/ doh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sthaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I zoned into Nurga from FM, hit forage, and got he shroom right there first try.  /shrug.  Don't think forage is location specific within the zone.  Took me a LOT longer to get the stinkin moss.<br />
<br />
The bright side is, spend long enough time in Nurga, collect some salts and skins, and go get a neato ring from Chardok.  Kill 2 birds with one stone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Got my drixie dust about the 10th one i pulled. I killed the druid type , warrior type and wizard type and nothing. The one it finally dropped off was a shaman type he was trying to slow me while we were fighting. I dont know if that was luck or not but saw someone else mention it. <br />
<br />
    The tan chanter rock i got from right after dropping down from the water fall. Killed the 3 first mobs the couple in by the tents and the mobs from both side cove. I tried orginally after i killed the overseer but to slow respawn and not enough mobs to begin with so after moving back to the front got the correct color rock probably half an hr. Now I'm stuck trying to get the gorge moss /sigh have the rest and this is taking me longer than the rest of the potion parts. Oh out of curiosity if the potion after its made no drop? Thanks and good luck to all of you working on this quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Lorwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The final potion is indeed no drop.  After failing my first combine, I went to the seemingly endless task of trying to get drixie dust again.  Once again, it was a shaman type drixie that dropped it.<br />
<br />
Made the potion this time and now have my 6th cudgel, yay! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">/sigh on <br />
<br />
You dont have the skills blah blah (failed xinthe). Could almost hear the gameshow sound effect. Would you like to leave now with your two halves of the potion or press on?? (crowd cheers go go go go ) I'll press on chuck&lt;attempts combine&gt; WAH wah wah wahhhhhhh (crowd: AHHHHHhhhh) Chuck: AH I'm sorry it was so close but you leave with this lovely parting gift, the aggravation of doing it all again. hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">123 Drixies down (10 shaman type). Zero dusts... Almost ready to give up on the f-ing quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">First of all..the 'tan' stone from the goblins is the same graphic as a sharpening stone.  The other stones look like smushed gems, so it's unmistakable.  The goblins actually hit pretty hard for greenies (to 53).  I had to buff up and keep an extra tight leash on dogdog..that dungeon is MURDER on pathing.<br />
<br />
While you are in Nurga..you can zone into Droga and kill Digalis the iksar prisoner for the BW part.  You can also forage the sponge mushroom.  I added forage to my canni-dance key..I am amazed what I'm picking up now! :)<br />
<br />
The partisan spawned where the ChampionsofCabilis guide said it would..but as soon as it spawned a druid showed up and tried to kite it away...apparantly it's also for a druid quest.  I BELIEVE I casted slow on it BEFORE he snared it..but the end result was that I ended up with the dust.  The moral I guess is to /shout what you are looking for in every zone.<br />
<br />
As far as the drixies...let me confirm that the shaman-casting one dropped the powder.  Vekis spawned while I was camping there..and I watched as newbies ran to her like moths to a flame..adding to a growing pile of corpses.  I /shouted, /ooc'd and /auc'd NOT to run up to Vekis..but they kept doing it...she's Ally to us questing lizzy shaman types.<br />
<br />
The combine (after a long..and odd trip to Gorge of King Xorbb..why the heck would a Kunark quest require ONE trip to the mainland only? It makes NO sense) was quick, painless and trivial at 143 alchemy.<br />
<br />
Tomorrow I'm gonna head over to Dalnir, BW, and Lake to kill all the bullies..:).  Since my week in Kurns I haven't seen any other shamans doing this quest..I guess they are waiting to see if the Carnage effect gets fixed first..<br />
<br />
Good questing!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Killing a Firiona Drixie is a 5 point faction decrease.  5 goblin kills would make up for a drixie kill, FV faction-wise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I noticed they are a bit of a hit. My IKS went from MaxIdiff faction to Dubious and collected two dusts from them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Zeludrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Well, I'm still working on gathering the components (have everythign cept drixie dust and the feather), but I dont want to even attempt the combines til I can make sow potions with high reliability (supposed to be trivial around 40 which is close to sow, and I get about 20 to 25% fail rate on sow potions with 52 skill currently).<br />
<br />
My main questions on the quest are about droga and the fight with Doval in the tower.  I would like to know if I could do the droga Digalis skull solo at 45, or if I would need backup (never been to droga).  I would also like to know if Atheling Plague is on beta neutral faction or chardock (I've killed in chardock and am KOS there) and if I will need backup for the tower fight, the Champions of Cabilis guide says &quot;hes not particularily tough&quot; but as I recall, Cradossk was in his early 50s when he was the first to complete this quest, and theres a big diference between early 50s and lvl 45.  <br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">the droga part is easy, shrink invis &amp; head down to the jail area.<br />
kill him in his cell, loot skull, gate out.<br />
he will run &amp; agro the gobbos outside so keep him rooted!<br />
should be cake at 45 =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Zeludrax, my alchemy skill is 48 and I made the potion on the first try no problem.  What I did was to make a few IU potions first to see if the RNG was going to be nice, made 2 out of 3 IU potions then made the quest potion np.  Of course I then failed the next 7 IU potions in a row.  =P<br />
<br />
Also, as for Atheling, he is on beta neutral faction. Confirmed this last weekend.  The clerk is cake - killed him solo at 44.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Zeludrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Thanks, got my alchemy to 70 yesterday, so it looks like once I get the drixie dust, I'm ready to continue as long as I dont have horrible luck then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Cateye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">My only problem is this damn Gorge Moss, sat there for hours and foraged but none... Drixies and were grateful ) maybe coz I AoEed the )), Dlubish was up after a serverdown but that damn moss just don't wanna come, so sick of roots and vegetables...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Shizbiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Ask a druid or ranger friend to swing by the gorge for you, I had a druid (only lvl 35) forage 2 in under 5 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">The gorge moss, by the way, is EDIBLE.<br />
<br />
I bought one in the bazaar, with my trader mule.... when I went to do the combine, it was gone. I was pretty rabid for awhile, a druid friend just popped over and foraged one up on her first try. I owe her big... of course, her alt/main is a warrior, so she'll get the first click of my cudgel when I get it.<br />
<br />
I'm still on the HS skulls bit. Got a rogue her hs key last night so hopefully this weekend I can get into the south wing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">The tan chant rock is not no-drop, and I found one last night doing some faction work. <br />
<br />
So if you are stuck on this part, go look in bazaar!  It might be for sale cheap ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Cateye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Thanx for advices, however I got lucky last night.<br />
Moved my ranger twink to the Gorge and ooced to buy that moss, after 3 foraging failures someone sold me some :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Jikuliz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Well, im stuck on the Droga part. =/ Was wondering if anyone knew...I got to the jail..i can gate out, but i cant get into the cell to get the iksar slave. now, i have killed em all. dont know if ive killed the right one on account of not being able to get close enough to hail him and get a response. the only ones that would path OUT of the cell didnt drop skull, one will NOT path out, and i cant loot him from beyond the bars. I have found two keys in the area, but neither seem to open ANY of the doors, and i currently have my ranger alt stuck down there as he was scouting it for me and fell down the pit trap =/. Anyone whos done this part remember how they got the doors open? Thanks.<br />
<br />
Edit: Finally got him pathed out of cell, by not nuking him gave him time to run. But, three keys on ranger and cant get cell doors open, hes firmly stuck (. petitions not answered thinking ima have to get a porter down there if i can find one who will go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">hehe, shrink is your friend</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Jikuliz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Word of advice to anyone attempting 6th cudgel, the BW kill. clerk Doval. if you arent 50+ or so..the trigger mob will join the fighting. he teleported me into the sarnak fort /boggle. had one heck of a time getting out. I have to go back to Droga now...lvl36, quested since step one pretty much alone, has been tough at times but worth it ) This latest set back hurts tho heh, Droga was a tough solo job for me.</div></div><hr />
