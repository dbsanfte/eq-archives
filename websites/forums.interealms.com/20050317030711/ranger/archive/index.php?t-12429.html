<br />
I was in city of mist with some friends outside of the reavers area.  We used to pull the 14 spawns there without a problem.  Harmony, pull, pull, pull, harmony, rinse repeat.  I attempted to harmony a group of three, I got 6 resist messages. hmmm  thats strange.  I thought o well, we are low on mana, I'll pull from the other side.  I turn and harmony that 3 spawn.  Four resist messages.  I pulled one of the mobs that it didnt work on, and fight it.  For some reason the other that resisted didnt come.  He just stood there.  We decide to med up after the fight and are just talking when I get attacked by ALL of the mobs that I had attempted to harmony.  I have a perm see invis item so i immediately hit track to see if someone had trained us, nada.  No one but us in the entire back half of Com.  I did the math and it came out to when harmony would normally have wore off.  None of us were within the agro ranges of the mobs.  I have been able to duplicate this effect.<br />
<br />
For some strange reason I think VI hates rangers.  Harmony is the only thing that allowed me to pull while in a group, period.  While hunting alone I can wait for a mob to walk away from the others, but groups dont like waiting.  The new harmony uses 4 times the mana, is not AOE and is easily resisted.  Dots have a resist of svmagic minus 100.  Normal magic spells are just svmagic.  Our DD vs summoned are magic minus 40.  Harmony of nature is svmagic minus 10.   Its gona resist, not all the time but it is gona resist.  When I fight indoors, I've tried to use the pacify line as my cleric.  Resists every time.  I've never got it to stick.<br />
<br />
So picture this 6 mobs are standing there.  Ranger has to harmony 5 times before we can pull.  Thats 500mana and if it gets resisted once, we pull them all.  /sigh  Im done with pulling until we get feign death.  Ranger gate is no way to pull.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SirTamalot</div><div class="date">10-23-2002, 08:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This new nerf is kinda funny. I rarely use harmony spell to pull so I wanted to see how the new nerf effect mob.  So I try it out on a mob of course it resisted. The funny thing is only the mob I target come chasing me and the other remind on camp. And after 30sec later the other attack me forcing me to zone. Anyway I learn it better to park mob and run out ot range to pull than wasting mana on harmony =).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">muasakili</div><div class="date">10-24-2002, 01:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I posted the following to the developer site. I dono if others agree with me but I hunt quite a bit with harmony. I am a hunter. I dont sit in a camp and wait for a monk to bring back prey. The harmony changes and proposed harmony changes have seriously hurt. <br />
<br />
begin post &gt; <br />
<br />
I don’t know exactly who to send this to so I’m trying whoever answers the class specific ranger problems because I view this as such. The recent change to harmony has seriously damaged the ranger class. We are hunters of the outdoors. Outdoor zones are the only places that we can still “hunt” rather than sit in camp waiting for the monk or shadowknight to bring the prey back in. For most indoor zones, track is just a “rare spawn indicator” but in outdoor zones, the combination of track and harmony made the ranger the puller of choice. <br />
<br />
While the scroll for the spell harmony of Nature still has not been found on any server, the details of the spell are available via Lucy and Eqcaster and have been posted numerous times on the web. The spell is severely lacking. Rangers, especially half-elves, do not have large mana pools. The combination of an increase in mana cost and the “upgraded” harmony being single target, completely destroy its usefulness. I cannot cast the spell three times on each pull. I simply don’t have the mana to pull at the rate most groups demand. Because I would be pulling I also have no time to meditate between fights. Couple this with the fact that the spell is easily resisted, SvMagic minus 10 vs. the average damage over time spell resist of SvMagic minus 100, and rangers simply can not pull anymore. We do not have any method of feign death. If the spell is resisted the mobs will agro and the ranger will die rather than lead 5 mobs back to their camp and slaughter their friends. Because it is NOT an AOE spell it must be cast once per mob with each having a chance to resist. <br />
<br />
We have also been encouraged to fight mobs above our level. That is suicide with a spell like this. Rangers have no way of splitting off second, third or fourth adds on a pull like a monk or SK. Four red mobs will eat any full group alive even if they have an enchanter. The rangers only choice is to stand and die then be pulled back to the cleric for a rez. Without real harmony, we are nothing more than extremely poor warriors that can sow and snare. We are not hunters of the forest. <br />
<br />
The stated reason for the change was players were able to single pull in Cazic Thule. The average level of mobs in Cazic Thule is 55. Why then is the level cap lowered all the way to 40? I would suggest the following changes to harmony. The creation of a harmony line of spells. <br />
<br />
Harmony 25mana up to level 30 mobs <br />
Calmness 50 up to level 45 mobs <br />
Serenity 75 up to level 60 mobs <br />
Tranquility 100 up to level 65 mobs <br />
<br />
Range 200 <br />
Casting time 3 seconds <br />
Recast time 30 seconds <br />
Outdoor only <br />
Resist SvMagic minus 100 <br />
<br />
The reasons for these changes are as follows. The range is identical to both the old and new. Mana cost is reasonable for someone that never has a chance to meditate. Casting time is the same as the old harmony but more than harmony of nature. I think 3 sec is completely acceptable. Recast increased from 12sec to 30sec. The recast time should be increased to make it more difficult to harmony very large groups of mobs. The spell should be kept outdoor usable only. Resist magic minus 100 is the same as DoT based spells. This will allow the spell to be resisted yet still be reasonably useful. Duration should continue to be the same, 2 minutes. Mobs should not agro when the spell wears off as is happening with harmony now. <br />
<br />
I accept that monks and shadowknights are much better pullers in indoor zones. Rangers however should be the great hunters of the forest. If harmony isn’t fixed, rangers should be given an “Elude” skill, similar to feign death but only usable outdoors. This would allow a ranger, with 4 mobs on them after a bad attempt at harmony, to loose their pursuers. I died 5 times attempting to pull today. I will not be pulling again unless this is fixed. Even in the forest I will be letting the warrior pull. At least he can take the hits. I am no longer a hunter. <br />

<br />
Instead they made it un-usable everywhere with this stupid nerf. Sometimes I hate they way the Dev team thinks,<br />

.... with thier heads up their arses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good point.<br />
<br />
Why is our title HUNTER?<br />
<br />
EDIT:  The only thing we are the best at is tracking.  Warriors even have a higher archery skill cap than rangers.  Hunting something down with tracking and bringing it back is what we were ment to do in the forest.  Harmony fit in so well with the role we played.  What happened to &quot;roleplaying&quot;?  I bet Rich (the guy that nerfed harmony) didn't even know that rangers pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taradoni</div><div class="date">10-26-2002, 08:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think this must be their way of saying, Get a group and get CII or  KEI, Unfortunately it is appearent they have not played a ranger on my server and tried to get a group. I am 54 now and at 36% haste and non Epic I deal some pretty good DPS, and still no group. Most guild members post 50 have gone to ubber guilds with promises of epics and the majority of my guild is 45-50 so no great exp grouping with most folks. The nerf was appearent, in that they did it so we could not pull in PoP where most zones are based outdoors. I agree, they should have made harmony 100% resistable in CT and in all of PoP, now I cant pull alot of mobs I would normally solo due to this nerf.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kishin</div><div class="date">10-27-2002, 02:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">muasakili - is your proposed change an AoE line of spells?<br />
if not, we would not be able to keep more than 3 mobs harmonized at any time due to the uncalled for recast time (if this is ST rather than AE).<br />
<br />
also, this change to the old harmony makes for some interesting pull concepts.. if a 40+ mob aggros due to resisted harmony wearing off -and- doesn't bring friends when it comes to find you, it's like a 2min guaranteed root spell on 40+ mobs.<br />
if your group can drop your 40+ mob of choice in under 2 min, it would eliminate every other pull.  granted, you have to worry about someone else pulling the delayed aggro mob, or hitting too many with the AoE.  it would take some finesse, but the implications are.. fascinating.<br />
so the question is, do delayed-aggro mobs bring friends that have not been affected by harmony?<br />
any info would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
was this nerf warranted? i don't think so, no.<br />
does this destroy who we are as rangers? no.  we're much more than warriors with sow, snare, and tracking.<br />
does it hurt? yeah, it hurts.<br />
does this shrink our highly situational bag of tricks (which happen to take a lot of skill to utilize)?  unquestionably.<br />
<br />
it's not the end of the world, HoN seems to still be a work in progress.. but rendering a powerful skill-dependent spell so close to useless 45+ just makes things less fun.  one more player(not character) skill that people will never have the chance to learn.</div></div><hr />
