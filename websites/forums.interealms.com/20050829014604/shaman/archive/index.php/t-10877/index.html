<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I started looking for it when I came back a couple months ago, it just plain has not been for sale.  I did manage to get Malo off a Guardian Wurm just before hitting 60, so that was a plus, but was still Torporless.<br />
<br />
Last night, I found someone with one, who'd been turning down offers of 50k.  We settled on a Fungi Tunic (now going on Bertoxx for just under 50) and 10k.<br />
<br />
I'm now broke and have no shirt, but I have my spell.  Well, that's not exactly true, I pulled the Spined Seahorse Hide Tunic off my twink and put it on until I can find something else.  It's nothing special, but 29 AC and 50 HP won't be horrid in the interim.  Gets me to 1100 AC self-buffed on the nose too, which is kind of nice.<br />
<br />
Since I'm no longer in a real raiding guild any more, looks like my options are probably Phase Spider Carapace, PoG, or maybe just saving a lot of money for Night Terror Chain or something -- where do those come from anyway?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">topor makes your fungi tunic obsolete .. i'd say that's a pretty decent trade seeing that topor is a pretty big upgrade to the fungi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You might think about hunting in CT a bit for components for a Tae Ew chain bp.  Those are pretty nice, and certainly comparable to a chain tunic from HoT, which are so fugging rare.<br />
<br />
I'd trade a fungi for torpor at 60 anyday.<br />
<br />
You won't miss it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gooch Gooch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My friend and I got our tae ew chain tunics for about 21k each.  They were an amazing upgrade from the barbed ringmail and arguably on par with velious BP's.  They have everything you need 45ac 11wis 8sta 50hp 50mana 5 to all saves and other crap.  A great buyable BP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I love my Tae Ew tunic. Been working on equiping the whole guild with them. Runs 45k on the open market on Torv.</div></div><hr />
