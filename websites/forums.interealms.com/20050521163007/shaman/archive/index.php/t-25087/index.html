<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yesak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm just curious, what would be the best exp for a warrior/shaman dou? Both are EP flagged. Warrior has around 8k hp and I have 6.5k both buffed. We're not flagged for anything in GoD, decent gear, nothing special. Any info would help. Thanks  :D <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yesak, you could probably do whatever is listed for soloing, only do it with less risk and downtime because you have a Warrior tanking for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Yesak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not quite Sam. All the stuff i solo is root/rot stuff. I dont know if i could heal him through a PoFire C1 mob that i can easily root/rot but hits quite a bit harder. Or Tables for that matter. Doing BoT CY right now with him and doing it quite easily. Might test out PoFire later. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Maybe Nobles' Causeway, just crawl along the gulley. I can solo there, but I'm at 50m after one mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">hey, i often hydra a warrior along with my shaman. We have a bit better gear then your characters.. sitting at 14khp buffed for the warrior and 9.3khp buffed for me but some of the stuff that we do when needed is any wall of slaughter mini named, noble causeway crawl looking for nameds, powater/earth near the zi are doable also. Try to maximize dps by using any clicky dots that you have on the mobs, always use a buffed pet, keeping regen on the warrior and using some ds potions.. those things individually dont do anything but combined will make a nice different over time. Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Try RCoD.  I can duo that with my ranger, though it can be rough when I pull a noc.  The XP is fairly good.  If you want a third there, grab a necro who is LFG, even if they are in the low 60's.  Between Mind Wreck, Zevfeer's Theft of Vitae/Night Stalker, snare/root, FD pulling, res, and good dot/pet DPS; they add a lot to a person who is duoing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kazracr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">murkgliders are a good spot, easy to solo pull and don't hit to hard ok amount of hps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Frakass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">don t forget that shaman+warrior = no snare</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sekin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I like to duo RCoD with my L68 war friend. We usually do the 4 named camps...kill ph/named then invis and move to next one.<br />
<br />
War is 10K buffed. I am L70 390aa 8K buffed. I can heal the war fine without C and downtime.<br />
<br />
Exp is okay but the $$$ is good.<br />
<br />
Oh about the part that war+sha = no snare...I just right click my ornate pants non stop when mobs around 20% hp.</div></div><hr />
