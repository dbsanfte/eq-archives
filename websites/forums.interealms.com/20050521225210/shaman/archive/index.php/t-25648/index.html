Do you play EQ2?  Many changes suggested in that letter have already gone live.<br />

BS arrow restrictions?  They aren't restrictions, but recommendations.  It's identical to adding more con levels except it allows for really easy trivial loot coding.  The mob conning in EQ2 isn't rocket science.<br />
<br />
PVP wasn't meant to work in EQ1 and isn't really meant for EQ2.  I think that PVP is really about the only &quot;if you don't like it go play another game&quot; kind of reply I would ever give - but really, if you want PVP, play AO, Shadowbane, or WoW.<br />
<br />
A general forum on the boards?  That really tops your list?  They don't need a general forum because they have enough specific ones not to warrant it.  If there was one, it would be flooded with posts that were more suited for the specific forums.<br />
<br />
Dots on the map for quest givers is a new suggestion to me.  It wouldn't hurt anything, but seems uh, really unneccessary?  There are plenty of quest givers in game now, frequently I feel as if there are *too* many.  I'm sure the majority of non-mob NPC's have a quest or two to give.<br />
<br />
I don't feel restricted in EQ2 anymore than EQ1 or any other game, if not I feel like there is even more to do.  I've been playing since release and still haven't even exhausted what's available to me in &lt;25ish level zones - Antonica, Commonlands and adjacent dungeons.  I haven't really touched any of Nek and no more than half of TS.<br />
<br />
I don't know what you mean by restricted really, maybe clarify that a bit more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">SOE's previous work in wrecking EQ1 is sufficient to make me believe nothing they put on their website. Eg: &quot;Ok friends your class sux, the quests are broke, progression without a 50+ guild is impossible, we stil haven't fixed the 2H hammer animation, but hey we're listening really well! We listen better than anyone!&quot;<br />
<br />
I played EQ2 from late beta to about X-Mas. If they have already introduced the things i complain about, i take them back. Unreservedly.<br />
<br />
Here's the things that drove me out of EQ2 -- I liked it alot when i first started playing:<br />
<br />
The arrows are restrictions dressed up as recommendations. When i was playing, if you did not bring exactly the right combo of players with the right combo of lvls, you got no loot from mobs. Forget sticking a monster in a zone and saying &quot;here she is, whack her and you will find unbelievable treasure!&quot;, the message is: &quot;bring 2 clerics and a guardian with no more than 2 lvl differences, and 3 other players, but make sure none are from different cities, or more than 4 lvls different, but don't bring 2 groups, and make sure you are all wearing red socks! On the left foot. Except dorfs. Who need green...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ok it's an exaggeration, but the design intention seemed pretty clear:  you do this exactly how we want you to do it, or not at all.<br />
<br />
Same with Tradeskills. I found the TS system more enjoyable than the adventure system, despite it being bugged as all hell on release. Again, up to lvl 20 or so, actually 30. Then they made you make only blue widgets for another player, who can turn them into brown left-angled wodgets for another player to make a part of a the leg of a red table, for another player to assemble an antique victorian table that requires 7 different parts from 7 other players. A daisy chain of interdependence that is simply just frustration.<br />
<br />
Same with quests. I could spend 30 mins trying to find a group to complete various quests and the whole thing would take a couple of hours after player B killed the four gnolls he needed, then player C did the 5 ghost gnolls she needed, the we finally got rouind to the 2 pink gnolls that i needed.<br />
<br />
OR i could lvl up solo and go back and do the quests when they were trvial in 1 hour. And not have to spend so much time putzing around or asking friends who were busy trying to get their own quests done. Which is what i usually did.<br />
<br />
If they had used the storyline of Qeynos/Freeport to have some epic battles of good v evil -- which seemed to me to be the best thing about EQ2 and the drop dead most obvious bleeding hook ever lucked on to keep players involved in the world and motivated to take part in -- i  would probably still be playing. Instead, they send you out to collect more gnoll tails, because these are vitally important to the stability of Qeynos whole political system... but don't hang out with trolls and ogres because they are evil n stuff!<br />
<br />
I have zero interest in a grind for months to be denied access to more content.<br />
 <br />
**Cliff notes: static world, tedious progress, the dull graphics started to bug me, the restrictions on mobs and grouping became an annoyance, and the whole experience started to remind me of the bad bits of EQ1.**</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I find many of the people who don't like EQ2 base it on their time in beta. I've yet to run across any friends who only started playing on release who don't like it, pretty much everyone likes it who didn't play beta, that i've met.<br />
<br />
Anyway, as to the letter, it sounds good, I jus thope they aren't overly responsive. I want them to make the game they thing is right, not just adjust to people complaining.</div></div><hr />

 Brighten up the game? With what crayons so it looks like WoW or more like EQ. I think it looks fine, even better then fine great.<br />
<br />
 Ok this is EQ2 not EQ so why make it like EQ? And as far as PvP well don't hold your breath or do and pass out. :) J/K I have no problem with PvP just give you guys your own server so they dont mess up the PvE which more of us want anyhow.<br />
<br />
 As for the DoT for quest givers why don't you learn the area or Ohh my god ask a guard? A Dot would do nothing for the game other then fluf for the lazy sorry :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's really simple. What you complain about here is a HUGE FIX to the catastrophe that was the CON system in EQ1. I could walk up to Rhag Zeh'zum in Ssra Temple with my level 67 Necromancer in EQ1 and go &quot;Hey cool... this fella's Blue to me! It's even telling me that he shouldn't be much of a challenge!&quot; And BAM, .003 seconds after I engage I'm dead as a stone and my corpse is in an unhappy place.<br />
<br />
Now they not only TELL you when a mob is intended to be killed by a GROUP (Btw, double healer groups aren't needed, that's just a safety net, I've been in groups with only my Mystic healing and we've killed ^^ RED Group mobs, and it really doesn't matter what the makeup of the group is.. a HEALER, a TANK and some DPS-ish people.. it REALLY doesn't make a FRACTION of the difference in the class makeup like it did in EQ1.) And I'm not unique in this experience.<br />
<br />
<br />
Same with Tradeskills. I found the TS system more enjoyable than the adventure system, despite it being bugged as all hell on release. Again, up to lvl 20 or so, actually 30. Then they made you make only blue widgets for another player, who can turn them into brown left-angled wodgets for another player to make a part of a the leg of a red table, for another player to assemble an antique victorian table that requires 7 different parts from 7 other players. A daisy chain of interdependence that is simply just frustration.<br />
<br />
100% Agree. If they wanted to create this tangled web of interdependancy fine.. but at LEAST make it so that if my Sage REQUIRES stuff that only Woodworkers can make (Paper and Quills) then give my Sage SOMETHING he can make that the Woodworker might want! Otherwise there's no trade being cultivated here. I have to make spells to sell to people or merchants, then use CASH (Since that's the only thing of value I bring to the table for WoodWorkers) and buy the pens etc... it's just plain not thought out.<br />
<br />
Same with quests. I could spend 30 mins trying to find a group to complete various quests and the whole thing would take a couple of hours after player B killed the four gnolls he needed, then player C did the 5 ghost gnolls she needed, the we finally got rouind to the 2 pink gnolls that i needed.<br />
<br />
Again, we're on opposite sides of the fence in this area. I find quests to be 1000000000x more efficient in EQ2 than in EQ1. Back in EQ1 we had to spend TWO MONTHS 24x7 farming shards and rings and crap for Vex Thal access. You know how much easier that would have been if you WHOLE GROUP got quest credit when you killed a Luclin shard dropping mob?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?! That **** burned me OUT on Everquest. No more Evercamp. YOu move in, move in with purpose and move on. MUCH more fun (Minus the stupid Stiletto's orders camp, which I've heard has been fixed.)<br />
<br />
There are so many people DOING the Armor quests, or Zek Access quests that it's quite simple to find people that need it and form a quick group for the purpose of achieving your common goals. You don't need 3 different flavors of Gnoll (Or other mobs) for most quests. Some of the different sub classes might need something else, but it's never caused that much undue time wasting. Hell, if you need to kill some Gnolls, go pickup 3 or 4 OTHER Gnoll slaying quests and get QUADRUPLE credit for killing ONE Gnoll and finish 4 quests at once! And get reasonable Exp and Items for doing so! GOod lord I can't begin to fathom how someone would prefer the old system to this one.<br />
<br />
OR i could lvl up solo and go back and do the quests when they were trvial in 1 hour. And not have to spend so much time putzing around or asking friends who were busy trying to get their own quests done. Which is what i usually did.<br />
<br />
Or maybe we could change ALL the mobs in the world into Orcs and then make all quests require killing 1 Orc to complete the quest. Would that make it better?<br />
<br />
If they had used the storyline of Qeynos/Freeport to have some epic battles of good v evil -- which seemed to me to be the best thing about EQ2 and the drop dead most obvious bleeding hook ever lucked on to keep players involved in the world and motivated to take part in -- i  would probably still be playing. Instead, they send you out to collect more gnoll tails, because these are vitally important to the stability of Qeynos whole political system... but don't hang out with trolls and ogres because they are evil n stuff!<br />
<br />
There's talk of using the Guilds in EQ2 as the armies of Qeynos and Freeport in Epic battles to come. (Guessing in Expansions?) But I'm too busy immersing myself in the massive wealth of gameplay and lore to have time for that just yet.. I suspect that by the time I'm ready for some Inter-City conflict it'll be looming around the corner. I don't think PVP should be entered into the game, except maybe in some special &quot;Battlefield&quot; zones, where you can go for the purpose of brawling...<br />
<br />
I have zero interest in a grind for months to be denied access to more content.<br />
<br />
If I wanted to, I could do the Zek access quest and get in there now. If I didn't want, I can just zone in for free when I hit level 32 on Adventurer or Artisan levels. The same goes for every restricted zone in the game that I've seen. If you want in early, do the quest (For decent Xp reward at the same time.) If you don't.. go about your business and you will get in for free pretty soon anyway.<br />
<br />
**Cliff notes: static world, tedious progress, the dull graphics started to bug me, the restrictions on mobs and grouping became an annoyance, and the whole experience started to remind me of the bad bits of EQ1.**<br />
<br />
If they staged another catacalysm on Day 2 after the game went live, I don't think we would have enjoyed the current world much.<br />
<br />
Perhaps give the players some time to smell the roses before you nuke them.<br />
<br />
Aside from Tradeskills being poorly worked out (Yet I still enjoy them enough to do them) I haven't seen an issue in the game that they haven't fixed amazingly fast.<br />
<br />
Oh well.. it's definitely not for everyone.<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Geeze.  Why don't you compare EQ2 to EQ1 before any expansions EQ1 had?  I think that's a more apples to apples comparison.<br />
<br />
Try playing EQ1 without any MMORPG experience, and tell me if you really like it, and compare that to EQ2.  No maps, no compass, no &quot;friendly&quot; con-system, no journal, no quest helper, quest items that bog down your inventory and bank space... now, what's that &quot;A broken arrow&quot; for again?<br />
<br />
Thank goodness I don't have to mash my sense heading button anymore.  It gets tiring after making your 5th toon (yeah, I know how to macro it, but it still is crazy).<br />
<br />
I do agree about the tradeskills.  I'm not going to start on them.  It seems too much of a hassle.<br />
<br />
I must admit that there's alot of &quot;sameness&quot; in the game.  The same quests... kill X mobs, Y times.  Even the distinction between classes are blurred.  A tank is a tank, a healer is a healer.  DPS classes... just dps.  Nothing that unique about classes, IMHO.<br />
<br />
-Fin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Tradeskills are a trainwreck IMO.  The Con system is annoying at times but honestly I have to say that the trivial loot code is probably for the best.  How many EQ players were driven nuts by the farmers camping what were trivial mobs for them, thus blocking you from any chance at fighting mobs that were challenging and rewarding for your level?<br />
<br />
I think the Arrows are a bit much when combined with the group/solo distinction.  The death penalty is so minor in EQ2 that I think they should just give you con colors and let you figure out from trial and error which mobs are extra tough or not.  Leave the group/solo distinction in though so groups don't waste their time killing solo mobs.<br />
<br />
Previously, it pissed me off that apparently you got X experience for Y encounter regardless of whether you had a 3 man group or a 6 man group.  However I see in the latest letter that they are finally fixing that... so I'll hold my tongue on that until I see how the fix works out.<br />
<br />
The one thing that does still annoy me is that group mobs are either trivial to solo or damn near impossible, thus making a LOT of quests off limits to soloists.  By the time you can solo the group mobs needed for the quest they're often grey and thus you can't get a chest to collect a needed item.  In other cases as you get higher level, the lowest level of green con mobs are utterly trivial in that they can't hit you at all.  I can often fight the lowest level green mobs as a lvl 36 illusionist and they simply can't hit me at all.  Nothing but misses.  That's out of whack as well, just in the opposite direction. ;)<br />
<br />
Overall, I'd rate EQ2 a very solid game although it's certainly got flaws.  It's come along pretty quickly since release and heading mostly in the right direction as far as adventuring.  Tradeskills need a MAJOR revamp to put it mildly though.  The interdependancies are so overdone that they're just ridiculous.  Personally I've always found tradeskills tedious so I can't really comment on the overall 'fun factor' of creating items objectively.  I do like that it's a much more interactive process than simply hitting the combine button and waiting on fail/success at least.</div></div><hr />
