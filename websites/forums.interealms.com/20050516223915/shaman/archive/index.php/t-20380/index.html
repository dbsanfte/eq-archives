<br />
LOL this is one area you and I are definitely in agreement on. <br />
<br />
Test server isnt for testing man, you should know that. Its for finding exploitable loop holes before SOE closes them on the main servers. SOE uses the regular servers for testing stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My guess is they probably didn't have much of a chance.  I appreciate that these are better than what we had before, but I'm skeptical that they will be enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Any improvement in Q is welcome.  With my AA's and items the new Q should fully heal a single Canni5 with one cast, which is VERY NICE.<br />
<br />
I agree that the new direct heal is an odd choice, only 250 more than our current direct heal.  But I'm willing to put the AA's into making it a &quot;real&quot; heal eventually.  2k every 4 seconds is enough to keep a tank up against elemental mobs long enough for the evac to go off :-)</div></div><hr />

I don't have to test this heal to tell you it isn't sufficient, sorry.<br />

And we have issues on the short and brutal fights in GoD. We do fine on long fights, especially on easy MOBs. Not spectacular but not too bad either.<br />

Naturally, as with everything that goes live it's a prereq that it have the support of everyone on test.  I personally raised holy hell about that kragg crap when they put that in, as did several others that are compitent...really payed off didn't it...  The change was listed on 3/12 I went home for the weekend to visit the folks, sorry that I didn't stop everything to test out a change....as we are naturally obligated to do simply because we play on test.<br />
<br />
If your pissed at dev, that's fine and I can say I blame you.  Lay off my boys though, 75% are ready to quit 'cause of the dx9 **** already...not to mention the general crap the class is being fed as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">It's like saying 90% of people won't see the elementals, etc. Total rubbish.<br />
<br />
So where is your evidence that it is otherwise ? Maybe its not 90% maybe its 80% or maybe its 92%. I dont think anyone knows for sure but its certainly not TOTAL rubbish.<br />
<br />
I dont think the huge number of twinks people in uberguilds have should count for extra people in this equation btw. And people that dont play anymore doesnt count either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">We meet again Spiritblood, my fine nemesis..... :)<br />
<br />
I was trying to say that making up percentages is total rubbish. I was semi-quoting the &quot;how many folks are elemental&quot; percentages that get used when any elemental issues are discussed as an example, not as a percentage to be discussed.<br />
<br />
Anyone can make up percentages and use them to sway, or attempt to sway an argument.<br />
<br />
So, I'll admit its not &quot;TOTAL rubbish&quot;, but forgive me for saying its &quot;ALMOST TOTAL rubbish&quot;.<br />
<br />
Peace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">It does seem like they put the changes out pretty fast, but that doesn't prevent us from still lobbying for what we want, and in the meantime, we have somewhat improved healing.  I can live with that.  Besides, BoT was nerfed with the mana change last week, so hopefully this rushed change was at least in part to fix that blunder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">When will this kind of percentage be made into a more reasonable number? It's like saying 90% of people won't see the elementals, etc. Total rubbish.<br />
We've had this discussion ad nauseum in one of the myriad threads about casual vs. raider issues.  W/o hard numbers from SOE, any percentage is arbitrary at best.  <br />
<br />
However, from strictly an anecdotal standpoint, it's not a stretch to say that a large majority of the playerbase will not receive these spells based on the fact that there are far fewer raiders than non-raiders. I use the number of VT+ guilds on a server as the baseline of what defines a raid player capable of most of the GoD content.  Based on this, I'd say 90% may be high, but not by much- I think when we discussed this last raiders came out to only ~15% of the server's population using SOE's last published subscriber numbers (400K I believe).<br />
<br />
Anyways, my point is that it's still ridiculous to tie a balance fix to a NO DROP spell in an expansion that many people didn't even buy (myself included), when the problem exists outside that expansion.  I've said this repeatedly: how is it okay for warriors/monks to login and get their balance fix from a vendor but not us? Why is it okay for us to get our incomplete heals from a vendor (a healing balance fix) but not this?<br />
<br />
I give up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">A clarification, Howjan:<br />
<br />
In no way did I assume the Shamans on test thought the changes were enough. I actually was pretty sure you guys feel the same way as most of us.<br />
I merely wanted to express my disappointment with the Devs for pushing this to the live servers that fast *as if* everyone on test who had tested the spell was fine with it and they felt comfortable enough to launch it.<br />
<br />
I am criticizing the Devs, not the people on test. Sorry, if my cynicism wasn't obvious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">If they had NOT put the new heal changes out in this patch I bet you would see a nice long thread on the shaman board complaining that there was a patch and the new heals were not included in it.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
<br />
You mean that 90% of the shamans are too scared to go in some open zones and try to go XP in places where mobs are fully slowable. If 90% of them don't want to try, their own loss, but don't say that at least the new blast heal is not available to all if you can get him in zones open to all.<br />

I have no doubt that any shaman that worked alot on his AAs, have some friends and is not affraid to die alot and start again will see kod taz.<br />

I've been playing a lot in GoD since it came out...  Tried crawling a couple of times in Ferubi with a group, and wiped...  Can generally survive most of the sewers (exp versions only so far), but have so far always wiped when deep in the Plant one, although that has been due to unfortunate pathing as much as anything.<br />
<br />
Who knows, maybe you're right, and I will get to Kod'Taz some day, although I have a hard time believing that my normal group will be able to survive a named in the trials beyond the sewers from what I've read.  Sure, you might not need the new heals to get to Kod'Taz if you're already &quot;uber&quot;, but they'd sure help those of us who aren't get there.</div></div><hr />

it is too hard for 6 peeps, go with 8, 10 ... nothing prevents you from bringing 2 groups. If I go hunting in Feruby hunting for augments or nameds, I never go with a single group.</div></div><hr />

Apparently you haven't been reading these boards. Yes, 1550 isn't enough. Yes, numbers have been posted.<br />

<br />
1) I am not supposed to be testing spells on the live server<br />
<br />
2) This isn't some super new ability, it's a 19% upgrade to my PoP heal, which is incredibly inadequate.<br />

<br />
Yeah this sure made it all happy warm fuzzy for me.<br />
<br />
I really fail to understand why so many people think this is the case. <br />
<br />
I'm a little testy this morning, so let me break this down in the simplest possible terms:<br />
<br />
Daluda's Healing and Balance Of The Nihil are both drops in the first sewer trial.  They drop off the level 65 Sludge Eating Fly.<br />
<br />
So, how do you get the spells?<br />
<br />
Well, you ZONE IN repeatedly until you a) see a Slude Eating Fly on track, or b) you zone in until there is a Slude Eating Fly standing right beside you.  Then you kill it.  If it drops your spell, loot it and leave.  If it does not, do the whole thing again.<br />
<br />
You DONT have to win the trial.  You DONT have to DO the trial.  You DONT HAVE TO DO ANYTHING BUT KILL A FEW MOBS!  If 90 percent of EQ players cant do that, then 90 percent of EQ players should find something else to do.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  For those complaining, consider this:  an upgraded heal, that adds roughly 400 hp (after focus effects) to every heal you cast is ALOT better than another pointless disease DoT.  The upgraded Breath Of Trushar is at least worth using, and they even made one of our existing spells slightly better.  How is any of that bad?  Its not enough?  Well, maybe not, but its alot better than it was.  It shows me that A) someone listened and b) there IS some thought behind the direction the shaman class is going.  Whether or not I agree with those thoughts is a different story, but at least someone, somewhere, is thinking about it (now, anyway).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">If the upgraded heals aren't enough for you then just start a cleric and be done with it.<br />
I believe that's my last option to try and squeeze a little more fun out of this game before WoW's launch, whenever that will be.  LDoN hards (and maybe GoD eventually, who knows) are the pinnacle of achievement in risk/reward for us bazaar players.  My shaman is a drag on the group of friends I play with at this point and we are stuck and can advance no further.  One can only spend so much time in normal LDoNs, BoT/PoV/Tactics after all.<br />

3 years, epic, 8th shawl, full spellbook, 80 aa's, all relevant foci... falls before the power of cheal. For the power of cheal could not be undone...<br />

Quit whining, drop rate on spells is already around 75-80%. The mobs always drop one item + random chance (75% or so) at spell now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't forget the 5 minute lockout they instituted to prevent spam spawning trial zones (it was probably causing too much server load).  Also, it's not like those flies appear at the zone in very often.  You might get one there once every 20-30 minutes if you're lucky.  THEN you have to pray it drops a spell rather than a piece of crappy gear that's hardly better than what you can get in bazaar.<br />
<br />
Most of the time if the Sludge-Eating Fly isn't at the entrance, it's a good 40-50 mobs away, which defeats the purpose of spawning a new instance over an over again.<br />

I think we need some remedial math here.  The drop rate is definitely NOT 75%.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll say it again.  GoD is a raiding expansion, not a &quot;let's sit in a low-level trial zone and farm spells&quot; expansion.  Two of the four spells should have been available from vendors.  It wouldn't have made a difference in light of the expansion or previous ones.</div></div><hr />

They summon, mitigate slow and hit for like 800-900 I think.  If you're a Time-geared shaman with like 400AA, maybe.  I wouldn't recommend it otherwise.  I've duoed them with a ranger (who I begged to switch to a two-hander because my heals couldn't keep up with the riposte damage).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I think you'd need some pretty good gear to solo him.  I can't remember if he summons (quite a few things in there seem to, though), but he hits for 1100-ish and mitigates slow.  Would certainly be a lot more doable if he doesn't. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">I wouldn't say that it is soloable, or at least not soloable to the point where it would be worth soloing.<br />

There IS a 5 minute lockout.  What does that mean for you?  Well, if you play smart, not much.  If you have 6 friends, you stay ungrouped.  You ALL get expeditions until you get one that seems acceotable.  After that, you group up and the leader of the expedition invites the others.  The more trackers you have, the easier this is obviously.  The non-trackers pretty much have to hope they zone in and can see the fly from the zone in (which does happen, though it might take a while). <br />
<br />
That isn't the point though. I was pointing out ONE way to get the spell.  That way is an awful lot like work though.  The mobs in trial 1 do not get harder as you go deeper into the trial, so why not have some fun?  Play the game -- fight your way into the zone.  Challenge yourself.  The other trials also drop spells, and they can be fun.  Is this a good way to distribute spells?  I'm not sure.  I think I prefer it to runes, though, and I *know* I prefer it to paying 100k for the spell in bazaar.<br />
<br />
This expansion might be the best yet for shaman, if you think about it.  The spells are good enough that I want them, but not SO good that I feel I can't function without them.  The zones are tough enough that I feel challenged, yet not SO tough that I feel they are unwinnable.  I didn't realize this at first, but this expansion also makes a shaman slower MUCH more desirable.  My beastlord has a rough time in GoD on the slowing front, and my enchanter has it even worse.  The shaman just keeps on clicking out those slows, though.<br />
<br />
Is it all good?  No, of course not.  On the whole, I'm pretty impressed with the sewer trials, and the vxed trial.  I haven't done the tipt trial yet (this weekend, maybe).

You're more uber than I am then.  :)  I found myself overwhelmed by the amount of incoming damage.  Also, the difficulty of getting single pulls was less than thrilling.<br />
<br />
Still, it will give me something to shoot for.  For now I'm content to form a group filled with people that want their spells and gear upgrades and just do it the old fashioned way -- by slaughering my way to the named, killing him, killing his firends, killing his allies, killing his dog, and maybe (just maybe) randomly killing one or two group members.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  In hindsight, I seem to have issues with killing.</div></div><hr />

If you never play in GoD and kill the mobs that drop them, you will never see them. It's really up to the individual to get these spells, especially Daluda's Mending and Balance of the Nihil, which both drop in zones that are open to anyone.<br />
<br />
As for the spell Breath of Trushar.  It depends on how motivated you are.  In a couple months, everyone and their brother will have Kod`taz access.  If you want Breath of Trushar right now, pass the trials.  They are honestly not that difficult, a challenge with decent reward, sorta like Hard LDoNs were when LDoN came out.  You don't have to be in an uber guild to do this.   My guild has about 15 active players and 8 not so active ones.  We're all pretty much Kod`taz flagged now.  We're not flagged for elemental planes, or even vex thal.  I am significantly better equipped than many of my guild too and we've managed the trials well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Spawning trial missions over and over might be the best way to get spells.  Spells also drop from mini-named mobs in Ferubi (Hexxt and Pixtt).  We collected a lot of pieces from the Pixtt Elites in ferubi for the smith trial.  I can tell you their loot table is broken. They dropped things like Brell's Mountainous Barrier and Cloak of Luclin.  Level 60 Luclin spells.  That's so wrong.  We also killed several Hexxt which seem to spawn where the Pixtt do, but sometimes not.  Hexxt do drop GoD spells, but out of the 4 or 5 we killed, only one dropped a spell.  We've killed mini named in Riwwi and Qinimi also, but they haven't dropped any spells.<br />
<br />
Having everyone in the group spawn a trial is a good way to do it, but you need everyone in the group to be able to invis and run back and forth without training the group.  That can be hard for some people *cough* clerics *cough*.  If you lack trackers there are always other &quot;tools&quot; you can use which are infinitely better than tracking, but I'll leave that at that.</div></div><hr />

Some servers don't get updated as quickly as others, despite all of them being brought down for updates. I think Plane of Mischief versions vary across servers.  Some GoD raid encounters work on some servers, but not on others.  So far I haven't seen any phenomenal increase in the spell drops from the sewers.</div></div><hr />

BTW, we do most of our spell farming in trial 5, wich may be too difficlt for most, BUT we also do a lot of trial 3, which is NOT too hard for the avarage person who can handle a hard LDoN.  Have seen spells of all classes drop there, so it's completely random. <br />

Send a rogue, ranger or druid in and track for A Sludge-Eating fly.  He can spawn anywhere (have seen him twice right at the zone in), and can be up more than once in the same instance.<br />

I'm in about the same boat as you, gear wise.  6k buffed.  The fly IS soloable, but it's really not worth it.  Things go just fine until root breaks.  Then i might as well zone out, since rerooting is going to put me through 3 continuous rounds of combat.  9 swipes of 990 is usually enough to put me under, or at least make it very difficult to recover.<br />
Good gear/AAs is necessary to solo the fly.  All the skill in the world won't help you if you don't have the hp to survive 2 max combat rounds.  Unless you happen to be an ogre and never get stunned, and your root never breaks.  Unfortunately, i don't fit into either category.  <br />
<br />
But don't take that to mean the spells aren't obtainable by poorly geared players.  The crematory spawns nameds that drop spells, albeit deep in.  The mobs there hit for 500ish.  The Sludge-Eater isn't a challenge for the poorest of groups.  It's easily duoed by 2 dot classes, let the other guy keep summon aggro and you heal him.  If they really did change the drop rate to 75%, then trushar and daluda shouldn't be too hard to obtain for ANYONE with a little patience.  From what i saw, that wasn't the case, but i haven't killed too many since the change, so that could mean nothing.</div></div><hr />

If you are doing the sewers trials with less than VT quality geared people, that's too risky to begin with, so I don't see what the problem with me saying it is easy is, honestly.<br />

I'd like to see a pre-VT quality geared group win the sewer trials(doesn't have to be VT gear to be VT quality).<br />
<br />
All I can say is that I don't bother buffing myself when farming the sewers. A 4k HP Shaman(which is definitely VT quality) with Virtue and self buffs would probably be less than 1k HP away from me when doing this. <br />
I finish the fights with 60% mana, so that shouldn't be a problem either. <br />
<br />
If you can't solo it, you don't necessarily suck, you just have to practice a bit.<br />

You dont think that perhaps your shielding might contribute to your ability to solo such mobs?<br />

I'm mean if you insist on keeping it a secret fine.  Dont share with us.  But I am curious to know what kind of Shielding you were speaking of in the above quote.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">Shielding as in shielding mod on time items. Shielding reduces the Damage Bonus of a mobs hit, thus resulting in a lower max and minimum hit(hence why I couldn't tell you the max hit accurately). No realistic amount of shielding will make a difference in soloing the Fly.<br />
<br />
Telling you what shield I am wearing would only lead to you telling me how I can solo the Fly due to my Time gear, which simply isn't the case. I never said having Time gear doesn't help. I am telling you that with 3.8-4k HPs and Virtue+selfbuffs ANY Shaman with VP3 can solo the Fly.<br />
<br />
3.8-4k unbuffed is definitely VT quality gear.<br />
<br />
This is a silly argument. I don't recall posting screenshots and boasting about how I soloed the Sludge-Eating-Yeldema. That ****ty Fly is soloable without a single piece of Time or elemental gear even, period.</div></div><hr />

First, I wasn't sure if it made any difference between spawning the expedition with Gamesh or the High Priest so I decided on Gamesh ( which is the XP version ) since he's right there.   After a few attempts of spawning an expedition, I finally got one with a Sludge Eating Fly wanderer that pathed into the first room.  There was a nihil arcanist spirit and muck-covered fly up between the zone-in and the point he wandered to, so I thought i'd better clear them out first.  After killing the spirit, I ran into my first snag, as the muck covered fly was immune to root.  After zoning out, I decided that it wasn't worth chancing it and brought in my 2-boxed enchanter to help.  In retrospect I wish I had tried soloing the muck covered fly first just tanking it.  I was under the impression the mobs in this trial would  for over 1.1k, but it turned out none were hitting much over 900 if that.  Anyway, I decided to just lull the muck covered fly and try pulling the Sludge Eating Fly past it when it pathed in.  That part worked fine, but much to my chagrin, it turns out the Sludge Eating fly was immune to root too!  This is where my confusion came as the previous posts had said to used the root/dot/back out tactic to kill it.  I was wondering if this was because I had chosen the XP version instead of the trial version.  The Fly did mitigate slow and was also hitting in the 900's ( not the 1.1 suggested earlier in the thread ) so I decided to try to tanking for a bit.  Well it was looking like a losing proposition ( for reference I went in with Virtue but no BSS so was just under 8k hps ) so I decided to zone out.  I probably should have given this a harder try with a pet, etc but it wasn't looking good and I didn't feel like dying at 1am.   I decided to give it one last shot and cheat by letting my enchanter charm solo it instead with a nearby stonemite :)  Of course that went off with out a hitch and it dropped of balance of nihil! :)   Yes, nerf charm. <br />
<br />
So I guess the point of my story is <br />
- The Sludge Eating Fly did not hit as hard as mentioned but did mitigate slow<br />
- The Sludge Eating Fly was immune to root which contradicts what was mentioned earlier.<br />
- Shaman won't be soloing it with the root/dot method if at all.  I think it might be doable by a very well equipped (time+), fully raid buffed shaman but would be difficult.  <br />
<br />
My question is, were the changes introduced with the last patch, or was it because I chose an XP version of the expedition from Gamesh intead of the progress trial version from the Arch Priest?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">I decided to give soloing the lair expedition a try last night and thought I'd relate my experience.   First, I wasn't sure if it made any difference between spawning the expedition with Gamesh or the High Priest so I decided on Gamesh ( which is the XP version ) since he's right there.   After a few attempts of spawning an expedition, I finally got one with a Sludge Eating Fly wanderer that pathed into the first room.  There was a nihil arcanist spirit and muck-covered fly up between the zone-in and the point he wandered to, so I thought i'd better clear them out first.  After killing the spirit, I ran into my first snag, as the muck covered fly was immune to root.  After zoning out, I decided that it wasn't worth chancing it and brought in my 2-boxed enchanter to help.  In retrospect I wish I had tried soloing the muck covered fly first just tanking it.  I was under the impression the mobs in this trial would  for over 1.1k, but it turned out none were hitting much over 900 if that.

<br />
It wasn't because of Gamesh for sure(all the ones I have killed were from Gamesh and only Gamesh allows you to choose the expedition you want to start anyway). I am a bit baffled now. There's only 2 explainations:<br />
<br />
1) They nerfed this in the last 24 hours and made the Sludge-Eating Fly root immune<br />
2) You mixed something up<br />
<br />
The Sludge-Eating Fly everyone here has been killing was level 65, rootable, mitigated Slow(partially affected) and was hitting for close to 1k, if not 1k.<br />
<br />
I will be checking when I get home.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">I cycled through solo &quot;lair&quot; expeditions from Gamesh yesterday afternoon until the sludge-eating fly was in the first room.<br />
<br />
I VP'd it, slowed, debuffed, dotted, got summoned, backed out, got summoned, backed out, rinse, repeat, until I died. VP ran full duration.<br />
<br />
I think perhaps I went into it a little casually because it owned me, although I think it would be a pretty hard fight for me. I am fairly new to the elementals with partial elemental gear (around 6200hp raid buffed). Perhaps my LR0 factored in. Either way, I am going to go back with a druid friend and hang out there.<br />
<br />
But, it was fully rootable yesterday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">In case it still is rootable and you have troubles healing up at some point, use spiritcall(ot advanced!). <br />
The 5 pets will last you long enough to heal up with Q since the rooted Fly will not be able to summon you, but has to hit your pets instead. This will add normal damage, enrgae damage and buy you time to stack DoTs or heal up efficiently with Q.<br />
<br />
Defensive AAs are a plus obviously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Oongah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">Interesting to hear that.  Well I'm positive it was the Sludge-Eating Fly I killed and it was immune to root.  He also dropped a 90hp pure melee mask if that rings a bell.  Just to make sure, it WAS lair you're doing and not plant?  Perhaps the explanation was that either 1) the trial spawns with random characteristics ( ie, sometimes the fly is rootable and others it is not ), or 2) it was because this fly was a wanderer and not a static spawn and the wanderers have different characteristics.  Also I'm sure he nor any other mob in there hit me for over 1k.  I'll definately go back and try again to see if things change.  Do you remember if the other flies were rootable normally?  The muck covered fly was definately immune too.  Heck so was the damn stonemite I ended up charming :)  Only thing I could root in there was the nihil arcanist spirit, though I only tried those 4 mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">Sounds like it was nerfed. <br />
The mask is a common drop and the mob characteristics were always the same(no matter whether it was a static or wanderer). The littles flies and the stonemites have been immune since the beginning.<br />
<br />
I hope this thread didn't lead to it.<br />
<br />
Definitely not worth doing this anymore considering the drop rate is ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">Oongah,<br />
<br />
Something is different..... I root-rotted a static spawned much-covered-mob (It wasn't a fly, and it wasn't immune) to open up space for me to die to the sludge-covered-fly. I did test out the melee of the muck covered fly and was hit three times for ~950.<br />
<br />
The sludge covered fly was about the same, although it mitigated slow and summoned. Both were static spawns so I have no idea if the wanderer aspect would cause immune to changes messages. It seems that there are other differences besides that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">Well, I farmed the lair trial earlier and everything was exactly the same as always. I even picked the same roamer you did and it was rootable just fine. <br />
Could it be that you got a resist message and no immune message?<br />
<br />
I killed 5 and got no spell btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u90"><b>Oongah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p90">Yeah I'm not sure what to say, I just killed 2 myself that were rootable.  No spells this time though.   I'm positive the first one was immune though but maybe I was smoking crack or something.  I'm sure I'll be doing more so we'll see what happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u91"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p91">I really fail to understand why so many people think this is the case. <br />
<br />
I'm a little testy this morning, so let me break this down in the simplest possible terms:<br />
<br />
Daluda's Healing and Balance Of The Nihil are both drops in the first sewer trial.  They drop off the level 65 Sludge Eating Fly.<br />
<br />
So, how do you get the spells?<br />
<br />
Well, you ZONE IN repeatedly until you a) see a Slude Eating Fly on track, or b) you zone in until there is a Slude Eating Fly standing right beside you.  Then you kill it.  If it drops your spell, loot it and leave.  If it does not, do the whole thing again.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I have yet to see two specific class spells drop from this named, and I've killed him over 150 times.  I got my slow from him, and I seriously doubt that he has a chance of dropping the new heal too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">oh, I've killed over 150 of these guys and everyone of them has been rootable/snareable.  Everyone of the Sludge Eating Flys have also summoned.  Now, the reg. flies in the lair are root/snare immune and I'm sure that's the ones that you are thinking of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>Quiggle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">Got the new heal off the Trickster in Vxed tonight. So far I've killed about 10 nameds with 3 spell drops: 1 beast nuke, 1 ench nuke and 1 shaman heal. Same casting time as Tnargs (3.8 with no spell haste). <br />
<br />
 -Quiggle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">Got Balance of the Nihil off umbiki last night. Still working on Daluda's Mending :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">finally after about 170 Slude Eating Fly kills I got a second slow last night, gave it to Badasc, who is one of the shaman in my guild.  Still have yet to see a cleric heal though.  I think that I've found a viable way of getting named to pop though, which involves the courtyard in barindu.  We got two of the named mastruq to pop easily last night in about 30 min with just a small group and although he was tough dropped him.  Yay us on our third named kill in Barindu with the spell Voice of Thule (level 60 SK spell).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u96"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p96">I'm not quite sure why you are all bitching and sayin xx number of shaman will never even see this. Have you tried? Have you given it 110%? I made a group one night, including a 3 boxed BST-WAR-CLR, myself, ranger and a chanter and we beat Tipt np. Same group hit up Vxed the next night and won. Sewers are far inferior to the mountain trials, and especially the WeaponMaster, yet we killed WM over sewers. 1 flag a day, Kod`Taz in 3 days not even really trying. Basically you need a skilled enchanter (one who doesn't die when charm breaks) and a tank w/ HP. Ranger to WS Tipt named is priceless. Just please stop whining about stuff you haven't taken enough time to try. I'm sure if you're 65 you can get 4 sewers flags and the mountains are easy if you can stay focused.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">Currently the problem isn't beating the trials, it's getting the spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">Noone is complaining about the mountain trials being too hard (too onesided and unbalanced, yes. too hard, no).<br />
<br />
People are complaining about the spell drops being far toor are. I have been Kod'taz flagged for quite a while now and I have one GoD spell - the turnin one (Breath of Trushar).<br />
<br />
I have killed about 40 flies now and seen 8 spells drop, 5 of them the new beastlord DoT. At least in PoP you could feasibly buy your spells after a while and more importantly you could use your runes to whatever classes needed spells.<br />
<br />
Killing hours for a single spell drop and then having it rot is just not fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u99"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p99">The NO DROPness on the spells is IMO bull**** for a few reasons. We did Vxed and killed the named crag monster, Umbiki. He dropped a INT caster robe and a WIZ nuke Black Ice if I recall. There is an Expedition Window, and what I would like to see is when the instanced trial is made, it takes class in to consideration, and doesnt drop spells for a class that isn't there. I have seen 4 spells drop in GoD and not even one of them could be used by that group. It just urks me because theres prolly 3 rotted spells for every one that got memmed.</div></div><hr />
