<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, lets stop hammering the guy and lets get down to business here.  I emailed my reply to a post he made today, in a thread that was locked as I was posting.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here was his reply to my email with 2 things, first he said he would have the spell guy look into the changes to Breath of Trushar on test and see if it was a bug.  Second he responded directly to my concerns.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hello again,<br />
Would it be fair to sum up your current concerns in the following 3 points?<br />
<br />
1.                Healing spells upgrades are rendered irrelevant due to the massive amount of damage Gates mobs dish out.<br />
2.                Slow is most often resisted and when it does stick it I most likely not a factor at all in combat as the fights are over quickly.<br />
3.                The Gates DoT’s similarly are ineffective in Gates combat due to the quickness of the battles and low damage output.<br />
<br />
 <br />
If this is a good summation would you pass along on the Shamans Crucible that this is what I am forwarding to our spell guy?<br />
<br />
 <br />
Thanks much.<br />

It was not exactly what I had emailed, but close enough.  I can post my original email to brenlo at some point, if you want.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Here is my reply.<br />
<br />
Brenlo, kick ass!  Thanks for writing back, I really<br />
appreciate it.<br />
<br />
 <br />
&gt; 1.                Healing spells upgrades are<br />
&gt; rendered irrelevant due to<br />
&gt; the massive amount of damage Gates mobs dish out.<br />
<br />
Yes, our current healing upgrade (which is a heal over<br />
time) is irrelevant due to the high damage output of<br />
the mobs we are fighting in Gates.  <br />
<br />
<br />
&gt; 2.                Slow is most often resisted and<br />
&gt; when it does stick it<br />
&gt; I most likely not a factor at all in combat as the<br />
&gt; fights are over<br />
&gt; quickly.<br />
<br />
Slow is a tougher argument to summarize.  It is most<br />
often brought up in conjunction with our concerns<br />
about healing.  I would never say it is &quot;not a factor<br />
at all&quot; because even a small slow for a short time can<br />
help, a little.  Shorter fights mean less return from<br />
slows, especially when they are heavily mitigated and<br />
we are forced to malos every mob before we can slow,<br />
then the mob is already at 50-60% (or less).  It looks<br />
like you folks tried to equip us for this scenario<br />
with the new GoD slow.  If this could be tuned up a<br />
bit, percentage-wise, I think shamans would overall be<br />
content with it (shocking, I know).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt; 3. The Gates DoT's similarly are ineffective in<br />
Gates<br />
&gt; combat due to the quickness of the battles and low<br />
&gt; damage output.<br />
&gt;  <br />
<br />
You got this one right on the nose.<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt; If this is a good summation would you pass along on<br />
&gt; the Shamans Crucible that this is what I am<br />
forwarding to our spell guy?<br />
<br />
I will go ahead and post this.  You can feel free to<br />
read the replies to the thread on the crucible.  I<br />
can't say I speak for all shaman, but I try hard, when<br />
campaigning for my class, to take the middle ground<br />
and not my personal agenda.  Again, thank you for<br />
responding to our concerns.  Whether or not there is<br />
changes because of anything we discussed remains to be<br />
seen, but the most important thing is open discourse.<br />
Thank you!</div></div><hr />

I 100% agree with this e-mail interaction, i back these 3 point 100%<br />
<br />
<br />
I will not ask for more things at this point in time cause i know full well that you cant wave a magic wand and make every bad thing go bye bye.<br />

I also want to thank you for finaly interacting with us. Beyond anything you do to help with our class, the biggest thing you have done is talked to us. So from the bottom of my heart. Thank you.<br />
<br />
<br />
I would also like to add with henora that our canni spell truly upsets me that its ancient. I think our DoT should be ancient cause it would make a nice addition to my spell book and i would be very happy for it to drop and get it, but its not as useful and helpful to us as CP.<br />
<br />
I strongly ask that you re-consider this. I am sure there is not 1 single shaman that will not back this request here.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have just posted a (not quite finished) summary of what I feel are our main concerns here  summary of shaman problems  (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=20192) <br />
<br />
Currently missing numbers and conclusions/proposals - will add those in when I get the time.<br />
<br />
It is not exactly a short summary but it might be helpful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">These points are good, but the canni upgrade being ancient definitely should be addressed.  Fixing it doesn't have the importance of our slows and heals not being up to snuff, not even close, bbut I would put it well higher than concerns about the new DOT.  <br />
<br />
If you look at mana pools today compared to when canni 4 first came out, canni 4 is nowhere near as dramatic as it used to be.  Even canni 5(our canni AA ability) restores only a mana bubble and small change for me personally -- since canni 5 can only be used every few minutes, shaman mana regeneration is not nearly as startling as it used to be.<br />
<br />
It actually takes quite a bit of concerted pressing of the canni gem slot to get mana back and keep it at a reasonable level for a shaman unless the shaman is very lazy and just refuses to cast many spells at all.  This does not add to the challenge of the game or playing the class, nor does it keep up with the present realities of the gameplay.  It is merely very, very tedious.<br />
<br />
A little relief on the old wrists and fingers is longer overdue than it might seem to many people who aren't shamans and don't realize how much of that clicking we have to do.  During which we can't really socialize, grab a bit of a sandwich, do the ordinary things of life and gameplay that makes a game seem a little less of a strain and a little more fun.  There are plenty of times when I've wanted to respond to tells and chat with friends, but have to just relegate myself to endless clicking of my canni spell gem instead, or the group will be in trouble.  It doesn't feel very friendly or fun.<br />
<br />
We don't have it as bad as bards, but considering the size of mana pools these days and how rapidly shamans need to fire off spells against mobs that die quickly, then fire off more spells again for the next incoming mob -- canni 4 and yes even canni 5 are not quite as stunning as they used to be.<br />
<br />
Making the new canni spell NOT an ancient would make playing a shaman much more pleasant.  It wouldn't reduce the challenge so much as the sometimes grinding, repetitious tedium.  And the break sure would be nice for our hands and wrists!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hail, Brenlo<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
     I am Gangaskan Gnollbasher a shaman from the Blades of Wrath guild on torvon I responded to the thread about shamans in the newbie zone.  I have something constructive to say, as you are aware Kod`Taz trials aren’t the easiest I haven’t done many due to the fact that a druid is more situational then I am in the healing department.   Mainly because the named monsters aren’t slowable and uh, quad 1800+ if I recall correctly I do enjoy the quintessence upgrade although I feel it was not needed.  Whenever I quint its after cannibalize 5 or when I’m soloing tnargs heals 1300 base 1500-1830 with aa’s + marrs gift and if your lucky a 3k-3500 healing cirt with all aa’s regarding healing adept / gift.  Maby if you flag those immune mobs slightly or partially slowable we would be more viable in Kod`Taz trials I don’t know it might be something to consider just keep that in mind.  <br />
<br />
     I want to contribute to my guild but with being a third rate healer I find lack of groups and when I do we don’t even get past the first named because its 1 hour before an raid by the time we kill the named monster.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have a problem with your response in regards to Slows. <br />
<br />
A higher percentage on Balance of the Nihil will not solve anything. <br />
In a lot of cases I have to cast Nihil on the incoming mob to be able to switch to healing as soon as possible. <br />
<br />
Even if I can slow the mob the very second it hits the camp, it will still take about 10 seconds before I can land a heal on my tank. In reality, though, my Slow is either resisted or causing me to get aggro which delays the time for me to be able to heal the tank even further. That's assuming I live through the aggro from the early Slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'd have to agree with Giac. <br />
<br />
A higher resist modifier on Balance of Nihil would be more worthwhile than a higher slow percentage. In GoD the important aspect is getting the mobs slowed fast, whether it's 60 or 75% slow is of lesser concern. Not unimportant, but lesser.<br />
<br />
For the sake of argument, let's give BoN a -55 resist modifier as opposed to the current -40. That means Nihil would have a 'built-in' malos effect. <br />
<br />
This would make it a more viable spell for those mobs where you have to put priority at slowing asap rather than slowing for a high percentage. Malos+turgurs is still the best _slow_, it just works better in other situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">how about a boost in resist and slow. I dont see a problem with cranking up the check and making it a 65 or 70% slow<br />
<br />
I never saw the unbalance of it to begin with, we are THE slowing class. If we are going to be a one trick pony, then make it a hell of a trick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">All of these different responses only emphasises our problem with focusing on a particular concern.<br />
<br />
Over the past week, it's been about healing in GoD. Now that Brenlo gave a response, suddenly everyone is muddling this concern with all kinds of different ideas again, from Buffs, to revamping the slows etc...<br />
<br />
Why not just stay focused on the major concern (which in my opinion is healing ability in GoD), see if that gets resolved, then move on to other fixes.<br />
<br />
SoE is not going to fixed 5 different problem areas at the same time. That is just wishful thinking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Isn't the common consensus that slowing IS healing for us? <br />
<br />
After all that seems to be the historical justification used in all shaman spell implementations. When you look at shaman 'healing' you cannot concentrate only on the direct healing aspect. Slow is a too intricately involved factor in our class makeup to simplify it that far. I think most players will agree on that.<br />
<br />
As for slow specifics, I would not go as far as to ask for a higher % slow on Nihil AND a higher resist mod all in one package. Cranking up the slow % on Nihil too close to Turgurs would not only encroach on Turgurs usefullness, it would also have an overly trivializing effect on non-GoD content. I realize all new content makes old content somewhat trivial, but from a devs point of view there is probably no desire to overly inflate trivialization if it can be avoided. If anything, tack on an anti-agro component to Nihil in combination with a higher resist mod.<br />
<br />
Having two tools at our disposal (malos+Turgurs or Nihil) should be sufficient, and practicable both in and out of GoD, as long as these two tools both have different situational uses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think that a few people are missing the point that this isn't necessarily just a GoD issue, specifically the healing problems most post 60 shaman feel we have. Why should I have to buy GoD to be able to heal half as good as a druid or even a cleric? I know that even buying the expansion doesn't grant that ability but the point is we are all priests, and have been since level 1. <br />
Does a Monk need to buy GoD to be a viable replacement for a rogues dps? no, so why should shaman's not be a viable replacement for druid or cleric healing? Sure we got slows but they got better more sought after buffs, better dps and ports in the case of druids. And they also got self mana regen that doesn't require wearing out the keyboard, and cheaper to cast spells that generate less agro.</div></div><hr />

Cranking up the slow % on Nihil too close to Turgurs would not only encroach on Turgurs usefullness, . . .<br />
I do not mind that at all - the only spell that lasted this long in anyone's spellbook is complete heal - and complete heal did not have random mitigation assigned to it.<br />
It is time for an upgrade to Turgur's, not a spell we mem alongside it.<br />
<br />
. . . it would also have an overly trivializing effect on non-GoD content. I realize all new content makes old content somewhat trivial, but from a devs point of view there is probably no desire to overly inflate trivialization if it can be avoided.<br />
Well, the spell is nodrop and pretty rare - that alone should keep a lot of players who still use pre-PoP content from ever seeing it.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps I came out a bit fuzzy in my logic. What I was getting at is that I would not want to see Turgurs made totally superflous by Nihil. From a game balance viewpoint Turgurs HAS to be the preferable choice over Nihil in some situations. Otherwise Nihil will be the be-all end all of slows and all slowing will be carried out using Nihil (with or without malos depending on mob type).<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: or maybe we are at the point where it is time to phase out Turgurs? That's a question I do not think any of us are qualified to answer since we have not seen all of what GoD has to offer yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Yes, these are our main points of concern.<br />
<br />
Much of the discusions above hinge on the fact that, for shaman, slowing is one element of our healing/damage mitigation.  If our slowing can not be upgraded to deal with the new content, then our heal shoudl be upgraded to deal with the new content, or the combination should be .... to me, thats what folks are saying.<br />
<br />
Many (me for one, and I really think most shaman) look at slow as our main thing, far outweighing all of the other things that we can do.  If the slow is trivialized by mitigation and/or very fast fights, what do we have left?  Since it seems unlikely that slow will get upgraded (see the debate over whether Nihil is useless or merely situational) ... how else can we contribute?   We are priests, and if we can not mitigate damge through slow, then we need/want to mitigate damage through healing, but we do not have the tools for unslowed mobs, or partially slowed mobs in very short fights.<br />

<br />
If the Ikkinz raids are any indication there is almost ZERO reason to ever use Nihil.  Since anything really hard is immune to slow and trash is easily slowed with turgur's.  I sincerely doubt they are going to go through all the content and reflag every red mob to be suddenly slowable.<br />

I've seen one instance where I wish I had Nihil and that was in Uqua which as far as I am concerned is a broken zone.</div></div><hr />

That is exactly my point - why should Turgur's not be phased out? I can see why they are not upping the slow percentage but I see no harm in getting a true upgrade to Turgur's, especially with enchanters and beastlords slowing so close to us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Slowing used to be healing for us.  Mitigation changes that quite a bit though.  Not all mobs in GoD mitigate but they do all need to be slowed if we're to have a prayer of serving any significant role as healer.  I see healing as the #1 problem with the shaman class atm.  If we can't slow and main heal, that is fine and probably the way it should be.<br />
<br />
What we should be able to do:<br />
-be slower and a reliable backup healer.  This is borderline possible now but it's a stretch in many of the higher end areas depending on whether you have a Super uber tank or just an uber tank.  <br />
<br />
-fill the role of main healer for most xp groups.  This may require a separate slower, which is fine.  If a slower is mandatory for any other priest class, then I don't see it as unfair that if a shaman is main healer a separate slower be required.  Asking for us to be able to replace 2 classes in any group is asking too much.<br />
<br />
As far as the Canni upgrade, it's fine IF we get our healing upgrades.  Being able to canni for more mana won't do a damn thing for us if we can't heal fast enough to keep the tank alive.  A shaman with full mana is no more use to the group than an oom shaman if he can't keep people alive.  Asking for canni upgrades to be given priority will only serve to weaken our calls for healing upgrades.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You are forgetting that with the slow mitigation in place, Druids and Clerics would be able to heal just fine WITHOUT a slower. It is NOT *fine*, if we requrie a slower to slow for us to keep up a tank in exp groups. <br />
You are just giving them an excuse to not upgrade our heals with that paragraph, since they are ignorant like that. If Slows are part of our healing, we should be able to keep up a tank with just us slowing AND healing.</div></div><hr />

        It's pur BS ! So what Beastlord are only slower ? they are not dps too ? What chanter are only slower ? But you must be joking . No surprise we have very inferious heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I'm not as concerned with the healing upgrades as a lot of other Shamans but I'm also not playing at the same level as them. Inevitably I will be though and I know that i will want and need better healing eventually. Already I'm starting to see signs of this.<br />
<br />
I was in an expedition a while ago where the Cleric went down near the beginning of the battle and I spent the rest of the fight spamming tnargs on the MT over and over. Even had two squeeze in a mass cann near the end so I could keep him healed. This was on one mob that was slowed. :P<br />
<br />
For the new slow spell I haven't got it yet. I love the fact that it has a neg 40 res adjustment so long as this completely removes the need to waste time ALWAYS having to malos a mob first to ensure slow sticks. What I don't like to see is it at 60% and a 12 sec recast time. There's really no reason for this spell not to be a direct upgrade to our level 51 slow. It should be 75% with a reasonable re-cast time. <br />
<br />
I along with the masses of everyone here was baffled and dssapointed with the release of a new disease dot. I solo a lot and therefore actually use disease dots from time to time (And only when I'm soloing) but given that we got our last disease dot at level 64 I can't begin to understand the reason for giving us another.<br />
<br />
The problem is GoD is now released and the spell is now live. Unless some drastic change can be made, like the spell be turned into a disease based nuke with a quick casting time (in comparrison to Velium Strike) and does over 1k dmg, I don't see any reason to discuss this problem. This spell is out already, it should have been taken care of before GoD went live. <br />
<br />
What I'd rather see discussed is our new Cann spell from GoD be turned from an ancient spell to a regular drop. I believe all Shamans should have a chance at this spell since it is arguably the best GoD spell that was released.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Repost from the other thread that got cluttered, it's all about the mob design.  SoE radically changed mob design in PoP-GoD, but di dnot anticipate the balance problems that would come out of it.<br />
<br />
With PoP, and especially with GoD, the game has been reduced entirely to tanking, quick healing, and quick damage dealing.* Any class that sucks at all three of those sucks, period. We suck at all three of those. <br />
<br />
We aren't a tank class. That leaves healing and damage. We need to be substantially better EITHER at quick healing OR quick damage. There is no division, just about every intelligent poster here has been saying that since mid-late PoP, and now everyone (except people saying that we are fine at all stages of the game because we own in upper guk groups) is saying it. <br />
<br />
<br />
* I understand why they did that (SoE has to know that CH, high % slows, and defensive/evasive were each horrible decisions, and the new style eliminates the first two-expect &quot;the mob is slightly effected by your defensive discipline&quot; coming to an expansion near you so they clean up all 3 of those blunders), that's why I am not asking for a return to the old days. We ruled in the world where mobs had low damage output and high hitpoints. That world has been replaced by super high damage output, low hit point mob models (and THANK GOD for that-we all know how much Luclin sucked). But while this change helped some (see:charmers) it diminished others (see: us).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Hello.  I would like to echo the thanks that many have posted for your willingness to listen and address shaman concerns.  <br />
<br />
Would it be fair to sum up your current concerns in the following 3 points?<br />
<br />
1. Healing spells upgrades are rendered irrelevant due to the massive amount of damage Gates mobs dish out.<br />
2. Slow is most often resisted and when it does stick it I most likely not a factor at all in combat as the fights are over quickly.<br />
3. The Gates DoT’s similarly are ineffective in Gates combat due to the quickness of the battles and low damage output.<br />
<br />
May I offer a perspective on the three points you list.<br />
<br />
GoD mobs put out massive damage.  In order to succeed there, your team must be able to kill them quickly.  A fight that keep on going for as long as one full minute probably means that the party is wiped out.<br />
<br />
The question I would ask is, what is the shaman's role intended to be in fights like this in GoD?  Traditionally, a shaman is (1) a priest class with strong heals, (2) with a very significant role to play in slowing the mob's attack, and (3) the ability to inflict serious harm on the mob with damage over time spells.<br />
<br />
1.  The amount of damage these mobs put out currently rules out the possibility that a shaman can serve as a healer.  The new shaman Heal over Time is a very minor upgrade over Quiescence, and is completely insufficient to keep anyone alive.  A shaman's quick heal spell provides a base of 1300 hp of healing :: with mobs doubling and tripling for over 1000 per swing, a 1300 hp heal is completely insufficient to keep anyone alive.  This means that the role for a shaman will not be healing in GoD, with the present setup.<br />
<br />
2.  Most of these mobs mitigate and resist slow.  A group that fights in GoD cannot wait for the shaman to succeed in slowing the mob:  so they must endure the damage the mob inflicts and go on about the business of killing the mob.  By the time a shaman casts Malos, casts Turgurs, gets resisted, waits for it to refresh, and then casts it again, the mob will routinely be down under 50 pct health, often as low as 30 pct health.  That means the group has had to kill the mob without benefit of a slow.  To be successful in GoD, a group cannot count on a shaman to slow the mob early and reliably:  instead, they must be able to kill an unslowed mob before it can kill them.  This means that the role for a shaman will not be slowing in GoD, with the present setup.<br />
<br />
3.  A successful group in GoD needs to be killing a typical mob there in 30 to 40 seconds.  Shaman DoTs will have at most 30 seconds to run:  less than that, if they do any healing or slowing work at all.  A DoT that would do its damage over a period of 2 minutes is only going to do one fourth of its damage if it only gets to run for 30 seconds.  So a spell that looks powerful -- a 4000 point DoT -- would have no more killing power than a 1000 point nuke.  This means that the role for a shaman will not be using DoTs in GoD, with the present setup.<br />
<br />
The bottom line on all this is:  with the present spell lineup, a shaman in GoD cannot succeed as a healer, as a slower, or as a DoTter.  No group that hopes to succeed in GoD can rely on shaman heals, shaman slows, or shaman DoTs.  Thus, none of a shaman's traditional roles can be fulfilled in GoD.<br />
<br />
This lines up quite closely with the three points in your summary.  I offer this perspective as one player's sense of why these three are so significant.  Thanks for your time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Yes these are my three biggest areas of concern.  And if I had to pick one it is the healing one.  <br />
<br />
I am a shaman, my Archetype is Priest.  I do not feel that I can fulfil the role of my Archetype in groups.  <br />
<br />
I feel very strongly that I should be able to function as the main priest for my group in place of a Cleric or a Druid - in an appropriate group (i.e. someone else other than me slowing).  My healing powers are not strong enought that I can do that in GoD at all.  I can, with great difficulty, do that in the Elemental Planes or Hard LDoN, although there will be many more deaths in my group compared to a similar group with a Cleric/Druid as the main healer in my place.  <br />
<br />
My view is that there are several roles that must be filled for the 'standard' group - I fully accept that there are many different group types and tactics.  The standard XP group has a Healer, a Tank, a utility (mezz/cc/slow/whatever) and then damage.  I do not feel that shaman are currently suitable to fill the Healer role, where a Cleric can fill that role and a Druid less easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Thlexian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I think that one of the biggest concerns from the shaman class has been that we didn't know if SOE had noticed our feedback about our in-game experiences.  Thank you for responding, Brenlo -- it lets us know SOE is listening.<br />
<br />
Even more basic than our suggestions of how to fix the shaman class is our desire to be useful in groups and raids; we want to be more than just a buff bot.  The people who post here are shamans because they love the class and the characters they've spent so much time and effort to advance.  It's currently disheartening to feel like we have no place to contribute in the new content.  I think most of us are realistic and understand that we will not get everything we request, but please give us enough power to be of use to our groups.  I want more than anything to bring value to my team because my class has abilities that are needed (and dare I say perhaps &lt;b&gt;better&lt;/b&gt; in one area than any other class, such as slowing).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I don't think the DOT is one of our top three concerns.  Neither do some others, and that's why some answered, NO, those are NOT our top three concerns.  <br />
<br />
Maybe some agree that the DOT we just got in GoD is a top three problem, but I bet most of us don't.<br />
<br />
There's no sense giving him an answer you don't believe yourself.  You'll only wind up misleading him, and then how can he help?  He asked an honest question so he needs an honest answer.  <br />
<br />
With a yes/no question, &quot;no&quot; is just as valid as &quot;yes,&quot; and in this instance it would do a lot more good.<br />
<br />
I really doubt many of us put the damage from the DOT from GoD -- which many of us don't have and many more will not have for a long time -- as one of our top three issues.<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't think DOT's can or will be improved enough to matter, so they're a dead end.  They're all about lasting a long time, sometimes a very long time, and neither players nor mobs last a long time these days.<br />
<br />
Perhaps turning the new DOT into a reasonable DD -- eliminating it, not adjusting it -- would make it matter.  Giving us a better and more accessible canni, whether or not it's the now &quot;ancient&quot; canni, would at least help us not go OOM from spam healing, which I have done in Tipt and Vxed, and doing so would help solve our problems on simply having no time to canni much compared to our mana expediture.  Not to mention bring our mana regen more in line with the idea people commonly have about it being incredibly fast.  Neither canni 4 nor our AA canni ability are incredibly fast regenerators of mana these days -- not for the mana pools of today or the pace of the game.<br />
<br />
I'd put both those alternatives at a higher level of importance than adjusting the DOT somehow.  I have a feeling no matter how they adjust the DOT, if they keep it as a DOT at all, its use will be minimal.  Like someone said above, even a 4k DOT doesn't necessarily add up to much except on paper.  Certainly it seems to me that there's nothing they could do to that DOT that would make it a top three overall shaman class issue.  We have bigger fish to fry than that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>lfclan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">What scares me is that we are concentrating on one aspect (healing) and as seen by B's post he is gonna forward our worries about healing &quot;first.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking into the future (using the past examples as a template) I see us proving our heal points, SoE agreeing, SoE tossing us a bone of a decent burst heal, then closing up shop on shaman.....<br />
<br />
The scarey thing is that once they give us some better healing then they will have the excuse that &quot;hey we listened to u and gave u what u wanted... so shut up and leave us be....&quot;<br />
<br />
As will most of the rest of EQ.... Weve seen many many posts about how we are whining and crying and we need to shut up cause we can solo Lodi.... So when we get our heal upgrade we will have to deal with our huge lack of DPS, Gimped slow ability, and Mana regen problems still....<br />
<br />
 BUT  Having put all our eggs in one basket ( Heals ) we will have no ammo to fight for other upgrades that are so sorely needed in the new world of PoTime and GoD that its close to impossible to play a useful role.<br />
<br />
Im more than glad B has come here and opened a line of communication, but at the same time it scares me to death.... lets hope for the best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">For me the issue of healing comes down to the 3 priest classes being the 3 best healers and the fact that paladins are only slightly behind us while druids routinely take the place of clerics in CH rotations.<br />
<br />
the argument that we should be so far behind druids is invalad on every front that I have seen presented. <br />
we have slow...druids have snare both of which are hugely powerful in game<br />
we have great buffs...so do druids and theirs are better on many fronts.<br />
druids out dot us<br />
druids out nuke us<br />
druid spells come with resist modifiers that make me cry  (-100mr check on their primary dot line)<br />
spell range on many druid spells is obscene.<br />
druids get CHARM ok Charm just to be clear allows a class with mini tash, snare, serious pet buffing including haste, and a huge CH to dish out some amazing dps.<br />
<br />
so one more time tell my why shaman shouldnt just get their current heals upgraded to the druid versions right now? <br />
<br />
sure we are more powerful than druids situationaly but they are far more powerful in general. <br />
<br />
<br />
that and the new cani spell would be my 2 biggest complaints with the new expansion and with life as a pve shaman in general.<br />

<br />
If you look at his response I can agree with that being the top three issues even tho i could care less about the dot. If you look at what he wrote especially in the context of the other comments they seem to understand that dots are not a viable option for damage, especially disease ones, and we need an improved form of quick damage, aka nuke.<br />
<br />
If we got a new direct heal in place of  Breath of Trushar, an improvement to Balance of the Nihil (ideally increased slow and duration to make it a total replacement for turgurs and a deaggro effect added so we can actually cast it imidiately) and Plague of Daluda turned into some improved nuke I'd be pretty happy personally. Altho all 3 might be dreaming.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree that all three of these seem like viable issues that should be worked on with the shaman class. The only other issues I hope can be touched upon is fixing our Focus (HP) line of buffs with removing the +stats ( Str, dex ) effects on the buff and change them to +skills ( ie. +sheidling, +avoidance, +accuracy, etc. ) <br />
<br />
And possibly along with adjusting DoT damage maybe help out our nuke damage because Velium strike has waaay to slow of a cast time and spear of torment is not enough damage to even be able to contribute in some &quot;burst dps&quot; types of situations.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>JenamdarAL</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">The problem for shaman currently isn't all about spells, but how they effect us on the content we encounter as well.<br />
<br />
Take a look at the current spell line up for GoD:<br />
<br />
Balance of the Nihil <br />
<br />
Decrease Attack Speed by 60%<br />
Resist: -40<br />
<br />
Perfect example of how a spell is effected by content. This slow might be quite useful if hard mob's we encounter in GoD had higher magic resist and it was the only slow that could land. However the red con mobs we encounter are SLOW IMMUNE making this spell totally useless to us. Basically this slow could be 100% and still not address our problems because of slow immunity.<br />
<br />
<br />
Breath of Trushar <br />
<br />
Heal 360 per tick<br />
Costs 220 mana<br />
<br />
The spell that is currently in flux, it has been changed twice on test and neither change made much sense. With a large amount of content that is required to progress being slow immune our healing short comings are highlighted for everyone to see. Our healing has been balanced around our ability to reduce damage out out by mobs, therefore bringing their dps down to a level we can heal. This balance of effectiveness is directly related to the content we encounter, and when slow immunity is present our balance is lost. One suggestion that I liked was making this a massive heal over time, limited to 4 ticks regardless of focus effects, healing 1k per tick with a good sized recast. Certainly not something that is going to make shaman primary healers in GoD but it would be a unique heal as a backup to clerics on tanks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Plague of Daluda<br />
<br />
Decrease Hitpoints by 145 per tick<br />
Mana: 393 <br />
Duration: 2.1 mins  <br />
<br />
One thing we do not need is another long duration dot, which also happens to be DR based and more resisted then anything else we have. Along with Balance of the Nihil a spell that I would never care if I never got. It simply does not add anything to our class.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ancient Chaotic Pain <br />
<br />
Decrease Hitpoints by 668 <br />
Increase Mana by 360  <br />
<br />
The only really benefical spell in our GoD lineup, but since it's an ancient spell few will see it any time soon and many will never see it at all. The idea behind ancient spells in SoL was to give a slight bonus in the form of a dropped spell. This spell however is a huge upgrade that is hidden away as an ancient spell. Great spell, shame very few will ever get to use it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If we assume that content (slow immunity) is not going to change then our problems will have to be addressed through spells.<br />
<br />
What I suggest is:  <br />
<br />
Replace Balance of the Nihil with a direct heal thats aprox 20% worse then what druid's GoD heal ends up being. I don't have any desire to replace druids and number 2 healer.<br />
<br />
Upgrade Breath of Trushar to 450-500 healed per tick for more mana. OR make it 1k a tick like I mentioned above and leave Balance of the Nihil in and not add a direct heal.<br />
<br />
Replace Plague of Daluda with a new nuke, say a 1kish PR nuke? That would go well with the focus effects that are out there for shaman currently.<br />
<br />
Leave Ancient Chaotic Pain as it is BUT make it the rune turn in spell. Move Plague of Daluda(or proposed nuke) slot to ancient drop.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">For intents of discussion, I WILL NOT address issues regarding our nuking, DOTing or meleeing situations.. all of which I feel need discussion as well, but not here, this is about healing.<br />
<br />
Okay, I read a statement by one Shaman saying that he was glad Brenlo addressed our healing concerns but that we are no muddying the waters by discussing slows and canni spells.<br />
<br />
The simple fact is that with Shamans these waters have ALWAYS been muddy.  Let me explain the situation as I see it.<br />
<br />
Shamans are not Clerics, and Druids are not Clerics.   All of our healing concerns and adaptations from the point of SOE are based on a comparison to Druids.   So this is where it begins.<br />
<br />
Shamans heal.   Druids heal.<br />
<br />
Shamans slow mobs which in turn mitigates damage output, requiring us to heal less overall HP than a druid would need to heal to a melee under similar circumstances.   Druids heal.<br />
<br />
Shamans can Cannibalize by many means to convert our considerable HP pools to mana allowing us to Heal and Slow more often and turn over a higher rate of Mana per encounter.   Druids Meditate so that they can heal.<br />
<br />
Now.. In Kunark, Velious, and even Luclin.  This was a fair assessment of the situation, we had signifigantly weaker healing prowess than Druids.  But our alternative skills compensated nicely.<br />
<br />
In PoP, Shaman heals were upgraded, slightly. Tnarg's Mending is a lovely spam heal, nothing more.  In concert Druid heals were improved as well, and to a wider margin.  This is where the gap began to widen.<br />
<br />
PoP also saw the rise of Slow Mitigation.  This began to create a problem whereas we could no longer compensate for our reduced healing potential with impressive damage mitigation.  GoD has further widened the gap, not by mitigating more, but by increasing the damage the mobs are doing on a per-hit basis.  It's not uncommon to encounter Blue-conning mobs, that can be 75% slowed but can hit for 1200+ her hit.   No amount of slowing is going to change the fact that a quad-hit from a mob of this calibre could easily do 4000+ damage in one round of combat.  I'm a very well-geared Shaman, and a hit of this magnitude represents about 75% of my Self-buffed HP.<br />
<br />
Now, unless they are Snare-Root immune... I haven't seen many 1220 hitters mitigating snare, have you?<br />
<br />
Druids, Bards and Necromancers are able to Snare-kite in GoD.   Soloing for Shamans in GoD is no longer feasibly possible.<br />
<br />
In addition, SOE has given us no new direct heals to compensate for this like the current 1925 point Sylvan Infusion, which is reportedly under investigation to be upgraded to 2100 points her cast.  SOE has, by a lack of action, reduced Shamans from third rate, to 4th rate or lower healers.  (Currently I would argue a Paladin is a superior secondary <br />
healer than a Shaman is, if by no other means than by their group healing abilities, and the drastically shorter casting time of their heals)  GoD mobs have absolutely furious damage output, so much so that a Plate melee who is used to tanking in Elemental Planes can find themselves very quickly killed by these new mobs, but to offset this DPS increase of the mobs they have had their HP reduced drastically compared to Luclin or PoP XP mobs.    They hit hard, and die fast.   This is in direct oppostition to the philosphy by which a Shaman operates.<br />
<br />
WE SUCCEED BASED UPON HOW LONG THE BATTLE LASTS, ESPECIALLY WHEN SOLOING. <br />
<br />
Shamans have more &quot;staying power&quot; by right of our damage mitigation by slowing and mana-regen capacities. The longer a fight, XP encounter or even a PVP Duel lasts, is to our favour as we can maintain our moderate levels of damage output for extremely long, possibly indeffinite lengths of time. <br />
<br />
We are a Class designed by thought, or by accident, to be creeping juggernauts of destruction. Unfortunately we are being thrust into a world based upon quick, bloody fights that are over in 30 seconds. Even slowed 75% without mitigation, a GoD mob far outclasses any means of healing we have.   Even a Druid cannot compete under these circumstances as a lone-healer for a melee against this class of mob.<br />
<br />
SOE is juggling the fact that they have created a world populated by Warriors, Shadowknights and Paladins with 10,000 Hitpoints.   In order to make it possible for a Mob to kill them, they needed to create an environment where the abilities of a Cleric are not always sufficient to keep one of them standing.<br />
<br />
In order to give a Shaman a fighting chance of being a suitable healer for a GoD group, we would need a Slow even MORE powerful than 75%.   Unfortunately, this can NEVER happen.    We slow in three separate capacities, for soloing, for XP groups, and for Raiding.    While, for arguements sake, an 85% or 90% slow would make it possible for us to solo in GoD, it would prove SO unbalancing in a Raiding environment as to unbalance the game beyond repair.   Imagine slowing a Velious Dragon by 90%?   <br />
<br />
A Shaman could solo NTOV under those circumstances.<br />
<br />
Slowing has always been an incredibly powerful skill, regardless of what Class uses it.  SOE has attempted to remove the stranglehold slowing has held upon the game by implementing Mitigation, Immunity and vastly improved Mob melee ability.   Unfortunalely we cannot be upgraded to meet these new requirement without ruining previous expansions completely and reducing encounter that are already easy to the level of foolishness.<br />
<br />
Have any of you given any thought to what Balance of the Nihil is going to do to the Emporer Ssra fight? It will be trivialized even further, to a point where a Shaman, a handful of Enchanters, 3-4 Clerics, 1 Warrior and about 5 assist DPS could beat this mob.   A mob that was at one time seen as being unfairly difficult by guilds.<br />
<br />
SOE has stuck to the philosphy that Slowing requires us to have weaker healing properties than Druids to balance the overall healing powers of the two classes, but have since been forced to de-tune slowing overall as a tool in the game without raising the level of our healing powers.  Effectively, they have, by lack of attention, made Shaman weaker healers in this expansion AND weaker slowers.  We have lost on both accounts.<br />
<br />
SOE either has to look at our healing prowess and improve it, or address our slowing and improve that, somehow.  <br />
<br />
Balance of the Nihil *could* be a solution, but I have yet to know, as I have no way of testing this spell as I do not have it yet.    The availability of spells so far in GoD is discouraging to say the least.  The only easy spell to attain does absolutely NOTHING to aid our current problems. (Breath of Trushar) Or, SOE needs to do something I even dare to suggest, which is thinking outside the box once again.  Perhaps it's time SOE looked at giving Shamans a 3rd means by which to assist our damage mitigation abilities, possibly a Cripple-like spell that will mitigate or block the &quot;per-hit&quot; damage a mob could do per attack.  Possibly a Spell that would block a 1200-hitting mob from landing a blow for over 750 Damage, not unlike how the Warrior Defensive Discipline which allows all blows to be mitigated by 60%.<br />
<br />
In summary, I have no solution to the plight of the Shaman, I'm left seeing us as an out-dated class.  We're Horse-mounted Cavalry in a world where all the mob have Gattling Guns.   Shamans are indeed a one-trick pony, but our trick isn't working anymore and I don't know how to fix it.    Both the shaman community, and SOE can both realize that there is a &quot;hole&quot; in the Shaman class, but so far no one knows how to fill it.<br />
<br />
I would invite discussion on this.   I would love to discuss these matters with a Dev, Brenlo, other Shamans, ANYONE who is willing to listen and contribute beyond simply claiming we need to be repaired now, or else.   To be truthfully honest, I would not be surprised to see Slowing, as a skill, to be absent in EQ2.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">If we go on the premise that shaman have slowing and secondary healing as their primary role, another option would be be not to have new heal as such, but have a spell that acted as a damage mitigator for a period of time. Sort of like a mini-defensive and a mini-evasive. Have them set at a 10-20% value and last for 30 seconds. These would then essentially be inverse HoTs, but ones that would scale according to the dps being put out by the mob. That would give shaman a unique role and would make them a highly desirable element in groups. This would also be consistent with the view of shaman as a buffing class. Used on hard hitting mobs these spells would also put out corresponding amounts of hate, meaning that some skill and strategy would be required when using them.<br />
<br />
They could be scaled according to level. For example, have the 10% versions at level 55, 15% at 65 and 20% as ancient spells. The actual values would have to be adjusted for balance purposes of course, but you should get the general idea.<br />
<br />
As for removing Nihil, IMO that is a shortsighted idea.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">The value of slow to an encounter is related to how long the combat goes.<br />
Back in Kunark Era, combat with mobs would often go 2 full minutes with a mob.<br />
At present, combat with most xp mobs only goes about 1 minute long.<br />
In plane of earth, mobs die at or before the last tick of Bane when I tag Malos on the inc, and Slow asap when spells refresh.<br />
Mobs in LDON live for about 30 seconds in normal, and about 1 minute in hard.<br />
Mobs in GoD (Vxed and below) live for about 1 minute as well.<br />
The shorter time a mob is alive, the less total damage is prevented by the slow.<br />
As such, the increased speed of a single kill is highly reducing the effectiveness of our slows.<br />
<br />
Back in Kunark, mobs hit for about 250-300 if they hit really really hard, and named stuff hit for up to 600 (like the dragons).<br />
Chloroblast heals for 428 a cast, and superior healing for 583, and torpor heals 300 a tick.<br />
Nowadays, mobs hit for 700-1200 if they hit really really hard, and single group killable named stuff hit for up to 2000+.<br />
Tnargs only heals for 1300, and Quiessense still only heals for 300 a tick as our 2 main heals.<br />
Mobs are hitting for 2.5-4 times more now than they did.<br />
Shaman heals used to heal double what a mob would melee in a single swing, and our heal over time could keep up with the average dps of a slowed mob.<br />
Currently shaman heals heal only slightly more than the melee output of a mob in a single swing, and Q will only slow down the speed at which a tank will die to a slowed mob, it won't actually heal the tank in combat like it once did.<br />
<br />
To summarize the problems of the shaman going into GoD (and even touch on high end POP) IMO:<br />
-mob DPS scaling up much faster than healing amounts are scaling up.  if mobs are hitting for 4 times as much, we need to be able to heal 4 times as much.<br />
-slow mitegation prevents shaman from being the main healer in a group as they used to be able to.  Shaman rely on slow + efficient heals to heal.  Large sized high efficiency heals are what allow druids and clerics to be healers.  Clerics have complete healing and supernal XXX.  Druids have their infusion and renewal spells.  When slow mitegation occurs, our heals are no longer useful enough to allow us to actually be main healers anymore.  You don't have zones where all healing spells are reduced in effectiveness by 25%-75%.<br />
-very short combat prevents shaman from doing any forms of efficient damage.  Disease dots are useless.  2+ minute duration is 100% worthless in fights that go 30 seconds - 1 minute total (including debuffin time).  Poison dots pull too much aggro to use unless the shaman feels like becoming main tank for a significant portion of the fight (when a mob hits for 1200, any tanking more than zero seconds is significant).  Shaman rain spells are highly resisted (usually 1/3 of all waves are resisted).  The shaman ice nuke takes too long to cast, and has a very poor mana efficiency.  The shaman poison nuke is too small to be noticable and has very poor mana efficiency.<br />
-active mana regeneration vs short combat.  With shorter and shorter combat, shaman have less and less of their time available for casting cannibalize to get back their mana.  When combats go for 2 minutes, and only the first 20 seconds are needed to malo, slow, dot, dot the mob, the remaining 1:40 can be used to wince and regain the used mana.  When combats go for 30 seconds - 1 minute, and the first 20 seconds are used to malo, slow, and dot/nuke once, the remaining 10-40 seconds doesn't leave much time to regain mana as we once were able to.  Ancient canni addresses this, by only requiring us to wince one time every 3 ticks, as opposed to chaining c4 to get the same mana regen.  But making it very very highly inaccessible does nothing to address the problems of the class.  Making the spell much more highly accessible would be a fix for this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Except that you can cast Nihil in about one fifth the time it takes to cast Malos and click TA.

Not to say that this is not indeed the main use of the spell, but take a look at what slow mitigation does to Nihil. (Note: we should really go get some accurate numbers for the levels of slow mitigation - going with 25/50/75 %)<br />
<br />
25% mitigation (mostly effective) -&gt; 60% * 0.75 = 45%, meaning 55% MOB damage instead of 40%.<br />
<br />
50% mitigation (partially effective) -&gt; 60% * 0.5 = 30%, meaning 70% MOB damage instead of 40%.<br />
<br />
75% mitigation (slightly effective) -&gt; 60% * 0.25 = 15%, meaning 85% MOB damage instead of 40%.<br />
<br />
Given that Turgur's usefulness is already debatable on slow mitigating MOBs and given that the aggro on Nihil is pretty much the same as on Turgur's . . <br />
<br />
As someone else pointed out, adding a deaggro component to NIhil would make it much more usable as you could actually benefit from the cast time.<br />
I still would not like the spell all that much but it would at least be preferable to Turgur's for these fast fights.<br />
<br />
As is I can slow the MOB faster, slow it less, take a beating because I slow so early and then spend the mana I saved on Malos to heal myself I guess.<br />
Or I could Malos, then Turgur's, taking no aggro in the process and thus not waste mana on healing myself but slow later (though for more % - probably not much dufference overall) and for more mana.<br />
Or I could just skip slow and spend the mana on healing. If you have a charming enchanter this is probably your best option.<br />
<br />
What I want to say with all this rambling is, even in these short brutal fights the only thing Nihil clearly is superior for is for slowing the adds while Malos and Turgur's are recycling.<br />
For the main MOB the advantage, if any, is tiny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">I have to agree with Jen on Balance of the Nihil and I'll explain why it's often useless. Mobs in Ikkinz and many other zones where any buffing mobs are close will be pulled with 2 buffs on them. That's Resist Magic(sometimes) and Haste(usually) of some sort.<br />
<br />
Now when mobs have Resist Magic on them, Balance bounces quite a bit due to the low resist adjust(I have been requesting a -70+ resist mod since I first saw the spell and that's what this spell needs) while the innate MR of the mob might actually be kinda low. <br />
So in practice more often that not you will have to dispell the MR buff before Balance lands(60% Slow) *or* you cast malos, which will overwrite the MR buff and click the TA(75%). Dispell and Malos both will have the same effect and, if you have a TA, you will be slowing for 75% in the same time you'd be slowing the mob for 60% after a dispell.<br />
<br />
That means that using Malos/Slow will be preferable since you slow the mob with your best slow and you have it's innate resists lowered for DoTs/DDs.<br />
<br />
A fix for this:<br />
<br />
It's simple. Make Balance a 1 second cast, up the resist mod to -75 at least and keep the % it has.</div></div><hr />

Nihil is quicker only if<br />
- you can take the aggro<br />
AND<br />
- if the MOB does not need to be stripped of resist magic (see Giac's explanation above)<br />
AND<br />
- you do not have an opportunity to Malos while the MOB is incoming<br />
<br />
and even then it slows for a lesser percentage. That lesser percentage, while not too noticeable on slow mitigating MOBs means that Nihil prevents only half as much damage on fully slowable MOBs as Turgur's does.<br />
<br />
And this is why many of us are not all that excited about Nihil. It truly is a very situational spell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have 2 answers for this:  Druzzil's Disillusionment and Abashi.<br />
<br />
While Abashi is fairly rare, it's not hard to find the Ring of Vulak up to get a chance at having it drop.  Bards pulling is nothing uncommon now and whenever we're doing any trial with a bard I always tell the them to pull with dispell, especially on ikaav mobs.<br />
<br />
Also, you could cast Annul Magic on incoming and then Nihil.  Annul Magic is 75 mana and is affected by beneficial spell haste (even though it's a detrimental spell).  With Quickening of Mithaniel you can cast it in 2.8s.  They have the same range and by the time your gems repop you should be able to cast Nihil and not get aggro.<br />
<br />
It is a situational spell for the most part.  I only use it on kyv mobs and some mastruq mobs.</div></div><hr />

It would be great to see some “outside the box” thinking regarding mobs that are flagged immune to slow. Make them vulnerable in some other manner that Shaman can take advantage of.  <br />
Give us a new spell/ability that can only land on “immune to Slow” Mobs. Maybe a small nuke with a rapid cast time or a “spirit tap” where you take some essence from the mob and give it to your group.</div></div><hr />

Heh, have you ever fought Emp? You DO remember his little unmezzable friends right? The 3 pallies in the corner arent JUST wanking each other off. This is, of course, assuming Balance of Nihli actually landed on the magic immune mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">From the poll done before, the top 4 issues are:<br />
<br />
Slows [ 129 ]  13.67% <br />
Direct Damage [ 143 ]  15.15% <br />
Cannibalize and Manaregen [ 151 ] * 16.00% <br />
Healing [ 205 ]  21.72% <br />
<br />
<br />
Combined, this accounts for the top 65% of problems shaman currently feel need addressing.<br />
<br />
Do the 3 issues mentioned by Brenlo match up with this?<br />
<br />
1. Healing spells upgrades are rendered irrelevant due to the massive amount of damage Gates mobs dish out.<br />
<br />
Yes - healing was listed as our biggest issue (22% of votes) by quite a margin. This is a combination of Tnarg's getting left behind, and the minor upgrade to our heal over time being insignificant given the amount mobs hit for (compare upgrades shaman have had for Torpor vs Clerics' upgrades to their heal over time spells since torpor came out)<br />
<br />
Personal Suggestions: <br />
Upgrade BoT to ~450/tick, increase mana cost proportionately.<br />
New upgrade for Tnarg's (or upgrade existing) to 1800 base heal, upgrade mana cost proportionately.<br />
<br />
2. Slow is most often resisted and when it does stick it I most likely not a factor at all in combat as the fights are over quickly.<br />
<br />
Slowing is our 4th biggest issue (14% of votes), its significant but not right up there at the top. A more desirable slow would<br />
 - land more reliably (i.e. like the new GoD slow). If I get a resist on LDoN I won't bother to recast - mob will be 50% dead by then.<br />
 - slow for 70-75% (to uphold our position as best slowers)<br />
 - fast cast time and short recast time so we can slow adds too.<br />
<br />
Personal Suggestions: <br />
Upgrade nihil to 70% slow, 4 second recast. Duration is fine as is. This will allow us to slow mobs effectively, and before they are half dead.<br />
<br />
<br />
3. The Gates DoT’s similarly are ineffective in Gates combat due to the quickness of the battles and low damage output.<br />
<br />
The new cannibalise is a bigger issue than the new DoT. Mana regen is our 2nd biggest problem (16% of votes) at the moment. Cannibalise is a unique and core shaman ability, and as such we would like to see this spell being reasonably accessable for everyone, not an ancient spell. Canni 4 is very old now and all shaman could desperately use an upgrade.<br />
<br />
We all agree the new DoT is worthless for reasons stated above, one suggestion is that this is converted to a disease based nuke, which would address our 3rd major issue (15% of votes), DD spells. Currently these are inefficient, either slow casting or low damage, and lack flexibility (only cold and poison based, with no resist modifications either)<br />
<br />
Personal Suggestions:<br />
Change disease DoT to a nuke, fire or disease based check with 5-6  second cast time and 900-1100 dmg. Make this the ancient.<br />
<br />
Make the new cannibalise a standard spell, not ancient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">Easy fix (think someone else brought this stuff up before).<br />
<br />
Make the GoD DoT a 1100 pt nuke and make it our ancient spell.  Swap the GoD HoT for a fast cast heal that is an upgrade to tnarg's.  Lastly, make the -40% adjustment on our GoD slow -55 and drop the recast time down a bit more for shamans who do not have TA on multi pulls.  The only thing that really needs to be carefully balanced in that list is the value of the heal so as not to make the changes overpowering.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's incorrect.<br />
<br />
The Emporer is not 100% MR, he's just got very HIGH MR.<br />
<br />
When the initial Mob-resist changes were implemented to allow DOT's to land and be stacked on raid level mobs, the resistances of raid level mobs were greatly reduced for several days.   During that time, my guild was able to slow the Emporer with Ranger Epics and even Turgur's and trust me, when Turgur's was on the Emporer he was foolishly easy.<br />

My point is that Cloud of Gummus is already gimping him with a 40% DR slow.    Adjusting Nihil to being a -75 MR check lure like some are suggesting will most likely make this a landable spell.<br />
<br />
And to Flabbo....<br />
<br />
Yes, I've fought the Emporer, probably more times than you have.   My guild was the first guild on my Server to defeat this mob and I've done the fight so many times I got sick of it.<br />
<br />
So yes, I recall the Lockdown mobs of which you speak and there's 4 lockdown and 4 mezzable mobs... not 3.   I also recall that at a time Pre-65 Pre-lightning reflexes and Pre-Innate Defense I was able to Offtank one of the Lockdown Mobs by myself.  At that time it took 4 enchanters, 1 per mob, casting Bliss to keep them mezzed as that mez has a slow reset time, whereas now a single enchanter can mez all 4 mobs with the PoP level Mezzes.<br />
<br />
At this point any Melee with decent gear/aa's could offtank those mobs.<br />
They could even just be killed quickly now and allowed to respawn.<br />
<br />
(You do know that 2 of the 4 respawn within a couple minutes while the other two are on a 10-15 minute timer, right?)</div></div><hr />

<br />
buffing - i think stat buffs need to be looked at, as the game progresses it looks like people will be maxing all important stats sooner and sooner, meaning buffs like sta, agi, and diaku are useless for many.  I'm sure the effects of our stat buffs were meant to decrease as we lvl, but were they ever intended to be useless?<br />
<br />
slowing - i have only spent a few hours in god so far so i dont know much about specific god issues.  But I know that beastlord's being able to slow faster than shaman (due to innate hybrid spell haste) is a sore spot.<br />
<br />
wishlist<br />
<br />
cripple - i would like to see another usefull shaman only debuff which could seperate shaman from the pack as the best debuffer.  As it stands our best debuff in that line is only usefull on raids, and it is also shared by enchanters.<br />
<br />
avatar AA - i think it would be cool to see an aa group avatar ability, stats wouldnt have to be the same as FA, i think aa group 60 avatar would be fine.  This could also help shaman stacking on raids, mgb avatar would rule.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">That's incorrect.<br />
<br />
The Emporer is not 100% MR, he's just got very HIGH MR.<br />
<br />
When the initial Mob-resist changes were implemented to allow DOT's to land and be stacked on raid level mobs, the resistances of raid level mobs were greatly reduced for several days.   During that time, my guild was able to slow the Emporer with Ranger Epics and even Turgur's and trust me, when Turgur's was on the Emporer he was foolishly easy.<br />
<br />
My point is that Cloud of Gummus is already gimping him with a 40% DR slow.    Adjusting Nihil to being a -75 MR check lure like some are suggesting will most likely make this a landable spell.<br />
So worst case, a -75 resist check on Nihil, a nodrop spell, might trivialize one part of a 4 expansion old encounter? And you think this is bad for what reason?<br />
I am not sure upping the resist modifier on Nihil is a good idea but worrying about how it might affect a single 4 expansions old encounter is silly.<br />

Lure of Lightning(-300 MR) has no hope of landing on the Emperor, a -75 MR will never stick.<br />
<br />
I love how you are talking about Bliss, when that spell didn't even exist back then. The only spells working on the mezzables back then were Rapture and later on Ancient Rapture. And yet, this does have nothing to do with Balance getting a -75 mod.<br />

Back to the point at hand people.<br />

They cannot improve slowing without risk of trivializing the game.<br />

They cannot pump up our heals and make us into Druids without unbalancing Shaman/Druid classes in our favour.<br />

<br />
What a laughable attempt...<br />
<br />
The Emperor was turned *magic immune* almost 2 years ago, when they removed the DT. There was a very brief time when his resists were screwed up(was fixed immediately). This happened long after highend guilds had stopped killing him for VT keys.<br />
<br />
You seemed overly worried about a spell trivializing old content for somebody killing Quarm, a mob that has been farmed by some of us for over 8 months...<br />
<br />
Balance of the Nihil needs a -75 MR resist check, period. This won't fix every issue we have, but it will be more viable as a pre-Slow. Coupled with a biger HoT(which needs to be 500+ a tick or it won't be of any use) and an upgrade to our fast heal(1 sec cast time, 5 sec recast, 1800 HPs for 600-650 mana), this will be going a long way towards balancing us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">1 sec cast time, 5 sec recast, 1800 HPs for 600-650 mana  - Giac<br />
<br />
1 second?  Cleric heals aren't this fast.<br />
<br />
Even with the 5 second recast that's unreasonable.<br />
<br />
I can channel a 1 second cast through ANYTHING.   Try it yourself by chaining Malicious Decay through hard aggro, it's easy.<br />
<br />
At 1 second, it would almost be a guaranteed heal, which would give us an unfair advantage over other healing classes if we could do it for even 1k instead of your proposed 1800.  Nevermind the 5 second recast - if you had all your shamans casting a 1 second back up heal on a warrior, you could almost trivialize any encounter.  The casting time is put into place for a reason - so that there COULD be a possibility of failure.  Changing the healing time will only unbalance everything even more, only this time Druids will become obsolete as the 2nd best healers.<br />
<br />
Now lets take a 2nd look at your proposal with Healing Adept (10%) and the Quarm Shield (30% Healing Focus) - your 1800 point heal just became a 2520 point heal that could potentially crit for 5k+.  In one second.  The mana cost is inconsequential - and you as a shaman should know this.<br />
<br />
Your proposal is absolutely absurd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">My only problem with slow in GoD is that 90% of the boss mobs so far are unslowable.  As if PoTime wasn't enough of a snoozefest for a Shaman already...<br />

If you are going to make me useless on boss mobs as a SLOWER for heavens sake at LEAST make me useful as a PRIEST class and give me something better to heal with.  As a high end Shaman in GoD I am becoming more useless the further we get without having a heal that heals MORE hitpoints and has a slightly faster casting time.</div></div><hr />

If you wanna attack each other have fun in a different thread, i would ask that you atleast respect this one  thread that we know brenlo is reading and not fill it with flaming and bickering.<br />
<br />
<br />
Nihil is quicker only if<br />
- you can take the aggro<br />
AND<br />
- if the MOB does not need to be stripped of resist magic (see Giac's explanation above)<br />
AND<br />
- you do not have an opportunity to Malos while the MOB is incoming<br />
<br />
and even then it slows for a lesser percentage. That lesser percentage, while not too noticeable on slow mitigating MOBs means that Nihil prevents only half as much damage on fully slowable MOBs as Turgur's does.<br />
<br />
And this is why many of us are not all that excited about Nihil. It truly is a very situational spell.<br />
<br />
Well, taking aggro has nothing to do with speed of a slow landing and it also has nothing to do with your chance of casting malos on a inc mob. You dont cast malos, you cast this and from the people that actualy  HAVE this spell, they all seem to like it alot. I dont have it so i cant say for sure, but im telling you direct feedback i have read from the shaman on this board. 99% of everyone i have talked to with this spell say its great and they have given examples as to how and why tot he point where im now excited to get it. <br />
<br />
But your absolutly correct, its ieasy to tell right away this is a situational spell, but i think you might be not seeing that its design is to be a situational spell to begin with. This spell  its not meant to replace turgurs, its meant to be a exp group replacement and for that it can serve its purpose well. The only thing i dont like about it is how much the slow is. I just dont see how its over powering to make it 65-75%.<br />
<br />
<br />
So me, im excited, i hear good thigns from people that actualy have it and i see in daily situations where i would love it.; Am i going to use it on a boss mob? MAybe for a pre slow, but not if i can land tugurs, but for what it was obviously designed for, i think its not bad.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also though i have heard people saying that mobs are buffed fo MR. Where is the proof of this? Im not trying to discredit, i just would like some evidence so i can know what you do.<br />

<br />
May I introduce you to a class that is outhealing us. We call them Paladins over here and that's their best fast heal http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4894&amp;source=Test<br />
<br />
A 1 second heal with a 5 second recast will give me the chance to throw it in right after a Slow resist so that I can try again and go back to using it again if I get resisted. <br />
The Healing per second chain healing this is no threat to either the Druid nor the Cleric heals, but it will give me a significant edge over the Paladin spell for a higher mana cost.<br />
<br />
Think about the impact of your words, before you say something is unreasonable as what we will get will be based on what we can agree on. This requested heal of mine, won't make us the preferred healer just the same way as people don't pick Paladins over Druids for heals.<br />
<br />
Edit: Just to correct your math. A 1800 heal + AHA(19%) and the Whorl(30%) will result in a max crit of 4482 HP heal. That's the max possible crit. You crit 16% of your heals, nothing that you can count on.<br />
<br />
The average heal would look like this: 1800 + AHA(19%) + AHG(16%) + Whorl(30%, random) = 2709<br />
<br />
Sylvan Infusion in comparison will look like this: 2100 + AHA(19%) + AHG(16%) + Whorl(30%, random) = 3161</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately this is not a perfect world.  I know what my idea of a shaman is, I know the role they play in the game, I do not know what is in our spell guys head as far as the direction he sees the class moving in.  I will try to find out what that direction is and pass it along. <br />
<br />
As for concerns, the first I will pass along is healing. I will see if this is what is intended or if there was an oversight.  As soon as I know, you will know.  <br />
<br />
Keep ironing out these thoughts and ideas and I will keep reading this thread.<br />
<br />
Brenlo<br />
<br />
I think a short paragraph or two about our past, present, and future as shamans and what we are to the game from the SOE design core would go a long way to clearing up any misunderstandings that may have arrisen since the days of 'the vision'.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for addressing &quot;The History&quot; as I recall the last 4 (or is it 5) years:<br />
<br />
In the past, we were always pretty much a 'support role' for a group with our primary role being as incoming damage mitigation and outgoing melee damage enhancement with good secondary healing and magical direct damage.<br />
<br />
With the advent of Kunark, we shifted a bit to having better healing (hello Torpor!) and more outgoing magical damage.   But at the same time we backslid on the outgoing melee damage enchancement (hello stat and haste caps!).<br />
<br />
With Velious things pretty much stayed the same for us, we got some enhancements (new cold nukes!) but there wasn't much that could be done about the diminishing returns on stat buffs and maximums.<br />
<br />
For Luclin things started to get strange.  We got some improvements to our outgoing damage again, and we saw the advent of our first 70% CH spell.   But as many of the maximums were relaxed for capped damage and stats we saw less effect from our new Stat bonus spells.  Additionally, the creation of the BST class showed that the real benifit for outgoing melee damage enhancement lay in the +ATK bonus spells and since most melee in Luclin had obtained gear that would max them out even with the smallest of buffing.<br />
<br />
Planes of Power blew the top off the old stat maximums and just as rapidly the melee caught up again.  Once and for all it was shown that the spells that melee wanted were +ATK, +Speed, and +HP since those stats had the best effects for them.   <br />
<br />
The shaman lines of spells received very little in the way of aids to these.   Stacking issues that had been plaguing us had finally been resolved but only STA and Focus line proved to be of any need.   Our Second Level 75% CH (called Khura's Mending) would have a nice addition but this is where it went 'strange'.  That spell never left Beta and while the other priests all received upgrades to their healing lines the directed healing never increased for shamans.  And while they did receive a version of Torpor that didn't snare it's target it really is only a stopgap and the existing Cleric versions were already better and over-wrote it. <br />
<br />
Expansions since PoP have shown the same trends.   Little or no growth in the healing lines while other Priests and now Priest-Hybrids have grown in healing and cure powers while there has been little to no way for the shaman to keep pace.   We've received some growth in the outgoing damage department with DoTs that dont break root and swarm pets (ignoring the broken second generation swarm pets that replaces instead of supliments the better first generation) but our original functionality of Outgoing Melee Damage enhancement has been completely handed off to +ATK based spells that we never receive.   And let us not even mention +END.  That spell as a ward is giggled about at every raid where we cast it.   Druids and Clerics both deride it at their leasure.<br />

Who is talking about using it on myself?<br />
<br />
This will help me keep the tank alive for the time it takes to slow the mob. I'll repeat it, the Healing per second is inferior to Druid and Cleric heals. I am not even touching the efficiency.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">Brenlo- Thank you, thank you, thank you. Communication is key. <br />
<br />
SOE controls what a shaman will be, and as long as there is a role that makes a shaman desired in the new content, I will be fine. <br />
<br />
Personally, I agree with the three issues laid out above. Shaman were balanced for Kunark by giving them slow casting high mana drain spells and weak active healing. That makes shaman generally unwelcome in Gates groups, which need strong tanking, fast dps, and fast healing. Adding to our healing abilities to permit Shaman to be secondary healers in GoD would be sufficent. For example, if a shaman could keep a cleric alive for one round if the cleric got aggro, this would be a great help.<br />
<br />
PS: Can we throw up a moderated sticky thread for Brenlo and SOE to communicate wit hteh shaman commnity without getting flamed?<br />

We do have three MAJOR concerns.  They must ALL be dealt with together, not separately, if we are to retain a viable role in GoD.<br />
<br />
PoP and hard LDoN pushed the envelope of the shaman stereotype.  GoD has broken it to pieces.<br />
<br />
YES we need new, faster, more powerful healing abilities.  YES, we need to be able to slow more effectively.  YES, we need to be able to contribute fast, effective damage.  How exactly this might be done is something we can debate, and that the designers can deal with.<br />
<br />
All we are asking for is parity.  If we once had it in PoP, it is gone in GoD.<br />

I am not flaming if you think that my statement could have been mistunderstood, I have no problem with that. On the other hand, I thought it was quite obvious what I meant, since the main thing we have been talking about is that we have to chain tnarg's on our tanks after a resisted Slow. We all know that situation.<br />
<br />
If I could cast Slow and in case of a resist, throw that 1 second heal on the tank to mitigate some of the damage he has been taking from the unslowed mob, allowing me to cast another slow hoping it lands without the fear that he's dead by then, would go a long way imo.<br />
<br />
Feel free to disagree.<br />
<br />
Honestly, Gangaskan, I don't understand why you are disagreeing. You want a bigger base heal, my proposal is just that, a bigger base heal. The fact that it has a fast cast time and a moderate recast is an attempt to counteract our slow acting in general. The recast is needed to ensure the heal isn't too powerful or even threatening to Druid and Cleric heals.</div></div><hr />

A fast casting heal with a longer recast WILL allow us to keep the tank alive while we cast that second slow.<br />
A 3 sec heal would be to slow if you take 1800hp healed as base.<br />

But the good thing is that we can disagree as it is the spell guy at SoE that has to figure all the pro's and con's out in the end. the more opinions the better but please keep all aspects in mind (and we do not all have a TA, some have to actually cast that slow)</div></div><hr />

It's that you get less out of a smaller heal when it's boosted by 10% from healing adept, vs a bigger heal when it's boosted by 10%.  A 1000hp heal becomes 1100hp..  A 1800hp heal becomes 1980hp heals.  100hp vs 180hp total gain.  Healing gift and improved healing just intensify the difference.</div></div><hr />

I understood what you probably meant at the time, just your english is lacking. Focus effects work the same, nor do their percentages change -- you are now simply reinforcing that a bigger heal does indeed heal for more.  I agree with you that any heal upgrade that they give us should be around 1800pts or so.</div></div><hr />

Balance of the Nihil is a damn fine spell.  Could it use improvement?  Yes.  Add a &quot;cinder jolt&quot; component.  Make it so it's at least as powerful as the beastlord slow.  <br />
<br />
But like the guy on page 2 said.. yeah, if you have a TA, it's not as sexy.  To me, a TA isn't as sexy now, so I got something else (since I can chain cast slow just as effectively now).  The slow could use some work but it DEFINITELY has its places (P5 Inny fight, hard LDONs, vxed/tipt etc... hard hitting mobs that need to be slowed quick).<br />
<br />
Also, the spell is a beauty when mixed with VP.  Malicious decay on incoming, cast Balance, then VP the mob off you.  Not something you want to do in a raid, and not something you want to do without telling your group what you're doing, but it works and it's good stuff.<br />

Umm, you could just malicious decay, then VP, take less damage overall and debuff it at your leisure.<br />
<br />
I still do not see any reason for keeping Nihil up other then getting around the recast on Turgur's - it may be a tiny bit better in some situations (and a lot worse in others) but I cannot see why anone would give up a spell slot for it.

62.5% or 15%, depending on how you do the math, there was a huge thread here a while back about that, but I get your sentiment.<br />
<br />
What I would like to know is, why can't people defend spells around here without people treating them like complete idiots? <br />
<br />
&quot;You still have Turgur's memmed alongside Nihil, right?&quot; <br />
<br />
Nowhere have I said Balance replaces Turgurs, not one single time.  I haven't even suggested that it might be possible.  I like Balance for exactly the reason you mentioned -- if I get a bounced Turgurs, I can cast Balance immediately, or vice versa.  <br />
<br />
Once I get some spell haste, and Malos isn't 5 seconds of my life, then I might unmem Balance.  Once I get a TA, I'll probably keep Balance up where Turgurs used to be.  <br />
<br />
It's not the end all be all of spells.  As a very capable and knowledgeable shaman officer in my guild likes to say, &quot;The new spell is nice, but it doesn't mean we can't get it done the 'old-fashioned way'.&quot;  And he's exactly right.  I'm not suggesting that Balance of the Nihil is the second coming, just that it would be outright stupidity to suggest taking it from the game altogether.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The healing adjustments that are in development on test will most likely include an increase in the power of shaman Heal over Time spells.  The healing changes in general are aimed at significantly reducing the number of situations where a cleric is the only viable healer in 6 man group situations.  While we certain maintain that clerics should be the best at healing, it is unfair to expect them to be the only adequate healer in a single group setting.<br />
<br />
The frequency of slow immune NPCs in Gates is also being looked at, and there is the possibility of some adjustment in certain areas if we find it necessary.  Although this will likely only apply to a few specific areas where the concentration is especially high.<br />

<br />
Technically, the innate spell haste hybrids got at some point in the game only applies to detrimental spells. If for some reason, Paladins had 1 second/5second recast heals in order to be able to cast them between swings and thus not losing too much DPS, that would only be an argument for us getting the same kind of heal spell(albeit more powerful being a real priest).<br />
The Shaman loses his effectivness due to slow spells and the game doesn't allow for slow acting anymore. I used to work around this innate weakness of my class when you could insta refresh your spell gems with a clicky. That was the biggest nerf to the Shaman class ever, when they took it out of the game.</div></div><hr />

Clearly we are getting the attention we have wanted.....<br />
<br />
Now what to do with it....<br />
<br />
I think we have addressed with the number of posts why we need what we need.  IF we get an effective slow that compansates in a group setting, I will be happy.  IF we are adequant in the healing dept we should be set.  <br />
<br />
If we can some how balance the aggro issue with the new SCS and healing, than I think we are playing our class the way it was intended.  Really haven't gotten much feedback on this, but I figure if this was tweaked to the point that we aren't taking as much aggro on our main roles we could play back up healer just fine. <br />
<br />
IF the dev team decides to change the NPCs rather than the PCs, I say more power to them.  At least it brings things more in line with our abilities.  <br />
<br />
I am glad we came together on these points and got some attention.  <br />
<br />
I am not sure it is the final answer, but the heal over time concept is a good start.  IF it could be made group so we might be able to MGB it, that would be better.  <br />
<br />
I don't think it is a win for us all yet, but it will take time to see where this goes.....</div></div><hr />

<br />
what this class needs is not an improved breath of trushar or AA's and gear to effect heal over time spells.  sorry, this will be entertaining for a bit like crit dots were entertaining for a bit, but it will not affect the balance of our class in relation to modern game content, which is what this argument is all about anyway.</div></div><hr />

A significant improved HoT 'may' lessen shamans healing problems a bit. But the central issue still is, that shaman heal per second or 'burst heal potential' is insufficient for current high-end content (mainly GoD at the moment, but not necessarily limited to it).<br />
<br />
I don't see, how that issue could be addressed only via HoTs.<br />
<br />
And to repeat it:<br />
ALL spells necessary to address those issues should be available to all shamans willing to hunt for it in reasonable accessible zones - so no ancients for central shaman spells like canni please. That was a bad idea(tm).</div></div><hr />

       I'm shocked to watch that SoE is not aware that heal over time are outdated . Even if you double the HP healed by Q ,what the point of a double(up to quading) 1300 hiting monster with 640 proc. Plus add that monster mitigate slow.<br />

Remember, we never thought that it was going to be possible or even implimented until we actually saw a GoD aa that allowed DoT crits, so the coding IS a possibilty.<br />
Now granted this doesnt really affect the situation were in with regard to our healing overall. However, there is a good chance that it could, when combined with an upgrade to our HoT line overall, and a possible upgrade to our blast heal, that it would make us rival druids in healing ability, but in a different way than a giant leap to our blast heal or adding a CH to our lineup(CH's hold no intrest to me or 99% of the Crucible). It would also still let shaman feel like shaman and not gimped druids (in respect to healing) as it would be a unique ability for us.<br />
Just a thought.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think a Heal over time would be good enough. If they gave us a real one.<br />
<br />
Look at druids biggest heal. It is what 4650 hps healed or some such? And 10 second cast time.<br />
<br />
Something fair With our slows would be to give us something comparable Over time. Like 1150 a tick healed. For 4 ticks. It would still run over 24 seconds. (Or with proper focus and AA would run for 36-42 seconds) for a 36 second run it would heal 6900 damage. But in the same 36 seconds a druid could get of three of thier Big heals. (Okay okay) would be 37 seconds with the 2.5 refresh. <br />
<br />
We would have a heal that we would be needed to use. And yes it would be better than clerics. But in one aspect of healing that wouldnt be so bad. They completly dominate us in all other aspects of healing. (Plus the little buggers can bash Grr!) It would be overhealing on many ticks if not used properly Just like a druid can mistime thier heal and not get full effect out of it.<br />
<br />
But combine that with a 1750 upgraded blast heal for shaman and we would be viable healers.  <br />
<br />
Just an idea. <br />

The downside on HoTs is that you can't stack them to compensate more damage done. Aka no stacking for more then one shaman.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u134"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p134">I fail to see why shamans should heal so much worse than druids- I didn't buy that argument when the incomplete heals went in and I don't buy it now.  It's okay for other classes to get a slow very close to ours, but not okay for our heals to come close to others?  I'm a bazaar player and even in my game world Q is useful only up to tier 3 trash, assuming the tank has the buff slots, which they usually do not.<br />
<br />
What would I like to see?<br />
- 4k upgraded incomplete heal. Technically this should be the same as druids get since there's no valid reason to separate this spell, just like superior healing and chloroblast can be scribed by both classes, but it would at least be decent.<br />
- 1750 blast heal for less mana and faster cast than druid version.<br />
<br />
After years of playing and loving my shaman, it hurts to wake up one day as you move on to more difficult content (LDoN hards in our case) and realize you can no longer bring the shaman along, you must have a cleric.  I don't like having to borrow a someone's cleric just to be able to play with my friends- this is plain broken and needs to be addressed.<br />
<br />
But, based on what they did to monks, it probably won't be.  Warrior/Cleric/Chanter = Velious Part II, the Revenge! Long live the Holy Trinity- do us a favor now and pare the classes down from 17 to 3 if that's what your aim is.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u135"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p135">Well, to me - here's the assumption you would have to make as a programmer.<br />
<br />
In practical application - yes, you can probably safely assume that any group forming without a shaman, will have at least a bard, beastlord, or enchanter along as well to cover slows - BUT - you cannot absolutely guarantee that the group WILL have some form of slowing. Chances are they will, but it's not a hard certainty.<br />
<br />
With a shaman added in, you can absolutely guarantee the group also has a slower.  Which is a very bad thing for us currently because our heals (even HoTs in their current incarnation if we cast them on the MT on incoming) simply cannot keep a tank alive long enough for us to get a mob debuffed and slowed before 1/2 of the group is wiped... and once we DO manage to get it debuffed and slowed, and start scrambling to patch heal, spamming Tnargs over and over, we're so far behind the curve that we can't ever hope to catch up, just scramble (often vainly) to keep someone alive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u136"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p136">The deal is they split up the healing. Druids get the big direct heals and we get the HoT's.  This is how it is, there is no point trying to butt your head against it cause <br />
<br />
#1 alot of shaman wont support you<br />
#2 This is already in place in the game.<br />
<br />
The only thing we can ask for is a new quick heal.<br />
<br />
With that said, realize what &quot;The Spell Guy&quot; just posted not 1 page ago<br />
<br />
The healing adjustments that are in development on test will most likely include an increase in the power of shaman Heal over Time spells. The healing changes in general are aimed at significantly reducing the number of situations where a cleric is the only viable healer in 6 man group situations. While we certain maintain that clerics should be the best at healing, it is unfair to expect them to be the only adequate healer in a single group setting.<br />
<br />
They have communicated their end goal, which i highlighted in bold, and im happy with that. We have communication, we know their healing vision for us so lets give them a chance to do some things. Watch lucy for a bit then we can see whats going on.</div></div><hr />

Increasing our HoT will do NOTHING.  That is NOT the problem.<br />

We need better blast healing power.  Substantially better.  <br />
<br />
I don't care if I get an improved HoT or not.  Ok, obviously I'll use it if I get it, but a significant blast heal is what is missing.  <br />
<br />
As the impact of slow diminishes, the disparity in shaman/druid healing power (remember, they used to be the same) should diminish.  <br />
<br />
And both need to be much better to get into the same ballpark with clerics.</div></div><hr />

Ryan said our HOT spells &quot;most likely&quot; will include an increase.  (Somehow this doesn't reassure me in the least nor does it really address what we've been talking about...)  Unless he's talking about a HoT that lasts 1 tick and does about 4k a tick, of course...<br />
<br />
He goes on to say Clerics shouldn't HAVE to be the only adequate healer in a single group setting.  Notice, he didn't say &quot;GATES&quot; single group setting.  (Again, I'm not feeling many warm fuzzies here...)  This could just as easily mean a BoT group or a Hard LDoN, etc...<br />
<br />
And lastly, he talks about the &quot;possibility&quot; of &quot;some&quot; adjustments in &quot;a few specific areas&quot; of Gates where the concentration is &quot;especially&quot; high in regard to slow immunity.  This sounds like to me they'll have the same number of these mobs, just &quot;maybe&quot; not in the concentraded spot.  This, in no way, has anything to do with our new slow spell being fairly craptastic...<br />

I think we should not be a fast dps class but then we nead somthing difrent the whay the design is going for fast fights with high dps low hp makes dots more and more undepowerd compared to dd spells.<br />

The problem is that the game is moving more and more towards fast fights and that is not good for shaman becouse most of the spells we have is towards fights thats is over 1min .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u143"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p143">I think my group last night shows the problem pretty clearly. After raiding last night I went with a group to finish the vxed trial. To give some context we're an elemental, nearing time, guild. The group was cleric, warrior, ranger, bard, enchanter and me. This was a very solid group over all and all players are well geared. The warrior for example is our biggest mt, 10k+ hps 2k+ ac about as good as you can get pre time. The other players are simularly geared.<br />
<br />
We gather up and start the trial since we're all still fully raid buffed. Second mob pull happens to be a mountain pooka so we debuff and charm it for a sick pet. Tracking tells us we've got 2 named up and unfortunately one happens to be in the way and we can't avoid it.<br />
<br />
We get ready to pull it but we know it's gonna be rough. Bard slows the mob on pull and tank lets him self get low and then fires off reposte disc while everyone else tries to burn him down. In the end we managed to kill the named with out loosing anyone but the tank nearly died and only didn't because the charmed pet allowed us to kill the mob so quickly. I never did manage to slow him, malosed and then got resisted and by the time it was refreshed I was chain spaming tnargs to try and help keep the tank up.<br />
<br />
A heavy tank, 2 healers including a cleric and we can't keep up with the healing on a named mob in an easy trial. This isn't even the difficult named in tipt let alone beyond. This is one of the normal named in vxed and honestly one of the easier ones in vxed.<br />
<br />
The mobs hit way to hard for the healing capacity thats out there really and an improved HoT isn't gonna do a damm thing to help us. The mob lasted maybe 45 seconds and probably not even that. A 400 or 500 hps a tick hot wouldn't have meant anything in that fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let me just give my two cents on why it is more counter productive.  First of all I see a shaman as a patch healer not really main heals.  I never thought of myself as main heals or a cheal rotation kind of class.  <br />
<br />
We are there to make other people's jobs easier.  For example a cleric will go OOM very fast if they are the only one healing.  We are there to PATCH heal and slow to mitigate damage. <br />
<br />
If you got a good HoT we could keep people in a group topped off.  Mostly from an AE or other type of encounter that would over load a main healer.  <br />
<br />
The benefit you get from a HoT is less aggro in my opinion.  You cast off a group HoT and you could keep people topped off while doing all the other necessary functions such as buffing, crowd control, etc. <br />
<br />
The HoT plus a Tnarg would allow us to do exactly that without getting huge aggro.  Ask any cleric why they aren't tossing out there highest heals when a mob isn't slow.  They will use lesser heals until the target has been subdued.   <br />
<br />
This is just my view of the situtation.  I understand that we are behind in healing dept, but I don't think a really big heal would help.  And if you speed up the cast time you just will get aggro that much faster if you are casting it a lot.  <br />
<br />
Unless they tweak the aggro reduction line of SCS to very good we will never be main heals.  75 percent of shaman don't have the LR5 AA or gear to support getting a beat down in even the elemental planes.  <br />
<br />
You have to be realistic when you ask for something.  I would say it should be geared to the majority of the community not just the end game shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u145"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p145">Improved HoT is fine and dandy but is completely and utterly irrelevant to the concerns we have. <br />

Again: you guys have transformed the grouping game into a superfast clickfest where the only things that matter are tanking, quick damage dealing and quick healing.  We do exactly zero of those things well right now.  Giving us more or better slow heals does exactly nothing to fix that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why? The end game shaman is who is suffering. Tune the lower game, and you will still have problems in GoD and elementals. And the next expansion, and so on. In the end, everyone has their important aa's; most elemental non bot shamans with a clue have LR 5. Balancing around weak shamans will only mess things up. Just because YOU might be too under aa'd/geared to take the aggro from spells we NEED to cast, doesnt mean we shouldnt have the ability to cast them. Perhaps they should remove all dots while they are at it, since it hurts those who cant take the heat? :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u147"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p147">For the most part I have retired my Shaman until most of these three issues are fixed.  The Shaman's inability to stack has cost me my guild; that is how badly out of balance the Shaman is currently.<br />
<br />
I have purchased Gates but I have not had a chance to play in the new zones.  I really don't think that my 65 Shaman is up to it so I have been leveling a Berserker.<br />
<br />
My point is that Shaman are still having problems with Pre-Gates' content.  I am still passed over for other slowing classes in LDoN groups.  I would hope tweaking the Shaman for Gates will fix most of the problems Shaman are having in LDoN and PoP.<br />
Even without the new Gates' content poorly equiped but high level Shaman were struggling.  Please do not think that our difficulties have arrived with this expansion.  I think that LDoN clearly illustrated that Shaman only have one strength (Slowing) and even that skill was not uncontested.  It would seem that in the six person group format, that character classes need to have at least two solid skills to be &quot;cost effective.&quot;  Even a Warrior has two purposes at main tank= Damage Sponge and DPS.  Currently a Shaman's old secondary roles of healing and buffing have been negated with the change in content and lack of upgrades to the Shaman's spells and abilities.  Our dots and other offensive skills are okay for soloing but this is a social game and most players would rather be adventuring with other players.<br />
<br />
Not only will true upgrades to the Shaman class help those high-end Shaman in Gates, it will also return to viablity those of us high-end Shaman still adventuring in PoP and LDoN.</div></div><hr />

Problem is Rascalan it is the end game shaman thats have the bigest problem now becouse the heals we have is fine untill you get to GoD and the ikknz 1 group encounters untill then you dont realy nead a better heal. If you have time gear and the rest in your party have it to .</div></div><hr />

You are dead wrong.  Shamans should be an alternative for group healing.  I know alot of shamans, including myself for a long time, are against being &quot;main healers.&quot;  Unfortunately, there has been countless times I have been stuck as a main healer for raids, because we were short on clerics and druids.  And when clerics are busy on CH rotations, guess who needs to heal those hit with AE's or rampage?  Us.  My heals are too slow or don't do enough with me being a main healer.  <br />
<br />
If I'm going to be seen as a healer, which we are categorized as, then I should be able to heal comfortably.<br />
<br />
I can honestly say though, if my damage was scaled like the other classes throughout the expansions, I might not be so desperate for better healing, but that's not the case.</div></div><hr />

Problem is the Shaman doesn't even qualify as a patch healer really on named mobs in Tipt and above. For that matter some trash mobs can be rough also. I have all Healing AA, a 40% healing aug, and spell haste, and keeping the tank up against the end named in Tipt is by no means easy.<br />
<br />
Heaven help the group that pulls him out of the room. Did that one time and he hit me for 1400+ and 2 x 3770 in a matter of seconds. This was after the tank dropped when the named was at 30%. It was dominoes from there. MT, Cleric, Me, Mage, Rogue, Necro FD'd and lived.<br />
<br />
Try running into a hasted mob in Kod Taz. If slow doesn't land fast you better pray because it will most likely rape your group.<br />

An upgraded HoT won't help much. We need an upgraded direct heal.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for stopping by Rytan-<br />

When you say &quot;significantly reducing the number of situations where a cleric is the only viable healer in 6 man group situations&quot; should we read that to mean that you guys agree that A) a shaman should be able to heal, for example, by himself in say LDoN hard adventures? Or B) should we read that to mean a shaman and a druid together should be able to heal in LDoN hard or some of the tougher GoD trials?<br />

How about a 4 second cast time HoT that does something like 1000 pts healed initially (blast heal), then does 750 pts / tick for 4 ticks or something - extendable with AAs.<br />
<br />
Now THAT would be a nice HoT upgrade, and even allow &quot;some&quot; minor benefit to stacking without impacting the overall HoT stacking issue.</div></div><hr />

1500hp/tick, 800mana, duration 4 ticks, casting time 6 seconds.  <br />
<br />
Something like that might be enought to let us act as a main healer, and is the logial upgeade from Torpor.  Mobs hit for 8 times a much damage now as they did then (1200 vs 150).  <br />
<br />
With that kind of Heal over time going in I should be able to blast Tnargs to keep the tank up, and maybe have time to debuff the mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u155"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p155">I would be happy with an upgraded heal over time, actually -- if the amount healed was substantial.  IE: 3 times the amount of Q, for 3 times the mana.  That would give me enough healing to continue my secondary healer role (mitigating damage taken by the MT) and still leave me free to provide that extra little blast with Tnargs to help out.  <br />
<br />
If the change to our heal over time was to make it heal 500 instead of 360, though, that would be more or less worthless to me and would do nothing to solve the problem.<br />
<br />
I guess its a matter of degree.<br />
<br />
To be honest, what I'd really like would be an 1800 point direct heal.  Thats it.  Upgraded Tnargs, no fuss no muss.  Make it cost however much mana you want -- when I need to heal someone, I need to heal someone, and efficiency is the last thing on my mind.</div></div><hr />

I've done Tipt with and without an enchanter pet. There is a major difference between the two. <br />
<br />
On one you slow and maybe throw a patch heal on the tank, and watch the enchanter for charm break.<br />

On the other, you patch heal much more, tank sometimes, and hope you don't get more than 2-3 mobs at a time.</div></div><hr />

This is just my view of the situtation.  I understand that we are behind in healing dept, but I don't think a really big heal would help.  And if you speed up the cast time you just will get aggro that much faster if you are casting it a lot.  <br />
<br />
Unless they tweak the aggro reduction line of SCS to very good we will never be main heals.  75 percent of shaman don't have the LR5 AA or gear to support getting a beat down in even the elemental planes.  <br />
<br />
You have to be realistic when you ask for something.  I would say it should be geared to the majority of the community not just the end game shaman.<br />
<br />
No, you dont understand.  I have under par gear for vexd and I've been there.  HoT will do nothing, and my spams delayed the tanks death maybe 10-15 seconds.<br />
<br />
You dont get a chance to do CC, if the mobs not slowed and you get aggro in these zones, your dead.  <br />
<br />
Personally I dont see why anyone not in the elementals would complain, I can heal BoT just fine and even a monk tanking in HoH, no sweat.  Its in the elementals where it begins and in GoD where it falls off.</div></div><hr />

Lets say we get the heal over time upgrade.  How will this change your playstyle?<br />
<br />
Your battle:<br />
preDoT Heal<br />
Dispel on Pull<br />
Malos 4.5 seconds<br />
recast delay 2.5<br />
Slow (1 or 2 seconds)<br />
<br />
At this point one of two things has happened.<br />
<br />
Resist or No Resist.  If it's resisted you have to wait another 6 seconds to cast again and you have some extra aggro or if your main healer has issues you go into Tnarg mode.  You have 20-30 seconds to add to the DPS of the group regardless (and regain the 400 mana you just spent).<br />
<br />
How much damage is the MA taking if slow is resisted? 2-4k every 2 seconds?  Shaman are WAY outclassed for healing this kind of damage.<br />
<br />
Why did people give up so early on the whole DPS, Chain-Tnarg, concerns?  A heal over time doesnt really address any of this.<br />
<br />
I'd settle for far more earned spell haste over any meager upgrades to our existing spells.  Remove the blurry line between SHM and BST the same way you did PAL and CLR.<br />
<br />
Gates AA: Instant Quick Buff (requires Quick Buff Level 3, 12 aas).  Quick buff now applies to instant beneficial spells (like heals).<br />
Gates AA: Detrimental Quick Buff (requires Quick Buff Level 3, 12 aas).  Quick buff now applies to instant detrimental spells (malos, annul magic, etc).<br />
<br />
Your battle:<br />
Dispel on Pull.<br />
Malos 2 seconds<br />
recast delay 2.5<br />
Slow (0.5 or 1 seconds)<br />
<br />
Obviously we are to far into the expansion for new aas, but at least its written down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The HoT thing was not specifically focused towards the GoD trail activity.  I am in an EP guild and don't really feel that us being able to spot heal is the answer for making GoD easier.  <br />
<br />
I have read post after post where shaman have said I use Q in conjunction with Tnarg to keep a main tank up when I am the only healer.  <br />
<br />
The idea of the HoT would just allow you to be more efficient in an over all group.  This would actually make the over all shaman population more desirable at lower levels.  <br />
<br />
The GoD trials and end game grouping is a whole other problem.  I really don't think skewing the healing in general to accomadate one part of an expansion is something the developers would do......<br />
<br />
They have to keep making harder content to please the masses.  You can't keep skewing things as they come out with harder things.  Bringing us more in line would be good, but the only effective thing I could say they could do is make an AA that would effect our healing abiilty.  So as you get to higher level content you have the &quot;ability&quot; to deal with the higher DPS.   <br />
<br />
Adding spells into the game that will topple other content for us may not be the answer.  I don't disagree with what people are saying here, I am just being realistic in my requests. I know the developers won't change a direct heal like what people are suggesting, so I am looking for something somewhat more in line with their vision.  <br />
<br />
I believe the HoT idea that is being tested is more than likely what they will play with first.  You see when you start adding heals to the game it starts to unravel things fast.  I think that is why they scaled us back so much when they were originally giong to upgrade us with a better heal.  <br />
<br />
If this was the vision they would have implemented it by now.  They are giving us credit on the ideas, but have no real method of implimenting better heals without throwing things out of whack.  <br />
<br />
I am not claiming that this will solve problems, but it will set us back up to do a more in line method of healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u166"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p166">It seems there have been many issues about class balancing, most of which have been mainly due the effectiveness of classes twards these new mobs (high dps/low hp).  There are also issues in which changing things around can lead to over-powering and even disrupt the integerity of the game.<br />
 <br />
To address our concerns, the shaman on Stormhammer have concluded a few VERY good ideas, which would take care of many problems.<br />
 <br />
--Our first idea would be to change the time it takes between each tick that DoTs make from 6 seconds to 3, or at least less then 6.  This would not only take care of the dps issue that Shaman and necros have, but it would also not change the integerity of the game, since this would only put these classes dps back on par the way we had them before.<br />
 <br />
--Our second idea would be to change the way mobs mitigate speed attack debuffs.  Origionaly Shaman were penalized for haveing this debuff by decreasing our usefullness as a healer, which does make sense.   But now,  mobs are even imune to changes in attack speed(named mobs), thus our class has become even that much less balanced.   This issue can be easily resolved, if that nice balance between our heal/Tugurs were put back into place as they once were.  This would not over power us, it would just put shaman back in the spot they were.<br />
<br />
These two ideas would not change the way in which other classes have to offer, neither would they change the way in which the new and old zones would be approched................</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u167"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p167">I understand very well what the last few posts are saying.<br />
<br />
As a L55 Shaman I am currently very happy with my class.  But already I am seeing the signs of bad times ahead.<br />
<br />
2 nights ago I started running into situations where I was forced to debuff all the mobs before slowing.  There was NO WAY to land a slow without debuffing with Malx first.  By the time I got Malx landed, and followed it with a slow, our MT was below 50% every time!<br />
<br />
Even with the damage mitigated by my slow, I was never able to do much more than keep the MT level at 50% until the mob was dead.<br />
<br />
Sure, I can easily heal him after the fight, but my heal output is basically the same as the damage output of the slowed mob.  In cases where 2 mobs came, I had to root both mobs, Malx, Slow before the MT could step in and fight without dying.  God help us if we had pulled 3.<br />
<br />
Anyway, it seems that our heal line is a fairly linear step up over the final 10 levels of spells.  Unfortunately, it appears that the mob step up is exponential, meaning we get farther and farther behind as the level of the content increases.<br />
<br />
Needless to say I'll be very disappointed if I get to end game content and find that my character is no longer a desired group member.  I'll be equally disappointed to find that my character is nothing but a healer.  Right now I do many things well.  That is what I liked about the class when I rolled it.  Please don't take that away from me as I approach the pinnacle of my class.<br />

<br />
This is probably impossible.  I'm going to go ahead and guess that the six second tick is coded so deeply and called so often that it would take months for them to repair the damage of trying to make ticks every 3 seconds instead of six.  You also have to consider lag,latency, and server stress  issues with the server sending out twice as much data because ticks would be happening twice as fast.  <br />

Actually for us bazaar/casual players, it starts in LDoN hards, BoT wing bosses and some Tactics mobs that mitigate slow.  I guess I could live w/o being primary healer against a BoT wing boss, but it greatly irritates me that  we _MUST_ have at least a bazaar cleric to do LDoN hards.  A raid-geared druid has also been sufficient, but it still makes me redundant.  <br />
<br />
I don't like being redundant, nor a drag on the group.  I've successfully been main healer/slower for my group of friends going on 3 years, always as a shaman- why should I have to change now?  I don't even raid and I'm running into this issue.  <br />
<br />
Again, I'm not asking to be as good as a cleric, I'm just asking to have the same shot at primary healer against LDoN hards as a druid- I fail to see why there's such a big discrepancy between their 4.5k &quot;cheal&quot; and our 2k &quot;cheal&quot; when every mob there mitigates slow.  I thought our healing was pitiful in PoP, but it never became an issue until they kept juicing up the mobs but leaving our healing the same.  <br />
<br />
Poor design, please fix it ASAP. And no, the standard answer &quot;so go roll up a cleric, newb!&quot; is not the answer.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u170"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p170">Seems to me that slightly increased pulse heal amounts only keep the current HoT as a recovery heal spell rather than a action heal spell.   <br />
<br />
Even if the pulses healed 500 or 600 or 700 per tick its not going to keep a aggro holding tank alive by itself (or anyone with GoD type aggro alive for that matter) <br />
<br />
People are attempting to lay out the logic of using a HoT in addition to Tnargs or Knargs in places where a Shaman is the primary healer.  But it's going to take a combination of increasing pulse heals of a HoT along with increased heal value of direct heals to let a Shaman's come anywhere close to being a Primary much less on a mob that can't be slowed in GoD.  <br />
<br />
We need both HoT spell values increased AND a new AA for increasing non CH type heals. I would think the following would solve the problems:<br />
<br />
HoT - 500HP for 400 mana for 4 pulses.  2000 HP natural added with AA's extended into 3400 plus over time.<br />
<br />
AA - Mastery Healing Adept - add something like 10% more direct heal (Not CH) at 2/4/6 rates that continue to stack with Focus items (30% Total)<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, if the person had new HoT and AA/Focus items ... they should be able to heal for the 500 per tick along with 2,000 +/- Tnargs for like 2500 per tick.   Or if spam healing for something like 10k total over 4 ticks.   Nothing Uber or coming close to Druid/Cleric's heals.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
People keep saying our healing sucks. Then you hear some of the same people say our heals have always been less because the difference slow makes. I agree with that, shaman do not need to be such strong healers when we can land a 75% slow on a mob. Because after slow, the mob is just not going to do nearly the same amount of damage. <br />
<br />
Give me a better slow and other tools to kill a mob and I won't have to heal as much. If a mob dies 5 seconds faster, due to DD or better DoT, and does 20% less damage, due to slow, then I don't need a much better heal. I didn't sign up to be the main healer in groups. I was intrigued by being able to debuff, then slow, then send in Dogdog, then DoT, then get in the mix and melee, all while spot healing and root parking some adds. I know in those situations that I am not the highest DPS, best crowd control, or best healer, but I don't want to be the best at those things. And I understand that all these things can't ALWAYS be done by me (especially the higher I go), but I don't won't to be relegated to Malo, then slow, then start spamming the hell out of my quick-heal hotkey. Or sitting there like a cleric medding and waiting to cast the next CH.<br />
<br />
Give us a slow that is say 70% with a -45% resist modifier. It is a bit worse percentage-wise than Turgur's, but it has built in Malo. And since we are shaman we should naturally be better slowers than anyone else, so make it where we automatically don't get mitigated as much as other slowers. If a beastlord gets mitigated 50% by a mob, then an enchanter might only get mitigated 45%, and a SHAMAN (THE MASTERS OF SLOW, DAMNIT!) would only get mitigated 35% or something similar. Just make our slows unique to the Shaman class once again. <br />
Once we mitigate a mob's damage by so much, we wouldn't need huge healing upgrades.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Sorry, after reading again, it sounded like these ideas are all I thought were good ideas. I am not saying to give us these and only these. Hell, it doesn't have to even be these, but give us something special again the makes us useful and distinct without turning us into a druid or cleric clone. Could be better slows, and minor heal upgrades. Minor slow upgrades and better DPS. Minor heal upgrades, minor slow upgrades, and minor DPS improvements. It doesn't have to be where all we get is one BIG healing improvement to be better shaman. Be creative and not just cookie-cutter.</div></div><hr />

Mobs are tuned with Turgur's in mind. Other classes heals are tuned with a slowed mob in mind. This goes up there with &quot;our spells cost so much because we have cannibalize&quot;, and &quot;We are the stat buff kings, bring 'em on!&quot; arguments.<br />
<br />
Frankly I don't understand Shaman players who want to keep their class stuck on a single Kunark spell for all eternity. Clerics have more than CH, Bards have more than &quot;mana song&quot;, so why the hell do you want Turgur's to be your one and only spell that means anything?</div></div><hr />

<br />
People say it because its true. Our heals have been based around the amount of damage reduction we impose on mobs. The problem lies in the the effect removing this damage reducion from our abilities on mobs while also increasing said mob's dps.<br />
<br />

That is why it will stay balanced.  It wont let us dish out twice the DPS, it will just allow that single dot that we put on the mob last for the full amount of ticks, thus letting the dot perform its full efficiency.  That is all most of us want anyhow.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u179"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p179">Interesting thread, much simmering tension. I no longer play my shaman, and as a necro I'm probably more interested in what response you get to #3 than any of you are. However there's one shaman thing that I didn't see in the thread.<br />
<br />
In theory shaman healing is balanced against a slowed mob. While the balance has changed, and is a bit wonky, this will remain true. However it doesn't fully express the fact that this means shaman healing must transition from woefully inadequate (pre-slow) to mostly inadequate (post-slow) on each contact. And during that vital transition the shaman cannot heal. This was fine in an expansions where the tanks HP could offset this period, but GoD DPS both doesn't allow the shaman to recover from this healing deficit even if the tank should survive it.<br />
<br />
The current GoD slow seems to be meant to be used in this way, as a fast slow. But the recast shoots that down. I'd like to see it slow less but cast faster and with at least a malo level resist adjustment. After this the shaman gets to make a tactical choice whether to heal (and the heal should be balanced against this fast slow) or to invest time in landing a superior slow (ie. Turgurs).<br />
<br />
This doesn't fix the shaman healing problem. But it does adress the fact that if you are going to balance healing and slowing (which you have to) then the shaman must be able to land that slow before the tanks HP pool depletes. And God has made that a very narrow window indeed.<br />
<br />
Anyway, here's hoping the shaman situation improves. And if they notice that plague of delusion is pointless perhaps they'll realize the same is true of almost all DoT's versus nukes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u180"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p180">Are our DPS balanced now?<br />
<br />
I was speaking how it is balanced pre-GoD.  I usually used to see a wears off message on my Bane and sometimes my Blood of saryrn.  It just would be nice to see that again, in GoD. /hopeing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u181"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p181">I think the SCS AA can help a little with the aggro.  I have it at second level, and wonder how well it will do at the third.<br />
<br />
I do know that, before I had any SCS, spam healing my quick heals would get me summoned even over heavy aggro by the rest of the team.  The heal is so weak that I have to cast it a zillion times for it to seem to make any difference.  Doing that means that I can either die right in the middle of the battle from spamming it so much, or that if the cleric dies, I'm immediately dead right after because of the huge aggro I've built up.<br />
<br />
If we do get bigger heals, I hope they really are big enough to balance out the high aggro situation I get now.  Maybe I have to cast them less, or maybe they just have their aggro adjusted so that if I do spam them, I'm not constantly right at the edge of death as my reward for trying to help.  Honestly, sometimes I know I've healed so much with direct heals that I figure that if I continue, I'm just sacrificing myself on the off chance that maybe the MT will live by my suicide.  I can take a little aggro from some elemental mobs, but in GoD, I'm wiped out right away.<br />
<br />
I just got SCS levels 1 and 2 and haven't had a chance to notice their effect on my heal spam yet, but people do seem to indicate that it doesn't affect all aggro, only things like slow and malos aggro.  <br />
<br />
I hope with either AA or something or other, I will be able to spam heal without it being a death sentence.<br />
<br />
I also don't think any of the stuff we've asked for should be an ancient spell.  These are flaws with the class, not special prizes to hand out to those who jump through certain hoops.  Restricting better healing, better DPS -- whatever it takes to make shamans actually a reasonably desired class -- to only a few will still leave the rest of us hanging.<br />
<br />
If we're going to make something ancient, don't make it something that adjusts or fixes the class -- make it a cute party favor.  It's the class that needs adjusting, not the luck of a relative handful of players that needs to be tweaked and celebrated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aggro reduction is a huge issue even if we got a better heal.  That is why I would want a smaller heal and over time.  The idea of SCS coming into play would be great if it were tweaked.  <br />
<br />
I think if we pushed the idea of the granting HPS in a burst and having them reduced over time there would be a compensation.  I may be wrong, but I don't think granting HPS would effect aggro like healing.  Maybe if they tied SCS in with an AA like this we could creatively get around the healing issues without unbalancing things.  <br />
<br />
Thinking outside the box instead of working against three other classes.  Just add a new feature to our class that once again makes us a bit different, but falls in line with our abilities.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have read post after post where shaman have said I use Q in conjunction with Tnarg to keep a main tank up when I am the only healer.  <br />
And that flat out will not do in GoD. It was sketchy in PoP and LDoN already. Even if you get 2 ticks of healing between your tank having full HPs and being dead, which is doubtful, that will at the very most negate a quarter of an attack round of a GoD trash MOB.<br />
<br />
The idea of the HoT would just allow you to be more efficient in an over all group.  This would actually make the over all shaman population more desirable at lower levels.  <br />
Efficiency does not keep people alive, it keeps groups going. Having a 700 per tick HoT on an instant cast, mana free, instant refresh AA button would not allow me to keep people alive in GoD. The only thing it would change is that I would die at full mana.<br />
And by the way, shaman are fine at lower levels. Lvl 50 shaman do no need help. Lvl 55 shaman do not need help. Lvl 60 shaman do not need help. Lvl 65 shaman who just entered the planes do not need help. This is a high level problem. A high level, high AA, high gear, new content problem.<br />
<br />
The GoD trials and end game grouping is a whole other problem.  I really don't think skewing the healing in general to accomadate one part of an expansion is something the developers would do......<br />
Then have those new spells be nodrop and only drop in sewers / mountains / kod'taz. A common drop of trash in Kod'taz sounds nice to me.<br />
<br />
Adding spells into the game that will topple other content for us may not be the answer.<br />
You mean just like every single expansion has trivialized the last one? This will be less of an impact to old content then LDoN gear was.<br />
<br />
I don't disagree with what people are saying here, I am just being realistic in my requests. I know the developers won't change a direct heal like what people are suggesting, so I am looking for something somewhat more in line with their vision.  <br />
And we think shaman need these upgrades and so we suggest them. What we will get is decided elsewhere, we just get to vote on it with our wallet.<br />
<br />
I believe the HoT idea that is being tested is more than likely what they will play with first.  You see when you start adding heals to the game it starts to unravel things fast.  I think that is why they scaled us back so much when they were originally giong to upgrade us with a better heal.  <br />
How would us getting druid heals, which would be a lot more then everyone asks for, possibly &quot;unravel things&quot; ?</div></div><hr />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
People say it because its true. Our heals have been based around the amount of damage reduction we impose on mobs. The problem lies in the the effect removing this damage reducion from our abilities on mobs while also increasing said mob's dps. <br />
<br />
         Turgur is a kurnak , in kurnak shaman and druid got the same heal spell. It's only way after with the thott graph and some very arrogant people here ,we got very inferious heal.</div></div><hr />

Was this true in Luclin? Quite easy to argue that way, especially when you looked at single group settings. Is it true today? In my opinion it is not, especially at the current high end.</div></div><hr />

When with max healing AA, and Elemental sleeves, I can not heal ONE G***AMN HIT from a mob that is unslowable (therefore taking away my *godly  :rolleyes: * ability and requiring two healers, which both have to NOT be shaman) on top of Sony giving us inferior spells (hello crappy slow, hello crappy dot, hello crappy HoT, hello good cann but buried in a zone few will see), and then say a new Heal over Time is what we need (per this thread, quoted from Mr Spell Guy), is ludicrous.   <br />

Good Luck all.  I pray that sony removes thier head from thier a$$ and realize we are a PRIEST CLASS, and any group with half a brain has a slower of some sort (whether us, or a bard/ beast/ enchanter), so to stop penalizing us for crappy mana efficiency, high cost of spell costs, long spell casting times, crappy heals, and overall crappy attention, and make us the priest class we are.

I'm not even sure you can realistically do that without invaladating the other priest classes totally through elemental level.  Already on bottom feed content (LDON normal) you don't need anything more than a shaman who can slow/heal at same time.  It's even possible though very very difficult to be only healer/slower in elementals.  If you improve shaman healing you may find a bbig push out of groups.<br />

with only 2 classes that can do it.  Bards and Chanters.  Theres room for more classes to impinge in this CC area honestly.  If VI wanted to be creative they could even do this in a more shamanistic way.  Summoned Spirits to confuse/occupy the enemy.<br />

On LDoN normals Beastlords already heal fine. On LDoN normals wizards tank just fine. &quot;Balancing&quot; for trivial content is just silly. It is like trying to balance healing in Crushbone.<br />

And it is a lot easier to just bring a cleric instead of a shaman and forgo slow completely. No more aggro bouncing, no worries about resisted slows and more healing in all situations.<br />
<br />

That help is so miniscule it will not matter. If we get a better HoT we will use it but it will not come close to letting us heal even close to a druid. Casting a heal for 6 seconds and then waiting for potentially another 6 seconds to see the first bit of effect does not cut it when tanks die in under 10 seconds.<br />

Heh but snare/parking takes decent skill and has some space related issues.<br />

I thought of a perfect Shamanistic CC device.  100% slow (not subject to slow mitigation) with a 1 point rune on it.  And short duration.<br />

What you are missing Sir is the game design here.... <br />
<br />
You get a greater heal and you get more aggro.  Even if you got what you asked for you would be dead to the group in one cast, therefore what you are asking for isn't going to help the situation. <br />
<br />
Getting a greater heal will not help you, as you will be dead and than your tank will be dead.   How does this solve the problem??<br />

<br />
To answer your question if I haven't made it clear in the above post I apologize.  When you introduce greater heals in the game you will have to push against adjusting three other classes, plus mob damage to make it work.   <br />
<br />
It ain't that they couldn't do it, but if they were going to do it you would have seen it on the last healing upgrade we got.  <br />
<br />

This is an intriguing concept.  What would make it very useful is to make it function in such a way that it is a NO Exp rez, however, the corpse can STILL be rez'ed by a cleric at a later time.<br />
<br />
Perhaps call it &quot;Spirit Recall&quot;.  Allows the player to quickly rejoin the fight, but doesn't encroach upon the Cleric in such a way as to exclude them from a group.<br />

A lot of your info is correct, it's just that your conclusion is flawed.  Game design is what's screwing us, correct.  If you introduce better heals for one priest, you need to balance that with the other priests healing powers, correct.<br />
<br />
The problem is that they've upgraded both Druid and Cleric healing substantially in GoD and given shaman an upgrade so minor that it barely qualifies as an upgrade at all.  Compounding that is the fact that encounter design has shifted towards high dps, short duration fights where the effects of slow aren't nearly as powerful as they once were and fast healing is substantially more important.<br />
<br />
Get it?  The area we got absolutely no upgrade in has become a central focus of any group/raid in GoD.... Fast Healing.  The one area in which we excel, Slowing,  has been marginalized even further in GoD.  The one thing that we, as priests, REALLY need is improved direct healing.  Everything else is secondary unless you totally redefine what the shaman class is.  We're priests, we need to be able to effectively fill that role and should most definately exceed any hybrids healing capacity.  That's simply not the case right now due to our underpowered direct heals.</div></div><hr />

What you fail to realize is this has to happen every time you go upgrade or mess with a healing classes spells.  Upgrading us means these other classes have to be evaluated and thier healing scaled as well.  That is part of the problem with asking for better heals.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u200"><b>Tolann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p200">Ok, I haven't read completely everything in this string, but I want to put in my 2cp.  <br />
As far as the &quot;3 main points&quot;, my concerns are mostly with our heals followed by slows.   I feel that when the druids got their lvl 64 big heal and ours was taken away (nerfed out of our books before it was even released), we lost alot of our idenity.  we were at one time able to not only slow in small groups, but we had a decent chance of keeping someone alive during battle.   Now its druids and even paladins that are looked to for patch healing, while our healing abilities have fallen far behind.   <br />
Slowing should be the ability shaman have that truely set us apart, right?   Well as this ability has been spread to the enchanters, bards, and beastlords again we lose our chance to shine thru.   To further the problem with slow, everything is looking more and more  mitigated.  Debuff is a must to land a slow and when the mob is finally slowed, it's only marginal which brings me back to my first point regarding healing, because now our melee friends are hurting.  <br />
I feel that the shaman class (at least from my view point and my playstyle)  could best be helped with better heals, not only with HoTs but with a better instant heal (maybe a base of over 3K to be somewhat in line with druid &quot;complete&quot; heals or just an upgraded fast heal) and a fix to our slows that will let us perhaps rise above some mitigation and will let us shine again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u201"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p201">If you didn't know we get a heal that does almost 2k called Kragg, if you are debating getting a better more powerful heal you may as well be asking to just lower the mana cost on this spell and the casting time.  <br />
I like this idea, who uses that damn CH anyway?  Drop it to a 6 sec cast time, make it affected by QB, HA/HG and focus effects.  Boom problem solved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u202"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p202">That might make Kragg useful again.

It is kind of embarrassing when Druid's fast heal heals for more than our CH.<br />

Sure, no problem.  Your first point in this post is true.  In fact, what you apparently haven't realized, it is the point that everyone is agreeing on.  They upgraded Druid and Cleric healing without looking at the oft ignored priest class, us.  They didn't scale us for Gates.  <br />
<br />
As for the easy fix, it's something that's been stated before, and I don't understand why it's being ignored by the naysayers.  While clearly game design is running into another problem with the level cap (compressing a large range of content difficulty into a small player level range, namely 65), and 70 will probably happen 'soon', for the moment AAs can provide the fix.  Create a high cost healing AA ability, one that would require the Shaman to be well, well into 65 (and therefore at the point where slow mitigation/resists, and high mob dps/low mob hps become the problem with Shaman balance) and there you go.  You haven't skewed the lower game, it isn't something that can be passed from non-Sham mains to twinks, and the class has the blast heal that's necessary.  What am I missing?</div></div><hr />

You seem to be missing the KEY point here. This balancing among the priests that you keep talking about... That's the problem.  The other priests have been 'balanced' with upgrades while we got jack.  There is NO need to upgrade CLR and DRU healing around an upgrade to shaman directhealing.  We are already vastly underpowered.  An upgrade is what is needed to RESTORE balance between priests.<br />

Who cares about extra aggro from better heals?  Guess what?  The druids and clerics get more aggro from their upgraded heals and they deal with it.  Aggro is NOT the problem in GoD.  The problem is being unable to fill our role as priests due to insufficient healing.  If you're slowing, then chances are you aren't going to be main healer, thus aggro from your heals is a side note, not a central issue.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to be a snob here, but have you actually been through the Mountain Trials or Ikkinz?  I don't think you understand what the problem is.</div></div><hr />

How come cleric heals, druid heals or even paladin heals are not trivializing large parts of the game then? Oh, wait, they do trivialize it. Just noone cares.<br />
<br />
More AC trivializes old content.<br />
More FT trivializes old content.<br />
More HPs trivializes old content.<br />
More healing trivializes old content.<br />
More damage trivializes old content.<br />
<br />
This is the nature of the game. You get new gear, new spells, more level - content is suddely easier and it should be easier. When I add some 4K HPs and mana, FT15, a ton of focus effects, 15 levels and 7 expansions worth of new spells of new gear to a character I expect content to become easier.<br />
<br />
The one thing you have to look out for is not to unbalance the areas you never intended to touch - which in this case is trivially easy. We already have spells dropping in the expansion we have the most issues in and they are already nodrop.<br />
Make our new spells drop as a very common drop in Kod Taz. Make them equally common off the boss in Tipt. Make them very rare of nameds in the sewer expeditions. Put in a few nameds deep in Ferubi that drop them commonly or just put them in as uncommon drops on the existing nameds. Put in a vendor selling our (nodrop) spells at the top of TipT and make it spawn only after killing the boss.<br />
<br />
Any of the above will restrict the new spells to those who need them most.<br />
<br />
So, in what way would getting new heals trivialize older content and why do new heals for other classes not trivialize the same content?<br />
<br />
As to your argument about us getting more heal aggro - all of our proposed heals would heal less then the current druid spot heals, and they seem to do just fine on aggro. Even clerics, who can heal a lot more damage in a fast time frame do not have trouble drawing aggro with healing.</div></div><hr />

Thanks, but those of us who don't raid and don't have GoD are still running into this same issue.  This is a class-wide change, it should not be restricted to raid level shaman nor to GoD only.  The original incomplete cheals weren't quested, neither should these fixes.  <br />
<br />
Don't make me waste time getting AA's or camping rare drops in an expansion I don't want or spend 50k+ for spells used to fix a class balance issue.  Last I looked warriors did not have to do any of the above to get their aggro abilities or their 5% mitigation bonus, nor did monks have to do anything to get their new lull spells- both were fixes to problems (perceived or real).  Why are we accepting that any potential fix must involve a lot of pain and suffering and be tied to one expansion?<br />
<br />
It sickens me that we accept this level of pain going all the way back to the pain of acquiring torpor/malo.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u211"><b>lfclan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p211">PoP Expansion: Droods/clerics/shaman: all get upgraded healing. Tho shaman are left behind by a good bit we still got a upgrade<br />
<br />
GoD Expansion: Dr00ds and Clerics get upgraded heals.(due to upped mob dps) Shaman get NO upgrade AND a lower percentage slow.<br />
<br />
GoD Expansion part B: Dr00ds and Clerics get upgraded heals again ( Due to developers underestimating DPS of mobs and the reduced slowing through mitigation) Shaman get NO upgrade.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now tell me how this is balanced?<br />
<br />
Tell me how upgrading our direct heal ONCE will unbalance the game when the other healing classes have had TWO?<br />
<br />
How is it that we will all the sudden fall over dead from heal arrgo when Clerics/Dr00ds both got big upgrades in heals then got ANOTHER increase and arent falling over dead?<br />
<br />
How is it ok for other healers to get upgraded ( not once but TWICE )and its not YELLED out that its trivializing the game?<br />
<br />
All these arguements are full of crap and everyone knows it (even if they wont admit it)<br />
<br />
The game wont all the sudden break down and stop working as intended if we get a 1800 burst heal.... And arguing against it just makes no sense: High end shaman need it to assist heal, Lower tiered shaman need it so that u dont have to sit around waiting for a cleric all day to exp... you can get some exp while the shaman heals WHILE looking for a cleric or dr00d....<br />
<br />
There is no REAL reason for us not to have a burst heal upgrade.... None what so ever...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u213"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p213">I'm no fan of taking a party line for against anything really, but before we lay the blame for years of screwing up on Sony's part on Brenlo's shoulders in a kind of shamanic chant, remember he's been posting reasonably frequently now and seems a lot more open that he did when he came up with the &quot;played a shaman to 50 line.&quot;<br />
<br />
We can't assume that he has the power to do everything right away, especially something as radical as not just tinker with shamans but really fix them and make them wanted by more than just people who should really know better by now.<br />
<br />
Let's let him catch a bit of a breath before coming down on him too hard.  Remember how long we've been living with mitigated slows and crappy heals?  I've got a fair bit of grim disappointment and anger with that myself, but it won't do much good to blast Brenlo's face off with it all at once.  Especially since it seems he's in the mood to actually care.  Frankly, I've been on the edge of retiring my shaman for years, and his intercession could be the only thing that keeps me from doing it. <br />
<br />
So let's see what he comes up with.  Does Sony deserve tremendous criticism for being ridiculously clueless all these years about shamans?  Heck yes.  But now that they're perhaps waking up and actually paying some attention to how THEIR OWN GAME actually works -- let's see what they come up with.  <br />
<br />
Lord knows we'll have all the right in the world to complain if the class is not drastically improved, but we don't know for sure that all we're going to get is a &quot;grass is always greener&quot; reply anymore.  <br />
<br />
Give Brenlo a little slack and some time.  I wouldn't kiss his or anyone's butt, and intend to keep a sharp eye out and not automatically agree with any proposed solutions just in case all Sony wants to do is toss us a withered old bone to get us to shut up, but I want to keep an open mind for a bit.  Not on how Sony has treated the class in the past -- that I'll never agree was done intelligently -- but on how they might still be trying to treat us in the future.   <br />
<br />
Maybe something good will happen; I know it had better happen fast, as I am rapidly losing the will to log in at all.  But if it doesn't happen in 10 minutes, I'll get over it.  I'll probably be back and checking in 10 more, but...let's not kill the goose that might lay the golden egg -- Brenlo and Rytan, that is.<br />
<br />
You don't even have to like them, or Sony, but I'd rather have them posting with us even if they get slammed here and there than just withdrawing to an ivory tower somewhere and letting the class rot as retaliation or because they just don't feel like talking to us at all.<br />
<br />
I frankly expect one hell of a lot from Brenlo and Rytan by now, and feel they will be real screw ups if they don't deliver and deliver fast ... but let's give them a chance to try.  These EQ guys didn't use to come here at all, and when they did listen in the good ole days, would talk about listening to some cronies on the test server they gave spells to for free, or the guys who frequented their boards, where they just lock threads and ban posters whenever anything negative comes up.  Here at least we all have a chance to communicate, somewhere in between the justified and unjustified observations, screams, reasoning, and moaning and groaning.</div></div><hr />

Note that I said &quot;most&quot;. Ideally there would be two to three parts to an upgrade in shaman healing, one via AAs and one via a dropped spell and one by upgrading Tnarg's. That way everyone would get a bigger Tnarg's, everyone who felt his healing needs a boost could get the AA and everyone in the new expansion where we have the biggest problems could get the spell.<br />
<br />
As to your Torpor/Malo comment - rare spells are certainly not the way to go. Putting the spells into a new zone is fine, making them rare is not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When WoW's release is imminent, I expect a slew of positive changes and not before if past history is any judge.  <br />
<br />
Unless your class is in the Holy Trinity, do not expect anything soon either.  Monks were, are and always shall be broken, but they didn't even get anything thrown their way until warriors chimed in about their aggro issues, leading to the &quot;melee fix&quot; after a year of melee issues.<br />

Hold your breath, I'm sure you'll be able to heal as well as a druid before you asphyxiate.<br />

interesting idea.<br />
<br />
let me suggest to make this AA not GOD related and this should solve many issues.<br />
<br />
- better tnarg will help the non-Ep/GOD 65 shamans.<br />
- healing AA will help the EP 65 shamans.<br />
- and the drop spell to help the GOD 65 shamans.<br />
<br />
makes sense to me.<br />
<br />
I hope Brenlo will find this idea as interesting as I do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u217"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p217">Brenlo is nothing more than talking head. He reads what we say, forms his own opinions, and talks to the devs and spell guy about those opinions.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, Brenlo, the devs, and even the spell guy have never played a shaman class at the highest levels. And you have to play a shaman at level 65 for awhile before you begin to understand the problems we face. I played mine at &gt;= level 60 for over a year before I understood that I was underpowered, overworked, and burned out.<br />
<br />
No other class in this game has to constantly casts spells even during downtime to keep up with mana demands. All other casters just sit down and go do something else for 5 to 10 mins, and come back to a full mana toon. Shaman on the other hand are constantly rebuffing, then canabilizing to get mana back, and then doing more rebuffing, and it just never seems to end. I used to play for 7-9 hours a night, and except for potty breaks, I was casting non-stop for virtually that entire time.<br />
<br />
The other thing that finally got to me was that shaman had no way to damage so many raid level mobs. DoTs were too much aggro or simply wouldnt land. Our nukes are and were a joke for most upper end encounters. I remember years ago, when I first went into ThurgadinB, and found that the ONLY 2 spells that I could get to land were Malo (unreistable) and our LEVEL ONE fire nuke (no, we never got a higher level fire nuke).<br />
<br />
Eventually, two years ago, I burned out playing my shaman. But I still wanted to play EQ. So I decided to experiment with NON-BUFFING classes. I tried a warrior... Then a monk... and then a rogue. And I fell in love with the rogue. <br />
<br />
Today, that rogue is level 65, has 376 AA's, is farming PoTime weekly, and is currently happily dying over and over in the Ikki trials in Kodtaz. The sad part of these trials though is that I know that as they are currently tuned, I will never get my shaman through them. 100% positive that he would never be able to contribute anywhere near enough DPS or utility to allow a group he was in to win any of the 3 Kodtaz trials. Oh sure, he could cower outside the zone as a buff whore for the ones that can get through the trials, but cowering outside of a trial that you know you have 0% of ever getting through is not fun.<br />
<br />
My shamans account is currently inactive. Unless there are some major changes to shaman, it will probably remain that way.<br />
<br />
I paid for 2 accounts for years. The game has now reached a point where only the best geared and most dedicated raiders can advance. My shaman is not among the best geared. Which means he cannot get to where I am with my rogue. Which means I no longer have any real incentive to pay for his account.<br />
<br />
Is this really what SOE wanted?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u218"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p218">The game has now reached a point where only the best geared and most dedicated raiders can advance.<br />
<br />
Isn't that how every expansion starts out?  Some of the expansions even hold onto that feeling for a while.  Many of the Luclin zones remained quite difficult and dangerous (hell some of them still ARE) for a very long time into the expansion, so much so that guilds really needed to take baby steps through the content.<br />
<br />
Also, it's only the people who have trivialized all current content that have nowhere to advance but into a new expansion.  Anyone who has yet to trivialize (or even experience) old content has plenty of advancement to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u219"><b>Maerrec</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p219">With all this communication going on, I'm almost ready to dust off my Shaman and give him a whirl. I loved playing my Shaman up until 60 when I started to notice a decline in not only need for Shamans but my own interest in playing one. And I knew that I wouldn't be able to play any other class cause I'd be bored if I wasn't constantly casting spells and trying to find new ways to CC while spam healing the tank when both the Chanter and the Cleric went down. Even if these new improvements were GoD raid quested only I'd rejoin the EQ crowd for the fact that I would be able to work for something again. After all, even soloing dragons can get a little redundant after a time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is an idea and, as far as I am concerned, just a mental exercise. Actually calling this &quot;the fix&quot; for shaman opens a whole-nother can of worms.<br />
<br />
We have heal spells now: Kragg's and Tnargs. They are ineffective as they exist. I don't need another spell to mem or an aa to grind out or a final ANCIENT type spell I will never see anyway. I just need what I have to friggen work in the environments I am in.<br />
<br />
Change the existing spells to actually work at a level that makes me a priest. 2 spells. 2 adjustments. 1 patch. Done.<br />
<br />
Then we can move on to finding a reason to cast our buffs or giving us some unique ability with our slows.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

The thing is - Kragg's and Tnarg's are fine at the level we can first use them. We are missing the additional spells everyone else got in later expansions where we got . . . Breath of Trushar.</div></div><hr />
