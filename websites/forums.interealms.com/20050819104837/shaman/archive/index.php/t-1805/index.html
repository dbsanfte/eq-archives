<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, after a long, long time of working on my epic, then not working on it, then working on it again, then blowing it up pretty badly, even I can come out on top.<br />
<br />
I even took some pics to prove it.<br />
<br />
The worst thing that happened along my road to gain an epic, was probably when I turned my first tear into a mage pet.  Yes, you heard right, a mage pet.  I still havent lived it down.  I probably never will.  But this time I have proof.  Jobarber isnt an iksar tear richer.<br />

<br />
Oddest reaver raid I've ever been on to be honest.  We never ever, stepped foot inside the castle.  Total reavers killed - 1, Neh's.  Another shaman on the raid is a step closer to his epic from the Neh kill.<br />
<br />
Someone had left Rak out in a decent spot, and we decided to go with it there.  Turned out ok.  But the oddest thing happened.  We were preparing to leave, when a reaver dropped out of the sky and attacked us.  I'd really like to figure out how that happened.  Be nice not to have to travel all the way to neh again, have her come to you.<br />
<br />
Of course, the obligatory Heyokah pic<br />

After that, I got screenshot happy.  Here's a pic of my necro friend, the Neh Shaman, and staring in awe at the feather flapping<br />

Eventually, I'll get a screenshot of me holding that thing in every zone in norrath<br />

Let me assure you.  If I can get my epic, ANYONE can.  I had alot of help.  To much help at times.  But friends can get alot done in eq.  I am now proof.</div></div><hr />

Congrats on the epic.<br />
<br />
<br />
Funny thing as a collary to your story.  I helped a close friend of mine do his epic this saturday morning.  We pulled the first reaver from the castle and went through 10 before he died.<br />
<br />
The 10th reaver got pushed into the water outside the gazebo (under the one for Nek'Ashir's reaver) and low and behold Reaver #10 returned with another reaver.  We killed both and low and behold the 2nd reaver was Nek'Ashir.<br />
<br />
The pathing is messed up or something wierd is going on in CoM.  Either way we didn't have to fight up to Nek'Ashir which was a pleasant change.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">We tried it tonight.  Failed miserably in getting to neh.  We didnt have a chanter and we got overwhelmed in a room otw there.  After CR, our rogue had to log and we were stuck without a lockpicker.  We used gflux to get a mage up on the skywalk, and he coth'd everyone up.  We proceeded just fine and cleared the way to the first gazeebo.  Then, to our unpleasant surprise, we discovered that the door to the next gazebo was locked.  Monk did the succor trick to get through the door and then pulled four mobs from neh's gazebo to the door and FD'd, and our tank pulled them through the door.  He pulled them back to the first gazebo where we were set up (dont ever set up in a room where mobs spawn.  bad bad bad idea we were stupid.  we should have set up out on the bridge in front of second gazeebo) and as soon as he got there the room repopped.  We were winning but then more just started appearing out of nowhere.  We still dont have a damn clue where all these mobs came from.  Wiped out again, and after another hour or two of CR we called it a night and logged.<br />
<br />
=\<br />
<br />
I enjoy being a very valuable member of a small guild as opposed to an expendable member in a large guild, but it really sucks when you fail at something because you're missing a chanter rogue or clerics.  We now have 1 chanter and 0 rogues in the guild, so it looks like me epic is going to have to wait a while.<br />
<br />
So close, too :(  the monk said he would have been able to pull neh's reaver on the next go, if only we hadnt been wiped out.<br />
<br />
/rant off<br />
<br />
sorry for the book, but I just felt like venting off my frustration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gaef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If dopropertinting is messing up the models (ex black no texture skins on the player models) upgrading your video drivers SHOULD fix the problem</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Nice screenshots. Thanks for sharing them with us. I can't wait to start my path for the Epic on MithMarr.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">As a side note, I went and downloaded the latest nvidia detonator driver (usually try to stay away from the latest, made an exception).  Turned /dopropertinting to on, and It fixed me right up.  No more green chest of black skins.  Thanks for the tip.</div></div><hr />

I feel your pain. I'm also in a small guild and it does feel good to be an important figure within it, but the lack of some casters at 50+ has been a real hindrance for us. We are more concerned about having fun, really, but it does get discouraging at times for some of us without a chanter or two around. Keep the faith.</div></div><hr />
