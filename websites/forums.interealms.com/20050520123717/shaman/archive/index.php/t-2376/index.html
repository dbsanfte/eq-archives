What's the difference between INT and WIS?</div></div><hr />

Stats and Tradeskills<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
 Stats, and how they impact tradeskills, have been the subject of much debate, pet theories and urban legend. Over the past 2 years, we've received several conflicting/changing reports on the effect of stats when tradeskilling. Here is the most recent information we have, based on Spring, 2002 Fan Faires.<br />
<br />
The basics:<br />
INT &amp; WIS: whichever of the two is higher will affect skill increases when practicing any tradeskill. The higher either your INT or WIS is, the greater the chance you have for a skill gain while tradeskilling.<br />
<br />
CHA: higher charisma, along with faction, will affect your buying and selling prices with merchants.<br />
<br />
Exceptions to the above:<br />
Smithing: skill increases for smithing are determined by INT, WIS or STR, whichever is higher.<br />
<br />
Fletching: skill increases for fletching are determined by INT, WIS or DEX, whichever is higher.<br />
<br />
While tailoring has been mentioned several times as needing DEX, at last check it was still not implemented.<br />
<br />
<br />
Stats have no impact on your chance of success or failure when practicing tradeskills. (Only your current skill is supposed to impact your chances of success or failure when creating an item.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Which is actually a wee bit different from what Yakitizma released about a year ago...  said it was INT or Wis for increases, with high STR (Smithing) &amp; DEX (Fletching) adding bonuses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which stat is used for raising skills in Blacksmithing?<br />
<br />
Whichever is the highest of Intelligence, Wisdom or Strength.<br />
<br />
What other skills have secondary skills like Smithing?<br />
<br />
Fletching runs off Dexterity, Jewelry runs off Dexterity, Tailoring will run off Dexterity soon.  Basically that means whichever is highest of Intelligence, Wisdom or Dexterity will be the stat checked for chances to raise skill.<br />
<br />

In case anyone wanted to see the official statement ^^</div></div><hr />
