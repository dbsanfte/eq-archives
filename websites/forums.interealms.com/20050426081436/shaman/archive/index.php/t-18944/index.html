<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>rudolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Level 36 shammie (pretty much 37) doesn't know where to level. I'm twinked to high heaven (1300 life, 700 ac unbuffed), i have a fungi staff for clickie regrowth, have a 19/22 weapon or a copper hammer of striking (13/20) and can tank most slowed mobs and have 90% life afterwards, i'm just not sure where to go. DSP seems slow cause the mobs go down slowly. Any suggestions would be appreciated. :)</div></div><hr />

Went from lvl34 to lvl40 in about 6-8 hours total, exp was so fast I almost fainted.  Fastest exp in the game, when you out level it, you'll miss it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When I was that level, I hunted in DSP.  I averaged a level per session ( usually 3 hours or so ) when I was in a group.  We usually killed anything near ME or GE zone-lines.  XP started to really slow down in the 40s around this area, and I moved onto TM to kill bats and sonic wolves.  GF zone-line is an awesome camp spot in your 40s.  I averaged a level per kei, and I usually killed the Runner a few times for Rallic Pack.  At the time, I would sell them for about 1k - 1k5.  With the buff nerf, I do not know if this is a viable spot to camp.<br />

Also, you might want to try CoM.  It is a good zone, and you can live there for a while as well as work on your epic drops.</div></div><hr />
