<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kubke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If my CDs from the ancient original have been laying in the sun and been bent and twisted, could I buy a new EQ cd (basic) and then patch aaaallll the other expansions?<br />
<br />
I have all the necesserary info required, but should my old pc croak id need the cd's<br />
<br />
Do I need some others cd's or could I do it like this. Some kind spirit left em in the window after cleaning/dusting off, she wont be doing that again Im sure</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Good question and I'm not totally sure.  I *think* you'd need the other CDs, but I might be thinking that only because I never tried using only the one when I loaded it up again on other computers.<br />
<br />
Sorry I couldn't be more help on that, but I did want to say that I think you could burn a copy of your EverQuest directory onto a DVD or multiple CDs and you'd be ok.  I haven't tried it this way, but I recently switched out hard drives and loaded up WinXP instead of the Win98 I'd had, and I just put the old HD as a slave and did a straight cut and paste from the old HD to the new with my EQ dir and it worked fine.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.  Damn that sun! ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks <br />
<br />
I any case I think the days of buying only the basic pack is gone. Now I kinda get Basic+RoK+SoV at a bare minimum. Im pretty thats enough thought it makes for a helluva patch <br />
<br />
edit, damn smileys</div></div><hr />
