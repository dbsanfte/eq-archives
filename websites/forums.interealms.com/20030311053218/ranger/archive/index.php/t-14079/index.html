<br />
Yes, at 58 I should have learn by now, but all I have is my own, not very scientific experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sarkaukar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Must include the following:<br />
<br />
Bow damage<br />
Arrow damage<br />
AM 1-3(lvl59+)simply magifies the damage.<br />
<br />
Skill lvl + Atk+ lvl determines both damage(dependent on bow/arrow damage) and hit rate.<br />
<br />
Dex helps in skill increases and those nice crits.</div></div><hr />

Dex does not improve your chance to hit. <br />
Dex does not make you hit harder with melee. <br />
Dex does not improve your chance to dual wield. <br />
Dex does not improve your chance to double attack. <br />
Dex does make you proc weapons more often. <br />
Dex does improve your chance to critical hit. <br />
Dex does make your bow shots hit harder.<br />
Dex does improve your chance to gain weapon skill. <br />
<br />
This information is FACTUAL.<br />
<br />
<br />
DEX according to this person is your meat and potatos when it comes to bow damage. I still can not answer if STR has anything to do with it, cause I am still trying to verify that for sure.<br />
<br />
Now I am not 100% sure about the rest of these, but this is what I have found out in my understanding of archery:<br />
<br />
<br />
Attack = If you are able to land a shot. Average dammage.<br />
<br />
Archery Skill Level = The maximum dammage you CAN do.<br />
<br />
Level = Yours vs. the mob. The higher level you are the more bonus you recive, the lower level you are the more penalty you recive.<br />
<br />
Skill level and attack are kind of intertwined, cause as you increase in skill level, the more attack you recive. However if there were such thing as a 500 attk buff, I dont think that you would hit harder, but be more accurate, and have your average dammage higer. Dex also assists with both the maximum dammage you WILL do, as well as the average dammage you do.<br />
<br />
All 4 of the stats are connected together, but independantly, this is what I see.</div></div><hr />
