<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Level 44 shaman here (ding!) (And this might be why I am wondering about pet weapon effectiveness, my level might be to low)<br />
<br />
1) First of all, are we absolutly sure Pet doesnt dual&quot;bite&quot; without two weapons, have anybody verified this lately?<br />
<br />
(I have verified that my pet dual wields by using two different weapon types, but I am wondering if it is the same amount of bites as hits with dual wield)<br />
<br />
2) Also: I have noticed that my pet hits for the same max value with FS longsword and bite. Is there any DMG difference from using weapons?<br />
<br />
3) Need advice: Usually I throw haste, hpbuff and strength on my pet, anything else I should put on it ?<br />
<br />
4) Have anybody parsed shaman pets earlier and posted it, if so can you please link me to this?<br />
<br />
I have tried searching for alpha pet and dual wielding pet, no information I have found helpful, and since I am a noob I dont know how to parse fights.<br />
<br />
I know I am challenging conventional wisdom here, but some proof might be nice for a doubter.<br />
Thanks everybody.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So -<br />
<br />
1. Based on the parse, we are pretty certain that at least the 61 pet doesn't dual wield without weapons.<br />
<br />
2. Based on experience, the max hit value is not affected by the weapons.  If the weapons proc that might add some additional damage.<br />
<br />
3. Based on the parse, haste and strength are good.  HP doesn't improve DPS directly, although a lack of HP might decrease it down to zero...<br />
<br />
4. See the parse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Excellent, exactly what I needed!<br />
<br />
Thanks you!<br />

3) hehe.<br />
<br />
<br />
And my search skill increased (1)!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Considering the effect +STR has on pet output, Focus/HoS (which you'll get at 49) becomes a reasonable buff for Fido, giving increased damage output AND longer life in a nice little package.<br />
<br />
And haste -- real haste, don't bother with Spirit Quickening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Whats wrong with Spirit Quickening? it stacks with Haste AND HoS!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It doesn't last long enough. I hate having to keep this spell memmed so I can cast it on pet every so often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The haste portion of Spirit Quickening does not stack with regular haste ~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">ahhhh...didn't know that.....ty!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You CAN change the max dmg of the pet with the weapons you give it, just that there are very few weapons around that you would bother doing this with.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Broken Blam Stick from PoMischief is one of those weapons.  It is a 20/30 1 hander that no classes can use, so ideal as a pet weapon.   Wielding the blam stick will raise puppy dmg to a max hit of 72.<br />
<br />
<br />
  As for checking if he can dual wield easily, turn on the pet messages and change their color, then filter them and others melee into a window and you'll see without weapons puppy can only get in 2 hits at a time, and with them he will quad (and when haste/dual wielding he actually makes up a fair amount of the battle spam)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Whats wrong with Spirit Quickening? it stacks with Haste AND HoS <br />
<br />
The +30str 19ac stacks. The haste dose not. When you have 2 or more haste &quot;spells&quot; the higher % haste takes over. You might still have the icon for 2 haste spells but you only get benifit from one. Look at Talismen of Alclerity and chanter haste the icons stack but you only get the haste % from the chanter spell. The same is true for SQ.<br />
<br />
<br />
(Edit for stats on SQ)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>peleg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">So is Swift Like Wind better than Spirit Quickening then?  I've never parsed it since I'd just have no idea how on earth to do that, but if wind is better, I'll be happy to chuck spirit quickening to the back of the spellbook!  :p <br />
<br />
P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yes SLTW is MUCH better haste then SQ. Just looked them up SQ is 20% haste +30 str, 19ac from Lucy. SLTW is 60% haste. If you wanted you could use SQ for the extra str and ac. But with the other buffs we have, that have a much longer duration. There is really not much point IMO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The reason why I got SQ was for added AC/str, if it even helps in those situations where every point counts...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">At level 44...str isnt going to help your pet; and i'm of the opinion it bears little relevance at all on any pets.  Unless you have mana coming out of your ears the only thing pet needs is haste, and if he's tanking, hp buff (no stamina buff since it doesnt help NPCS).<br />
<br />
And somewhat offtopic but...spirit quickening is one huge joke of a spell; it SHOULD be 60% haste or at least 50%, the only reason i own the spell is because one dropped when i was hunting shardwurms for bile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Agreed that SQ is pretty much a joke due to its duration.  It's really just silly.  But STR on your pet's probably worthwhile.  Someone did a parse of True Spirit plain and with Maniacal Str/Focus and the difference was certainly notable.<br />
<br />
STR buffs aren't THAT short, so I'd probably still go for it, but really the best solution is to just get 49, since HoS gives you both str and hp (and dex for when you get Fido some proccing weapons).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Armak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Im not sure, but im using Diaku on my pet when i got dogdog equiped with proc weapons - FoS+Diaku+Haste should help dogdog proc, if dex now have some kind of effect on procrate. Havent parsed it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I believe Dex does help.  When I gear up with proc weapons on puppy I buff with Daiku + mortal deftness + Infusion + PE + FA.   Little dog gets considerable DEX out of that and begins to spam me with mage procs to return the favor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Armak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Mortal and Diaku and Infusion stacks? OMG havent even tried it, thought they locked that buffstacking down. Nice too know, Thanks :)</div></div><hr />
