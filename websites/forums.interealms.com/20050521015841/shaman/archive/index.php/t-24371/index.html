<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Brekkee - *Ariu* Are class definition documents still in the works? <br />
                     Brenlo - YES! They are, we in fact had meetings today on this. Now we most likely will not be publically releasing the<br />
                     documents publically. <br />
                     Brenlo - But they will give us solid footing for figuring out the class issues and helping you to understand our points. <br />
                     Brenlo - We want each class to be fun and have strengths and weaknesses. We feel that many classes are there now but<br />
                     some need some tweaking here and there. <br />
                     Brenlo - The docs will help us to figure out where to tweak. <br />
<br />
<br />
A full transcript can be found at http://eq.stratics.com or at the Magecompendium. Fair warning: don't read it when you are already tired or when you still got better things to do - like mowing your lawn or reading 'Krieg und Frieden'.<br />
<br />
I got a simple question to above quote. How in all &lt;bleep&gt; hell is the playerbase supposed to give meaningful feedback or input on class roles, when the supposedly actualized class descriptions are kept secret?<br />
<br />
And that one is outright funny:<br />
<br />
Brenlo - But they will give us solid footing for figuring out the class issues and helping you to understand our points. <br />
<br />
Huh? No really huh? How can those documents help us (the playerbase) to understand anything, when they are NOT published?<br />
<br />
One mage over there on the magecompendium compared Brenlo's way of answering questions to Bush in the recent debates. I really believe that is a bit unfair - to the President.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ranlron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They dodged the question about QA as well, even though it wasnt asked correctly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I got a simple question to above quote. How in all  hell is the playerbase supposed to give meaningful feedback or input on class roles, when the supposedly actualized class descriptions are kept secret?<br />
<br />
I thought this was pretty obvious by now.  They really don't care what the player base feels.  They have a formula, and they are sticking to it. <br />
<br />
They are more than happy to take input on 'non-core' issues like what happened at the hyped guild summit, but when it comes to fundemental class changes, they could care less what you think.  Their numbers are balanced, we are just a bunch of crying babies to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">But they will give us solid footing for figuring out the class issues and helping you to understand our points.<br />
<br />
Huh? No really huh? How can those documents help us (the playerbase) to understand anything, when they are NOT published?The most positive available understanding of this is as follows.<br />
<br />
The current problem is that the designers do not know what the various classes are supposed to be and do.  So when players ask questions about class design, class balance, class anything, designers can't help giving lame answers, because they do not know what the classes are supposed to be and do.<br />
<br />
When they finalize class definitions, then the designers will know what the classes are supposed to be and do.  Then they will be able to answer player questions intelligently.  And so they will be able to help us understand their points.  Because then they themselves will understand their own points, and might therefore be able to explain them in understandable ways.<br />
<br />
I am not confident that this is the right way to read Brenlo's answer, but it's the most positive way of reading it that I can see.  Alternatively, he may just have goofed and said something dumb when he was meaning to say something intelligent.  Or he may have thought he was making a joke.  He does that from time to time, and his jokes don't always work.<br />
<br />
If indeed these definitions are intended to be in-house documents to help game designers answer player questions, the intention remains pretty silly, for a number of reasons.<br />
<br />
(1) It builds in frustration for potential new players.  &quot;Hmm,&quot; I say, &quot;I bought this game, I need to make a character, how bout a shaman?  I wonder what's the official SOE definition of a shaman?  I'd like to know that, so that I can see if that's the kind of character I want to play.&quot;  Sony's answer:  &quot;Ha ha, it will be more fun if you make a shaman, level it up to 70, and figure out once you get there that this isn't what you wanted:  you really should have rolled up a beastlord.&quot;  But actually that's not creating more fun.  That's just creating frustration.<br />
<br />
(2) It does not stop the flow of information, only the flow of goodwill.  The player base as a whole will deduce the overall content of these documents.  It may happen rather quickly, like cracking the 1.5 epics; it may happen more slowly, like solving the 1.0 epics; but it will happen.  And people will post their findings online, compare notes, and it will become a matter of public knowledge that the Sony definition of ClassX is blahblahblah.  When we do, we'll be almost right:  we'll be more cynical and biting about it than Sony is.  Instead of having the information with a positive sense of goodwill regarding what ClassX is supposed to be, we'll have the information, but with a harsh sarcastic edge.<br />
<br />
(3) The point of secrecy here appears to be plausible deniability.  Plausible deniability doesn't work well in other places, and it doesn't work here either.  If SOE publishes their class definitions, people will say, &quot;Hmm according to your information here, ClassX is supposed to work like such-and-such, but it isn't happening that way, and here's why.&quot;  Good Quality Assurance values that kind of feedback from interested customers; and customers value it when Quality Assurance responds well to their feedback.  But it appears that SOE just considers that this kind of feedback might be embarrassing.  So if they can keep us from knowing the definitions, we can't demonstrate when one of the definitions is not being implemented properly.  That would leave them free to ignore or ninja patch or deny the validity of any criticisms, without ever having to admit there was a problem that they needed to fix.<br />
<br />
Sony would be far better off having serious conversation about class issues with the player base, which by now includes a huge amount of wisdom and knowledge about game dynamics.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, they would still do reasonably well offering their own clear information:  this is the definition of ClassX that we are working with, this is the rationale for it, we may still tweak it some but that's what we have in mind.  If you want these skills and abilities then this is the class for you; if this doesn't appeal to you, choose a different class.<br />
<br />
But it appears they are choosing the least helpful strategy:  keeping basic information about how to play the game out of the hands of the players.  (&quot;What class should I play&quot; is about as basic as information in this game can be.)  This strategy does not create a better game.  Instead, it creates frustration instead of fun, sarcasm instead of goodwill, and deniability instead of customer appreciation.</div></div><hr />

Step 2:  ?????<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hmm... Is this because they don't want to take the flack?...<br />
<br />
SHAMAN<br />
This is an obsolete class that has no place in the modern EQ game....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Fundamentally, they can't let players write class descriptions, because players, as a whole, are nutty and unrealistic.  <br />
<br />
It is in fact true that SOE needs to have their own vision of what they think is fair and viable, and at some point folks need to fish or cut bait.  Play or don't play.  <br />
<br />
This is to some extent unchartered territory on what is the best way to communicate these sorts of decisions and how much design responsiveness is reasonable.  There aren't many games like this with this kind of history or dynamic.  <br />
<br />
I think some sort of publication is necessary, but it doesn't necessarily have to have the same kind of detail as an in-house document.  In fact, it clearly shouldn't.<br />
<br />
I feel Gart is viable and effective.  There's always something to bitch about, but that's hardly the same as broken or worthless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>DevvNull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Be realistic, people.  You all know that the minute those documents were released, they'd be torn to shred in such a fashion as to resemble the &quot;cow in the pirahna infested stream&quot; analaogy.   Besides, they'd probably suck anways.   :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think some sort of publication is necessary, but it doesn't necessarily have to have the same kind of detail as an in-house document. In fact, it clearly shouldn't.<br />
<br />
Agree, it doesn't have to include all the leet internal SOE secrets :) .<br />
<br />
Something like the old class descriptions (manual, online during creation, ...) could be completely sufficient, if it would be actualized based on current gameplay and contain some general remarks, what SOE views as basic functions of the different classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Exactly, they could write a volume on each class for internal use, but they really need to update the 1-2 paragpraph descritptions in game and in the manual.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Personally, I don't care what their vision of the Shaman is.<br />
<br />
Nor do I care how the community would rip their vision up, because it doesn't fit each individuals conception.<br />
<br />
But what I do care about, is that they get some frigging clue as to what they want for classes.<br />
<br />
They do need to set some standard, as to what they expect a class to be.  They also need to share that vision with the players.  Because without that vision, they won't know how to fix us, and we won't know what's expected of us.  I wholeheartedly agree with Macnair on the issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">so thay are actully trying to write up a new version of &quot;The Vision&quot; for EQ? wonder if thay can just cut to the chase and find a copy of the old one and just update it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Why even bother mentioning it?<br />
&quot;Oh, yes, we're working on it, but we can't let you see it, so we might as well not even be working on it&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">ky wrote, that they wont release the full definition documents, but kinda an overview, and imo thats better than nothing.<br />
with the situation on the sony board atm making too detailed specifications (or specs at all) would just result in a way way stronger flaming there. I dont mean those posters that are discontent with their current situation but still stay reasonable, i mean those that would even scream murder when they would be given everything they demand. It may be few, but they are the loudest and most vocal part of the boards, especially those that wake up with one allegation in the morning and have to post it in 20 different threads :)<br />
<br />
at least i am an optimist and believe what ky writes, i hope i am right :)<br />
<br />
p.s. even short overviews of the definitions will result in massive uproar. almost everything they do now will result in many to threaten again to end billing, feeling shafted and nerfed to oblivion etc. etc. . its a very difficult situation atm (ok, one soe manoevered itself into for a good part)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Pinot Noir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Besides Class definition (for shaman), the problem is that they change zone difficulity only by slow mitigation. <br />
The adjustment of spawn time, spawn location, aggro path and range of agro is not so easy, so they mainly use slow mitigation for the change of zone difficulity.<br />
It makes players very dull. (especially in the case that all mobs have same mitigation.)<br />
<br />
And our main role in a group ; slow and heal &gt; destroyed easily.<br />
So their definition is not our problem.. problem is their way to change the zone difficulity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">My Kunark manual has class descriptions when I purchased the game.  Oh the nostalgia!  Maybe they should be what they said they would be when the product was sold to people. OMG what a concept!  :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Pretty soon they will figure out why, exactly, the first EQ boards were shut down.<br />
<br />
Without feedback from them, the players will just keep getting more and more frustrated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, they could keep Everquest in the title, and all the class names...otherwise there is not much else useful in the original any more...</div></div><hr />
