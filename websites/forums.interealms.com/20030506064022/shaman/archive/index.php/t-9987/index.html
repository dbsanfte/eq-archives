<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My level 50 shaman is my main character and the one of the highest level. He is the only character I've ever had in everquest since I bought it a few months ago. Since dinging 50 yesterday, I have entered the era of no longer being able to buy my spells but instead I must find them. I have a few questions about this, however.<br />
<br />
1. must all level 50-60 spells must be found off of mobs, or bought in the bazaar?<br />
<br />
2. what are ethereal and spectral parchments? what significance do they hold to a shaman?<br />
<br />
3. Are there 60+ shaman spells? There are none listed on eqshaman.com. I barely ever hear anyone talking about 60+ spells, is this because they are insanely hard to get? because they don't exist?<br />
<br />
4. At which level do the spells for that level only start dropping off of raid-difficulty mobs? Or can I get them through simple 6 person groups?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Stop using eqshaman.com, it is very outdated.  eq.castersrealm.com will have most of your answers about spells.<br />
<br />
51-60 spells can no longer be bought from your old guild vendors.  You have to go to either Firona Vie or the OT Outpost to get them (depending on your race).  You can get the majority of your spells here.  The rest of them are either drop spells or come from a turn in quest.<br />
<br />
In your turn in quest, you turn in either:<br />
<br />
Talisman of Jasinth (level 51)<br />
Spirit of Scale (level 52)<br />
Cripple (level 53)<br />
Cannabalize III (level 54)<br />
<br />
and you recieve:<br />
<br />
Insidious Decay (level 52)<br />
Talisman of Shadoo (level 53)<br />
Shroud of the Spirits (level 54)<br />
Torrent of Poison (level 55)<br />
<br />
There is no correlation between what spell you turn in and what spell you get back.  It is random.<br />
<br />
There is a thread stickied at the top of this forum that tells you where all the rest of your spells can drop.  You can either hunt here and hope for drops, or just buy them in bazaar.  Most kunark spells are very very common and sell for next to nothing, now.<br />
<br />
The parchments you asked about are the answer to your third question.  There ARE 61+ shaman spells and they come from parchments.  There is a vendor in plane of knowledge that accepts both varieties of parchments, and glyphed word runes (just called runes, normally).  When you hand him an ethereal parchment, you get back a random level 61 or 62 spell.  Spectrals yield a 63 or 64, and runes yield a 65 spell.  The ethereal variety spell are very common now and easy to get.  The spectral variety are still rare, but it is starting to become more common to see them on the market.  65 spells are still rare but they're starting to hit the market, usually for ridiculously high prices.  Expect to see prices for everything come way way down by the time you're ready to start buying 61+ spells.<br />
<br />
To answer your final question, you do not need a raid force to get any of your spells.  Torpor and Malo are rare kunark spells, and drop most commonly from kunark dragons (gorenaire, severlous, etc...).  These dragons will take a medium sized raid force for mid 50's players to kill, although they can be done fairly easily by a single group of 65's.  The other sources of torpor and malo are a one-group effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">thank you very much, that answered everything I wanted to know</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">okay I have one last question.<br />
<br />
Basically the only level 60 spells people talk about finding are Malo and Torpor. Are these spells specifically harder to find than other level 60's? or are they just such class-defining spells that they simply must be found to progress, versus FoS or avataar which you don't really need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I had no problem finding both Focus and Khura's in the bazaar and there were multiple copies up, I watched the prices on them and bought both of them somewhen around lvl 58 at good prices (focus was 150pp!).<br />
<br />
I haven't picked up Avatar yet but it's not _that_ big a deal.  The damage increase to melee would be nice but not at an emerald per cast.  I'll wait until I get a better version without a component cost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">link: Shaman Spell Vendors (http://www.nytmare.org/eq/shamanspellvendors.htm) shows where to buy all the vendor-supplied spells. Sticky thread at the top of this forum shows where dropped Shaman spells come from, but you're more likely to get those in the Bazaar.</div></div><hr />
