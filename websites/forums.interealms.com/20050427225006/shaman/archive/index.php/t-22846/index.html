For a different change of pace, I've been hitting Howling Stones lately.  Yes, the north and west wings will have a lot of greens, but there is some decent bazaar loot that drops there and the beastlord will get some decent xp. <br />
<br />
Once you get your south key, you'll find the zone more challenging as it will be mainly dark blue with a little light blue mobs.  The mobs don't hit especially hard and have relatively few hps, but you will get multiple mobs on several pulls.  Cash drops pretty well throughout the zone.<br />
<br />
A good goal here is to obtain your Master Key.  It is a fairly easy quest in that the drops are all ground spawns.  Your only challenge will be getting to them.<br />
<br />
Finally, in the east wing you may find Drusella Sathir.  She drops the urn for the Spirit Wracked Cords which may be a decent quest for you if you have hunted Droga enough to get your chardok faction up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">list your magelo, then give me the unbuffed mana/hps of your beast partner, then i can best gauge your chances, i have written a few guides here and have done insane (albeit sucessful) things.<br />
<br />
with a decent duo, you can rake in exp and loot in certain zones.<br />
<br />
<br />
link the magelo, gimme the numbers and i will look in my scrap book and find a spot :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tindaorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=458591<br />
dont know first thing about linking anything but there ya go<br />
<br />
and te beast has 2810 HP and 2651 mana, still working on her stats<br />
oh and i'm pre elemental as you can tell from my magelo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Trollfarceur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You might want to try the inner part of Acrylia Caverns. Some named drop 2-5kpp loots, the cash drop rate is not bad with all the runes and ore pieces, and at 65 you get about 1pct AA per kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dogpoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">one of the most fun I had with my bst bro was the caller event in fungus grove,was incredible exp for him,decent for me,and he sure was happy when that (fungi) tunic dropped hehe.<br />
<br />
  PoMischief was a lot of fun,ok exp<br />
<br />
  PoJ basement areas can net ya both good exp/pp<br />
<br />
  My bud is a big fan of PoNightmare too,although I am not lol (crappy comp here,he`s got a real nice one,might be why)good exp for the bst,ok for you<br />
<br />
   Sebilis basement can be a lot of fun if youre not alone,too boring if youre solo,decent exp for the bst,more of a charity/fun on your end hehe.<br />
<br />
<br />
   Hates fury was one of my favorite zones,I like the whole pirate thing,arrrrr matey..........some loot to sell from there and decent exp with her dps.<br />
<br />
   If ya dont care about those old-schoool factions a slaughterfest through felwithe was a lot of fun and with those guards dropping the 20pp swords+ everytime,it adds up real quick.Now I think of it,a slaughterfest through any city zone is a blast,pick the race ya hate the most and kill their parents*devil smile*<br />
<br />
  As ya can tell,fun came first for me,the rest sometimes (usually ) came along too.anything ya enjoyed doing a year ago but havent done since will probably be a blast to you.<br />
<br />
    Sirens grotto is great,and any waterspawns can pop fellspine,who can drop a great belt for the beastie 8)<br />
<br />
   If ya dont give a crap about CoV factions,kill some dragons in WW.nothing funner than downing a dragon imo<br />
   that reminds me, Dragons necropolis is a great fun place and maybe can get a PSC if ya dont go for the fungi.<br />
   Have fun and let us know what ya try/liked 8)</div></div><hr />

<br />
dont let that write-up fool ya tho,its probably real old(they make it sound hard)if a shammy can solo it np its easy imo hehe 8)<br />
<br />
the write up there just lets ya know where to get the blargrot,who to give it to,etc,all mobs die fast and are wimps.period 8)<br />
