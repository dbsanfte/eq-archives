What are you looking for? A ground spawn rune?<br />
<br />
It gives you multiple targets that can be taken down solo for runes. One is just a plain single spawning mob that wanders down a canyon, and the others require 3 people to get the expedition then you can do it on your own.<br />
<br />
If this isn't helping you at all then I don't know what will.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you could respond in that thread with what isn't helping..... or say on this one what you are struggling with........ saying that a thread doesn't help much that has been used by many people (myself included) to go and farm multiple runes in a solo fashion just doesn't cut it.<br />
<br />
If you want soloable drops from other expansions there are a plethora of posts in the hunting sections.</div></div><hr />

At least for me, Telosk's link isn't working.  I imagine Grathis is having the same issue.<br />
