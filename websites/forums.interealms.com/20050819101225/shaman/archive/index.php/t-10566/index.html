<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>juanmatus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i want to be a soloing shammy.  i put 25 points into wisdom and the last 5 into stamina, im a barb.  did i do this right or should i reconsider?<br />
<br />
im assuming i should gear myself as a warrior would as opposed to a druid.  any suggestions would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did the same as you when I started my shaman.  If I knew then what I know now and had to do it again...I would have put as many into stamina as I could and then put the rest into wis.<br />

Wis items are a dime a dozen and dirt cheap, at least on my server.  Good STA items are harder to find.  And since after lev 24 you HP bar becomes another Mana bar, the HP will probably benefit you more than the few extra wis points will.<br />
<br />
/shrug  Is all up to you though.  Anything can be fixed with items.<br />
Heck, I know a troll shammy that put the bulk of his points into CHA cause he thought it weould help with slow resists.  Troll, go figure</div></div><hr />

A while back, I put my level 53 troll shaman on the back burner and started a new shaman... I went ogre with all the points into STA and the rest into wis.  I've loved it.  Make sure you have a bit of +agi gear to boost your agi to 75+ and your set.<br />
<br />
Suprisingly the thing I miss about the troll shaman isn't the regen, its the snare necklace.<br />
