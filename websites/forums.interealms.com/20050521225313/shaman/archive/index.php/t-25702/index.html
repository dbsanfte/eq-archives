I have not confirmed this yet, but I am going to try deleting the following files and seeing if it works. I will report back later.<br />
<br />
eqclient.ini<br />
egame.exe<br />
eqgfx_dx8.dll<br />
eqgraphicsdx9.dll<br />
eqmain.dll</div></div><hr />

Well, it worked, eventually. I honestly am not sure what good it does to delete the eqclient.ini file. Its just a bunch of game settings, and it really messes up all your keyboard mapping, colors, etc etc. Wont affect your hotkeys, or your UI other than chat colors, though. But it took me almost an hour to re-set all my keyboard, filters, display settings, etc. Try it without deleting the eqclient.ini, or at worst, save the file and copy the data into the new one that gets created when you patch. The default settings dont even have WSAD movement anymore, dunno whats up with that.</div></div><hr />

The other two shouldn't have any effect on anything, unless they were corrupted somehow.</div></div><hr />
