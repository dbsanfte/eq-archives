<p class="largefont">Click here for full thread: <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=23189">NDA - what's that?</a></p>
<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Seems like some of you praise the NDA but do you really know what you signed up to?<br />
<br />
From the NDA:<br />
<br />
(1) You promise that you (a) are eighteen years of age or older, (b) shall not violate any of the provisions of the EverQuest User Agreement and Software License and you are not an employee, agent or principal of any entity that violates any of the provisions of the EverQuest User Agreement and Software License, (c) are not a principal or employee of a developer, manufacturer or publisher of video or computer games (other than SOE), and (d) are entering into this agreement on a completely voluntary basis with no expectation of consideration, remuneration or any form of compensation whatsoever other than what is expressly provided for in this agreement (IF YOU ARE UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE, YOU MAY NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE BETA PROGRAM);<br />
<br />
(4) You acknowledge that SOE may, in its discretion, charge a fee for the Beta Software and/or participation in the Beta Program, and your participation in the Beta Program is contingent on your payment of such fee(s);<br />
<br />
And in connection to (1) this is from the EULA:<br />
<br />
4. Upon registration, you must select a password. You may not disclose your password to any third party.<br />
<br />
So in summary you must be 18 or older, never give your login-details to anyone and you even risk being charged an unknown amount of dollars for helping SOE test their stuff!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They can charge the fee, but you don't have to pay.  Choice... it's a wonderful thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, looks pretty straight forward to me.   Not over 18? Dont want to play by their rules? Then I guess you dont play.<br />
<br />
I see that you are pretty hung up on the 18yr old thing.  Any reason why?  Is it really too much to ask that they dont have little kids testing their product?<br />
<br />
I know I'm making leaps but come on if they dont put an age limit on it there will be some knucklehead 10 year old trying to beta test.  Do I think the avg 17 yr old can beta as well as an 18 yr old? Yup.  16? Sure. 15? Hrm... lots probably.  14? Might be a few.  They had to make a limit and that limit happens to be 18.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">18 years old = age of responsibility before the law</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Veril is correct. Younger than 18 then any contracts 'signed' are not valid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">while i dont agree with you paying them to help them fix THEIR problems.. the age thing is standard, dont get pushed out of shape over something so trivial (unless of course you're underage and wanted to beta :p)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It sometimes amazes how easy it is to be misunderstood here. I wish I 18...but thats only because I am much older.<br />
<br />
What I was wondering was if anyone younger than 18 would not try to sign up for the betatest if they actually read the NDA first? How on earth would SOE know?<br />
<br />
And if they got away with it and it meant the &quot;signed contract&quot; wasnt valid it would only be in the kids favor.<br />
<br />
And it just amuses/amazes me that a company that so direly needs more testing of their expansions before they are released waste their time trying to cash in on that too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The fee thing is in there so that if they decided to distribute parts of the code using CDs instead of downloads, they could charge for the shipping. And if you didnt want to pay that, you wouldnt be able to continue in the beta even if you had been accepted into it. Its just a legal thing to protect them from liability under those circumstances. They allways have that in their NDAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah pretty standard stuff really.<br />
<br />
Though I agree with the fact that if you were under 18 they would probably never find out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You can't agree or disagree that you are over 18 if you are under 18 :-)   It always amuses me when I see a registration for a website or forum and I'm required to state that I'm over 13 (note - not 18!) .    If I'm not, and I click it anyway, its not legalling binding because I'm not old enough to make the contract! :-)<br />
<br />
Its just like when you register your account to play eq.   You have to be over a certain age to register and actually play eq or have a responsible adult do it and then permit you to use the account.  IF a 6 year old could afford the game and the game cards, SOE would never know that he/she wasn't old enough to play the game and didn't have parental permission to do so.<br />
<br />
Its all basically a CYA thing for SOE :-)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty sure I've even grouped with a few of them!<br />
