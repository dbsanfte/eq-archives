<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sordia Winetrsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heard this rumor and wanted to confirm before I took just one group in to go for Kirn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Prystin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">aye...all mezzable i believe....atleast i know of people that have taken one group all the way to Kirn pretty easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We went for the Ranger and Chanter mobs last week and the Chanter said he couldn't mezz some of the Golems... not sure if he was having trouble (couldn't get it to stick), or they were just un-mezzable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I THINK they are just a hard mez, not unmezzable.  Or perhaps they were to high for the enchanter.<br />
<br />
Been the hole alot the last few days, for the ratguard.  I dont recall our enchanter every say  that a golem was unmezzable, but some she did have trouble with from resists.  She was 54 though.  level probably had alot to do with it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Myfistow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Was there a week ago.  1 group, all the way to Kirn and killed him.<br />
<br />
Had a 60 Chanter who was able to mez everything.  Basically with our one group we owned the Hole.  No ,deaths.  No problems.  We did have a good group though.  I was the second lowest at lvl 55, lowest was 53, and we had 3 60's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's been a very long time since the golems were made mezzable.  A high level chanter can take a single group all the way in as myfistow just did.  Its totally fun and not an easy task.<br />
<br />
Last time I was there with a ranger, rog, chanter and myself.  We could have probably gone way way deep in but half the zone was camped by a monk &amp; cleric.<br />
<br />
The hole is one of the best (chardok is pretty dang close too) dungeon crawl zones in EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Howling Stones to Drusilla is still my favorite Dungeon Crawl. Chardok and the Hole are both way up there though..<br />
<br />
Bakkal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>thorvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Actually the higher level Golems were just made mezzable about 1 or 2 patches ago. Basically the Hole follows the same rules as everywhere else now as far as mez goes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sordia Winetrsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks Thorvan, I thought I was going nuts.   <br />
<br />
I knew from expreiance (about 2 months ago) that some golems in the hole were un-mezzable.  But this has just made my life a lot easier.  <br />
<br />
I am at the lowly end of my guild and pulling a whole raiding party out of the fun new zones they are exploring is hard, but rounding up a few for a single party, especially if I can just get an AE group to go and me and my monkey pet follow, now that is easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">/agree thorvan<br />
<br />
[wish the search function worked, we had a nice thread on this earlier but I couldn't find it]<br />
<br />
Prior to that patch the hole used the same rules as Antonica, Odus, Fadwer (basically 'Old' Norrath)...Which meant that anything over lvl 50 was an end mob (ala Vox and Naggy) and was un-mezzable.<br />
<br />
Of course since the Hole is full of lvl 50+ mobs it was a deathtrap.  The last patch changed it to where the Hole follows the same rules as Kunark, Velious, etc.  <br />
<br />
I think it's great.  The hardest part about the Hole section of the Shaman Epic was getting everyone to the tower.</div></div><hr />
