<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi,<br />
I am thinking about starting a new shaman. But I have a few questions.<br />
Maybe you guys can help me out.<br />
<br />
1. How well does a shaman solo compaired to other classes?<br />
How quick/effienent is it?<br />
<br />
2. Is there any must have gear I should try to get?<br />
<br />
3. Are you guys overall happy with the class?  Do you feel that you are balenced? (as far as EQ balence goes anyway lol) <br />
And if not why?</div></div><hr />

My advice, is that we can solo very well yes, in most situations.  Not as well as chanters or necros can in some areas, but overall just the same.<br />
<br />
Don't ask the question about class balancing.  All that you have to do is see the topics of about 20 of the last 25 threads on this page and you will see that alot are not happy with shamans.  Me personally, i love my shaman and don't plan on playing another class or making him my main ever.</div></div><hr />

I see from your Sig yor shaman has 316 AA but your Bst has only 6 AA.  What if your BL had same AA / flags and gear? Would you chance mains? If not why?<br />
How the heck did you level your BL just grinding, PL etc?  Just curious since im toying with a Bst atm.<br />
<br />
*yes im going there!  :D *</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Shamans are probably the most versatile soloers out there, meaning they can take on pretty rough spots solo and keep going. They aren't as efficient as they lack tooks like (good) snares or fear that necros have, but aren't far behind either. They are lots of fun and for many reasons. Get a rusty weapon and start whacking away.</div></div><hr />

Actually, my beastlord has 7AAs (got the 7th free one last night when I finally talked to the guy about my stories).  Personally, I play my shaman cause I've loved him since creation.  I created him from scratch in May 2002.  I created the beastlord in September 2002 just cause I liked his name, and I wanted to play a class that closely resembles the one that I love - Shaman.  So, i created him but I never did anything with him.  Fast Forward to Jan of this year.  We have so much leather gear that has been rotting in the elementals/time that I decided to dust him off and get him his levels so that I can loot some of them.  I decided to PL him up to 65 (used ranger till 25, druid till 42, then guildees shaman till 65).  My beastlord just dinged 65 a week ago, and he has all the same flags that my shaman has (exception of just missing Fennin for time access).  I don't enjoy him like I enjoy my shaman.  I've played 65 beastlords.  I have played the betabuffed one on beta for a bit, as well as having access to a few of my friends beastlords.  They just aren't as enjoyable as my shaman.  Dont' get me wrong, it was fun to play them, but NOT as fun as my shaman.<br />
<br />
Take into account that my shaman ahs well over 150 days played on him, and my beastlord just dinged 9 days (prob a 1/2 day of that too was on raids since the shaman and bst are on the same account).  So, in just under 2 years, I have managed to played another class a total of 9 days, while I've played my shaman alot more.  My beastlord is about as twinked as you can get (exception of shoulders), and i'm starting to get some stuff on pickup raids or rotting for him.  Doesn't matter, even with another 400 AAs and full elemental + gear, he just won't be the same as Val.  Put it this way, I was in an earth group with my guild last night on Val, and I switched out to Ticking to give them SD.  I decided to play him for a little bit cause he was sitting at 1% into 65.  Well, needless to say, 10 min later I was missing canni and malos so much that I switched back (that wasn't the only reason, just that I didn't plan on playing him for more than a few min).  My slow got resisted at least 2 on almost every mob.<br />
<br />
Put it this way.  I came into this game playing a shaman.  I will leave this game playing a shaman.</div></div><hr />

Well I know what you are talking about leather rotting. Im on the same vision quest as you are.  The amount of stuff rotting in Time/Ep leather based is silly.  Guess I will try to get a druid to help me out never did any Power leveling. Just never liked to.<br />
<br />
Thanks for letting me know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">there are lvls were we solo easy and then right before we get a new set of spells it gets tuffer (lvl 33, before we get our first pet for instance), but if you look over the hunting grounds section you will find all kinds of places to hunt.<br />
<br />
must have gear?  if you are a twink, buy an Iksar BP for the regen, get a nice pointy stick, or a good blunt.  please don't ask about best race and the differences in them.  just pick whatever you like.<br />
<br />
balanced?  erm.  shaman change the most over the course of their game play, more than any other class.  <br />
<br />
we are the first class to get SoW, at 9, but we are the last pet class to get a pet; at lvl 34.  we have decent melee skill till 50-60.  we get root, and gate.  but not see invis till 29.<br />
<br />
our heals are decent untill you get to high lvl content, then they just don't keep up and/or take way to long to cast.<br />
<br />
we have good mana regen thru the active method of cannibalization, but later other classes have better thru passive activities.<br />
<br />
by 65 more shaman look at the added stats of their primary slot over the damage/delay ratio, and some of them turn into pure casters.<br />
<br />
we have slow, and that has been our greatest gift, and our greatest curse.  <br />
<br />
as the game has changed with mobs having fewer hps but greater dps, the shaman role has become less necessary as mobs do not last as long as the duration of our spells do, and we waste mana by having a spell land on a mob that dies 10sec later.  Trials and LDoN come to mind.<br />
<br />
given enough time, shaman can kill solo lots of content.  unfortunately the content is shifting to burst dps and burst heals; we do not currently keep pace in those categories.  also the exp gained from solo'ing is not as it used to be.<br />
<br />
lastly, we have a stackability issue on large events.  after 2-3 shaman, you may find that the rest are not needed.  and i am personally concerned that shaman may become the bot class of the future.<br />
<br />
there are times tho when we shine and the fun factor is to the max.  as the content changes many shaman are worried about usefulness, let alone the fun factor.<br />
<br />
then again, there are shaman that see the issue entirely differently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Don't make a shaman.  Seriously.<br />
<br />
If you want to get into a raid guild your chances are slim that they'll actually need you since we don't stack terribly well.<br />
<br />
In terms of balance we bring alot less than an enchanter, cleric, druid or beastlord bring to groups.  I'd wait until after GoD is released to see if things get any better before investing plat and time into a new shaman.</div></div><hr />

the high end members of this board moaning and cramping about how broken the class is.  Enjoy yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">A lot of what you get out of a class depends on what you put into it.  A good player can get the most out of a class and excel while a gimp can't get by even in god mode.<br />

1. How well does a shaman solo compaired to other classes?<br />
How quick/effienent is it?<br />
<br />
At various stages, particularly at 65 once you start racking up superior gear and AA, shaman are potentially very strong soloists.  Soloing efficiency varies.  Some claim incredible xp gains from it while I personally find that almost any grouping crushes solo xp.  The nice thing is that shaman CAN solo, and can often solo very interesting content, such that you can often farm loot or solo quests which can be rewarding in a variety of ways.<br />
<br />
Despite shaman being able to solo, they are highly desired for groups and the strength of the shaman lies in filling in the gaps in a group and enabling a group to fight more effectively (debuffing being a part of this).  I personally feel that shaman are highly suited for grouping even though we can solo.<br />
<br />
2. Is there any must have gear I should try to get?<br />
<br />
Opinions vary.  Gear is important in EQ but in the early stages it won't be a big factor.  Over time there are particular flavors of gear and some items you may want to get.<br />
<br />
3. Are you guys overall happy with the class?  Do you feel that you are balenced? (as far as EQ balence goes anyway lol) <br />
And if not why?<br />
<br />
This is a bad time to ask this question - check any of the MANY recent posts regarding shaman issues and/or the GoD expansion.<br />
<br />
Personally I love the shaman class and find it very fun.  You say 'as far as EQ balance goes' - which is accurate - not all classes in EQ are equal vs. all of the many different types of content in EQ - and they shouldn't be or there'd be little point in classes or grouping.  I do feel that the shaman class has it better than many other classes - we can solo reasonably well, we're highly desired for grouping, and overall, we have a lot of abilities and options so we more readily adapt and contribute to new situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">1. How well does a shaman solo compaired to other classes?<br />
How quick/effienent is it?<br />
<br />
My first character was a monk.  As I leveled her past level 40, I was finding it difficult to find places for her to solo with the gear she had.  I wasn't able to amass a large cash base, and I started to become fustrated with my monk.<br />
<br />
So, I began my quest for a class that could solo, easy to get gear and be able to be an assest in a group.  In my search, the two classes that were at the top of the list: shaman and necro.<br />
<br />
The more I read about Shamans the more I wanted to play one.  I felt a certain kinship to it I guess, and I created my second character, Korelen.  He was created when spells like KEI and Focus could be cast on anyone.<br />
<br />
I took my time in the beginning leveling.  I wanted to get used to the character, and I spent a lot of time in Halas and EF.  I worked on quests to get armor and spells since I did not have a lot of cash to gear my new shaman.<br />
<br />
The lower levels always go fast, and I started to really slow down when I was in the 50s.  I think I soloed 60 / grouped 40 when I reached the 50s.  <br />
<br />
In the end, the question is:  why do you want to level fast?  Are you looking for a means to farm for cash or items?  Or, are you looking to make a bot that you tote around?<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Is there any must have gear I should try to get?<br />
<br />
I followed the school of ac &gt; hp &gt; wis when I was soloing.  I had decent ac when I made 40.  Slowly when I started to group more I flipped to hp &gt; ac &gt; wis.<br />
<br />
A regen item is always nice ( many people suggest the Iksar Cer. BP ) or a Fungi Tunic if you can afford one.  This helps if you canni alot.  A horse will be of value to you as well.  As for weapons, I got whatever I could get my hands on: 1HB or Piercers.  For the longest time ( to well into the high 40s ), I had Ry'gorr armor on - it is cheap or easy to get if you have a character that can farm.  I never had excellent gear, and I still was able to do amazing things.<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Are you guys overall happy with the class?  Do you feel that you are balenced? (as far as EQ balence goes anyway lol) <br />
And if not why?<br />
<br />
After a year and a half, I am still playing my Shaman.  There were times when I was a little bored, and I created a necro as well as a rogue as well as a druid, rangers, you name it.  I would play those for a few days, but I always came back to my Shaman.  I love my character, and I play him well.  <br />
<br />
I am a little disappointed with our healing, but if you max out your Healing AA's it is not as bad.  I can slow and heal easy in normal ldon adventures.  If I need mana, then I would canni 4 until canni 5 refreshes.  Mana is usually not a huge issue unless we get a lot of adds and I have to spam heal the MT.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shaman can solo but it's not quick OR effecient.  If you want to solo quickly and effeciently make a necro or maybe a beastlord.<br />
<br />
2. Is there any must have gear I should try to get?<br />
<br />
There are newbie quests for almost all race/classes now,  you can get decent armor doing those for you first 10 levels or so.<br />
<br />
3. Are you guys overall happy with the class? Do you feel that you are balenced?<br />
<br />
I am happy with the way shaman are now,  but don't expect the class to get any better.   Apparently shaman are a big joke over at SoE and deserve nothing  ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Id say if you are wanting to start a new character then buy GoD and roll up a berserker.  But playing my shaman is fun tho ... it is just very aggrivating being ignored like we have been :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Want a good advice? Don't play a shaman, that's the best one. Play some class which is not being ignored or forgotten by SOE, for example, beastlords. Shamans are M.I.A. for SOE since Velious expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">1. How well does a shaman solo compaired to other classes?<br />
How quick/effienent is it?<br />
<br />
In terms of versatility we solo very well. There are few mobs that any other class can solo and we can't. We can solo in a huge number of places and get xp and loot from it.<br />
<br />
How quick is it? Probably about medium compared to other classes. We somewhat lack in dps, at least until you start stacking dots like mad at higher levels. On the plus side, once you get canni V (an AA skill) we have awesome mana regen, and even before that the other canni spells give decent regen. Not as good as necros (imho), but its good. Thus, whilst we kill slowly, we have little to no downtime between kills.<br />
<br />
2. Is there any must have gear I should try to get?<br />
<br />
To start with, a regen bp and a nice weapon, perhaps with a dd proc. Fungi for big twinking, iksar regen for something a bit more affordable. At 46, a Jaundiced Bone Bracer. Also around that time you'll stop meleeing so effectively, and might consider a horse.<br />
<br />
At 58+, focus on getting your spells before worrying too much about gear.<br />
<br />
3. Are you guys overall happy with the class? Do you feel that you are balenced? (as far as EQ balence goes anyway lol) <br />
And if not why?<br />
<br />
Up until you start serious raiding, I think the shaman class is as balanced as any other. We solo reasonably well and we can make worthwhile contributions to groups. There are patches where we are very weak, particularly some level ranges pre 55 between getting heal upgrades. At other times we do very nicely, like when we just get a new pet level, new heal or new DoT.<br />
<br />
Problems start at raiding levels. We don't stack too well, 2-3 shaman is plenty for almost all raids, and quite often just one or two can do everything necessary. Furthermore, as beastlords get their level 65 slow and decent gear and AAs, they start to be able to take our place in xp groups, and enchanters with their charmed pets often get taken in preference to us too. However, I still find LDoN groups without too much problem - our utility as healer+slower who can also do soem cc is still valuable.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall - I love my shaman, still play him lots and would still say they are a good, fun class to play. Few other classes have such a variety of things to do, or such a range of options as to how to handle a given situation. We can solo, group, or raid. You can kite, tank in teh face, root-rot or get scared and gate. <br />
<br />
What we can't do: We can't kill things particularly fast, our nukes are very poor. We can't do much on raids if you're not the no.1 or no.2 shaman. Our heals aren't enough to keep up against high end slow-mitigating mobs. We can't do much dps without getting aggro.</div></div><hr />

Rep bump !!@!@!!11!!one!!<br />
<br />
Seriously though. Gloriana pretty much said all that should be worried about. Despite the choas around here ATM ( itll pass is always does ) This is a great and fun class all the way to 65. You can solo well, though arent the best, you can heal well, though arent the best. Wild horses couldnt drag me from the idea that we are still the best and most fun class in EQ to play.<br />
<br />
For me.<br />
<br />
Good luck mate.</div></div><hr />

The day we stop helping newbies and just assume with no real evidence things like that, is the day we make a big mistake i think.<br />
