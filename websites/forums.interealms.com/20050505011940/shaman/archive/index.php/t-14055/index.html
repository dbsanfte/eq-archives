<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eilderts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The account that my main char is on is screwed up atm so I have been playing a froggy shaman on my friend's account. He has every expansion EXCEPT for PoP (maybe not Luclin either...). <br />
<br />
So I gotta do this the hard way. Are there any good quests for a froggy to get items even comparable to teh PoK quests (BMM, Antique Ring, Fine Cut Mask)? And where should I hunt&gt;? I'm lvl 7 atm and rising pretty fast.<br />
<br />
Please do not use this thread as a place to make Frogger jokes about nooses etc. I really do need help with this since I probably won't be able to go to Paludal or Bazaar and certainly won't be able to use PoK portals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Paludal and the bazaar are Luclin zones.  PoP zones are ALL 46+ (aside from PoK, which won't net you any exp).  Exp wherever you normally would.<br />
Also, frogs look to have some pretty in depth newbie quests, I made a mule frog and followed around all these people and got to level 2 w/o leaving the city or killing anything.  Then they send you out into the swamp to gather more stuff, for newbie armors.  Worth a shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ailith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Head to Kurns at about lvl 9-10 if you're twinked at all. XP bonus was unmatched I found. At about 19-20, go to Paludal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eilderts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">How do I get there? Port/spires? <br />
<br />
Anyways, yes the armor is VERY nice for a newb, I wish my iksar could wear some peices (at 35 :P) Here's what I've quested so far:<br />
<br />

<br />
I have most of the pieces for BP and boots and arms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ailith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Field of Bones - I always used the PoP stones but you can get ports. Once in Field of bones, head to the north side of the &quot;pit&quot; in the center of the zone.<br />
I leveled from 11-15 in about 2 hours - looted numerous stacks of bone chips which I ended up selling at PoK for 40pp/stack to a couple necros (guess there was a run on chips that day).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No matter what you do, you're gonna have some problems here.  If you have Luclin, you can use the spires.  However, as you go from DL (with monsters that will be able to kill you with a single blow) to FV, you go through a monster-rich area.  Kurn's is a good area for Iksar shammy's or anyone PoP-enabled, but without the availability of the books, you've got a GOOD chance of making multiple trips, getting killed several timesa along the way.  Also, your closest soulbinder will be in Shadowhaven.  I'd stick to Innoruk for a couple levels and then move to Paludial, if Luclin-enabled and Guk if not....<br />
<br />
Oh, and Ailith, while your signature is very pretty, it's also a HUGE violation of the board signature rules.  It's not often that we see a sig that breaks three areas of the rules by so much, CONGRATS  :)<br />
&quot;Sig guidelines are no more than 100 high, roughly 250 wide and less than 25K in size and no java/flash things&quot; - Sunmoon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So you're in Innothule.... Getting to FoB would be difficult and IMO not worth it.  Getting to Paludal would be easier and definately worth it, when you get to level 10+.  The first part of the run is the same - get yourself to NK or GFay so you can take the spires.<br />
<br />
The GFay run is what I'd choose IF froggies are non-KOS in Freeport and Butcher, which I'm not positive of.  If so, just run north from Innothule to South Ro - Oasis - North Ro - Freeport, boat to Butcher, run to GFay.<br />
<br />
The NK run is goes through Innothule to Feerott, then to Rathe Mtns (you can avoid aggro here if you're careful), then Lake Rathe, South Karanas and then North Karanas.  You will most likely need help, OR just bank all your gear and make the run before level 10, if you die no big deal.  BIND in Shadowhaven before proceeding.  In fact, the perfect level is level 9, because then you'll have SoW but won't lose XP for dying (do you leave a corpse at level 9)?<br />
<br />
Once in Luclin, you can get to Paludal easily, but if you're only level 9 you will really need to go THROUGH Paludal and go to Shar Vahl.  Bind in SV and then XP grind from the SV side of Paludal, it's much easier there.  You will need invis to get through, beg at the SH zoneline long enough and you'll get it.<br />
<br />
If you really, really want to go to FoB, the run from the spires in DL to the FV zone is not bad IF you get SoW, lev, and possibly invis at the outset.  Go through the tunnel between the spires and the rest of the zone, then climb the glaciers on either side of the tunnel.  Get as high as you can, make sure you are looking level (hit HOME), get lev up, and take off.  As a small race, you won't hit the ground until you get to the zoneline; this lets you bypass ALL the nasty mobs in DL.  Zone into FV and run straight through the tunnels; when the tunnel opens out, hug the RIGHT zone wall really hard and then swim across to the city.  Bind at the soulbinder on the docks in FV.<br />
<br />
Leave the main gates of FV and run RIGHT to the cliff edge.  Run up the cliff edge, watching carefully for Drolvarg aggro, and hug the south and east zone edges tight until you get to the Swamp of No Hope zone.  You'll have to leave the zone edge to go around the Drolvarg temple, just watch carefully for aggro there.  From SoNH it's a simple straight shot up the east and north zone walls to the FoB zonein.<br />
<br />
The PoK books really made it nice and easy to get around, which I appreciate at high levels... but it was fun accepting the CHALLENGE of moving around in the old days... I still remember the rush I got when we avoided the spiders and safely arrived in LOIO at level 17, or when we made the run from Qeynos to Freeport at 13.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ailith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sunmoon - I tried my best :)<br />
Didn't do a test first so didn't realize it - but made a change.<br />
Will do the test first next time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Field of Bone/Kurn's Tower is a good place to level up to 16 or so. Without PoP it's going to be difficult to get there. The only spire takes you to the Dreadlands, and running through DL can be dangerous as the Giants, Dvolrags(sp?), and some Drachnids see thru invis. If they get a hold of you you'll be dead in a single hit. Same with trying to run through FV. You may want to avoid it and stick to some old world zones or go to Paludal at 10 and stay there until 20.<br />
It is easier to get to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tobasko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Sorry man, there are no quests that come anywhere near the PoK quests.  The best you can expect is probably to do your epic subquests as you level up.  <br />
<br />
As for hunting, here is an extraordinarily boring way to get into the low 50s...<br />
<br />
Move to the Oasis of Marr when you hit 12th.   <br />
Move to the Timerous Deep Skeleton Island when you hit 14th or 15th. <br />
Move to the Northern half of The Overthere when you hit 20.  <br />
Move to the Lake of Ill Omen at 24 and try to get into a Sarnak fort Group.  <br />
When you hit 30th move back to the overthere and get into a Ledge group.  <br />
When you hit 40th move to the Dreadlands and get into a North Wall Group.  <br />
When you hit 50 move to Gunthak and pull the steps to the Luggald fort.<br />
When you hit 53 move to Dolak and take over first boat (Stormwave).  When it becomes too easy/boring move to the second boat.<br />
After that, go to the planes - that is,  if you havn't killed yourself with boredom by then.<br />
<br />
If you fall in with a good group of friends, here are some diversions you can take along the way to spice things up.<br />
<br />
It used to be that in your late teens High Hold Pass. was THE place to be.  So much so that it was camped 24-7.  Now, with the advent of PC, the pass is rarely camped.  <br />
<br />
Gnomes in SolA.  Best experience in the game for the late 20s. <br />
<br />
Goblins in Nurga.  The gobs are various classes and are in the level range of 32-35.  Most of them can be single or double pulled and the zone can be handled by a pair of 35s.  Better hurry on this one, since Nurga is being upgraded in the near future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Eilderts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">hmm, HHK goblins are great for me from 24-32ish because I often start playing during odd hours when I can get into a group. <br />
<br />
Sol A was a GREAT place for me at 34 on my main.<br />
<br />
Nurga...can you ellaborate? I don't even know what you're talking about but it sounds interesting...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tobasko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Nurga is a dungeon accessed from Kunark's Frontier Mountains.  There are five notable things about Nurga.  <br />
<br />
First, you enter the mines my jumping off of a waterfall that is impossible for some to climb back up.   If you are bringing any melee friends with you you'll need to invis them to get them out.<br />
<br />
Second, none of the mobs see through Invis. <br />
<br />
Third it is the location of the sleeping oger for the monk Epic quest.   He is non-agro and is really only natable because of the area near where he sleeps is chock full goblins that come two at a time.<br />
<br />
Fourth,  the goblins all give +chardoc faction hits.  If you are going to  do any of the quests in chardoc you can get a bunch of your faction work out of the way in Nurga. (and get xp for it too)<br />
<br />
Fifth, Goblin Warders have the chance to drop the Shroud of Nature.  It used to be uber, but not sells for 100-200pp in the bazaar(or 10pp to a vendor).  It's lore and  I've let more rot than I care to think about.<br />
<br />
Here's what EQ atlas has to say about Nurga.  It is notable beacuse it is partially wrong and may be the reason that the zone is usuall empty.  LINK (http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/minesofnurga.html)<br />
<br />
The entrance to the Mines is kind of tricky. There is a large waterfall at the entrance from the Frontier Mountains, which is a very long, and painful fall. This waterfall can actually be climbed if you're careful, so isn't as dangerous as you might think. Going upstream actually leads to a safer way to access most, but not all, of the rest of the Mines. The entrance from Temple of Droga, however, is very one-way, and leads down into a room with goblins in it deep within the Mines, so it's best to be ready.<br />
All of the goblins in the Mines will aggro anyone, and many of them are casters who cast damage shields. They also like to run away when they are hurting, which can be dangerous with this many creatures around.<br />
<br />
The spiders are tougher than the goblins are, and hit hard and move fast. They also will group together to fight in that area. Located in their area as well is the Sleeping Ogre, who really isn't sleeping and will attack anyone inside of his huge aggro radius.<br />
<br />
The Burynai are the hardest, mostly because they are in large groups and come to fight that way. Crowd control is essential, and the pathing in this area is known to be especially bad. <br />
 <br />
<br />
Here's what wrong with the above description.<br />
<br />
 The Spiders and Burynai are all gone now and have been replaced by more goblins.<br />
<br />
 The pathing is fixed.<br />
<br />
 Pretty much zone wide, when the goblins run, they run toward the sleeping oger.  If you start near him and work your way out you really don't need to worry too much about runners.<br />
<br />
 The sleeping oger is now non-agro.  Even is you do agro him accidentially, fighting him is about the same as fighting one of the goblins.  It's proabably a good idea not to fight him though, since he is part of the monk epic quest and isn't on the same respawn timer as the rest of the zone. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I leveled a necro from 39 to 45 there solo.  The xp flew by and I made about 2000 pp in cash, fine steel, gems and Shouds of Nature.</div></div><hr />
