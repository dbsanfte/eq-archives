<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xekiu Bludpool</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Unfortunely, Xekiu the oracle in EQ got shelved for now since my playtime got destroyed.....  But morrowind can be saved and quit much easier, so i been playing it instead.<br />
<br />
First thing, it rocks.  Graphics are awesome and very well designed.  But when i tried playing a shaman, i found no such class.....  until i realized that you can MAKE classes!<br />
<br />
So here is my question to everyone who is playing morrowind and love the shaman class...  How would you make a shaman in Morrowind?<br />
<br />
Here is my idea:<br />
<br />
Race:  Orc/Nord<br />
Class: Magic<br />
Stats:  Endurance and Willpower<br />
Sigh:  up to you, but i would choose The Steed (in honor of SoW) or The Lord (for those troll lovers)<br />
<br />
Major:<br />
Medium Armor (END)<br />
Restorative (WIL)<br />
Destruction (WIL)<br />
Spear (END)<br />
Alteration (WIL)<br />
<br />
<br />
Minor:<br />
Blunt Weapons (STR)<br />
Mysticism (WIL)<br />
Alchemy (INT)<br />
Athletics (SPD)<br />
Block (AGL) or Heavy Armor..  not sure about this one</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You're going to need a mana modifier on INT, no damage caster can survive in Daggerfall and from what I've seen Morrowind without at least 1.5 mana modifier to INT preferably 2.<br />
<br />
I'm playing an Orc Knight, he has Restoration  and a piddly 32 INT which means 32 mana, not much room for fizzles which come hot and heavy at the start. I took Steed as a sign.<br />
<br />
If you want +3 or +2 for bonus INT stat at level-up you are going to have to buy INT using skill-ups at trainers before you level. All level-up bonuses on the Stats depend on what skills you leveled getting that level even misc skills count. The point is some magic skills use will instead of int and this won't get you mana.<br />
<br />
Best thing I did was soul trap one of those birds and enchanted (Enchant-a knight minor skill) a cheap amulet for 5 to 10 self heal (not bad, HP's are fairly low in this game) takes 1 of 20 charges to use and casts fast in battle, recharges fast and never fizzles, I only use the spell heals after battle or before sleeping to bring skill up, I want Restoration for the cures mainly.<br />
<br />
Don't forget mark and recall (mysticism), can't dungeon crawl without those and the Intervention spells that bring you back to a temple are great. I set mark at dungeon entrance, use intervention when full of loot, sell in temple or town after admiring all the merchants up to the 80's or 90's, then recall back. Yes as a knight I get the speech skill as a major.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Morrowind-Single player CRPG.<br />
Direct descendant of Daggerfall.<br />
<br />
In Daggerfall you could play for months and not even do the mainline quest. It could become repetitious at times as quests and dungeons were randomly generated. Some say too random.<br />
<br />
Daggerfall was known for it's bugs and patches but it was also the best first person RPG experience out there at the time and for not having 3d acceleration it sometimes gave startling good views (for the time)as long as you didn't get too close to anything.<br />
<br />
The skill and leveling system was open ended, you do it, you learn it, there was vampirism and lycanthropy. I spent several weeks playing as a vampire and living in a tomb, I was bitten and got the disease several days later and  took damage during the day. This lasted till the hunters found me and I was offered a &quot;cure&quot;.<br />
<br />
You could make your own spells and items, there were several novels worth of books to read, the land was several times larger than Great Britian and would take as long to walk it in game as Britian would in real life.<br />
<br />
The biggest complaints besides the numerous crashes was that the game mostly repeated everything after a while, that once you saw a small area you essentially saw the whole world.<br />
<br />
That may be true but I played it on and off for several years and always managed to find something new to do. I never &quot;beat&quot; the game but I still did a ton of stuff. It was pretty much a virtual world with limits but remarkable for it's day.<br />
<br />
Morrowind is a true 3d continuation of that, maybe what Daggerfall could have been if the technology was there, I'm sure it's limits will be found.<br />
<br />
Morrowind is smaller and tighter and maybe slightly more scripted than Daggerfall. It's too early to tell but I got it on Friday and it's been a whale of a good time.<br />
<br />
One thing included with Morrowind is an editor that will allow modules to be constructed that will add items, spells, dungeons etc. to the Morrowind world, so with time who knows what it will become. I guess you could make a uber sword of everything with it but it's single player only so you ruin only your own game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I absolutely loved Daggerfall but I got the same motion sickness from that game that I get from most of the first person shooters.  I think I would have had the same reaction to AC had it not been for the over-the-shoulder view.<br />
<br />
I assume that Morrowind has the latest graphics so it may not be a problem.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Reidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hehe...still no DSL.  DAMN CLECs!!!<br />
<br />
Anyway, picked up Morrowind to stave off the EQ hunger, and though Im at work, I still remember many of the things I used.<br />
<br />
Major:<br />
<br />
Axe<br />
Medium Armor<br />
Block<br />
Restoration<br />
Blunt<br />
<br />
Minor: <br />
<br />
Sneak<br />
Light armor<br />
Athletics<br />
Destruction (?)<br />
Security<br />
<br />
While this template may not be EQ Shamanesque..it does great for me.  Basically, Im a warrior with no downtime.  I have never been in an engagement where my health has dropped below 50%, and I can always pull with a nice fireball :)<br />
<br />
Hmmmm...maybe Im closer to a Paladin than Shammy.<br />
<br />
****..hell, I dont care :)<br />
<br />
Having fun with the game...but I tell ya what.  I miss the social aspect of EQ.  Are stand alone RP ruined for me?  Hmmmm, let you know in a week or so ;)<br />
<br />
Can't wait to get back into EQ.</div></div><hr />
