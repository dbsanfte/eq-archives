<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Be warned, I tend to ramble when something weighs heavily on my mind.<br />
<br />
I've logged 22ish hours in a single week (divided among 3 days) farming items in Ssra temple for guildmates' and alliance mates' Emp keys and VT keys. Two 6ish hour stints and a 9 hour bonanza tonight. (holy eyestrain batman!) I even religiously kept track of who was there so credit can be given for the farming time, as our guild/alliance does value this.<br />
<br />
Total booty...6 bags, 11 shards, 4 pieces of metal, and more spells than I can count (including the rare Hammer of Divinity for my cleric..yay!). I've earned at least a full AA point from all the accumulated raid experience. I've probably earned more raid credit from farming than from raiding this last week.<br />
<br />
The problem is that I am starting to run into people who ONLY want to do TMs or Shards, rather than help with everything. I think I had one person ask about doing Idols, but everyone else seemed pretty cut and dry Taskmasters-or-shards. The problem is, my last emp key piece is the ring. I don't intend to stop farming when I finish the key, but everyone seems to think I will. I know plenty of people do. This afternoon, when I made our first attempt to take a ring camp, we cleared the floor twice when several members of the group stated that they would be returning to the basement to farm shards because they wanted to finish their VT keys and leave, which in a way made sense as the guild was doing VT that day. This however would have left us quite short and probably unable to continue on our own for other camps. Trying to be a good sport, I rallied the troops and went along with their request, and we got shards for those who needed them to finish their keys, and one spare. (The two who finished their keys did in fact leave within about an hour.) We had about half the total number of shards we needed (and our tank needed a supper break) when we decided to try another camp for a while.<br />
<br />
Then we got a bunch of new folks to join up and everyone wanted to hit TM again. Okay, we did TM. Scored 2 more bags. Everyone agrees we can finally try for rings. YAY! We pull up to 2nd floor and start clearing...goes great for 90 minutes or so, then a bad pull almost wipes us. Ended up having to have a monk flop us all back down to the first floor for rezzes, because of see invis mobs blocking the route for those who had survived the evac. No big deal, we rez and I ask who is up for another try. Lots of people respond in a positive way, except...<br />
<br />
Everyone wants to go back to TM again because they've repopped. We are ringless, and 3 of us need rings to finish our Emp keys. All 3 of us have sat in the zone for almost nine hours today, all but 2 hours of it or so working on other drops than what we needed. I state that they can go back to TM, it's their choice, but then I am sorry but I will need to say goodnight. All of a sudden, I'm the bad guy. People ended up just plain leaving the group. The server crashed 20 minutes later so it ultimately didn't matter, I suppose, but I really am boggled at why folks didn't want to stay and at least walk away with one complete key. After all, we did it for those who needed shards earlier, didn't we? No one balked then. Why now? THAT is what bothers me.<br />
<br />
If I could get every drop everyone needed all at the same time I would. Seriously. But what happens when the person who wants to help everyone, wants to camp the guy that drops their own last piece? People shy away. I will camp that darn temple until it turns to dust getting people their drops. That doesn't bother me. What bugs me is &quot;2nd floor in Hate&quot; syndrome*. <br />
<br />
* (I chose this term because on almost every Hate raid I attend, as soon as the call to move to 2nd floor is made, classes whose armor only drops on 1st floor start leaving for whatever reason. Basically, they will no longer benefit so they don't want to stay.)<br />
<br />
Yes, that last paragraph probably sounds like hypocrisy. I voiced my intent to leave if they went back to TMs, but yet I hate people who do just that. My words were spoken out of frustration for my own situation. Just as I had done with shards, I'd have likely stayed and helped (and watched more successful looters walk away, with my luck). I'm a real sucker for helping people, even when I have a good idea that I will get left behind for it.<br />
<br />
What is one to do? Any of you had similar situations and think you can offer me some advice? I'm all ears. I like happy endings, even if they take some work.<br />
<br />
I want to finish my key. And PlayerX's key. And Player #2562, 1569, 209, and 214's keys too. I love helping people. I am just starting to feel like I am being taken advantage of and I don't really know what to do about it. I can't progress alone; I need help. The best way to get help is to give it in exchange. The question becomes, how much more do I have to give? If I knew there was a light at the end of the tunnel, I know I wouldn't be this stressed.<br />
<br />
Short disclaimer - I am in no way upset with anyone who left or who didn't want to camp rings. People have priorities. It's just the sheer situation that is bothering me, not the people involved. I'd go back tomorrow with every one of them and do it again. I just want that understood now.<br />
<br />

/em walks over to a nice shady tree to ponder, hoping Tunare can provide an answer to this dilemma.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't think there is an answer, because they quite simply ARE taking advantage of you. People who will ask for help with their tasks but won't help me with mine sicken me, and I eventually stop helping them. Screw their priorities, if they had any honor at all they would help you after all you've done for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kelliani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree with Kensei.  The game itself has degenerated into a &quot;all for me&quot; concept.  I personally try to avoid it, but I do occasionally rabidly pursue a goal at the expense of others (meaning I'm not available to help them until my goal is complete).  But the flip side of that is...I WILL help when I'm finished.<br />
<br />
People need to learn that the more they just take and take and take and never give back, the more respect they lose in the eyes of honorable players who do a favor for a favor.  I wish there was a simple solution, Kat; but there really is not.  :(  I'm a bit too under the influence for any heavy thinking to help you out other than words of encouragement to keep plugging away at it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks, guys. <br />
<br />
I plan on continuing the crawls to help as many people as I can.  One thing about being in a larger guild is that the majority just doesn't see it as a priority to help a few people finish keys, and that's one thing I do want to do for my guildmates because I know getting help is a pain. This isn't a &quot;help me finish, I'm sick of this&quot; post. I'd just like to see my piece drop before I spend another 30 hours hunting everything BUT Commanders. If I gotta spend 30 hours hunting Commanders to see a drop, that's one thing. At least the effort would be being made then to try camping them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hopwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nice Guys Finish Last, Helpful Guys Finish Last, XXX Guys Finish Last... ALL Guys Finish Last.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok, I shouldn't have said &quot;guys&quot;. I'm female.<br />
<br />
Anyhow...happy ending to the story. There was already a ring group going when I logged in last night, and we got 2 commanders to pop literally back to back. I won the second ring :)<br />
<br />
Now I can return to farm and actually enjoy it...it feels like I am over an amazing hill here. Feel kinda stupid for venting but it happens I suppose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Bah, never feel stupid for venting. If you don't vent, it'll just eat at you inside.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Catwalkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Venting is what we are here for, so you don't make enemies of your guildies and friends.  We hear you, we understand.  *hugs*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">situations like that are why swears were invented, for more info see my venting thread a few down</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Naw, swear words were invented for use while camping that pain in the ass Maiden's Eye shard. I've been camping it for 3 days as constantly as I have been able (6+ hours one day, 10+ hours 2 days) and not even seen one named :(<br />
<br />
(insert swear words and rant information here)<br />
<br />
Did I mention it's my last one? Grrr.</div></div><hr />
