<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Menion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The questions can relate to either the Shaman class or anything to do with EQ. I am curious what some of you feel are major issues with our class or EQ in general.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Since I'm going to the EQ Fan Faire in Seattle, these are my top questions currently.<br />
<br />
1.  What's the point of waiting 15 minutes for the Nexus? It's just a return to the nightmare newbie days of waiting for the boat.  It wouldn't affect my &quot;roleplay&quot; ability one whit if the damn thing went up every 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
2.  Changes to the Ragefire spawn. It has been the worst thing to happen to my server since Lodizal.<br />
<br />
3.  Was channeling changed with the SOL release?  How was aggro changed in relation to shaman slow?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Menion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Mine would be as follows.<br />
<br />
1. Were the side effects(insane agro) from the changes made to Slow spell intentional or is there some sort of fix in the works to resolve this issue.<br />
<br />
2. Is the Dev team happy with the current rate of spells entering the world? Is it really your intention that players that are turning level 60 and are not in guilds should have to pay 20-100k to purchase spells like Malo and Topor?  <br />
<br />
3. Why do spells not drop in Cazic Thule? There are plenty of level 60 mobs in CT that should drop spells. And this would give players who are not in big guilds another option besides Sebilis or farming Guardian Wurms. Especially since CT is very well tuned as far as risk vs reward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Why are my spells so $#&amp;^!@$%)%!@$ RARE!!!???   (x3)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Shaman specific for me would be:<br />
<br />
1)  Can you please stop bonking us with the nerf bat by giving all the other casters more powerful spells and giving shaman no additional damage spells?  (I'm ignoring the ancient spells here.  I think all the other caster classes got better DoTs, DD, spells, etc. with SoL.  We got more buffs :p )<br />
<br />
2) (/sarcasm on) Can you see if you can squeeze a few more mobs in luclin that are CR, DR, and PR?  With our relatively poor melee at level 60, I do so enjoy having to epic DoT and pet an 8000 hp mob to death.  If they haven't already been issued, perhaps VI could give the developers a list of shaman damage types to ensure that no mob gets in without at least a substantial resistance to all shaman spells.  Thanks.<br />
<br />
3) (/sarcasm still on) Could you please add a shaman only deathtouch to all mobs 60 and over so we don't have to wait as long to die after we try to slow?  Thanks, la~<br />
<br />
/sarcasm off<br />
<br />
Not pleased with a few things, as this post might imply, but I still love my shaman!  :)<br />
<br />
Non-shaman issues would probably inlude a port-at-will to the nexus.  No need for that 15 minute thing.  Good call by Glorianna!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A brief summary:<br />
<br />
1) Why are you stupid?<br />
<br />
2) How did you come to be stupid?<br />
<br />
3) Is there any way that the players can correct your stupidity?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Rofl!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sithithar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">OMG...this thread has me laughing at work loud enough to get the looks from my co-workers...<br />
<br />
Between Chutoi and Eoin, my sides hurt.  : )<br />
<br />
Seriously...my three questions would be:<br />
<br />
1.  If you are going to make us so popular with the quad 200 hitters for casting Slow, would you at least let some of those slows land now and then so we can run like little screaming girls to our clerics, where we can let them take over aggro by actually healing us?<br />
<br />
2.  Would you please re-visit some of the drops and spawns for mobs that were initially kept on a slow spawn rate to control the items entering the game?  Now that there are significant numbers of high-end players giving good loot to twinks, it would be nice if others had a better chance of getting some of the same items.  (Remembering my days in KK trying to get a spear, and in LOIO trying to get a Prod).<br />
<br />
3.  A small but highly annoying feature....it was nice that you made /tgb persistent, but would you please make other commands persistent, too?   Every time I zone into places like CT, Velk's, etc, I have to hide corpses or it kills my video card (A 64MB radeon).  I know I'm not the only one with lag/video issues, and little things like piles of corpses that we have to turn off every time we zone are annoying as hell.<br />
<br />
4.  Oh, and can I have a JBB, please?  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">LOL eoin I was thinking the same thing.<br />
<br />
I would add<br />

Exactly what would be the Pound per square inch of presure needed to pull your head out of your collective asses.<br />

<br />
Excellent Question.  Spell drops in CT would be good.<br />
<br />
<br />
My main question would be:<br />
<br />
1.  Do the disease counters added to slow spells increase the agro generated on the caster?  If so, is this an intentional change and why did you want to increase the amount of agro generated?  If not, can you please test it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">/LOL Eoin<br />
<br />
1) What do you plan on doing about the extreme rarity of the<br />
    level 60 Shaman spells?<br />
<br />
2) What was the point of putting Overthere on the VS faction?<br />
     (gameplay wise, not story wise) Would you concider a<br />
     GM event to overthrow Overthere?<br />
<br />
3) Brad admitted that the first time that Frodo went to the   <br />
    mountain, it was an adventure. If he did it 10 times it would<br />
    be tedious, yet you want the world to &quot;feel big&quot;. How do you<br />
    plan on reconciling these? (note: horses are too expensive<br />
    to be a practical solution).<br />
<br />
4) Would you concider making Alchemy a viable trade skill again<br />
    by reducing it's cost, and providing at least 2 zones per <br />
    continent that  the potions would take you to?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">1) Alchemy...<br />
<br />
2) Ragefire (Glorianna Im on emarr too, ragefire has gotten way out of hand)<br />
<br />
3) Would it be possible for the dev team to code in some customer service into EverQuest?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Seriously, the only way the devs could make so many obvious mistakes is if they are totally ignorant of the game. Talk about backseat driving. This is more like driving a car in LA from a bathtub in Bogata. They clearly have no idea what the ramifications of their decisions are because a) they don't actually play the game beyond level 10 or b) they don't pay attention.<br />
<br />
Take Ragefire (please!). The idea was sound: To disassociate the Ragefire spawn from Nagafen. The problem is that they turned it into another Lodizal-type rush. Do they have any idea what happens when he spawns? It's an open-air mobilization race/KS-fest. Is this really what they wanted? At least when Rage was in Naggy's lair, it could feasibly be considered a camp.<br />
<br />
I guess after a game is released, the time for thought is over.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Only one question I have.<br />
<br />
1) Why is Mala, a vendor sold spell, dropping in the world, at all?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Jaeden, I think you mean Malosini...I'm pretty sure Mala is a mage dropped spell (just common as hell).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Actually, I thought it was a mage vendor spell that kept dropping instead of malo.<br />
<br />
Might've misread the threads wrong, Malosini could be it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>balith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I want to know who the sadistic clueless spell designer was who decided a perfictally good spell system where we got spells from vendors waset good enough?<br />
<br />
Was he upset there wasent a small minority in the game who are the only people with a complete spell book? Did he feel spells are to be seen on paper not used unless this game is your life? <br />
<br />
Did he pull the wings off bugs and light small animals on fire as a kid? How does the current uber spell system with have and have not people with empty spell slots help the game?<br />
<br />
I dont mind armor drops being slightly better than what a group of 6 can get but this uber spell only idea (which was a change not the original plan) has been plain bull ****. I would like them to explain why they went to this moronic system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">1) Why can't there be more than 8 spell slots, now there's a gazzillion new spells in a spellbook since the original release?  As of now, I use over a dozen spells all the time during a raid.  Toooo much bobbing up and down in spellbook to change spells at any given moment.<br />
<br />
2) Any new, fresh spells/abilities to look forward to, for us?<br />
<br />
3) Oh, so no new fresh spells/abilites.  How about fixing that Tribunal symbol quest?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">1. why the hell do i keep looting malosini off of the emp, protector and jumpy in seb?<br />
<br />
2. What the hell is Poxx? matter of fact what the hell is Shaman luclin spells? let me keep going why the hell am i saving up over 150k to buy spells? <br />
<br />
3. The defense department regrets to inform you your shammy is dead after casting slow on a mob. BTW whats with all the non slowable mobs on Luclin? <br />
<br />
4. (insert sarcasm here) Thanks for the great final cudgel quest im sure that the reward of 12pp per cast will make us all run out and get one. <br />
<br />
5. how bout we &quot;Roshambo&quot; for a few extra damage spells. Here i'll go first. <br />
<br />
i love my shammy, but i dont even go to luclin anymore because its pretty much pointless.<br />
You begin casting Malosini <br />
Your target feels very uncomfortable<br />
You begin casting bane of nife<br />
Your target resisted the bane of nife spell<br />
you begin casting turgurs insects<br />
Your target resisted the turgurs insects spell.<br />

2.  Why was an unfinished &quot;twink&quot; class introduced into the game and can this be expected from future expansions?<br />
3.  Will Test Server #2 (Legends) content be considered for balancing before or after entering the regular servers? :p</div></div><hr />

I don't know how much good it will do, but if the opportunity arises, &quot;So, what kind of questions do shaman have?&quot;  I'll be ready!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>sharden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I'm puzzled how verant can still call us the buff king when most other classes have gotten those skills...   Don't they realize that our primary role on the high-end game has become debuffers?<br />
     Keep me in FOS and RH and back to the Debuff Team! <br />
<br />
   (1) What a waste of Ancient Spells for shaman when virtually every mob in Luclin resists POX (or our other DOT's for that matter)   Why not an Ancient Spell that has lower resist on Turgurs?   That would be more inline with our roles nowdays..<br />
<br />
   (2) What use are alt exp channeling skills when you nerf their effect?  Oh and at the same time increasing Slow agro?<br />
Could you please return to me all the alt exp points I've wasted in skills you then go nerf?  (i.e.  jbb crits, channelling)<br />
<br />
   (3) What happened to the:  Shaman are only priest class that can melee vision?  I have been trying to get my AC up and can self buff to a bit over 1200 ac yet my cleric friends can routinely self buff to over 1300 ac and they have much less &quot;uber&quot; gear than I.   With your &quot;adjustments&quot; to our skills (slow agro, channeling) you should at least increase our Defense, Dodge, etc to make up for all the deaths we get now..  The few times I try to melee on even a CT mob after I've slowed him its uhhh goodbye shaman..<br />
<br />
  (4) Could you please put a portal in the middle of the Dark Masters in Umbral that is a one-way zone into Star-Wars Galaxies?  I really need to leave a game that rewards your hard earned alt exp points with soon to be nerf'ed worthless skills......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Not really a Shaman question but...<br />
<br />
Why do you keep adding noobie content with every expantion?<br />
It's the high levels (55 - 60) who've &quot;seen it all, done it all&quot; and<br />
need something more. There's PLENTY of content for the noobs <br />
and alts to level up in. Us high levels might get stuck in a rut.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">1) After throwing the shaman class a rather small bone (*), all the while widely expanding the range and scope of some of the other casting classes (**), do you have more upgrades in mind for the shamans? <br />
<br />
2) After the latest range of 'tuning' of the focus items, you have made sure that our DOTs and debuffs (***) are quaintly left totally unaffected by those items. Are you done messing around or do you think there is a few more way you could insure that shamans are completly left out of that profound change to the game mechanic that is benefitting all the other casting classes?<br />
<br />
3) Any chance that you will ever stop considering us as a pet class only when the nerf bat come around or when you're running out of idea for AA skill? Or, if you insist equating our pet to a walking, barking DOT, would you at least have the decency of increasing the efficiency of our 55 pet in at least the same already-miserly way (****) you increased the efficiency of our poison DOT?<br />
<br />
*: woot! My group-buffs give as much stats as the next lowest single-target ones! What a blinding flash of the obvious that one must have been.<br />
<br />
**: Let's see... just of the top of my head:<br />
- Druid/Wizard getting succor before level 20<br />
- Wild expansion on the resurrection lines of both the palies and the clerics<br />
- Nice damage upgrade for the clerics spells<br />
- Mages now able to summon essential focus items.<br />
<br />
***:also known as 'meat' and 'drink' of the shamans life, whatever may think the deranged ape who decided to give us a dozen buffs as new spells in the last expansion. Not to mention that the last tweak also managed to remove the bonus effects of the archetype Spell Casting Fury on our Jaundiced Bone Bracer<br />
<br />
****: From Scourge to Plague to Pox, our disease DOT mana/damage ratio rose from 3.08 to 3.98 to 4.86. Comparatively, our poison DOT ratio from Venom to Bane went from 2.83 to 3.52 to peter out with 3.88.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Lacka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">1.  Alchemy-make potions more affordable so we can actually sell potions (even at cost) in order to recoop our investment.  Also, can we get some more useful potions? <br />
<br />
2.  Travel-OMG I hate travel with a passion.  When you are playing a higher end game and your entire guild is all ready at the raid it is almost impossible to get a ride to where you need to go.  I only have a limited play time and it is such a waste of time to have to beg and auction for rides for well over an hour.  Nexus helped, but did not solve the problem.  I would like to be able to go to any druid ring and have an NPC sell a stone that would give me a one-time trip to any other druid ring.  <br />

<br />
2&gt; what is up with AA's for shaman?  critical heals?  critical nukes?  how about an AA ability with a chance of getting another tick on Torpor or on a Dot.  You know, the spells we would actually be using when you are working on AA points.  Why are our AA's less relavent (other than cann 5) than others?<br />
<br />
3&gt; why dont pets retain usefulness late in the game?  Dungeons are not pathed to allow them to be used safely, they dont keep up damage wise, yet some classes are told having is part of what they get for giving up something else.  If pets are part of the class design, they should be useful the entire length of the game.<br />
<br />
actually what I would really like to ask them is what aspects of the game they most regret having done wrong but can't fix.  if they had it go over what would they have left out.  I doubt they would answer that.  complete heal and rezzes going to the same class perhaps.</div></div><hr />

Well they also said in the past they couldn't code this and that, but with the newer VI people working, they've been changing that tune.   I do not see how it's unbalancing having 2-3 extra spell slots.  As if having room to mem both regular focus and group focus, alters the state of the universe *boggles*</div></div><hr />

This is the only one of the old statements that I can remember that they said would most likely &quot;break&quot; the game if they tried to add to it... I am not sure what they mean or what but like I said it could be old blood lies.  But this is the only one I can recall where they said they couldnt because it would break... the other statements were just we cant code this because we dont have enought time or would break balance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">1. Why is it that i can't cast a DoT(let alone more than one)every minute(unless i am a necro and can FD the aggro off), which does 30ish DPS without getting killed, while chain casting DDs for triple the DPS doesn't generate anywhere near the aggro, when DDs are already far superior in Stackability/DPS/DoT(Damage over Time, yes i know this is ironical)/MANA EFFICIENCY!/Resistability ?<br />
(Can prove numbers easily if i was guaranteed an answer on this question)<br />
<br />
2. Do you realize how many hours/days/months of time guilds have spent to equip their previous overpowered melees in order to overcome the biggest challenges, just to see how a wizard with Kunark loot outdamages most of these uber-equipped melees withouting using any mana due to the insane AC of Luclin mobs.<br />
<br />
And do you realize that Wizards have become far too important for Luclin high end encounters to the extent that they decide the outcome ofraids even more than after the introduction of Bane spells. If this question isn't clear yet, i want to add this statement.<br />
<br />
Wizards have no support role, thus they are responsible for 80% of the magic damage inflicted to a luclin uber mob. Combined with there far superior DDs(both in terms of efficiency and effectiveness due to the variety they can pick from), Criticals, Mana Regen(on top of all raid buffs they can stack their own) and ability to reduce their hate and use a 59 DPS mana free item on 90% of the mobs, they are the most desireable class after clerics in the end game by far(actually not replaceable in most encounters). <br />
Now with that said factor in that the melee damage has been practically nerfed on Luclin mobs as mentioned above, you have created(or actually increased even more) a major discrepancy and difficulty to balance encounters, since a single player of a class can add so much that  2 or 3 more can trivialize any encounter and make it hard for guilds with 2 or 3 less of this class as the encounter was designed for.<br />

<br />
Zorlac. #'s 2 &amp; 3. WHY? TEST IS NOT A 4 LETTER WORD. (Well it is - but not it the &quot;George Carlin &quot; sense)<br />
<br />
Giac - please don't nerf wizzies. God they have gotten the short end of the stick for awhile.<br />
<br />
My 3:<br />
<br />
1) Why is Alchemy such an expensive trade skill? Why are the trade skills so un-balanced? I use sell back as an example.  <br />
<br />
 I Can sell back an enchanted ring for a small profit.  Potions generate about a 10% return.  Now what is WEIRD is that a 10 shot does not sell for 10x a single - but LESS. <br />
<br />
2) Why is so much content aimed at such a small percentage of players?<br />
<br />
3) When do you plan to stop issuing crappy expansions requiring umpteen patches, with insta-nerfs on certain items, INSTEAD of going BACK over all old world content and fixing quests, wording, and known buggy areas?<br />
<br />
4) Why can I log into DAoC, a much more visually satisfying game in less time than it takes me to just get to server screen in EQ?  Why does zoning take SOOOO long in your game, but seconds in DAoC?<br />
<br />
5) Why is aggro fubared? Please explain from a role-playing standpoint how a MOB 1/2 way across a zone knows when / if a Monk has actually gotten up from his FD?<br />
<br />
6) Why when a feigned Monk RESISTS a spell is Feign Death broken?<br />
<br />
7) Why are the Epics so varied in difficulty and effect? Mage Epic is incredibly hard, Monk Epic (And Shaman, Rogue) much easier.  <br />
<br />
8) When will you actually create a TEST server to TEST patches etc. I'm not talking about wipes - I am talking about adding new content (Non-legends) for the existing player base to dissect, sploit, etc etc.  As it stands now, test is &quot;test&quot; in name only.<br />
<br />
Caveat: Hell, if you stated &quot;We are creating a test server, bring all your crap and friends, free transfer, BUT be aware that while we won't be wiping, items MAY leave the game if found to be too powerful etc - you WOULD have more app's than you knew what to do with.<br />
<br />
9) When will you fix pathing? This has a detrimental effect on Shaman, Necro's, Mages and to a lesser extent - Enchanters.<br />
<br />
10) When you increase MOB or zone difficulty do you not realize that all you are doing is placing a big &quot;off-limits&quot; sign to a considerable number of players?<br />
<br />
More as inspiration (and beer) strikes me.</div></div><hr />

2) Hmm I don't have the answer, although Zorlac or one of the other whiz'es might.<br />
<br />
If I had to take a guess I would say that WIN NT is not designed for handling that kind of volume, insofar as it is a more &quot;secure&quot; OS than 95/98 and treats incoming packets differently. (Subjecting them to checks of various types)<br />
<br />
Or that WIN NT allows a limited number of connections at any one time? (That sounds stupid, I am probably thinking RAS)<br />

I am probably way off base. <br />

Giac - please don't nerf wizzies. God they have gotten the short end of the stick for awhile.<br />
<br />
<br />
I know calling for nerfs doesn't make you popular, BUT i fail to see when they had ever gotten the short end of the stick since the release of Kunark. Notice i was talking of a raid situation.<br />
<br />
Since the introduction of quad kiting(Kunark) there has been no problem for a wizard to solo his way up to 60 pretty quick. As a matter of fact they were among the very first level 60s on every server.<br />
Wizards have been getting one upgrade after the other for the sole reason that they used to have no possibility to do sustained damage in a group scenario. <br />
Something that VI didn't retain balanced since wizards are the &quot;damage dealer&quot; among casters. So they upgraded their desireability for raid encounters through the different expansions.<br />
<br />
However, i doubt the wizard class is getting nerfed anytime soon, so the question to VI is just that, a question. I think they don't realize that 80% of all nukes come from wizard nowadays(i am talking of a classic Velious guild setup, not with tons of mages and druids, who have nothing to do and can nuke away).<br />
<br />

- We have 2 web applications at my job, one is running on NT/IIS other is on Apache/Solaris. About same workload, NT version is 10 times more stable. You can have the most solid and stable server if your application is coded like crap (a la EQ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Raagnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">1. Why do stats mean nothing? and why do you make a class to buff those said worthless stats? <br />
<br />
2. Why do you balance the whole game and expansions based on spells that 10% of the population has. For shaman and priests specifically...i chose this class because i didn't wanna have to research  and quest for spells. i chose it cause i could buy them all and i knew that they would be less powerful then say a pure caster because of it. why was it decided that all players shouldn't be able to have all their spells when their CLASS is balanced on them having ALL their spells. you say our spells=tanks weapons/armor....are you forgetting we also need to get weapons and armor and spells as well. supremely idiotic design to make spells dropped did you do it just to milk more playtime and money out of people?<br />
<br />
3. Why is it always VERANTvsTHE PUBLIC like you're the Allied forces of WW2 and the public is the vile evil nazi's. That you are never wrong and it's always just an &quot;oversight&quot;. Take DAOC for example. they regularly say sorry we screwed up WTH were we thinking lol. Now that game is far from perfect but they have a much better relationship with players and it's VERY noticable that they treat player concerns and ideas with genuine interest instead of you guys brushing it off for 6months to a year then coming out and saying &quot;hey we have a great idea we're gonna do this&quot; which is what the player told you 3 months ago. So do you feel if you listened to the people responsible for your salary more often you would be able to improve the game?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">1. Could you make more than a few viable options in AA exp?<br />
<br />
2.  Could you make different paths, each with the different options mentioned above?<br />
<br />
3. Could you make those paths one-way so one character cant train in every single AA skill?  This will accomplish diversity.  As it stands right now, any level 60 wizard truly worth his/her salt will have manaburn, just like any regularly played level 60 ranger will have the bow thing, etc.  In other words, one level 60 wizard isnt a whole lot different than another level 60 wizard.<br />
<br />
This also allows you, the developers, to promote individuality in another way, as opposed to the current &quot;What equipment do you have?&quot; idealogy.<br />
<br />
An example would be the following:  A shaman reaches a certain point in AA training.  He/she has trudged through the basics, like the regen stuff, innate stamina, what have you...the generals and the archetypes.  Give that shaman the option of specializing in a field...healing magics (thus giving them HoT's, larger heals, quicker heals *allowing the cleric to be better here*, etc)....affliction magics (thus giving them larger DoT's, lower resist rates, quicker counters, etc)....or augmentation magics (thus giving them better group/single target buffs, better haste buffs *allowing enchanter to be better here*, etc).  This could be a lot of fun to implement, especially with wizards, magicians, things of that nature.  Even with melees, you could allow weapon archetypes to be specialized.  Or, make innate bane abilities for warriors.  You get the idea.<br />
<br />
Im not saying &quot;improve on spells we already have&quot;.  You've done that with the ancients.  Im saying give the specialists a...well...specialist line of spells all their own.  In my mind, a shaman hell bent on destruction (in whatever context the player roleplays) would be pretty miffed if their god only allowed them to cast the dot spells that a shaman mainly focused on healing could cast, and vice-versa.  You could REALLY get original here, and actually work off of the religion system already in the game.  Im sure followers of Cazic would be thrilled to get a nice &quot;Terror of Nightmares&quot;  dot.  Or, Rallos followers get a super berserk spell that includes haste.  Or, Tribunal followers have a &quot;Judgement&quot; nuke.<br />
<br />
Make all but one of the paths grey out when one is chosen.  <br />
<br />
*THE FOLLOWING IS IMPORTANT*However, this presents you, the developers, with a duty...make sure the 3 or 4 or 15 fields are balanced enough that someone doesnt wreck their character by choosing a certain field, or overpower themselves by choosing a certain field. *THE PRECEEDING MESSAGE WAS IMPORTANT* If I had to guess, this is kinda what you guys and gals are shooting at, no?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">1)  Shaman ae spells.  Torrent of poison can only hit 4 times no matter how many mobs, and won't hit anything under 20% health (auto-resist).  Tigir's insects only hits 4 mobs.  No resists on the others, it just clocks out and goes home once it's tried to hit 4 mobs.  I'd like to hear some sort of reasoning on this.  Not trying to get us wanted in the oh-so-ridiculous ae groups, but when there are a few lower level mobs inc, and I wanna just tigir's them, there's no way to know which ones got slowed and which didn't.<br />
<br />
2)  Can we have some kind of new nukes or dots?  Bane/pox were released in kunark, and are what most level 60 shaman use (well, those than can find the damn rare spells).  How many level 60 druids/mages/wizards use only their kunark spells, and no others?<br />
<br />
3)  Can we get a few of our aa abilities changed?  Extra ticks on dots, or increased damage per tick would be very handy.  With chloroblast and the jbb as our main real heals / nukes, getting improved healing or improved dd spells just isn't remotely in the same league as adding 10% to any other caster.  Not to mention casting fury doesn't even work with the jbb.<br />
<br />
Still, enjoying my shaman, and probably always will, just a few things that would be nice.</div></div><hr />

Especially considering Melees get disciplines &quot;free&quot; upon leveling without having to collect a drop.  And Considering that items with FT, &amp; now Focus effects, make more sense to balance against<br />
Melee AC/Stat/Weapons.<br />
<br />
2) Why do you not explain your balance for casters the same way you explained the last change for Melees.<br />

Agree with it or not.  At least you understood where VI was coming from.<br />
<br />
3) Why don't you come up with some way for Guilds to be able to spawn a mob when they have enough members.  IE: something for 2nd or 3rd teir guilds who would need &quot;everyone on&quot; and &quot;luck to find a spawn&quot;<br />
<br />
((Ways off hand include making a Guild Leader able to spawn<br />
something once a month.  And Guild Leadership not able to change except through petition with GMs. Or something.  Shrug.  Program something more for littler guilds.))</div></div><hr />
