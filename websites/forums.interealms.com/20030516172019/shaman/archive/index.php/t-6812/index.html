<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>muhahaha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can someone tell me where to solo for plats at lvl 34...I'm on Vallon Zek and a troll, so I'm only interested in darkie regions.  Also, can someone tell me what equip I should be looking to buy now...to give you an example of my stuff, I'm still wearing splitpaw gloves!<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My shaman is not 34 but i lvled my other chars in Overthere from 29 to 39<br />
<br />
Ot is still good solo up to lvl 41.<br />
U got bank right there, guards, things drop platinum and if u get enough sarnak braids u can get a wicked Hammer that teleports you to Overthere at the shipyards. :)<br />
<br />
You coudl also kill things in High Hold Keep. If u don't care about faction hits waste guards. Go lvl by lvl take stairs up and down. Nobles also work.<br />
<br />
<br />
Paw is also nice if u got a good grp u can go deeper in. No sowing in there and hard to get out if a train comes bring an evac-er.<br />
<br />
Well that is about all i can think of. There might be betetr luclin spots but since i lag a lot i play in the old world mostly.<br />
<br />
Ot u can do solo and in a grp btw. The dragoons (goons as ppl call them ) will not bother u cause u are with the dark side.<br />
<br />
Enjoy.<br />
