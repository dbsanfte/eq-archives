<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As I sit here at home browsing the boards waiting for my pager to go off (I'm on call), I can't help but wonder, what is the percentage of people that play EQ that have full time jobs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I work part time and go to school full time, all I do in school is browse EQ **** since I know most of this crappola the first year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ralahast-BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I go to school full time, but I also have a part time job(20 hours a week to balance with my 17 credit hours of school), voted choice 3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">40 hours + a week here, but I am reading mboards most of the day while I work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>robert135</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Full time job, 2 classes in CS, and a wife.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>reaper23</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i get paid for 40hrs / week todo anything that makes me look busy i guess</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I browse the message boards while waiting on data, client conference calls, etc.   Somedays I'm litterally hitting refresh waiting on new posts, other days I never am able to check.  (shrug)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Racknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">But wait... I work full time and go to school full time...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Canabull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm a full time student and grandson.  My grandfather is in bad shape, and when I'm not in classes I help my grandmother take care of him.  I mostly only get on when he's asleep or watching CNN (he's waiting for us to &quot;catch ole Bin&quot;), but I actually study, which limits my playing time even further.  Hence, I have no character above 51 in a year and a half of EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Meener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I worked in the dot-com industry for a while.  Obviously I'm not doing that anymore.<br />
<br />
Couldn't get a real job in my area, so I started a company of my own.  It's taking a long time to get going (not through laziness, just waiting for the planets to align so I can start).  I now basically work from home.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Lol, 50+ hours during the normal week, 18 hours a week on the weekend job. BUT... can play EQ at work on the weekend job while being paid. :)  Sleep is something I used to do.......<br />
One of these days I might slow down, but into my mid 30's and still only taking a few days a year off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i'd give my right arm for a normal or non-traditional job but nope, the damn economy has kept me out of a job since last thanksgiving. so now i am working on ways to sell my paintings and i also am doing some freelance graphic design here and there. thank god for unemployment insurance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I want to be a male giggolo serving chicks in Hollywood.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Full time work (no EQ here, but I can and do browse message boards), part time school (2 CS classes w/labs, 8 hours worth), 1 cat, 1 boyfriend, just bought a house in July, and just dinged 51 with my shaman:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>ryoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">this is what i have that cuts into my EQ time<br />
<br />
1. full full time job 24/7 365... United States Marine<br />
i do get everyweek end off so thats a plus<br />
2. one wife(plays to) <br />
3. two beautiful 4year old twin girls<br />
however at this moment my wife and kids are in new jersey while im stationed in hawaii for 4 or 5 more months<br />
4. the ever lasting possiblity of waking up one morning and going to iraq.....after all we are guarding the doors against the wolfs...<br />
<br />
all in all i think the military really get more time to play eq than most  least thats my opinion<br />
