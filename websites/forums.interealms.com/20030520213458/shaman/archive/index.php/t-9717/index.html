<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone tried doing this for a long period of time to check the XP? I had to logoff to attend to some RL things after I had soloed the first 6 frogs but the XP didn't seem that great. However the fun factor is pretty cool :) Pretty damn neat to be LFG and able to solo those frogs. I was only able to single pull one set but even with 2 per pull it's not a big deal with alpha dog and KEI.<br />
<br />
Just wondering if the XP is Katta-like or much worse? 5 of the 6 were dark blue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Beranor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">soloing in sebilis isn't nearly as good as other solo spots or PoP grouping.  It's enjoyable but I wouldn't recommend it as a primary source of exp</div></div><hr />
