<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am about to have another 6 aa points to spend and trying to decide where to spend them. I am considering 3 options:<br />
<br />
SCM3<br />
ND3<br />
SCR3<br />
<br />
I am thinking SCM3 but was wondering if people who have it think its worth it?<br />
<br />
ND3 I will want it eventually but I am sitting at about 5200hps raid buffed right now and for what my guild is doing at the moment it seems to be enough for me. If i did my math right ND3 would give me about 150 more hps. Doesn't seem like much for 6 aa points.<br />
<br />
SCR3 would be nice but I have my 8th shawl that adds to my buff duration as well. Eventually I do want this and want to get the class level as well but not sure if it should be next on my list.<br />
<br />
What are people opinions, would you choose one of the others or perhaps something completely different?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have all 3 of those AA's as well as SCRM, I think that SCR3 followed by SCRM gave me the biggest benefit.  It is a tough call though, because all 3 of those are GREAT AA's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Personally I think 150hps is well worth 6 aa points, and if I understand it correctly, it ends up being more than 150hp as your gear gets better?<br />
<br />
With that said, I am debating the same thing as you, trying to decided between ND, scm, and scr.  I cant really make up my mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Here's the thing about ND.  It is a great AA and I am glad that I have it, but there is a point where extra HP is just padding.  The original poster said she was at 5200 HP raid-buffed, which is just a smidge below where I am.  I don't reallly feel the need for more HP, I have plenty.  Self-buffed I have plenty of HP to canni5 whenever I need to, and raid buffed it isn't even an issue.  More HP is great, but I would rather have the mana savings from SCM3 or the buff extension from SCRM.<br />
<br />
SCM3 is a very nice AA.  Like I said in another thread, I stopped playing for a few weeks and left a friend with my account.  When I came back, he had gotten me SCM3, so I got to see just how big of an improvement it was to go from SCM0 straight to SCM3, and it IS a pretty big improvement, I was very pleased.<br />
<br />
SCRM I got all on my own.  I don't have 8th shawl, but I do have an EE focus item.  The 70% extended duration on your buffs is just AWESOME.  I love it.  When I join a group I group focus and sta and I don't have to cast it again for like 3 hours.  On top of that, there is usually not a chanter in groups I join, so I am casting haste as well, and I always use regen.  It is nice to have those last almost twice as long.  I don't have ferine avatar yet, but when I get it I WILL be using it on all the melees in my group (I use PA on those without primals, right now), so an 11 minute avatar is going to be very sweet.  The biggest reason to get SCRM though, is for TORPOR.  Casting a torpor on myself and having it seem to last forever really turns me on.  I cannot wait to get quinn.  1800-2100 point heal for 200 mana (minus SCM3 savings) that can be casted on tanks is going to make it even easier to be primary healer in any exp group.  I love SCRM, probably my second favorite AA after canni5. <br />
<br />
That is just my opinion, though.  All 3 of those are really great AA's that I am glad to have, but I think SCRM helped me the most.  Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Here's what yer talking about:  HP's, longer buffs or cheaper spells.  Among those three, there's no question....  HP's!  :)  With another 6 AA, I'd go after longer buffs (including Torpor and Quiescence) and finally cheaper spells (at this level, mana is cheap, but getting stuff cheaper is ALWAYS good).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Personally I went SCR3 before ND or SCM.  While I recognize that all 3 are nice, as a shaman, I was most interested in SCR not only from the annoying standpoint of buffing but that extending Torpor to 1800hp total was another major convenience, healing almost all damage I did to myself from CannV.  I will likely be finishing with SCRM next and trying to attain a extended buff duration item as well.<br />
<br />
Unbuffed I sit at just over 2200 hp (yeah I know most are amazed at how low that is) but even just self buffed I have yet to get low hp agro from CannV, with a druid/cleric hp buff I never even get close.  ND is definitely something that interests me but is way behind SCR.<br />
<br />
SCM?  Obviously useful with every spell cast, but I rarely find with CannV that Im even close to running out of mana, so again, while worthwhile eventually, not compared to SCR imo.  SCR is also a mana saver as you dont have to buff as frequently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Myself, I went with ND3 before the others.  My equipment, though not top of the line, is pretty decent.  With Planar Power 1, my hp now are over 6100 fully raid buffed, and it makes a difference.  I'm working on SCR3 now and will go for SCRM next.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but rabid bear will have to wait until the fix it.  ;)</div></div><hr />

In your sig it says &quot;Veteran Dugann Wynterwulff, Barbarian Oracle&quot; where I assume you meant venerable.  Just thought I'd point that out in case it wasnt intended.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">They are awesome AAs and really no clue whats better than the other.  i went nd3, scr2, CA3, and now doing scm3 then gonna finish off scr line.<br />
<br />
But really i think the only way to decide is go and /ran 1 3.  let 1 be scr 2 be scm 3 be nd.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
sorry for the off topic, was an oversight on my part, thanks for the correction, all fixed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'd go for SCM3 first.  The extra mana savings is definitely worth having.  Once you max out mana saving focuses and AAs, you'll really notice the difference.  It's like giving yourself a bunch of FT that stacks with FT.  In the old days before Canni5, any sort of mana regen used to be uber.  <br />
Anyway, that is what I would choose in your position.  And I have all kinds of mad skills. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I did SCR3 /SCRM, then SCM3 then ND3, no regrets at all ;)<br />
<br />
SCRM is amazing if you have Quiescence, is very nice for torpor, and 50% buff extension on everything else really makes this a great aa.<br />
<br />
SCM is nice too. 10 % mana savings that stack with everything really adds up, especially for shaman (high mana cost spells, most of our spells are alteration based, and we cast a LOT)<br />
<br />
I primarily did ND3 to fluff my magelo over 3k unbuffed, but again, +~250hp (I have 280 Sta buffed) that stacks with all your hp gear is nice ;)<br />
<br />
So from my experience/playstyle:<br />
SCRM&gt;SCM3&gt;ND3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Oh, and I'd also do one level of quickbuff before doing any of these, maybe 2 levels if no spell haste item</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Does SCR3 affect Quiescence?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I did SCR3 / SCRM and am now working on ND3.<br />
<br />
I have rather gimp gear and only come in at about 2600 hp self buffed.  ND3 is not great but I can realy use the extra HP when soloing.<br />
<br />
If you have nice self buffed HP then I would still do SCR3 / SCRM  before either ND or SCM.  Torpor / Q doing 1800 hp instead of 1200 is huge.  I would also take steps to get the cast time on Torpor down into the 3 second range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Does SCR3 affect Quiescence?<br />
<br />
Most definitely scr3 and scrm does effect quiescence.<br />
<br />
For the original poster I'd definitely say SCM3 altho since it goes 2 4 6 you can only get to lvl 2 with points you currently have. I went from scm0 to scm3 in a matter of about a week and it made a noticable difference.<br />
<br />
More hps are always nice but your at the good enough point for covering cann v.<br />
<br />
SCRM is a nice aa. 50% longer q/torpor and upto 70% longer other buffs with focus items is really nice. Great hastle saver and makes our best heal better.<br />
<br />
<br />
Qb is also nice altho focus effects and cleric buff can help out there depending on your gear. Personally I've got qb2 and a 18% haste item which is almost max reduction already so don't plan on qb3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">What is the min HP you guys recommend to have unbuffed if I want to be able to canni V with just a tad over 4 bubs of hps? Right now I almost have my 6th aa but I'm planning for the future =] <br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />

<br />
I already have SCM2, ND2 and SCR2.. just trying to figure out which one to go the last 6 aa on.<br />
<br />
Thanks all for the input. Someone mentioned going with Quick Buff.. thought about it but I currently have an item with Haste of Mithaniel that works as a 20% spell haste (on beneficial spells)..<br />
<br />
I am thinking I will go with SRM3. My guild is currently doing mobs that are LONG fights. Even with Cann5 I find myself running low on mana near the end. Then I think my next goal will be 4 points in Radiant Cure 2 (RC1 isn't cutting it for some of the mobs we are doing) then back to SCR3, unless I manage to get my hands on Quiescence then I will go with SCR3 first.<br />
<br />
If only I could get my AA points back for Rabid Bear! Grrrrr...... what was I thinking? Although logging a fight when I went  rabid bear in a group with my then level 60 ranger guild leader and doing more DPS then him and posting results on our guild forums was almost worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Get SCRM Would be my vote. Out of those choices.<br />
<br />
And Lay off the rabid bear. Sure it sucks. But The first time my tiny guild got through trials I had to rabid bear and finish off the Exe. <br />
<br />
(Cleric lagged and main tank went splatto, And I was oom from nuking And malo and slow with Canni% not up yet. And 4 people down. Just me and the cleric.)<br />
<br />
I Bit His ass three times just to make sure. After he fell.<br />
<br />
Snoww Silverhammer Bashy RABID bear. E marr</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think having the extra HP is always beneficial when you get PoP_Mob_01 beating on you for 300hp or so per hit.  However, as you have observed it doesn't offer a great deal of protection when you are getting pounded.<br />
<br />
SCM3 is fantastic from what I've seen, I've noticed visible mana savings with each spell cast, at the very least in my chosen specialization.<br />
<br />
SCR3 is nice for the extra tick of torpor, but honestly that is all you get if you are planning for it.<br />
<br />
Quite a few folks on this board speak very highly of the CA3/LR5 path, and from what I've been able to gather it's increased combat avoidance prevents at least 150hp damage per fight, so if you are worried about the safety factor, perhaps this is the set of skills for you.   Then again, a Tier 2 PoP mob unslowed pounding us is probably still going to kill us regardless.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">CA is also on my list. I have the first level already. I raid more now then I group or solo and I don't seem to draw as much agro as I use to. I guess what i am looking for is what would help my guild out in long mob fights right now. Since lately I have been canning like crazy towards the end of a long fight trying to get enough mana to patch that tank one more time before we wipe...that SCM3 would be the best thing for now. <br />
<br />
I tend to have a problem with saving up for the costly aa skills so i have a few levels of one thing, a few of another but only a few where i went the long haul and maxed them out. Trying really hard right now to finish off these 6 aa without blowing what i currently have saved on something that doesnt cost as much.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">It sounds like you just answered your self.  If you are having issues with needing just a touch more mana for long fights -SCM3 is definately the answer.<br />
<br />
The extra mana savings should be significant.  If I recall correctly, this is a 2%, 5%, 10% ability -and the jump from your current 5% savings to 10% savings will be noticable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Wudoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">easy...make that Quiessence/Torpor last longer and cast quicker...SCR3 all the way...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Many conflicting opinions.....  I'm only surprised someone didn't throw in AA abilities completely from left field, in front of those three</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">All 3 are important. You've sampled all 3 and still can't decide which one to go with first. So...<br />
<br />
Roll a 6-sided die. 1 and 2 = finish SCM3. 3 and 4 = finish ND3. 5 and 6 = get SCR3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">heh, no dice.<br />
<br />
maybe I will pull a number out of a hat  .. or maybe log in and do a /random  :)<br />
<br />
* Did a /random 6 a few times and it came up with 0 everytime.. /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I got a hold of Quiessence and find that I use it all the time and realized how much better it could be. So I decided to go with SCR3 instead of SCM3.</div></div><hr />
