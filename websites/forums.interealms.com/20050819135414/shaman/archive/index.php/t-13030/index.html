<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Adran Windrunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Background - I recently came back to the game after more than a year off.<br />
<br />
I was being helped through Trial of Execution tonight by the guild I've applied to join (nice of them as I'm not actually a member yet). Had a major &quot;doh!&quot; moment when the tank got slowed, and I was expected to cure.<br />
<br />
I'd read somewhere that slows now added disease counters, but the fact hadn't really registered. So of course I didn't have cure memed, and the tank was yelling &quot;slowed! slowed!&quot; while I loaded it up. We made it through fine, but it caught me flat footed - cure disease wasn't in my spell line up for that kind of fight.<br />
<br />
I've also noticed that people are using Cripple a lot more - I mainly use it if the tank is a little low, or against tough cons. But people are casting it on blue cons in exp groups. Maybe it's just something that's considered worthwhile now everyone seems to have KEI and/or horses.<br />
<br />
Anyway, this got me wondering what other major changes there have been to the class. I've been back-reading a bit through the Crucible, and picking up some good advice. I'll keep at it - I know you can't substitute advice for experience, but it all helps.<br />
<br />
Are there any old-timers reading who'd be willing to compare our role a couple of years ago to what the game's like now? I'm talking tactical stuff in fights, rather than more general or philosophical class issues. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Read the sticky post at the top of this forum yet? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vulash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I did the exact same thing you did.  Came back a few months back after over a year off.<br />
<br />
Here are a few things I've noticed since I returned -<br />
<br />
First, in PoP mobs hit much harder, so be careful to let your tank have decent agro before you slow.  In some groups you'll be able to slow on inc like old times, but in some (with wars especially) you can't or you will get eaten on resists.  Leading with Malo* is now a great idea as it gives your war a little time, and lessens your chance of a slow resist.<br />
<br />
Second, you won't see as many pulls of 5-8 mobs and the group living, stuff it to hard.  Even if you have a chanter be very wary on CC and help any way you can.  Learn quickly what mobs can and can't be rooted in your xp spots.  (for example in PoV -  Golems, fiends, and small larvae can be rooted.  Larger Larvae (most of them), skeletons, spiders, crawlers all have a chance to be immune to root)<br />
<br />
Third - most xp mobs will now enrage, be ready to back your pet off if your tank isn't positioning the mob properly. <br />
<br />
Fourth - Pets no longer break mez, and when mez is broken everyone in the area receives a message as to who broke it.  There is an exeption though, and somehow every once in a blue moon a pet can break a mez, i believe it happens on a riposte.<br />
<br />
Fifth - DoTs from different people of teh same type/spell now stack.  So 2 shaman could stack 2 BoNs<br />
<br />
Finally - vindi is doable by one group now /boggle<br />
<br />
I'm sure there are tons more, but thats all i can think of this early in the day ;P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Adran Windrunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Read the sticky post at the top of this forum yet? :)Yes. :p  In fact I hadn't checked it for a while, so I re-read it. But while it's all good advice, it doesn't really touch on how the game has changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Adran Windrunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Vulash, those are great, thank you.<br />
<br />
Yeah, from my limited experience so far, and reading here, I've started leading with Malo* and then slowing. I'm also trying casting Stoicism before the mob gets in range, and then slow immediately, so as it pummels me I just regen - especially when the tank is lower warrior and mobs aren't blue. But Malo first generally seems better.<br />
<br />
Eek, unrootable mobs. I haven't done ghetto CC in PoP yet, always had a chanter or just single pulls. I'll remember that and try to watch out for them. Not knowing that in advance could be disastrous.<br />
<br />
Can I just say that pets not breaking mez is AWESOME!  :D Discovered that one today.<br />
<br />
And I didn't know that DoTs now stack. People I've been raiding with recently must think I'm retarded.  :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Here's a question - is there a definitive list of what stacks with what now? I'm mainly thinking HP buffs. In the old days our Talisman/Focus lines didn't stack well with cleric buffs. I don't remember the specifics. Anyone know of a chart, or do I have to hit Lucy and try to figure it out?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fethanin_ECI</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">most of the hp buffs stacking are the same as usualy from what I can remmber, not sure though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kumeldar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The focus line stacks fine with the clerics Buffs, although it doesnt stack with the clerics self only Blessed armor of the risen series so clerics dont always appreciate being buffed with it, most other classes love it though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Third - most xp mobs will now enrage, be ready to back your pet off if your tank isn't positioning the mob properly. <br />
<br />
Thats funny, 54 levels of playing a pally I still gotta laugh at people who think its MY job to position there pet....<br />
<br />
<br />
Disenfecting Aura no longers cure poision BLAH</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Third - most xp mobs will now enrage<br />
<br />
As of 2 or 3 patches ago, xp mobs don't enrage any more.<br />
It's kinda reserved for bosses/mini bosses.<br />
<br />
Actually a nice change, not losing so much DPS in groups/soloing etc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">A year? Man, you must fee like rip van winkle. <br />
<br />
Ok, to help your return, here are a few tips:<br />
<br />
Bards are making a huge move in the &quot;Which Class Sucks Out Loud Most&quot; competition. Followed closely by paladins, who are cranking it up too. Druids, however are still on the throne, shaky as it may be. Feel free to bash any of these classes as you see fit. <br />
<br />
Sebilis has taken LGuk's spot as prime twink farming grounds. <br />
<br />
GWurms are now a sport, not a way to gain xp or useable loot. <br />
<br />
WW is for druid mammoth charming only. <br />
<br />
Soloing a dragon is no longer impressive. Playing main healer in the pit in PoT with 4 tanks and a chanter with a charmed pet is. <br />
<br />
Torpor on Rodcet server is down from 120k to 35k. <br />
<br />
Druids still suck. <br />
<br />
Your nukes are still a joke, just a bit funnier now. <br />
<br />
Mass Cannibalization is god. Canni V &gt; Prenerf MB. <br />
<br />
Your dog will soon be dark blue to you, forever. <br />
<br />
Mages are compatible partners. <br />
<br />
Monks are too high-maintenance to pair with. <br />
<br />
Every tard and his brother has a shaman now, but a good rep will keep you in high demand regardless. <br />
<br />
Druids still suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vulash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Sorry I didn't word it PR safe for those looking for flaws Mrens.<br />
<br />
It depends on the tank, and how he plays.  Some MTs don't position a mob at all.  As the mob gets pushed the pets then slowly work their way to the front.  I'm not going to debate you over who's fault this is, but this is one of those situation where you need to be paying attention.<br />
<br />
Other MTs are constantly aware of where everyone, and all the pets are.  They constantly move as needed for maximum dmg output from the group, and to avoid anyone getting caught in enrage.<br />
<br />
So xp mobs are going to remain the way they currently are?  (not enraging).  I had assumed this was an untended result of something Verant messed up in coding, and would be fixed at some near point in the future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Adran Windrunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">A year? Man, you must fee like rip van winkle.<br />
Somewhere between 18 months and two years since I played Adran, really, but I mucked about with some lowbies during that time.<br />
<br />
And I feel more like Fry from Futurama. :)<br />
<br />
And the self-only cleric buff must be what a friend moaned at me for overwriting the first time I grouped with anyone. He was about level 50 and as far as I can tell they get the first one at 49.</div></div><hr />

It was actually changed back to affect poison again!  Cast time was lowered as well.<br />
<br />

<br />
Reading the patch messages is also a good way to get up to speed:<br />
<br />
http://eq.crgaming.com/patches.asp<br />
<br />
Here's all the changes I can think of:<br />
<br />
* Soul binders in all cities and some other zones to bind melee <br />
* Travel is wonderful, all cities are connected through the Plane of Knowledge <br />
* No more hell levels - exp smoothed out all the way til 60 <br />
* 65 is max limit <br />
* AA points mean that most people will never be &quot;done&quot; with leveling, they definitely put the &quot;ever&quot; back into Everquest <br />
* Flags - upper tier PoP zones require individuals to participate in flagging events (ie boss mob killing) or quests to enter zones <br />
* Monks were nerfed so their defense was less than a plate class (sorry if I didn't explain it correctly, I just remember it was a big deal at the time) <br />
* Cultural smithing - players can now make very nice smithed armor <br />
* Stat/food drinks - really great, not too pricey player made food and drink which add to stats <br />
* The Bazaar - buying and selling is very easy <br />
* Vah Shir (cats) and froglocks are now player races <br />
* Tons of new zones which make leveling easy at the lower levels <br />
* armor dyes - hot pink troll love for everyone! <br />
* CT was revamped to be a high level dungeon <br />
* shaman/cleric now are able to use a player made (via pottery) stone to gate back to their home cities <br />
* Horses! Lizards! <br />
* Low level casters don't have to look at the spell book to med anymore <br />
* If you die before level 10, you respawn with your gear <br />
* Gnome Shadow Knights and Paladins and Halfling Paladins and Rangers! <br />
* An in game MP3 player <br />
* The ability to link item stats for other players <br />
* A permanant compass, depending on your skill (LOVE THIS) <br />
* Custom UIs <br />
* Cross server chatting! ;tell erollisi. gloriana <br />
* EQ IM for chatting with people while not in game<br />
* Two new LOY spell quests put in the game for shaman, stoicism and blood of nadox</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">NPC caster changes - there are mobs now who manaburn, cast malo (where DID that critter get 50k?!?!?), etc.  They have full spellbooks and are a lot more creative in what they use.<br />
<br />
Disinfecting aura will cure just about any tash spell.  However, malo line is still uncurable.  The LoY quest group cure spell is VERY VERY handy for the few mobs who will AE tash your group.<br />
<br />
Paladins are now my favorite tank.  Mages my favorite partner.  Mage pet toys can make their 61 pet a better tank than most PC's, and it's not quite as bad if I land a heal a bit late.  ;)<br />
<br />
I think most of the tards who made horrible twink shaman bots switched to beastlords (THANK you sony).<br />
<br />
Luckily, you're through the trials, which was hands-down the worst thing to happen to the non-uber shaman since I picked up this game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">there are mobs now who manaburn <br />
?????????????????????????????????????<br />
i've seen mobs with malo and poxx and stuff.<br />
what manaburns?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Adran Windrunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Thanks Laughingwoman and Glori.<br />
<br />
I did quickly read through all the old patch messages when I decided to start again - how sad is that?  :D It was a lot of the changes you list, Glori, that convinced me to come back. That and a RL friend who started playing. He has no idea what the game was like before all those things. :)<br />
<br />
One obvious change to the state of the game since I stopped was rather pleasant. Once I thought my chances of ever getting BoN were next to zero, but I just bought and scribed a copy. Those things used to be like gold dust!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shamad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hi everyone, I'm a long time reader, first time poster!<br />
<br />
What finaly made me decide to post was someone said monks are too high maint to duo with, and that they were nerfed bad.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, I two box my level 56 monk (only 6 aa's on him, and is a main, non-twinked) with my 56 (non twinked) shaman in PoP tier 1 all the time.<br />
<br />
The monk-nerf was removed 2 or 3 patches ago, guess you missed that. WIth my bufs only, my monk gets 2737 hp's and 1060'ish AC. That is enough to tank any mob (except archaic, don thav ethe healing power yet) in PoI, RCY mob's in PoD (Dont suggest it though, it's a loooong fight) and all mobs in PoN except the level 60+ spiders, hobs, and guards heh. <br />
<br />
When my level 60 monk friend goes in, we tear up the place non stop. <br />
<br />
SO don't tell any new or re-new people that monks aren't worth the time to group with. They're good tanks with awesome DPS. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Monks are not meatshields. <br />
<br />
Issue closed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Funny, I always thought it was the quality of the player over quality of gear over character's class, in that order, when it comes to finding a group or partner. So what if a Monk isn't a meatshield? If they know how to do their job, that's what matters. I'd rather have a great Monk in mediocre gear than an asstastic Warrior in VT gear anyday. And this is speaking through 50 levels of a Mage pre-Kunark, 60 levels of a Monk pre-velious and 64 levels of a Paladin to date. In all that grouping and raiding, I've found that the quality of the person siting behind the keys means more than anything else. <br />
<br />
You can have that asstastic Warrior that can't taunt, and I'll snicker and rezz you with my Paladin while my Shaman and a mediocre-equipped Monk are still gaining EXP while you rebuff, call up a new pet, etc...<br />
<br />
It's the whole Holy Trinity bias all over again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Just FYI, mobs do not manaburn.  What happened is you probably got hit by a mob casting a high level wizzie nuke like Strike of Solusek or the like.  I've been pegged by those before, and they hurt.<br />
<br />
I have decent resists, and I still can get nuked for 3k or more.  Watch the high level casters!<br />

Hehehhe... Then I will prove you wrong, dreadfully wrong. Come visit my monk and I in PoN nightly on Xegony. My monk can midigate some mean damage.<br />
<br />
Or how about you see my friend's level 62 monk &quot;not midigate damage&quot; on guards on PoN? He has been the main tank on guards in PoN, main tank in the Factory in PoI, etc etc etc.<br />
<br />
Monks can be tanks, and they do midigate damage well.</div></div><hr />
