<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay here is the background:<br />
<br />
Our guild has an &quot;Arena Bash&quot; once every 3-4 months or so where we get together and have duels in which we have an audience, referees, and combatants.  Simple rules, just don't leave the stage area (The Arena off of Lake rathe).  All else is game.  The use of DoTs is per battle (ie. we ask the other combatant if they will allow us to use DoTs...  you lose xp if you die to a DoT).<br />
<br />
It's great fun.  Some epic battles occur.  We have in our guild a beastlord who is pretty stacked.  He's not in elemental gear, but mostly ornate and he's got all the good LDoN stuffs.  His pet is augmented out the wazoo.  Full spell book and about 300 AAs.  In other words, he's a true beast.<br />
<br />
This beastlord usually rules the bash, going undefeated and taking down scores of fairly stacked people.  Even our best pally and SK (300ish AAs, 5k unbuffed hps) have trouble against him.  He's only been beat one time, and that was a fight in which the SK took him down in about 10 secs with a flurry of offensive nukes, discs, and HT.<br />
<br />
So needless to say, he has a stigma about him.  He's the guy everyone shoots for.<br />
<br />
We had another bash yesterday.  Again, the beastlord was steamrolling everyone, including other 65 beastlords.  I showed up just to hang out and watch the fights, and maybe do a duel or two.  I do a fairly good job at these bashes, in fact I've only been beaten by said beastlord... no one else has been able to beat me.<br />
<br />
Said beastlord also has a level 65 druid with full ornate and about 100 AAs that he 2-boxes.  He occasionally 2-boxes in duels and just owns people.  Not even fair, really.<br />
<br />
My main is a 65 shaman with 120ish AAs.  He's got decent gear, nothing spectacular.  I also have a 65 monk that I 2-box, with only 3k unbuffed hps and a SoFW...  doesn't even have his epic yet and only has about 20 AAs.<br />
<br />
So I'm sitting there with my 2 toons, just chewing the cud, when the beastlord announces in /ooc that he would like to see a match-up of his 2 toons vs. my 2 toons.  He said &quot;you think you can beat me?&quot;<br />
<br />
I said &quot;no, but i'll die trying.&quot;<br />
<br />
So we prep, and get in our respective corners of the rings, his 2 toons vs my 2 toons.  I was fully expecting to get owned.<br />
<br />
Why?  Well I've faced him before and I know what it's like.  First, his warder is unfair in PVP.  Quad attacks for 80 and and a proc that goes off once every few secs that stuns you.  He himself does good damage.  You can NOT land a spell on either him or his warder --- PERIOD.  He buffs himself to the gills and it's pretty much over from the moment the starting gun goes off.  He and his warder are VERY hard to get a spell off against without getting interrupted.  Even after I get a Malos on him it's still very hard to land a spell on him.<br />
<br />
The fight starts and I've memmed Tnarg's Mending, Quiescence, Canni IV, Malos, Blind, and Annul Magic.  I literally left 2 spell slots empty 'cause spells are fairly useless against him.<br />
<br />
His warder comes charging for my shaman, as I expected.  2 secs before he engages me, I send in dogdog to run interference.  I don't expect dogdog to last long but it's long enough for me to get some stuff done.  I put my monk on the warder, and then I summon the dog pack (5 additional dogs) onto his warder.  By this time the beastlord himself is beating on my shaman trying to interrupt me.  Little does he know that since the last time I faced him, my shaman got LR4.  ;)  He's having trouble interrupting me.  So I set loose with the spell that would prove to be the ultimate factor in the fight --- DISPELL.  I dispelled the **** out of his warder and himself... until he had no buffs left.  This pretty much turned him into a complete wuss.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, my monk, dogdog, and dogpack have completely owned his warder.  He's had to CH his warder 2 times already.<br />
<br />
Not being used to dispell, the bst stands back to rebuff.  Each time he rebuffs, I dispell.  We go back and forth, buffing, dispelling, healing, meleeing, using discs...  for about 15 mins.  My monk has used all his discs by this point, and I've already summoned my 2nd pack of wolves.  Canni 5 is proving to be huge in the mana-regen battle with his druid.  I was so busy trying to deal with the bst that there was little i could do to battle his druid, who was just sitting on the side medding and throwing heals here and tehre.  I was thinking that his druid was probly full mana, but I had thrown in a little stinker for him --- I dispelled his druid too.  ;)  Hoping to get rid of any mana-regen buffs.<br />
<br />
Little did I know that his druid had run oom 5 mins into the fight and was fairly helpless from that point on... he parked the druid and focused on using his bstlord.<br />
<br />
Like I said, 15 mins had gone by and I was beating the bst down and he was at about 70% health and I decided to put the 2nd dog pack on him... so I summoned them and put the monk on the bst.  This focused DPS knocked the bst down to 20% health and I was expecting his health to shoot up to full like it had been the entire time whenever I got him low... but this time he started running.  I was thinking he was just buying time for his druid to land a heal, but the heal never came.<br />
<br />
I chased him down and his health dropped percent by percent... the monk was pounding the last few bits of his life away.  Finally at 0% the monk landed a hit for 291 and I slayed the mighty beastlord.  Poof went his warder.<br />
<br />
Now all that was left was his oom druid against my wide-eyed monk and my nearly full mana shaman ;), and the monk chased him down and started beating the bejeezus outta him.  He tried to run but since the shaman had dispelled the crap outta him, I memmed a root and parked his ass, and he turned to the monk who pounded the last few parts of his life away.<br />
<br />
Victory was mine.  :)  He easily had a 250 AA advantage to me, but he could not keep up with the shaman mana regen and heals and the dispells turned him into mush.  My monk did too much damage for him to deal with and it soon made his druid run oom.<br />
<br />
It was a great battle and it was a great feeling finally slaying the behemoth.  :)  Everyone in attendance was jaw-dropped.  I now have bragging rights whenever I see him.  :)  I think the keys to the fight were LR4 on my shaman, Quiescence, and dispell and the dog pack.  The shaman never nuked or DoT'd once... his arsenal was strictly heals and dispell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A big congratz is in order, good work and great story!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I wonder if he's going to invest in an instant click buff item to help in the dispell battle?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ophidion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Aye, when i was in my first guild we had monthly meeetings in the arena. We would have a lotto then we would have duels and a royal rumble at the end (usually class/race wars).<br />
The best fight i remember was with a 65 druid with about 100-120 aa (i forget). The fight was a big war of me chaining pets on him to keep him from casting and dispelling all of his buffs. The fight lasted about 25-29 minutes.. he ended up eating poop at the hands of my dog pack + 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just to share one of my favorite duel tactics in the arena (you did say everything was allowed if you stay in the area).<br />
<br />
  Bind yourself on the pad, but int he corner behind or in a pot.  Or on top of the throne cover.  Shrink to minimal size, then midfight when you have a lot of people gunning for you.. gate.   It looks just like invis for the spell animation (or at least used to last time I duelled) and so many people just think that their see invis isn't working properly.   Then all you have to do is maintain a target on them and send out any spells you want from the safety of the pot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">and if somebody does something like what caanus said, watch the pets - they'll give you an instant beeline on where that person is...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grubnuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Not necessarily, Howler.  If you're mid-fight, chances are that your pet is going to have aggro on someone.  Gating won't cause him to stop attacking and return to you.<br />
<br />
If you do plan on gating before engaging a target with doggy, simply tell him to '/guard here' in the middle of the combat platform.  Problem solved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ophidion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">we had certain rules, like you couldn't hide in the fire pots or climb the spires... didn't seem to matter when i won the royal rumble one month... the last 2 people were a shaman and a shaman hehe. Needless to say it was an awesome rumble combined with a spectacular finish /victory on</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Dispelling is just about the number 1 way to defeat anyone.  Meaning, you get rid of their buffs, and you don't have to worry about their mana regen or haste or whatever.  I'm very surprised if he owned this much at pvp that he never had someone else dispell him before.  Hell, the first thing that happens to me whenever I step near someone pvp is I get dispelled.<br />
<br />
Oh, another thing about beastlords.. is that their warders always have a set order their buffs go in.  I have a beastlord and whenever I cast the buffs on him, they always go with the proc and haste first, no matter what order you cast them in.  So, always annul the beastlords warders and you can effectively take him out of the fight.  Even better is if the beastlord attempts to rebuff his warder, since he's using his mana to do that (and it costs alot of mana to fully buff their warders).  I did this once when I was messing around pre-raid to my guilds top beastlord.  I was on mine to get the flag, and I dueled her.  For the most part, she beat my ass (well, i had 5 AAs and she has 400, and she's in full time gear and i'm in full bazaar), however, i did get her oom quickly just by doing that to her pet while she kept trying to rebuff it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My last pvp experience was a GM held ffa in the arena.. ffa for casters/priests. I got 1 kill before I got LBed.<br />
<br />
Rules were no invis, no levitate, no hiding. anything else allowed.<br />
<br />
I'll never do any kind of ffa that allows insta kills. HT is ok, but not disc/improved ht</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">i still play on sullon with my hunter.<br />
<br />
lifeburn, harmtouch, manaburn - all skills that should never exist in pvp to the extent that they do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with you there especially since Berserkers right now can't use any of their discs in PVP.<br />
<br />
Great Job on the Fight. I bet next time everyone will debuff the crap out of him and he will lose everytime now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Herger_Athach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Poguk, I laughed so hard reading this I almost broke a rib.  :D -- Because I have been owned by our guild's Uber BL. He asked me to try a duel with him. I knew I was going to die with only 8Aas compared to his 390 or so. Plus I think in all the years I have played I have avoided duels altogether. But hey, live and learn...die and learn too.<br />
<br />
I think I lasted less than 10 mins with him, and mostly because he was laughing too hard to go after me. The key was the dispelling. He broke me open by dispelling my arse then pounded the life out of me. And...NOW I too know about dispell.<br />
<br />
So, ever so quietly I am labouring on my AAs...and soon, we will revisit the arena.  ;) Thanks again for sharing that. Most entertaining and informative.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Yodelroy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Nice story, but nothing ever beats this shaman pvp story (reposting from Ungkor):<br />
<br />
My best victory was when I (ahem) let a bard sucker me into a duel in Ice Clad Ocean. Good spot for him, wide open areas to run, great visibility. I bound under water near the gnome village; cast and fully buffed a pet, then suspended it.<br />
<br />
We started the fight a short distance apart. When we said Go, I immediately gated. Then I taunted /ooc that he couldn't kill me because he couldn't even find me.<br />
<br />
Next I used a potion to cast Illusion Gnome, and moved to the gnome village. I went inside an igloo, unsuspended my pet, and told him to guard there. I put a DS on with a potion. I went outside to the door of the next igloo. Kept taunting /ooc. He tracked me down, of course, figured out that I was in the village, finally figured out that I had turned into a gnome, and came charging in on me. I ran inside the igloo to hide. But he knew he had me now, so he came right into the igloo after me.<br />
<br />
I stepped in back of him into doorway of igloo, clicked Rabid Bear, and commenced to melee. In fat old bear I completely blocked the doorway. Selos is worthless when you are locked inside an igloo. With Rabid Bear, maxed 2hb skill, and Bone Shod Great Staff, my melee was about the equivalent of his.<br />
<br />
But Alpha Dogdog, guarding one igloo over, immediately came to help, and started attacking right through the wall of the igloo. Took Mr Bard a moment or two to realize what was happening. He turned to attack the dog, realized that was a mistake, and turned back to hit me again.<br />
<br />
In between swings I constantly cast cancel magic on him, stripping his buffs as quickly as he could re sing them. I had 11 junk buffs up, then a low level disease dot to avoid mezz, plus Focus, Sta and DS. He cancelled 8 of my 11 junkers. Every time he hit me -- and he hit me a lot -- he took damage from the DS. I also cast Malicious Decay on him several times: it's just a debuff, it does no actual damage, but its unresistable so it lands every time. I did that to make him worry about why he wasn't resisting this &quot;disease dot.&quot;<br />
<br />
I had myself wedged hard in the doorway, but he still managed to interrupt me some. Even so, I was able to channel through Spirit Call 3, and 5 more dogs popped into existence. (It was quite crowded inside that igloo by now, but almost everyone there was on my team.)<br />
<br />
I channeled through one Quiescence, and that was enough. Quiescence heals 50 hp per second; bard melee isn't quite that much. If you have backed into a corner or wedged yourself in a doorway, you can probably channel Quiescence at least one time out of three tries.<br />
<br />
But just in case, I had a 10 pack of Stinging Wort set up on a hotkey, for 300 point instant heals if I had gotten down below 30 % health.<br />
<br />
Once the bard came inside the igloo to kill me, it was all over in maybe a minute and a half. He got me down to about 45 before Q hit, but I was back up to 60 and rising when he fell into the snow.<br />
<br />
Also, when he got down to about 25, he stopped fighting and tried to run away, trying to squeeze past me out the door of the igloo. I couldn't hit him well at that point, because I was twisting to make sure I had that door blocked: but the six dogs didn't have any trouble eating him up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">A few weeks ago my bro (a 68 pally) had tried dueling a bst (also level 68) in the bazaar arena, and died. While he was dueling this lil 52 war kept attacking him, so I went there with the intention of scaring the warrior out of the arena (root him, debuff him, blind him lol).<br />
<br />
Anyway, I got there and my bro and the beast were recovering, so I healed them a bit. The beast asked if I wanted to duel. I hadn't really done duels before, except for messin' with my bro (see how I was gonna mess with the war). I accept and we agree to use only our own buffs, dispell is not allowed, debuffs are allowed, and pets are allowed. <br />
<br />
We buff ourselves and our pets up, then I wait for him to med to full. =)<br />
<br />
We walk into the arena and he immediately sicks his pet on mine and attacks my pet. Dogdog lasts a few seconds with enrage (muahaha) and I cast a few spells that are resisted after Malos and MD. After my pet is dead the beastlord comes for me. He can't stick any spells on me, and I can't cast any on him, but I can cast heals and HoTs on myself! I back myself against a wall to help prevent him from interupting my spells so much, try dotting him every now and then, all the while my 32 point DS is eatting at his hasted dual wielding self, and his warder. =)<br />
<br />
So he's using his discs, and I'm standing there chomping away at my own arm. He stops attacking to heal himself and his warder, and to refresh Ferocity when needed. Eventually he runs out of mana, and can't redo his ferocity, I stack Sisslak and Bane on him and he starts running out of the arena! He makes it just outside and then dies.<br />
<br />
We talked a little afterward, found out he had a bigger mana pool and more HP than I did, although he was 2 levels lower. I've seen him dueling lots of people in the bazaar before. He wants a rematch, but now the bazaar arena is gone.<br />
<br />
Fight lasted about 20 minutes I guess. Never could get wolf pack to cast since it takes so long. =\</div></div><hr />
