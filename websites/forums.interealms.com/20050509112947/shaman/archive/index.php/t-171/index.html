<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ragz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">left the game for a while and recently started shaman again.  I procured one of these babies with my startup capitol, just hit 36th and started procing it.<br />
<br />
Suddenly i'm beeing offered prices upwards of 50-60k for it from the local uber guild.  Is there something going on I don't know about?  Impending nerf..? (again)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hyllus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">is it Pre-nerf ? Clickable from inventory?<br />
<br />
If so its worth some cash</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ragz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Post nerf staff, thought about that.<br />
<br />
Last offer was AoN or BE Greaves + random items I didn't care about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hyllus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heh wish my server had your price's i have a tuff time selling mine for 7k ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">hyllus,<br />
<br />
i'll buy it.  contact me in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Had someone offer me an AoN for mine a while back.  Should have taken it, but I wasn't sure how much either was worth, and I was completely addicted to my fungi staff in my pre-torpor stage :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, the staff is an amazing shaman item, plus more and more beastlords are getting into the 35+ range.  Add to that the fact that fewer people are camping the Spore King and you have a rising price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Durich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Bought Mine for 5K about 6 months ago and now I am getting offers of 15k...  I think all the Beastlords bought all the excess and now they are back in demand .. gotta love EQ economy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Prowlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I heard they stopped dropping.....that is why the huge inflation.   But EQ is like wall street...rumors affect pricing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I had one, pre-nerf its junk!<br />
<br />
It snares u, only stacks with regen after a sow is applied and that dont work in a dungeon.  Also doesnt stack with fungi tunic.  Don't see what the big deal is...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Azhdarkhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The big deal is it's mana free Regrowth that can in the great outdoors be made to stack with other regen effects.  In places where running away won't save you, the snare effect doesn't really matter.  In places where running away might save you, it can be clicked off (though SoW would need to be reapplied - works nicely partnered with Black Fur Boots.)<br />
<br />
I was fortunate enough to buy one from a newly-ordained Oracle who had outgrown it for about 2k pp.  It has come *very* handy ever since - I don't have the funds for a fungi tunic (especially lately) and this makes a very nice second option.  Whether it's worth the exorbitant prices mentioned above is a dubious proposition, but any item is worth exactly as much as someone is willing to pay for it/part with it for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">a day doesn't go by where I do not use my staff on either my shaman or my beastlord.  It is the most used item I have with exception of my Jbb.  <br />
yes, you can use it in dungeons effectively.  If you have to flee, just click it off????</div></div><hr />
