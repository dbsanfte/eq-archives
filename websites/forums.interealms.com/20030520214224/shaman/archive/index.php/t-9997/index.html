<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm having some trouble figuring out which (2) spells for low mana cost is best for gaining agro. I usually tank mobs or if not root &amp; dot, if I'm soloing. But agro kiting say a totally MR mob that doesn't summon, while the pet chews it up is sometimes helpful.<br />
<br />
I say 2 spells because that's generally all the spell slots I have remaining for such occations. I've skimmed over the Shaman Tip's post and someone said try Disempower. I'll have to try that, but from you all's experience, what other spells for low mana cost and generally a fast cast time can cause the best agro? <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for the help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ScRuBbA</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">disempower works fine, im assuming u slow just in case as well even if ur not fighting it &quot;in teh face&quot;, that should be a lot of aggro already, also cripple has lots of aggro on it<br />
<br />
then... basically any poison dot (poison counters) will cause massive aggro as well, only SKs/Pallys that know what theyre doing r going to be able to get aggro off you after those spells r cast (slow, cripple, posion dot)</div></div><hr />

<br />
when I kite ice burrowers I just use insideous decay and pox to keep agro, make sure you have /taunt off</div></div><hr />
