I have about 36 to stun resist...and I resist stun on those AoEs (like in Inkuta and generally a lot of mobs)  quite often, so get it higher and it will be worth it :), along with AAs to cast through stuns and what not, it will be wonderful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">well, I have 25 on me right now and I notice it going off alot.  Has saved my ass plenty of times while running from here to there, then again, some of the times that I wish it went off it didn't and I died.<br />
<br />
Either way, there are things like that where you may not seem to notice it alot, but it's there.  Last night I got DTd in Inktu'tu and it hit me for 16400, which means that my spell shield blocked a good amount of it.  Not enough yet to actually save me, but nice to know that it's working.  Shielding is something else that although i dont' have alot of, I notice it sometimes, including the time when quarm doubled me for 3780 (2% shielding baby).</div></div><hr />

LoL, thanks, that was worth the chuckle over a morning cup of coffee!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am finding that so many others want spell shielding or shielding that it comes easy.</div></div><hr />
