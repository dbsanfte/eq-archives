1. You must be using 1024 x 768 to use this UI.<br />
<br />
2. Create a copy of the default UI folder in the uifiles directory and rename it to custom for example.<br />
<br />
3. Extract the files int he zip to this directory.<br />
<br />
4. Go into the game and type /loadskin custom (or whatever the name of your folder was).<br />
<br />
5. The UI should be visible.<br />

Not 100% sure what you mean. But I think this is it:<br />
<br />
The files in my zip replace existing files, but you still have to have all of the other files from the starting default folder. When I modified I just created a copy of the default and named it custom.<br />
<br />
I then modified the 9 files that are in the zip file. I didn't all of the files from the directory, just the ones I changed.</div></div><hr />

Error loading skin &quot;Aruman\&quot;, atempting to load default.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Download the file ONE more time if you have it already.<br />
<br />
If you haven't downloaded it then nothing to worry about.<br />
<br />
1. Make a copy of the default folder under uifiles, rename it anything you like... custom for example<br />
<br />
2. Extract the files in this zipfile to that copy of the folder<br />
<br />
3. Enter the game and type /loadskin &lt;foldername&gt;, where &lt;foldername&gt; is the name of the copy folder.<br />

It works now, tested it with a guildie. Sorry about the slight mess.</div></div><hr />

Thanks Njorls... I have more plans for the hotkeys and spells, but I am trying to figure a few things out. Maybe a guide or GM will give me the info I need.<br />

Most important thing to remember with this UI is that you must use 1024 x 768.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sendadar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Can you take bits and pieces and intermingle other parts from other UI's or are we locked to having to have all the files to make this UI work?<br />
<br />
Just a question.  I have been experimenting trying to get the best UI setup and most efficient I have a few pieces, but want to know if I can integrate them into the mix with your files.  hehe...<br />
<br />
Sendadar    :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well, you can mix, but I have found you usually have to change a few things in the files to get them to work.<br />
<br />
You can take individual windows and selectively copy the file to the custom directory. Whether it works without making a few changes is the questionable part.<br />
<br />
If you modify mine all I ask is that you send a copy of the changed file to me. Not going to stress over it tho.</div></div><hr />

Just one question. My neckslot item is a right clicker and I would like to add it to the clicker menu. When I right click on an item in the clicker menu and hold down, EQ crashes much like it did when they first gave us the new ui. How do I go about modifying the contents of this menu? <br />

I tried the reverse and right click+hold on the inventory and onc I got the icon it still didnt work when I placed it in the clicker window.<br />

BTW have to take the .txt extension off, sorry posting from a mac so no way to zip it up and it only allows you to post curtain extensions. =)<br />

Send me an email with what inventory slot items you want in the click area. No more than 8 though :)<br />
<br />
I will modify the file and email it back to you.<br />
<br />
I'm curious though... what did you mean by right click and hold causes a crash? Didn't do that here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Ezeekial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Just curious im at Work and can't try it out. Are the clickables Hot-keyed?

Taraddar, all I have to do is save that text file to my modUI to get the numbers after the mob? When I save it it saves as a notepad file. <br />
<br />
As I said you have to take the .txt extension off the end. If you have windows it's probably hiding it so you'll need to go to view - folder options - view and uncheck hide file extensions for kown types.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, I didn't make them hot-keyed, but this way makes it much easier to use things like RH BP, CD Legs, Buff earrings, etc... without having to open the inventory window.<br />
<br />
You can still drag items to hotkeys if you like. I haven't found it to be all that necessary with this setup.<br />
<br />
I never used alt casting... The text does show when horizontal, but I'm sure I could do something to change the text positioning if I felt it was necessary for me. I never needed to use the alt key to see the spells I had memmed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It should show up when you do /loadskin &lt;foldername&gt;, where &lt;foldername&gt; is the folder with the files in it.<br />
<br />
If not then click the Icon in the Window Selector that will say Right C'icks when you hover over it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What do you mean by listing?<br />
<br />
Each Inventory Slot is assigned a unique EQ Type number. If you look in the EQUI_Inventory.xml and EQUI_Pet.xml files you can look at the code and find EQType for each of the Inventory Slots.<br />
<br />
Holding down the left mouse button over a right click item causes EQ to crash?<br />
<br />
Don't think that happens here but I will look into it.</div></div><hr />

Gonna take a shot at modifying your clickables window to handle additional inventory spots.  I saw your offer to customize this, but will hopefully spare your time for more useful stuff.  Besides I need a reason to dig into xml.<br />

I can confirm this....I held a left click to attempt to swap out a different inventory item, and got a nice look at my desktop wallpaper.<br />
<br />
<br />
One thing I would like to be able to do is pop up additional chat windows, so I can split off some helpful messages.  I can pop up the new windows, but I am unable to resize them.  Anychance there is an easy mod to allow the chat window(s) to be resized?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I used it last night in a NToV raid where I was the only level 60 Shammy (another shammy level 56 with us).  Talk about annoying, 45 peeps begging for rebuffing while I'm taking care of newly-rezzed people, while peeps begging for Epu, while we're PULLING!<br />
<br />
Anyway, the new skin make all that much easier :)  I wpnder if it's possible to put a couple of pet buttons on the clickables, like attack and back off, if you can't do that, I'll just drop them as hot buttons, but I need all my hotbuttons for debuff notices :)<br />
<br />
BTW, I'm glad you didn't have any tools to help you make this, as I think that forced you to be very minimalistic.  And with the new UI, less is DEFINATELY more!  Oh, and I love watching my tiny FT get big when I pull it out of my inventory  :)</div></div><hr />

Yes, this is also an easy change to make.<br />
<br />
I rarely if ever use a second window so I disabled resizing.<br />
<br />
Look in EQUI_ChatWindow.xml.<br />
<br />
Go all the way to the bottom of the file and you will see a line<br />
<br />
{Style_Sizable}false{/Style_Sizable}<br />
<br />
Change it to <br />
<br />
{Style_Sizable}true{/Style_Sizable}<br />
<br />
where the { and } are &lt; and &gt; respectively.<br />
<br />
use /loadskin &lt;directoryname&gt; to reload the xml and you will be set.<br />
<br />
I will look into fixing that left click problem.<br />

I dont use his inventory screen. So I am wondering why I still crash when I hold Left click on items. <br />
<br />
This is puzzling me also Xantrik.<br />
<br />
I seriosuly don;t understand why this is happening, unless its some issue with the window I am using, but I doubt it.<br />
<br />
I have a suspicion as to what it might be. I will keep everyone posted.</div></div><hr />

Try left click and hold please.<br />
<br />
I have been trying to track down the issue and haven't seen a thing that could be causing it.<br />
<br />
If you dontl get a crash please send the EQUI_PetInfo.xml file to me.<br />
<br />
Would be greatly appreciated!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Second, if I wanted to replace the hotkey window with the default one, which file do i replace? not sure if i like the horizontal one or not yet :).</div></div><hr />

<br />
To Hide the Clickables window press Alt-F1.<br />
<br />
To replace the hotkeys with the default...<br />
<br />
1.  Copy EQUI_HotButtonWnd.xml from the default directory to the directory where you put my files.<br />
<br />
2.  Type /loadskin {foldername} where {foldername} is the foldername where the custom files are.<br />
<br />
I am still working on that problem with the left click and hold in the clickables window. I still haven't figured out why that is happening. I have some suspicions but have to find the time to confirm.</div></div><hr />

THEN on accident mind you I found out how to change the chat window LOL  The right click menu is on the BOTTOM of the window and found the menu, my chat is now tan and solid.

<br />
Ok new things....  I to have the problem where if I left click the right clickables box I crash to desktop....  did it twice in a group with my baby tank yesterday!<br />
<br />
Is there a way to edit the clickables box?  I mean my warrior... her gaunts are cobalt and clickable but gaunts are in the clickables... and her boots are clickable but aren't showing in the clickables box at all :/ <br />

SHould be able to fix that by copying your defaults folder and reapplying the mod again. Verant changed some of the xml files in the last patch to add that feature and if you don't have those changes it crashes when you try to access those.</div></div><hr />

I chose what ones I wanted there.<br />

If you go look at the tables available for EQ Types, you can go change the numbers in the EQUI_PetInfo.xml file to suit your needs more.</div></div><hr />

I only dl-ed the mod and applied it yesterday, after the last patch by VI.</div></div><hr />

(other than the clickables and I could play with it later) BUT I can't use this skin....  since I started to use it I've had 3 hard system freezed ups.... yep that's hit the reboot button, OUCH! <br />
<br />
I went back to default skin /cry and I've not locked up since....  Any thoughts?  I REALLY loved the set up and had it PERFECT!  colors, fading, placement, chat screen size /snicker but alas it don't like me.</div></div><hr />

What files are you replacing in your mod? If the eqanimations file is one of them you probably either need to download a new version of the mod if possible or edit that file manually to add what verant added to it this last patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">I need a little help, I downloaded and then loaded this ui. I changed the resolution to the one needed on my desktop AND the options in the game login. The different baxes are still overlapped when I run EQ (the spell icons, clickables, hotkeys all overlap the chat box). Do I need to do something else to change the resolution?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">It seems that the window I used for clickables does not like everything about inventory slots being placed there.<br />
<br />
I am reworking a few of the windows to fix the left click crash to desktop problem.<br />
<br />
I should have the fixes posted by tomorrow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">You used the pet window controller for the clickable window. It could be that in the schema that window will only accept left click commands. <br />
<br />
But I have not looked personnaly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Nadia_brell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">I *love* your inventory window <br />
<br />
BUT<br />
<br />
there's no ammo slot ((<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone with a grandmaster trophy (player made) will be unable to use this because the trophy &quot;autoequips&quot; in the ammo slot<br />
(where it has no benefit)<br />
<br />
using your window,<br />
theres no way to access the ammo slot to put the trophy in the range slot  (where you receive the stat benefits)</div></div><hr />

As he's said before his ammo slot is over with his clickies because he has a horse he keeps there.</div></div><hr />
