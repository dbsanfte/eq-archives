<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've heard people talk about xp here at PoJ zoneout so thought I'd try it at 57. First impressions were good, but went rapidly downhill.<br />
<br />
I started with a rat. It was an easy kill, but I got a couple extras; they were manageable, but after killing all 3 xp wasn't good and I'd burnt a lot of mana.<br />
<br />
I then tried a sentry and it went great. Lost maybe a bub of mana and a bub or so of health, and got a bit under 1%xp. Figured I could keep pulling these for loads of xp, but no.... didn't quite work out.<br />
<br />
Firstly there aren't that many of them around that area. Secondly, the pathing is damn strange and they tend to warp all over the place, sometimes taking dogdog with them. Thirdly I get problems with adds whilst pulling em back to zoneout.<br />
<br />
The worst is this lizard monk guy, Sralm Noramir. He's a PITA, he is always aggroing me. Why!? None of the other prisoners do. Then there are the rats who seem to love a fight, and sow themselves so I need dispell up. <br />
<br />
Between the warping and adds, I've decided to try elsewhere for now. Does anyone have any tips for the zoneout as it seems a shame to waste a potentially nice spot if I can sort it out.</div></div><hr />
