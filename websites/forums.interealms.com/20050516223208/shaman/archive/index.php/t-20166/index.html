<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Togh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I put this idea in another thread and the more I thought about it...the more I liked it, so I decided to create a new thread to discuss it. Here is a cut and paste of what I put in the other thread:<br />
<br />
------------------<br />
<br />
What if they gave us a new type of CH? We're shaman...let's be different. How about a blast CH?<br />
<br />
Here are some possible thoughts and you can fiddle with the numbers to balance...<br />
<br />
Name: ??? (I'm not creative)<br />
Mana: 500<br />
Casting Time: 3.5 seconds<br />
Description: Heals up to the target to 65% (note it works different then current 75% CHs...see examples) of it's max HPs up to a total of 5000 HPs.<br />
<br />
Example1:<br />
Warrior has 10k HP. He is at 50% when heal lands. Total HP after heal would be 6500 for a 1500HP heal. &lt;--- notice cap at 65%<br />
<br />
Example2:<br />
Warrior has 10k HP. He's at 25% when heal lands. Total HP after heal would be 6500 for a 4000HP heal. &lt;--- notice cap at 65%<br />
<br />
Example3:<br />
Warrior has 10k HP. He's at 5% when heal lands. Total HP after heal would be 5500 for a 5000HP heal. &lt;--- doesn't hit the cap in this case<br />
<br />
Effectively this type of heal is the oh **** heal that heals for more the more dire the circumstance is. This is exactly the type of heal that I want. The tank is never at full HP with this heal so Q or the new super-Q spell is always at work. This is the perfect type of backup healing spell.<br />
<br />
Change the numbers around for balance. Make it 60% or 70% or make it a 3 second cast time or 4 seconds or make max heal 6k or make it 400 mana...whatever. But it's this type of spell that improves the more dire the circumstance that will set Shaman apart, but is not overpowering in other circumstances!!<br />
<br />
Come on designers....be creative!!! Make a new type of healing and give it to shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shoendesae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I kind of like it. Very situational, limited (cause we know how much SOE love to limit) and a general plus in the needed situations. <br />
<br />
Quick, mildly costly, maybe even give it a marginally long refresh time of near 10-20 seconds. <br />
<br />
Not too much to ask for IMHO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A 10-20 seconds refresh time would make it so situational it would hurt, but I really like the rest of the idea.  If &quot;balance&quot; is still a factor, they could always throw the same damn spell to the druids, and call it even since they still are superior in the rest of their heals.<br />
<br />
This would actually alow us to Heal in GOD, kinda...  Would be very risky since your only topping your tank to 65, but since you could chain it with the relatively small cast time you would be able to keep the tank up.  It would end up being extrodanarily (sp?) costly, resulting in a small med break after every fight you need to use it in, but that I feel makes it more ballanced.  We can be main healers, still keep all of our other tools, but come with the distinct drawback of needing more med time.  Kinda a switch for shaman hehe, but still creative, and I for one wouldn't mind it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">thats the way they should have done it, a ch to whatever % not this caped at 2k or 5k<br />
so druid say ch to 80%  shaman ch to 70%  would seem fine to me, likely be a 10 sec cast though. obvously cleric still better over all.<br />
<br />
mind with them capping ch at 7.5k, means druid capped at 6k, shaman at 5k., seems fair to me. or even at 60% is 4.5k ish for shaman<br />
<br />
mind with capped ch , they could increase cleric ch to 8 to 10 k etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This idea is way to good and balanced to ever make it into the game</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">the more i think about the more, i like this idea.  the incomplete heal never struck me as a ch, it was just a whatever cap heal.<br />
<br />
ch was too powerful hence the 7k cap. they should have just changed it to a %, so at 44? ch would be to 80%. then at 54 could be 87% 64 95% etc.<br />
<br />
druid gets 70% at 58, 80% at 65<br />
shaman gets 50% at 58, 60 at 65.<br />
<br />
something like that <br />
<br />
another idea was maybe like first aid aa for bind wound, so can ch to 50% then get aas to increase to 60, 70, <br />
druid 60%, then add to  80%<br />
then just have the quick heals / Q for rest.<br />
 bit rambling, just ideas:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Please dear god STOP with the refresh times.  Have we not learned yet how a refresh time kills a spell ?<br />
<br />
Other then that this is actualy a great idea. Its so obvious and easy. Good job for brining it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">With a cap at around 65% health it would leave the tank low enough that there'd be significant risk still on mobs that hit for as much as the god mobs do.  That seems to ballance well with the fact that other than that it would be a fairly powerfull heal (also the situational part of it). Also you couldn't replace tnarg's with it, so you'd need an extra spell slot if you were going to be using it.  But actually would be situationaly usefull unlike kragg's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I like this one, a lot.<br />
<br />
There would never be a circumstance where this would heal close to a CH, there might be circumstances where it healed comparable to a druid CH but you would still need to cast a new heal soon since it never tops people off.<br />
Also comboes nicely if you are healing a group together with a Druid - this + Druid CH = Cleric CH.<br />
<br />
Not so sure if it would be any good on raids - even ducking out of casts its hard to catch people low enough so this helps.<br />
<br />
Clearly we need this and Bara cudar's rain heal (a single Tnarg's on the closest 4 not-full-health PCs)  :) <br />
<br />
Yep, I think that would do nicely for a set of heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">what I would rather see is channelling heals. Channelling is something that everquest desperately needed to bring in spellcasting diversity. Yet they never incorporated it. Channelling spells, for those who dont know, require the caster to remain perfectly still and not beat on for the spell to take effect, but the effect is powerful.<br />
<br />
For example, why not have heals over time that heal 1000+ dmg per tick, yet they require channelling, and drain 150 points of mana every tick. The heal would be incredibly efficient, at the tradeoff of being unable to patch heal in case of emergency.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1000 damage healed with essentially a cast time of 6 seconds and a mana cost of 150 is less efficient then Q and barely more efficient then Tnarg's.<br />
A focused AAd Tnarg's is around 1700 damage healed for 320 mana. With the possibily of crits, no slot taken up, no stacking issues, no &quot;stand still and do not get hit&quot; requirement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">What I think PennyAntics meant was:<br />
<br />
healing 1000dmg per TICK<br />
for 150mana per TICK<br />
for whatever duration<br />
<br />
BUT, you have to stand still 'casting' it during its ENTIRE running duration. Moving or doing something else would immediately interrupt the spell. Much like Blizzard in WC3.<br />
<br />
Nice idea, but I think it is too much to ask for a whole new spell casting concept to be implemented. Keep it simple.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, and that spell would be inferior to Tnarg's - you can cast a Tnarg's every 6 seconds already and it will heal way more damage, not have stacking issues, not take up a buff slot and not require the shaman not to be hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I was just choosing arbitrary numbers, make it heal 2000 hp/tick, whatever. My point was channelling spells should have been implemented.</div></div><hr />
