<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This question kinda got lost in the weapons for a warrior twink thread, so here it is again :)<br />
<br />
I am pleveling a warrior twink (kitty) to duo box with. Kitty is for my own personal use and will never be a main.<br />
<br />
Currently Kitty is level 27. I'm looking for a fast route to 50. Kitty will be buffed cuddled snuggled and spoiled by myself (level 61 shaman). <br />
<br />
I've tried netherbian lair - the xp was bad at level 21, the regen annoying, the amount of time to kill a single mob tedious.<br />
<br />
I've outgrown echo caverns (fungal side) - I can kill all the boglings and needlites before they respawn, and most needlites are now blue to me.<br />
<br />
I tried Maru Seru (stonegrabbers and anything else that wandered up), it was ok, but over an hour and 40 minutes to get a level. I did get iron oxide for my pottery habit so that was okayish.<br />
<br />
So where to from here?<br />
<br />
I am thinking, either HHK guards or Crystal Caverns Orcs till 34ish.<br />
<br />
Then Underbulks/Taskmaster's room in the Deep side of Echo caverns till 51.<br />
<br />
Any other ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zorash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">&lt;font color=navy&gt;I personally did Unrest until about 30.  The basement yields decent xp and a couple low-mid level items.  If you're playing a twinked toon and being pled by a shammie you could probably do better elsewhere though.  At 27 I'd recommned trying the OT until about 35ish.  They should all be very red mobs but with tugurs and cripple on them plus some nice shaman buffs on the war, you should be fine.  After that, if it were me, I'd take the toon to OOT and take down some seafuries.  The xp should be great at 35 and you can do that for quite a while(I soloed there from 47 to about 50 with Zor)  It may be tricky at first, but I think he'll be able to handle it again assuming twinked, good buffs/debuffs and some heals.  By the time he hits 45-ish if you haven't moved on from sheer boredom, you'll be much richer from all the nice gems the furies drop :)<br />
<br />
This is how I would do it.  It's probably not the &quot;uber&quot; way to do it, but that's because I don't have the cash to get the uber gear (fungis and the sort) for myself, let alone my alts.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Greakan_VF</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My personal favorite PL path to 55, beginning at 27:<br />
<br />
27-42 - Kaesora (exp modifier there is awesome)<br />
<br />
42-55 - The Hole (again, good modifier. You will struggle a bit at 42 but by late 40s you'll handle them good and exp will flow)<br />
<br />
Did an Ogre warrior from 1-55 in about two weeks, less than 7 days played. Took this route.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Unknown_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Make some blistering flesh potions and get a 2 handed practice sword.<br />
<br />
I'm PLing a tank atm.  He's level 37, and I do do in my spare time.<br />
<br />
I did newbie grounds Steamfont until level 14.  Then took off for LOIO.  Gave him some burning flesh potions.  (1+lvl/2).  Pull a whole bunch of skeletons and kitties and just have him whack away.  The Skels and cats dont run when low, and as long as he gets a hit in you are good.  The bonus is that all of his Defense, Dodge, Parry and Riposte skills will skyrocket.  Just make sure to keep track of his skills in weapons and swap out when one maxxes.  I have within 5 pts of Max skill in all weapons/bash atm.<br />
<br />
I believe the practice sword starts proccing at lvl 20ish, which give a 6pt stackable DS as well.  And I went to the Overthere at like 25.  Was fun at lvl 25 to have my tank taking out lvl 38 tigers.  Rhinos and tigers dont run when they are low and are great to pull in.  <br />
<br />
I don't know if Kats are KoS in the outpost (I think they are), but if they aren't the bonus is the bezerker whip quest which is significant exp til high 30s.  Will also get you an OT hammer, which when trapped in a bad place is pretty good to whip out and get a proc to get yourself outta dodge.<br />
<br />
Process was, when working on weapon and defense skill ups to NOT slow the critters and let them beat themselves against the tank until Defense and related skills were maxxed.  Then you slow the critters until offense skills are maxxed.   Then you start using DS potions and the Practice sword (Swap it out as soon as it procs for higher damage), just to mow things down to get to the next level.  At less than 50% health I would JBB the critter.  <br />
<br />
Also get a horse.  Nothing ever aggros a 60 shammy in most locations as long as they are standing up.  And I never found mana regen a problem because of the horse sitting rate.<br />
<br />
I plan on hitting CoM soon...Maybe tonight if I get the chance.  There is a huge modifier there, but things tend to run when low there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Tried Kaesora at 27 last night, insane exp. about 1 1/2 blue's a kill. Generally empty also, indeed a great great place to pl a mele twink. <br />
<br />
But if you arent familiar with the area, give your mele a gate potion. Large dungeon. Also bring a snare proc'ing weapon. No sow/runspeed and trying to kill something 5+ levels higher than you tends to run quite a ways sometimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Wow, I'll have to check it out :) <br />
<br />
Aye, I usually cast paralyzing earth on her mobs. Makes things easier to dual box.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did SolA til 35 then Nurga to 45 then LGuk (king camp) till 55th. Also did Seafuries for cash in the 40 - 50 range. Made around 20k there for those levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Try underwater, there is a very nice bonus for fighting with the risk of drowning (get an EB item, of course).  Kedge Keep is great exp at the entrance until 35 or so, and with you there to keep him alive, you can probably do quite well there now.<br />
<br />
Once you are done with Kedge, move to Lake of Ill Omens, and do the bloodgill goblins.  They are good til near 50.  I solo'd them with a Troll warrior with fungi starting at about 45, made mad exp.<br />
<br />
Liberal use of potions helped me a ton.  Try using cripple but not slow, or a lower level slow.  Put up a damage shield and watch them melt.  Buff the crap out of the twink, remember to use the group versions to get stuff onto him that you cannot get on him directly (group him, buff yourself).<br />
<br />
My 2-box warrior is now 59th, soon to be 60th.  He is invaluable for me, allowing me to do legitimate exping even for short periods of time, and providing me an instant group.  Getting him flagged for second tier planes has been a pain, though.  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Droga and Nurga are great ideas...not only do you get experience for your warrior but you can do chardok faction at the same time.<br />
<br />
This gives you and your warrior (with patience) a great finger and wrist/shoulder item that duod you could farm all the parts for. A long haul but some very nice rewards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Slargg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I definately have to reccomend doing ot for a while, getting the ot hammer at the same time as exp was great. Now I can use the hammer to proc ot and shammy spiritstone to get both characters easily to pok/travel so going out of the way is only a 1 way trip. You will need about 200 braids and that should take about 6 levels if you focus on the bezerkers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, I decided to do nurga for awhile because I do want those rings/cord. At 27, she got 1 1/4 blue per kill. She is now level 32, with only about five hours of work... maybe six, I did bring some friends in for one level and pleveled them all a bit.<br />
<br />
Things just turned white at 31. I might be moving to droga soon depending on how good the xp remains. I have no idea how well I've improved my faction yet, but I suspect I haven't killed enough... but I can go up to 47 in droga so hopefully then I'll make it :)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well, I got her to 35 in Droga. Sadly, most things in the first areas were already blue when she went in at 32. At 35, I conned the gobby traitor... damn, still threatening.<br />
<br />
Right now we're in the safe room near the rail room and making good time, the last level took an hour and fifteen minutes. I am hoping to move in deeper, maybe camp the idol of the thorned eventually, but am a bit discouraged at the lack of progress with chardok faction.</div></div><hr />
