<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With new patch and according to Lucy, Disinfecting aura will now remove 48 counters of disease. hum not sure if 48 counters is really needed on 1 personn ;). <br />
<br />
No double use with Pure blood, and now i can delete abolish disease (i used it to remove slow on charmed pet but not tash, wich is poison. was annoying kinda to remove slow and tash).<br />
<br />
Better than nothing</div></div><hr />

<br />
I saw the spell info too, and I hope stoicism will be easy to find, because pure blood just do what disinfecting aura used to do, and I never had to use it before.<br />

Dohrian, bear 57 on A.Ro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I personally think that the pure blood/old disinfecting aura spells were very useful, i can think of a couple situations that it saves a considerate ammount of time and spell slots, like when i solo in CT some of the lizards will poison and disease dot you, getting rid of that in one fairly fast cast is nice, plus.. in trials of execution a lot of the mobs tash and slow the melee, invaluable to get rid of both right away so it doesnt hurt the dps.</div></div><hr />
