<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Adran Windrunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi folks. As mentioned elsewhere, I'm back in the game after a break. The new interface is (mostly) much better than the old, but I still haven't completely learnt my way around it.<br />
<br />
I get quite bad lag in some of the Luclin and PoP zones, and need to try and remember what kind of stuff I can turn off to improve it. I've found a lot of display controls that used to be done from the command line, but not sure if they're all there.<br />
<br />
Does /serverfilter still work? What about /showspelleffects and all that kind of stuff?<br />
<br />
If anyone has a list of what to set for lag reduction in raids, I'd be grateful, as it'd save me having to experiment during the raid itself!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">/serverfilter works again.<br />
<br />
When in huge raids, this is what I do<br />
/shownames 1 -- this in itself seem to make a huge difference.<br />
<br />
Then I open the options window and<br />
Spell effects Low<br />
 Particle effects Low<br />
I turn off other melee hits/misses<br />
I turn off damage shields<br />
<br />
If I'm still having a bit of a slow-down, then spell/particle effects go off, and I switch spells/songs/etc to group only<br />
<br />
Outdoors in Luclin and -- I believe -- PoP and Ykesha, you can /showgrass off, and turn off some small graphical doodads on the ground.  Like I said, I believe PoP and Ykesha have some of these &quot;grass&quot; objects in the outdoor areas.  Haven't looked yet.<br />
<br />
Sometimes the new UI (even the default UI) can load incorrectly upon zoning.  This can cause your system to start slowing down further and further.  If you find yourself with an abysmal framerate, try /loadskin YourSkinName 1</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Adran Windrunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The /shownames tip is great - I saw the command in the /help but I didn't think of using it in a raid. That's so much better than the old way of hiding the whole name, and trying to figure who people are from their armour. :)<br />
<br />
It looks like everything I used to do is still there, but with better control in many cases. Plus of course I'm glad /serverfilter got fixed!<br />
<br />
I'll make a hotkey for the UI reload, too. Thanks. :)</div></div><hr />
