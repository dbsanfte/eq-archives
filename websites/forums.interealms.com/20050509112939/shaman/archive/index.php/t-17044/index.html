<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Doleck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can you speed up Canni 4 with fucous effect? With the speed of ldon I'm constantly at full hp but oom, I dont' have time to canni down to 30 percent and heal back.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">All spell haste items only affect spells with 3.0s casting time or more, and all Canni spells are 2.5s, so no.<br />
<br />
Getting the Cannibalization discipline should help a lot in your situation though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">With Full Health and Virtue you should be able to back off of one fight ever 3 mins and either Torpor Self (I tend to cast before Canni 5) or cast Tnag'S Healing.  I realize Tnags is not near a mana effencent.  But hey if your OOM any mana is better then no mana.  And heck Canni 5 will be back up online in only 3 mins which in LDoN enviroments goes buy fast as all get out.  I just tap &quot;V&quot; (After I select Canni 5 from the Alt Advance menu) and am able to get an exact time when it should be refreshed.  You can use the &quot;V&quot; key at any time even while casting.  A second tap will cause it to dissappear once you get your refresh time.  Oh and for those not awear of this timer being there its in the top right corner of the info portion of the Canniblization ablitity.</div></div><hr />

You know, there is a much much much much much much much much much easier way.  Just click the canni5 hotkey button and it tells you how long it will be. No need to open your AA menu.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have my canni 5 button attached to a Hotbutton with a group message in the Action Menu.  This is so my wife does not beat the heck out me when my HP suddly drops to half.  Fun the first few times then it starts to hurt.  So needless to say if I click that to get a time then the group gets a false message.  Thoug also if you click the canni button you start to cast requiring you to duck out of the casting if you are not ready or wanting to use the ability.  Its just as fast to use the &quot;V&quot; key, does not use up a Hot Button slot, and can be used any time.  (I also have the Alt advance window set to 1/2 transparency so can still see what is going on.)  Only ussually have it up for 1-3 seconds.  Unless I am in HUGE hurry and want to know the EXACT time i can canni again.  I can also precast Torpor as well if I know it will be ready in 30 or less seconds.  Though yes your way works as well.  I find for myself it works much better using the V.  I use to have a Canni hotbutton on another hot bank but it was just too combersom when in the thick of battle to swap check, swap back to primary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That is a great idea, Chazic.  Thank you.  I'd never thought of doing that.<br />
<br />
It'll be great to not have to switch banks to hit the key to see how much time left and being able to check mid-cast will be even greater.</div></div><hr />
