<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wingelefoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">he's easy, a lvl 60 shammy can solo him. otherwise, have a tank, cleric, and slower. getting slow in is crucial. once its in, its cakewalk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zempten</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have  done this mob many times now. He has easy and can be taken down with a single group. All you need is a tank, slower, and healer ( preferably a cleric), and all the other slots should be filled by meeles ( a extra healer doesn't hurt). Once you got your group setup all you haveto be ready for is the long wait.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>TheRiov</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Doubles for 300, seems to have fairly high resists to fire and even higher to cold, not to magic. Summons. Runs just a hair slower than SOW. Warrior so it bashes and enrages. Doesn't cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Doon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Me and a couple friends done him 3 times the other week, we use ranger 60 paly 61 shaman 60, <br />
<br />
Have ranger kite him till shaman malo's and slows. Paly gains agro with stuns, ranger blows his trushot disc. Before my disc is down he is half way dead. Engage mellee and he is down. We do this without the shaman pet for some reason /shrug dont know why we do, i never asked :p.<br />
<br />
He is high MR so he must be tashed/malo then slowed. Once he is at this point he is a Orc_pawn_01.<br />
<br />
PS throw a snare in there when he is about 40PCT.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Actually some RL friends and I spent all of Christmas vacation campin Lodi...he spawns 2 times per day now, never skips and goes from 9-12 hrs, with the usual timer being 11 hrs....we were there for 11 of 12 spawns, engaging him all 11 times and being outright KSd 5 of the 11 times. In the 6 times we engaged and were not KSd or bothered in any way we did just fine with various combinations of classes, it was usually a level 60 shaman, level 56 paladin and a 57 Chanter, yes it was slow, yes it was lots of work, but we did it and did just fine- the 60 shaman can solo Lodi, and its a hella good fight; other times it was an additive of myself, another 55 Paladin, a 51 Druid, and a 58 Druidess. <br />
The best way to get Lodi is to log on ASAP when a server comes back up after a full patch and server shut down. Head to Lodi's spawn point just south of the ToFS on the 3rd iceberg island and watch it from a good distance....Lodi will spawn with an emote of something to do with him flapping his fins and will head out to the gnoll camps and then head east (?) down the coast...if not engaged he will despawn and respawn again in approx 10 min...if no engagement the second time he despawns and waits his full respawn time. <br />
Now comes the tricky part. You have Lodi's spawn time pegged now after the patch....approx 3-4 hrs before the next spawn you need to decide if you want to try to take him yourself (solo) or do you want to get lots of friends....my suggestion is get at least a few friends to help decrease the chance of KSing....the times we were KSd it was by the same warrior, wizard, shaman and druid combo with the warrior using a 2hs, triple attack and agressive disc...we were basically unable to keep up with manaburn, triple attacks in the 300s each and moonfires (duh like who can). The good news is that the warrior(and the shaman its a 2 boxer), wizard and druid all recieved warnings to their accounts /cheer and I am told that some of them actually lost points in the raid system from their guild /e pats himself on the back. <br />
Remember DPS is DPS with Lodi, use your pet, make the druid summon theirs, heck grab your 2 box 30th level monk to wack on it if you want, its necessary. Also I had never fought him before, but the 60 shaman that joined us reported that he seemed to be more resistant to slows/magic in general....we witnessed this fact after he Malo'd and attempted slow 7 times before it stuck and the 7th time only being after the chanter stopped chain runing the paladin and tashed. This was on the 6th kill and I dont remember the slows being that hard to stick the first times so it may just have been the RNG biting. <br />
Anyway, its a fun fight, you have the chance at some really nice drops (he always drops the map piece and at least one shell piece...we actually had him drop 2 shell pieces one time) and it will really bring a smile to your face. It was probably the most fun I have had in a long time in game(I took a 4 month Hiatus from the game due to RL problems, only to find when I returned that I was /guildremoved when I logged back in, sigh there goes my dreams of anything remotely epic related). <br />
Just to re-cap best advice I can give is DPS DPS DPS....torpor the tank at 80ish and he will stay at 80+ the entire fight and make sure you refresh slow on Lodi from time to time (heheh oops)...the bad thing about using Torpor is that it will do serious damage to your DPS, so bring pets, 2 box a wizzie, etc, whatever it takes to kill him fast to prevet or at least cut down the chance on a KS. <br />
<br />
Edit: Also Lodi spawns on the island, not under it; its not a hard island to pick out it has 3 hunters on it clubbing seals ; also I agree with the other posts above, announce to the zone and your local trade chat channel that your about to engage Lodi and make sure you have /log on to help with this....dont take any crap from the KSers out there, its total crap that people dont have anything better to do at level 65 than KS level 58 people for stuff they are gonna twink alts with...esp when the level 58 and lower are there for upgrades /rant off.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Archyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Lodi is not a forced spawn, has no placeholder, and there is no way to &quot;make&quot; him spawn. He spawns approx every 11hrs +/- an hour or so either way.<br />
You make him POP by waiting patiently :D</div></div><hr />
