<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Urssus da Greenbottom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This will be very long, sorry.<br />
<br />
Let's start out with this:  I'm 15 years old.  I'm working fairly hard to maintain good grades in school.  I've been playing this game since the release of Kunark, on and off.  Since then, and until about December-January I was playing a warrior on Povar, and I got him to level 47.  Then, right as I was deciding I was bored of EQ, I discovered some of my old RL friends had started up again on Drinal!  This was great, I could finally play with people I knew again.  Not wanting to spend 50 bucks on a server transfer, and fascinated by the thought of a new class, I created a troll shaman.  Over time I bought Luclin, PoP, and Ykesha, and I've been delighted by seeing a bunch of the new zones, leveling in new places, and the perks of being a shaman in general.  Yesterday I hit 39, and the new spells are really damn cool, even if they are expensive mana-wise.  I spent 15pp on a KEI, and went to Gunthak to hunt with a necro.  I gained 55% of my exp bar about 20 minutes before KEI faded.  <br />
<br />
All fine and dandy, yes?<br />
<br />
But now I'm thinking, January, February, March, April...it's now April 19th.  Keeping in mind I'm still 15, I spend 30 hours a week at school, probably 5-10 hours per week on homework, and about 50 hours sleeping.  Let's add 20 hours for commuting, eating, socializing, cleaning the house, picking up after dogs, etc, etc.  That gives me roughly 58 hours per week to play EQ.  However, I can't play for like 10 hours straight on the weekends just because my parents are Nazis about discouraging &quot;excessive&quot; amounts of gaming.<br />
<br />
Here's what I am wondering: are all the people who play EQ working adults who do nothing more than come from work and sit down at the computer?  I wold think that my situation is fairly common, but there are so many people with a ton of 65 or at least 60+ characters.  Or is that a lot of people are taking drugs to thwart their bodies' attempts to make them collapse from sleep deprivation?  Or could it be that all these people simply have been playing the game for a long-ass time?  I don't know.  I've heard nightmare stories about the rate at which it is possible to accumulate exp post 50, and I'm scared ****less.  Remember, my highest characer was only 47, I'm still a noob.  Given my &quot;busy,&quot; schedule, will it be possible for me to get to the upper levels, go on big raids, accumulate phat lewt, and become uber in general, without spending a billion hours over the next half a year?  I'm losing my conviction.  I love this game, but I don't want it to consume my life.  Someone tell me there is a way to reach high levels without sacrificing all my free time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ridik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can, I only play about 15 or 20hours a week, and am quite happy with my EQ experience.  Granted I've been playing since release, but I honestly think I'm having more fun now than I ever did.  Really, its just a matter of not wasting time.  Get on, get right into what you want to do (better to prethink this kinda stuff before you log on).  I have a high maitenence girlfriend, a full time job, and my own place to take care of, so EQ isnt the only thing in my life, just the thing I really enjoy.  As a shaman you have advantages over other classes with low playtime, YOU CAN SOLO.  So if you need xp, grab your buffs from nexus and head out, if you need loot, you are very desireable on raids, and in groups, the world is your oyster.  Getting a the right kind of guild is a big thing too.  You dont want a guild that gives you a ton of crap for not playing all the time, and not one that requires your presence everytime you are actually on.  That can be tricky to find, but once you do you'll be happier for it.  Remember, you are the one paying for this, so your needs are teh only ones you should really concern yourself with.  There is a happy-medium in this game, its just much harder to find than most, but its there I assure you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It can be done, just balance your life.  You can probably be in a 2nd tier guild easily with 25-30 hours a week of playtime (once you hit 65 of course)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Urssus da Greenbottom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks a lot guys, simple and practical advice, I like it.<br />
<br />
I'm generally not that depressed and morose, just was having a bad day and it set me to thinking along negative lines.   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">btw  need to group, you better at making exp solo up to 55.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>tannus vidar 2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The real key is just your play time lining up with guilds raid times. I can't play a whole lot, but major guild raids are only on certain days...I do have to plan arround these a bit,but it isn't too bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Remember, you are the one paying for this, so your needs are teh only ones you should really concern yourself with.<br />
<br />
If thats going to be your attitude please don't join a guild.  Unless its a guild that everyone thinks like this and isn't really looking to progress in the game, and you guys just want a friendly chat chanel.  If this is how you feel, be upfront with them before they accept you, and make sure they know that.<br />
<br />
Its very possible to level up, and if you stick with it you will eventually get there.  Remeber this game is going on 4 years old, some people have been playing 40+ hours a week for 4 years now, its a given that they will be high level.<br />
<br />
Many people make RL sacrafices to play eq, and many people work 8 to 5 and can log in from 6 to midnight 5 days a week for 6 hours a day.  You probably aren't in this situation, and at 15, its good that you aren't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Heh you think adults have the freedom to sit down at the computer after work and that's it?<br />
<br />
I have a lot more on my plate than you do, most likely - work, cooking dinner, planning cub scout meetings, putting kids to bed, going to band practice, playing gigs with band, booking gigs for band, taking kids to soccer, taking kids to piano, helping kids with homework, housecleaning, laundry, ... the list goes on.  All in all I get maybe 15 hours/week in game, and at that I feel like sometimes I'm neglecting my other responsibilities.<br />
<br />
I'm currently 62, been playing this character seriously since January 2001, and I'm sure I will hit 65 someday, but not a day soon.  I have decided to enjoy the journey and not focus on the fact that many of my friends outlevel me and are now 65 with 50+ AA's.<br />
<br />
If you're level 39 and you are having fun, don't sweat the time it'll take to get to 65.  Enjoy being 39, having new spells, using the pet, exploring new zones, pushing the limits of what you can do at that level.  The levels will come.  or they won't, who cares.<br />
<br />
When my wife and I started playing, I told her not to expect to get past level 25, because we just wouldn't have the time.  Now she's 61 and I'm 62.  So go figure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I guess I have less mental fortitude than these people - this game did consume all my free time. I would definitely consider myself a victim of &quot;evercrack addiction&quot;. I'm hoping that breaking away from it will come as easy as becoming addicted, because it has already started to effect my social life. Thankfully it hasn't effected my sports, but I'm sure it will work its way into those if I keep at it long enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Phinger Bang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Understand that to be truly huge, you really have to spend a buttload of time.  It took me quite a while to accept that.  So now I accept the fact there's a lot of things that I'll never see or get.  I set short term goals like: get pp for a spell or item, get aa exps, and set time aside for a raid once in a while.  I stick to that plan, and only that plan.  If I'm doing nothing, with nothing planned, for more then 10 minutes, it is time to log off.  I don't play nearly as much as I used to (wife and kids) but I make the time I'm on fun.  I've got a group of friends that play a lot more then me, but we work together very well.  If I can hook-up with them and get some quality play time, that great, if not, I've already got my plan set :)  Hope that helps a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Don't worry about rushing to 65 and becoming uber.  Just enjoy the game for what it is at your level as you progress, and make sure you spend enough time outside of EQ.  High school is about the most irresponsible time of your life, make sure you do some incredibly stupid **** that you can only get away with during that time.   :D   (Just don't get a disease doing it.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">There are very few things you can possibly get into that don't turn out to be a mistake at least somewhere along the line, even the best, most productive things.  Life is just difficult to manage sometimes, and so many things need so much attention; sooner or later some decision will be made that's a bad one or a poor utilization of your time.<br />
<br />
Just don't go nuts with it or about it.  If you obsess on your career you will probably have no life -- on sports, love, religion, whatever.  On EQ, for sure.<br />
<br />
But we all still want to reach our goals in some or all of those areas, and usually keep finding new goals.<br />
<br />
The trick is to let your goals become something that rewards you instead of kills you.  <br />
<br />
If you want to achieve in EQ without having your life go to hell, that's a perfectly reasonable goal, but it will require adapting to reality.  You simply won't be able to do all the things in EQ you want to do, all the time.  And some goals will either never be achievable or will take you much longer than you wish they would, or than it took your friends.  Some people might even pressure you or put you down if you are not the EQ god they think you should be.  Screw 'em -- it's your life, not theirs, and you have your own responsibilities they know nothing about.  Nor is it your obligation to explain any of it to them.<br />
<br />
Good luck finding the level of EQ that works for you.  Just like the level of school, career, etc.  Make your goals match the other needs you have in your life, and realistically relate to the level of time and energy and money you can and will put forth.  The real problems only come if your desires and goals get out of balance with each other.  All in all, EQ is fun, but a relatively minor goal in life.  Especially in high school.   You should be busy fretting over whether you'll get into a good college, or get laid, or somehow avoid getting arrested. ;)  There will be plenty of time to obsess about EQ later, if that's what you're into.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Branston Pickle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">took me 2 and a half years to get a char over 60, totaling about 100 days /played over various characters.. that's... 3 hours a day on average?<br />
<br />
like everyone i've had my 15 hour spells without rest.. but i have played very casually on the whole, and it's made that rise to power that extra bit satisfying<br />
<br />
 there are people out there who will level from 1 to 65 before i level from 61 to 62..  ...with all the new zones added in recent months, it's very easy to be a casual player - but get a lot of exping done.. and the items available today are great and cheap.. so yeah, you can get high level and get good items relatively quickly..<br />
<br />
 however<br />
<br />
my friend recently quit because he found it impossible to not get obsessed with the game, because he couldn't stop thinking about all the spells and items he wanted, and how he'd need to spend a couple hundred hours grinding the plat to get them all, this depressed him immensely.. when he wasn't playing eq, he was talking about it or thinking about it<br />
<br />
his thought pattern was like i need torpor i need malo i need to be 60 i need tae ew items i need 150k pp to do this i need to spend 80 hours in pog to get this i need my epic i need torpor i need malo i need to be 60 i need tae ew items i need 150k pp to do this i need to spend 80 hours in pog to get this i need my epic i need torpor i need malo i need to be 60 i need tae ew items i need 150k pp to do this i need to spend 80 hours in pog to get this i need my epic i need torpor i need malo i need to be 60 i need tae ew items i need 150k pp to do this i need to spend 80 hours in pog to get this i need my epic i am GOING INSANE<br />

you seem to have pretty high aims which is a good thing, but don't set your aims too high too fast, ignorance is fun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">As long as you remember it's a game/hobby, you're fine. When it dominates every aspect of your free time and becomes like work, it's bad. Sure, like all hobbies, there are times when things are tough and you're having less fun than you'd like. It's just like when you play a sport or practice a martial art. I love the martial arts, but there were plenty of practice sessions when I left feeling a bit frustrated. hehe And let's face it. I'm no Bruce Lee and never will be, but if I only practiced martial arts to be as good as he was, I'd have given up a long time ago. It's the same if you compare yourself to powergamers who play 40+ hours a week and have done so for the entire time EQ has been released. It would be terribly disheartening to do so, to me at least. Just find what you like about the game and build from there. If you find it's not that fun, then find a different game. Life's too short to waste on something you're not getting any fulfillment from.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought you were talking to ME when you said this... scared me almost. Here's a solution that worked for me so far, just did it a few days ago.  Get ready...<br />
<br />
Get a job with long hours.<br />
<br />
You'll be so wiped out that you'll just want to go home and sleep, and worry about school assignments. Being the uberg0th and antisocial bastard that I am, I before used Everquest as a temporary escape, not unlike alcohol or drugs, from my family that I loathe so very much.  When I got a job (Confectionary crap at a theatre, kicks ass), I was happy that I was working with friends from school (Don't get me wrong, I'm VERY VERY Gothic and antisocial, but people think I'm funny for voice talents and whatnot, I r teh witty c0medi@n, HAR!), AND not being pestered by 4 little runts that constantly leave a trail of slime and half eaten crackers behind them, because my mom decided to sleep and my sh1tty step-dad (#4, mind you =p) decided that we need trees in the backyard moreso than a legally fit home for kids.<br />
<br />
Enough hijacking, I played the pity-party enough, must be because I'm so gothic  :p .<br />
<br />
POINT:  It depends on your life, for me, EQ = talking to a few friends/being pestered to level/fun time PWNing old dungeons (Kurns, for example), get AA's, and ph@t l3wtz0r, and a Job = job experience, MohNAY($), uninterruptable escape from pressures of home, and free movies/Slurpee's/popcorn for when I go on break  :D.<br />
<br />
If you like a form of entertainment and escape from RL right in your computer for easy access, I'd say stick with EQ, once you get a car and are more independant, stick with a good job/college and squeeze in some EQ here and there.  Just my opinion.<br />
<br />
BTW... I was joking about the Gothic thing, I was in the mindset all through my sophmore year, but I couldn't afford the clothes with the hooks and chains on em, nor the hair gel or facial make-up.  I guess it takes a lot of effort, time, and caring to look like you don't care about anything, HAR!  :D<br />
<br />
Now I just act like a jackass and get people to laugh at or with me, it's all good, slip on a mask...  I'm now the GOD of my American Lit class from my voice talents... makes me feel all warm and ubah inside  ;) <br />
<br />
Oh, by the way, another good thing about EQ, there's a LOT of your kind of people in there, virtual anonymous escape and alternate lives seem to be popular amoung the variously abused and socially inadequate, not to say that all are like that of course, just saying that there's a lot of people you can talk to that had similar problems.<br />
<br />
Whew... long post...  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Waredan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I personally think you should be happy that you cant play that much. There has to be a balance. I got into the mindset that I HAD to hit 60+ a long time ago, and it almost cost me a divorce. Now I'm 61, ghetto, and lovin it, knowing that I dont HAVE to play 12+ hours a day.<br />
<br />
Advice: Enjoy being 39. Hone ur skills, keep reading these boards, and try to balance ur time wisely. I'd also advise reading the hunting grounds forums as much as possible, you might level a little faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Fethanin_ECI</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">My best advice, get a girlfriend (I assume your male), don't waste anymore time on EQ.<br />

easier said than done :P especially if you want a nice one lol<br />
<br />
anyway back to the thread. I, like you are 15, and I am afraid that I got completely &quot;addicted&quot; I used to get up on weekends, forget about friends and homework... and play EQ through the whole weekend... at least 16 hr days.<br />
<br />
Then I got to 60... and calmed down, as I have &quot;reached my goal&quot;. I was still playing way too much, and I have exams coming up, so I have quit the account... but even this hasnt worked, I guess im just lazy... I havent been able to revise at all, I find it impossible... I just browse the net or go out with friends every day, and Im still thinking about EQ, and cant wait until after my exams to get back to it :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Given my &quot;busy,&quot; schedule, will it be possible for me to get to the upper levels, go on big raids, accumulate phat lewt, and become uber in general, without spending a billion hours over the next half a year?

<br />
No, I don't think you can.  Sure, you can play casually, but if you first (1) want to level, (2) level and get AA and (3) play enough to get into a guild that does high end raiding, you have to play a lot of hours at some point.  <br />
<br />
A lot of hours.  <br />
<br />
Some people may have played a lot of hours in the past and now just log into their uber raiding guild whenever, but that's unusual since those guilds like to know who's showing up - and you still have to play a ton of hours to get to that point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I'm 14 (going 15 soon) and iv'e being playing i *think* just after velious came out in may. I've quit the game 4 times in total rerolling each timw when i came but not last time (my shaman was 26, quit came back but carried him on). I think i play about 4 hours on my PC every night at least after school which is not good (not as bad as my friend, him and his dad are PC freaks, plays like from morning to night non stop).<br />
<br />
For me it's more like routine that i can't break out of unless i take a big long break (had a holiday to australia for 3 weeks, cameback home and couldn't sit still for weeks, HAD to do something.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">How much do your friends play?  Do they plan on joining an uberguild?  When you get s'more levels under your belt, will you be content with doing &quot;easier&quot; raids like ToV, Kunark dragons, and tier 2?<br />
<br />
I've been playing the same character almost exclusively since June 1999 and I'm 61 with 1 AA (runspeed 1 woot!).  I've spent a whole lotta time on other things that don't matter to most people (maxxed skills, superb factions, a TON of random information), but I've thoroughly enjoyed reaching those goals for myself.  My guild only asks that I behave nicely and help out when I can.  We do some of the easier dragons and tier 2 in PoP and are working on moving up, but it'll take time yet.  Am I ubah?  Nah, not really.  Do I have fun?  Heck yea.  I've got really nice gear by my standards, the chance to hang out with my friends and try new stuff, and some fun toys to boot.<br />
<br />
You're already levelling a lot faster than I do, so those sorts of raids should be open to you before long.  If you think you could enjoy that without feeling inadequate compared to the powerplayers, then I'd say you'll be fine.  But I would definitely talk to your friends.  It's not at all a good feeling when your friends are always stuck on raids that you can't attend, in zones you'll never see.  Pretty soon they're talking about how crappy their armor is (when it makes yours look like tinfoil), how easy their latest tier 3 raid was, and discussing tactics for events you can't even imagine.  Be prepared for that if they go uberguild and you don't.  <br />
<br />
A side note: If you've been playing more or less regularly since the Kunark era, you're not a newb, no matter what your level.  You know how the game works and what you're doing in it, probably better than some people in the elemental planes right now.  Just because you haven't experienced the high levels doesn't mean you don't know what you're doing.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">once  you get old and move out you can do anything you want, it is a nice double edged sword, because with that ability to do anything you want comes the responsibility to do things you need.<br />
<br />
while gaming is fun, for most of us it doesn't pay the bills, or offer real life interaction that we need.<br />
<br />
don't miss out on the friends you make now, some will not stick around, but for every 10 friends you have one will be around in 10 years or so, are you going to be playing EQ in 10 years? no telling, but that friend will still be there for you.<br />
<br />
don't know if this was the point of your post or not, but keep it in mind when you are balancing EQ vs other things.<br />
<br />
BTW, I play the game more than I would like to, but when you are saving for a new car, cheap entertainment &gt; expensive entertainment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">EQ accomdates all. The trick to EQ-RL happiness and balance is ...<br />
<br />
---&gt; SET GOALS YOU CAN ACHIEVE &lt;---<br />
<br />
Simple. If you play 10 hours a week don't covet elemental armor and officership in FoH. Players in top level raiding guilds devote scads of time to their hobby/recreation/fetish, whatever you term it. If you don't spend that kind of time, don't get envious of Mudcrush's magelo. Too often I found people are unhappy in EQ when they covet what they cannot get.<br />
<br />
As far as can you enjoy EQ part-time? Yes. I've been playing EQ for four years this month, every day of it partime (10-11pm CST until 3+ am, 6-7 days a week). My gear is OK. My current guild is less than 6 months old but we're already in VT and top 5 on Fennin (definitive no. 3 soon :p). And I'm able to contribute when I play. <br />
<br />
But, I only play after my kid is in bed. Period. I'm 32, married and have a 50+ hour a week job, and EQ comes after family and work, always. I miss alot of sleep, but I live :)<br />

EQ is very goal oriented, and it's easy to get sucked into a constant game of &quot;I need this&quot; etc. But, if you can't spend the time necessary (because really that's all EQ takes, time, not skill etc), then don't expect to win EQ.</div></div><hr />

I'm VERY lucky if I have 10 hours a week for EQ, but I've still managed to get a rogue to lvl61 and a shaman up to lvl48, join raids and have fun.<br />
<br />
Just enjoy what time you have, and if you out-grow it, don't look back.<br />
<br />
You SHOULD be more worried about dating, trying to get into an R movie, how to convince your parents to get you a beater car when you turn 16 and how to cover up a hickey.</div></div><hr />

My best advice, get a girlfriend (I assume your male), don't waste anymore time on EQ.<br />
<br />
These people speak the truth.  You have WAY more important things to do right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Medican</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I'm a 16 year old kid. I got my school work killing me with all my AP and Honors classes to study for ( not bragging). I play eq and I have a RL. Nothing wrong with it in my view. My grades aren't dropping. My gear isn't ubah. But I enjoy every moment of my life. I have RL activities like going to the arcades, movies,lunch with friends, and the like. I got my studies to keep up with, and I'm meeting TONS of new people in EQ that are great people. People around the world. SOme from Asia, Canada, Hawaii........etc. It's a very cool feeling and I don't want any of this change. So my advice is just to balance out your life. Set standards and stay on goals that you set. <br />
<br />
I have only played a year now and I have a few good characters under my belt</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I've been in quite a few guilds with members who were kids who had tons of after school activity, sports and such.  They tended to do alot better than the pot and beer (mainly pot/acid/shrooms since its easier to get in school than beer is for an under-ager) after school crowd.  Who'd of thunk it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I simply do not let myself schedule EQ time. EQ takes a back seat to anything else. I used to play as much as possible per day, and it just got to be a hassle and felt like work. Work all day, and come home and work some more. The approach i am taking now, where i just play when i get some free time, works great. Fortunately, i have friends that play all sorts of hours, so it works out well for me. The advice everyone has given here is quite sound. I think most people agree that life is far more important. At 15, its *very* easy to take it for granted. Then when you are older, you look back and regret the things you could have done but didn't. Best of luck finding an approach that works for you. It can be difficult juggling everything, but as long as priorities are straight, then you never have to worry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">no!!! DO not let any of this reassure you in any way. This thread is a showcase of what this game does to you. Everyone who has posted here is in denial... they all know deep down inside that they are consumed by this game, it eats up every second of their free time. Yet they come here and make these 'reassuring' posts to fool themselves into thinking they are not obcessed. Get out while you can!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Morrighan Dreamwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I work 72 hours a week (6, 12 hour shifts), but I still play a little, though not much in past couple weeks. And, I still date on my night off. <br />
<br />
This game can be a casual one if you want it to. Just don't expect to do the things, and have the gear of those that do play 40 or 50+ hours a week. Be content with what you have the time for, but do not play so much that you don't have a social life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Invoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I read something a while back that changed the way I considered EQ, or any other game/hobby for that matter.<br />
<br />
This will always be here.<br />
<br />
The time that you have when you're young will pass very quickly. All the experiences that you can have now will not always be available to you later.  If you're put in a situation where you must decide between doing one thing or playing EQ, just keep in mind that there will always be an MMORPG waiting to entertain you.<br />
<br />
In the end, neither levels nor loot really matter.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">What Durdend and Amnon said is true, I'm a greying adult now, I mucked about with a computer pre teen years, until around 14/15 when I discovered booze, drugs, sex, travelling, extended groups of friends, had a whale of a time right up until the age of 30 when people expect you to start acting your age. Bought another comp, got married have a kid and another on the way, stopped boozing, stopped the drugs still enjoying the sex though :0<br />
<br />
If EQ had been around when I was 15 I shudder at the thought of the fantastic memories I would not have right now.<br />
<br />
Get out there, live life, achieve your goals and if you find yourself stuck at home on a rainy day, and non of your mates a re avialable, your GF is ill or out of town, and you have nothing better to do, log on to EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I agree with Barbacus.  If you have nothing better to do, log onto EQ and try to meet someone, play with someone, or do something with someone that is fun.  I made a rule with myself about EQ a long time ago.  If it wasn't fun, and I couldn't make it fun, I would leave or log.  And I've stuck to that.  Which means that even with my uberguild status I haven't got 400 AAs or 7khps or anything uber like that, but I do aight and I'm happy with the character I created.  <br />
<br />
And remember this, cuz this part is important.  The reason I spent so much time with this game is because I had VERY little else to do for the last three years and something had to fill the gap.  EQ did nicely and oddly enough I am grateful to the game for that.  But now I've moved back to civilization, got a really cute girlfriend (second day back, go me!), and am too busy with other things to log much time in this game anymore.  It's for the better I'm sure.  Life will pass you right by if you let it. <br />
<br />
Get busy living, or get busy dying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Mmmm, civilization.<br />
<br />
I'm in Alaska. If I have to choose between EQ and Helga of the Sasquatch, I think I'll go with EQ.<br />
<br />
The rest of you, though... Yeah, focus your real life, EQ is an afterthought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">And take it from someone who's been there -- the uber-thing just ain't that exciting.  I got into the biggest guild on our server by far just after the Velious expansion and kept at it for about 8 months, but I learned a few things:<br />
<br />
- While killing the baddest mother out there is cool the first time, by the eighth, it's just as dull as anything else, if not more so, because raids intrinsically waste more time.<br />
<br />
- No matter what is said, or even believed by a lot of the people, guilds of this nature will inevitably contain players so rabid that they not only need to be on and raiding whenever they can, but they will pressure you about it too.<br />
<br />
The combination of the two, plus just persistent clueless VIness drove me off for a year and a half or so.  I came back, rejoined my very casual guild, and I'm happy.  You're not really missing anything.<br />
<br />
If you think you are, when you get to 60+ (and you will, given enough time) make a couple friends in the uber of your choice and ask to tag along a couple times.  The excitement you'll get from the first few is as good as it's going to get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>NipperRipper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I suggest you drop out of school immediately and play EQ full-time. If for some reason in the future you need a high school diploma then theres always the GED thing you can do. Let's face it, EQ is more fun than 99% of the things people do in real life, such as have sex, play sports, and get drunk. Get your priorities straight! EQ all the way baby!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Slaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Listen to the advice given here, most of it is very good and very true.<br />
<br />
When I first started playing EQ around the Kunark release time I had 2 main goals, get a character to 60 and get a character his epic. Naturally I raced to do both and didn't have a whole lot of fun while doing it, because you're always looking at that next piece of armor you want or what spells you get at the next level. Thanks to my friends I made when I was very low level, pre-10. I got my epic at lvl 56. I made 60 and got a copy of torpor (for FREE) from a friend of a friend.<br />
<br />
Now that I'm post 60, I'm enjoying the game and RL alot more. I don't play near as much as I used to, and I'm quite happy with my non-uber armor (I have 950ish AC and barely over 2k hp unbuffed) and casual-raid guild (we pick a target and raid once a week).<br />
<br />
Experience life, make RL friends, I've even made a few in game that I've met in RL. Just remember, if it ceases to be fun, it's no longer a game, and you should not play it.</div></div><hr />
