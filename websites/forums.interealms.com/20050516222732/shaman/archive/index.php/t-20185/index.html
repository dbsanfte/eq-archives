<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TPFKAFaern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My Enchanter finally got the last piece required for the Epic.  Went to The Hole, got by the LOCKED DOOR and got the bag from Polzin.  Well of course it doesn't combine. (1337 monkey coders screw up Epic with GoD Expansion.)<br />
<br />
So I petition to have a GM combine for me. (Which they can do).  A very nice guide comes on. He tells me <br />
<br />
 They are aware of this, they are working on it, but there is no ETA on the fix. <br />
<br />
Cool I reply, but can a GM combine this for me? I have all the items right here at the NPC.<br />
<br />
And here ladies and gentlemen is the kicker:<br />
<br />
  Sony sent out a message saying we are to no longer escalate these problems to GM's for resolution <br />
<br />
IOW - THEY COULD do it, but they WON'T.<br />
<br />
I'm not talking about a food stuff - I'm talking an EPIC.<br />
<br />
W.O.W.  Simply W.O.W.<br />
<br />
When people leave EQ in droves it won't be the better mousetrap - it will be the combination of a better mousetrap and better CS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>DemonMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The problem is you have no ability to gain skill with the container you combine the epic in, and therefore are locked from combining. This was to prevent people besides gnome tinkering, or non rogues from making poisons. They are trying to find a work around that allows you to properly do all the quest combines, but still not allow those who shouldn't, the ability to tinker/make poison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think his point was more on &quot;Oh, we're not supposed to get the GM's to help you&quot;.<br />
<br />
My suggestion is file a complaint through EMail with hte Guide's name and quote, asking if it's true or if he's full of crap, and restating your request for a combine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ranguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">AFAIK you could always make items if you couldn't gain skill in the &quot;field&quot; Look at Celestial Essence...it uses Poisonmaking, but is a no fail combine and you CAN make it, but you can't use the new UI (which REALLY sucks) I think that by using the Experiment button, you can still attempt to make things in any container, but only containers that are not &quot;standard&quot; IE quest containers, are broken. One thing I noticed and think is relevant, is that if there is no UI implementation for a container, it won't work. Remember, quest combines with special containers don't work, but ones that use the standard containers do. Aid Grimel quest uses your standard tradeskill containers and can still be done, but the Coldain 9th Ring can't be done as it's a special combine that destroys the container upon completion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That's odd. I did that fine antique ring quest the other day for a newbie I just made, and it uses a container that combines into an object you turn in. It worked just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I can't recharge the fd ring from sky either atm :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Remember, quest combines with special containers don't work, but ones that use the standard containers do. <br />
<br />
Some work, some don't, there does not seem to be a pattern. VT key works for example, all stages. And yes, everyone can do Poisonmaking and Tinkering, no matter what class or race, but if you are not of the correct race/class you can not gain skills.<br />
<br />
According to a post somewhere on eqtraders.com a fix is on the way. It really would be nice if until then GMs would help with the combines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brenlo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hello there,<br />
<br />
Sorry to hear about the trouble you had.  I am not sure why you were not assisted, and I will ask around.  <br />
<br />
As an aside, this issue should be fixed on test and patched live on the 10th.  So at the very least you will be able to finish the quest then.<br />
<br />
Brenlo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks Brenlo, looking forward to the 10th now. ;)<br />
<br />
I found out about this bug after collecting about 15 pieces for the cudgel quest and went to do the first combine with the Iksar skulls only to see it not work. :(<br />
<br />
And my bank is a cluster***k of crap. At least it's motivated me to clean up some room in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>TPFKAFaern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Figured I'd give people an update on this.<br />
<br />
After I read this:<br />

 Hello there,<br />
<br />
Sorry to hear about the trouble you had. I am not sure why you were not assisted, and I will ask around. <br />
<br />
I figured that GM's were able or would be able to do the combine.<br />
<br />
Alas I was wrong. Oh well, fool me once shame on you...yadda..yadda.<br />
<br />
GM comes on and basically tells me they are INCAPABLE of combining items.  In his words:<br />
<br />
&quot;If you can't how do you expect us to?&quot;<br />
<br />
Now, getting told 3 different things by 3 different representatives of Sony doesn't bother me. Hell, I'm just $12.95 a month and not in an uber-guild so I'm under no illusions they give less than 2 sh!ts about me.<br />
<br />
However, the GM's (Wismon) next words were rather chilling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do not combine in game until we tell you to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Considering that atm, hitting combine does NOTHING, this led me to the conclusion, that upon patching a &quot;fix&quot; that said items (remember we're talking an Epic) could be EATEN.<br />
<br />
Forewarned is forearmed.  Caveat Emptor.  W.O.W.</div></div><hr />
