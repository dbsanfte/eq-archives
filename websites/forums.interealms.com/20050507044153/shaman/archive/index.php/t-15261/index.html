<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I figured that when I'm not doing much else, I might as well add a few dps by whcking at mobs. I did this for a bit, and some of the hits I got with Aleje's Ceremonial Cudgel (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=28813) seemed nice enough. Good I thought. I'm contributing without jugling my spell gems. Then I took a look at my parses. To my horror I did pitiful dps. This was some time back, but I recall the dps was around 10 - 12 or so. This was in pit in Tactics I think. Granted my 1HB is still lacking a few points. I figured that the weapon seemed good (I know next to nothing about weapons) and I'm lvl 65. Shouldn't I do better dps than the JBB? Or am I stuck forever with using that if I want to add any kind of dps not based on my spells?<br />

Hmm..<br />
<br />
Well..the JBB , if chain casted, is about 32ish DPS (283dd/8sec cast).  Unfortunalty I dont think any shaman is going to hit that mark for melee barring an unforseen upgrade to our melee skill.  <br />
<br />
However I dont think it really matters what your overall damage output is.  If you have done what you are in the group to do (debuff. slow, buff, heal) then anything else that you do is entirely up to you.  I regularly wade into the fray to melee a bit.  I'm getting my 1hb and 2hb up to more respectable levels (maxxed out piercing at like level 48 or so). Yes, my overall damamge really sucks beans and my melee really doesnt contribute that much to the killing of the beastie (but my dots and slows do) but I have a good time doing it.  And as long as I have the fiends back (or if there is a rogue then some of the back) then I can hit  relatively consistantly, albiet not for very much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The problem isn't your weapon, it's our melee abilities.  Using a 200 1hb skill to hit mobs that are level 62+, you spend at least 3/4 of your time missing, or getting parried/riposted/dodged if in the front.  In general your attack is probably pretty low too (even if you bother to FA yourself), figure most good melee have at least 1500+ (with FA)... I know I rarely break 1000.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've broken to 1050 or so - 255 strength, max offense and max peircing, with ranger buffs and Bih'Li I notice nothing improved over my normal 975-ish. <br />

Much like clerics, the only way melee is good DPS for us is with a nice proccing weapon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The only time ive been able to keep up with JBB damage melee was with avatar, speed of vallon, ranger atk buffs, a bard, and a bone of bertoxx.

Looked at that way, yeah, it sorta makes sense.  <br />
<br />
But look at it from my perspective:<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm 9 feet tall.<br />
<br />
I weigh 650 pounds.<br />
<br />
I have a hammer that looks to weigh a good 300 pounds all by itself.<br />
<br />
In a pinch, I can turn into a bear.  A BIG bear.<br />
<br />
Fully self buffed, I can do roughly 2/3rds as much physical damage as a 118 pound guy in green tights, who's weilding 2 knives the size of my little finger, and who is, for the love of god, SINGING while he fights.<br />
<br />
Whats wrong with this picture?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Ya know what?  Clerics are not a melee class either.  They were never designed to be a melee class.  AND YET....they got a melee upgrade and a summon that gets them a hammer that procs like MAD.  Now any cleric will tell you that about 70% of the damage they do comes from procs, but clerics STILL out-melee most shaman (that I know anyway).<br />
<br />
There is a cleric that I get together with pretty regularly to duo. After I slow he tanks and I stand behind and use my spear.  He is using his summoned hammer; Im using my REIF.  I dont keep the logs, but he does and he tells me that he still does about 50% more damage than I do.  Ive got the mobs BACK and am hasted to 77% (celerity +27 haste belt) so my REIF is effectively 12/10.7; hes got the front and using his 14/18 hammer of damnation with 50% haste, so his hammer is 14/10.1.  Im maxxed piercing at 200, hes maxed 1hb at 175 (I think thats it; I cant remember cleric caps and CR is down).<br />
<br />
I see a problem with that.  EQ literature calls shaman 'warrior priests'.  I would really like to see a melee upgrade for shaman.  Give us the ability to summon a spear or club that is on par with the cleric gear and boost out melee the same percentage that clerics were.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I dunno what the bard in question was using, but I was using the Pile Driver (1hb, 30/36, 75 dd/stun/knockback proc) with 36% haste item and my own haste, and about 1250 atk, including avatar.  The only thing that prevented my melee from being completely laughable is the fact that the hammer procs like crazy.  <br />
<br />
He was doing approx. 1100 per mob, I was doing approx 700, on PoV mobs, if memory serves.  :(<br />
<br />
Oh well, at least I can still hold aggro. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And I'm not gonna wear tights.  It's bad enough how much skin I show with Luclin chain graphics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even better, one with the priest-only 41% haste bracer from Earth.<br />
<br />
The proc rate on that hammer is just silly, really. Every other swing would be a BAD proc rate. Plus of course, you don't need to hit for the proc to go off, so the cleric is basically just as effective with 0 1HB skill as they are maxxed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Back when I used an REIF I did some actual parses and found that in PRACTICAL terms I was coming close to JBB damage.  i.e. when I took resists and interruptions into account, REIF was almost a wash with JBB.<br />
<br />
However, if the zone is outdoors, I can be MEDDING on my horse while JBBing and I can't do that with the REIF.  This makes JBB the winner hands down in my book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You can't med on horseback while meleeing, you can't melee effectively and cann, you can do more damage casting DoTs or DDing than you can swinging a weapon and canning the mana back with a torpor, oh ... and torpor cuts your attack speed down noticably (for those of us without Q).  I sometimes melee in low stress groups with cheesy blue con mobs, but against anything substantial, I'm DoTing and nuking (with my laughable nukes).  That said, a good proccing weap, a haste item and a SWTW and you're doing OK melee, certainly out doing the chanter that for some reason wants to maxx his weapon skills.<br />
<br />
Personally, the only melee skill I have yet to max is 1hb even with my cudgel (skill is like 186).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zzang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Why would you want to melee in first place?<br />
I understand that any extra damage is always better than no damage and that is the fact.<br />
However, as a shaman, we do a lot of damage already.<br />
Some people might not see it since it is indirect DPS, but non-the-less it is from our abilities.<br />
We can haste melee classes upto 60%, able to give as much as 300+ attack bonus, and max out DEX which helps weapon to proc.<br />
Also our resistance debuffs greatly helps nuker classes for maximum possible damage.<br />
<br />
In many situations, I was the only haster,slower and debuffer, and my indirect DPS was enormous.<br />

BUT a lot of times I don't have enough spell gems to mem a DD or a DoT. In my normal group a DoT would make me MT anyways and that is also a waste of mana.<br />

If I really want to pump out some DPS.. I could use rain nuke like Tears of Saryn(650DPS, 1300DPS with critical) and Velium Strike combination while mob is dotted to death.<br />
The point is.. there is no need for us to get close to mob and try to melee it while you can just med,canni and nuke away.<br />

Dunno about a bracer, but check out the Shield of Holy Vigor from the Arch Lich in Ssra (it's in my Magelo).  41% priest-only haste item.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Zzang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Okay, point taken.<br />
Indeed this thread is about the melee vs. JBB.<br />
However, most pros and cons are already talked about and has been discussed.<br />
There is no point repeating what they have said already.<br />
I am simply trying to show you a superior method of DPS.<br />
Because focus of the intrest was/is/will be DPS.<br />
Either it is done from melee,JBB,dot, or nuke.. DPS is DPS.<br />
And how many % of shamans do you thinks owns JBB or weapon of yours anyway?<br />
<br />
Let's be serious here and have a game face on.<br />
What is the point of discussing melee for shammies when it is a inferior method?<br />
Do you really plan to use melee method?<br />
If so, do your future group a favor and melee only when you are soloing.<br />
They will really appreciate that if you could.<br />
A favorite Shaman in the group is the one who never runs out of the mana, who can slow in time, do his/her full duty without much aggro, and buff them before even asked.<br />
You already have plenty multi roles in the group.<br />
There is no time for meleeing.<br />
Not to mention your melee DPS is only a quater of the true melee DPS.<br />
Canni, canni, canni, buff, buff, buff, debuff, debuff, debuff, nuke, nuke, nuke.<br />
Period.<br />
<br />
PS<br />
yes I valued poison rain nuke DPS too highly. It is more like 100+ DPS and still superior to your melee DPS.</div></div><hr />

i believe you have that gear, but it is kinda funny Kylt, because when i look at your magelo profile your primary item is the Staff of Lost Rituals.<br />

2, JBB can be resisted if mob is highly CR, where melee will do more damage than JBB<br />
3, REIF? that is so old school, use a 2hb with low delay or even that ugly lifetap mace drop in LoY has better ratio. If you have Potime access, Hammer of the Hour will get you want to melee more often than sit back nuking.<br />
<br />
Anyways...JBB has its use, I have guild first and second PoTime Saryrn kill shot, by JBB!<br />
while your mana is drained and add overwhelming your raid, epic + JBB &gt; our unreliable melee dps.<br />

In conclusion i'd say its depend on situation, neither melee or jbb(nuking) is useless, just use them accordingly.</div></div><hr />

With that weapon, I got my 2HB skill up to 200 and routinely melee with it in PoV and BoT.  I consistenly hit for between 100 and 200 dmg with it which I was pleasantly suprised with.  I have about 1180 atk self buffed inc avatar, 1200 ac and approx 5000 hps.  I do get riposte and parries but im still happy with the DPS im getting with my 2HB.  My epic, on the other hand, sucks for DPS even tho my 1HB is 180+.  I am 65 and find that my JBB (yes, I still have it) has grown to be of limited utility to me.<br />
<br />
Anyway, that's my 2cp's.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Personally, this is why I think the Soulstripper is SO underrated.  Yeah, its DPS sucks but it's all about the proc for me.  If I'm soloing in Nadox, for example, I slow, drop BoN and EB on the mob I'm gonna be tanking whether I like it or not.  This thing is going to proc about 3 times a fight for me which means 225 damage (blah) and 225 healing ( :) ).  A free 225 heal every fight is pretty nice for us canni-ers.  I've looked at some of the other weapons I drool over like the Piledriver or copper hammer from Droga, but they just aren't as useful as that lifetap proc to me.</div></div><hr />
