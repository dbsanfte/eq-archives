<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">quick question and I dont know if it had been addressed.<br />
<br />
If you're on a mount and a mob is attacking you. does that slight movement negate the meditation effects? or is it if &quot;you&quot; move?<br />
<br />
so like if a mob is summoning you and you have to tank ( like so many of us love to do  :) ) is is better to just sit there like a log and take the hits or to just turn on auto because you arent really meditating? and yes I know you can canni and take hits but when you need to chain cast stoicism to stay alive canni doesnt really fit in hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Being hit doesn't seem to reduce the meditation benefits of a horse.  <br />
<br />
I frequently slow, sic Scooby and then tank for my puppy while blasting with my JBB.  At the end of the fight I usually have regained the mana from the slow unless the fight was a very short one.<br />
<br />
As long as you don't move or attack you get sitting mana regen rates.  I haven't tested if turning in place has any effect but it doesn't seem to.  Need more data to prove it though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>sorsisis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i just is there and take the blows, if the mob is slowed, and i have regen on, i can regen more than they can hit while medding on the horse. however if you have a good tank you really shouldnt be getting aggro =)</div></div><hr />
