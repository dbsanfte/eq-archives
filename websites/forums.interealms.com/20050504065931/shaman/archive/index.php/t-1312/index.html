<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heya everyone.<br />
<br />
Ive been looking to see what mob drops this fine piercer, but all ive found out so far is that it drops in kael.  Im not quite of that level yet, but ill be up there eventually)  anyway...<br />
<br />
What mobs have you seen drop this weapon? what is an appropriate number of people and what levels should they be to attempt getting this.  How rare of a drop is it? <br />
<br />
Ive also never been to kael, so is it hard to get to the mob that drops it?<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Got mine from Oracle Bloodstorm... cant remember exactly where he spawned was near the Throne camp i think.... not sure.  We had 2 groups of 50+ and took him down easy.  In terms of rarity i have no idea... i wasnt camping for it when I got one it just poped while working on faction.  Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It drops from oracles in the manor of kael.  its very easy to get to.  Go in from EW side and go up and to the left when you get to the pool.  It's the building up there.  We killed him with a group of low-mid 50's.  He didn't drop it for me, though :(  I just bought it in gfay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Since I got the JBB, I've seriously started thinking of selling it.<br />
<br />
The bracer does more damage per second, and the Howling Harpoon's stun proc seems more useful for group or caster situations.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i think the dmg per second capable w/ this baby even without the proc is amazing.  The HH isnt nearly as good for going toe to toe melee, which is bound to happen everynow and then.  While stun is great, this weapon will do more damage no matter what.<br />
HH is 13/32? or 35? something like that.  the fang is 12/19, 1 less damage for over 10 less delay.  The ratio is a huge improvement.  Even w/ the stun, youll deal enough dmg persecond to make up for whatever you lose w/out stun.  plus an 80pt dd is always nice :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No doubt that the REIF has a better ratio (12/19 vs 13/35), but my problem is that the higher I get, the more I miss.  Up through the 30's, I was doing great damage with melee.  Once I hit 40, things went downhill rapidly.  Now it's embarassing when I decide to whip out the REIF even on a &quot;one pixel of life left&quot; giant.  Whiff!  Whiff!  Whiff!  Whiff!  19 damage!  Whiff!  4 damage!  Whiff!  Whiff!  <br />
<br />
Offense and piercing are maxed, too.<br />
<br />
Same thing when I'm grouped... I put out so little damage that it's embarassing.  At least I know the stun proc is good for something (stunning casters, halting damage output for a few seconds.)<br />
<br />
I've even considered going the &quot;dolly shaman&quot; route (paw in primary for the AC and WIS) - bleh !!!!<br />
<br />
I was so excited when I got the REIF... I think I got spoiled on it because I got it at a lower level than I should have.  Now reality is setting in, and I'm afraid there is no way I'm ever going to do enough damage with it to matter... and certainly not as much as I could do with a JBB blast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yeah, but its not like youd do any more damage w/ HH =\.<br />
<br />
<br />
Your 49, your epic will come soon ;D<br />
<br />
anyway, REIF will do more damage then the HH, and the proc helps that, while stun does no damage.<br />
<br />
and no dolly shammy plz)</div></div><hr />
