<br />
No this isn't another threat to leave by someone who is hoping to get enough attention to warrent staying after all.  I'm off travelling, and this is really just to say goodbye to the few people I know in the crucible chat (especially that Villan Etric).  As well as the shammy community at large.<br />
<br />
I'll probably be able to drop in now and again from different parts of the world and say hello.  Otherwise they'll be 20 new expansions and I won't have a clue how to play them by the time I get back.<br />
<br />
May your slows never be resisted or mitigated!  See you in a year.<br />

PS - If anyone has a spare room or a sofa to sleep on and you live in India, Nepal, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, USA or Canada.  I can tidy your house, or do the washing, or power level your alt in return or something.  :D</div></div><hr />
