It seems like there's a lot of guitar players in the Glade.  I was wondering if I could get some advice and help about guitar playing.  I've played for a couple months on and off.  I only know a few chords and songs, but I was wondering where do I go next?  I'm just teaching myself and I'm just a bit lost now, hehe.  I was just wondering how everyone acquired their guitar skills.  Classes, self taught, playing along with songs?  Thanks for any input.  :)<br />

Do this for a month or so. Then proceed with professional lessons, but ask around town for who to take lessons from. A poor instructor will kill your interest for your interest. A good teacher needs to inspire his student to be a better player.<br />
<br />
Also, with your lessons, don't be afraid to stop for a while and wait to absorb what you've learned. My 2nd teacher inundated me with information and I felt so overwhelmed. Had I taken the time to practice what I had learned and apply it all before continuing, it wouldn't have made me drop out the first time.<br />
<br />
You don't need lessons to be a good or a great player. But I think you'll reach your goal faster if you take them. With lessons you are using knowledge thats already tried and true instead of trying to discover everything on your own. It also gives you different view points on attack and approach as well as rounds you out as a player.<br />
<br />
Also realize that there are certain things in practice that won't always be fun, but stick it out. Unless you're one of those born with naturally great rhythm, you should play with a metrognome, which is never fun. But just after a few short months you'll notice a dramatic impact on your playing and punctuality. So will others. You have to learn a lot of basics before you can start jamming with people and have it be a constantly enjoyable event.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beryllin</div><div class="date">04-14-2002, 07:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) Take lessons. Can't be stressed enough. Ask around, see who's thought highly of. Remember, if you ask the music store, most likely they'll recommend their own teacher, no matter how good (or bad) he/she is.<br />
<br />
2) Practice, practice, practice. Needs stressing even more. Whatever you do, practice EVERY day, whatever time you can. Practice with a purpose. Force yourself to practice stuff that isn't as much fun. Practice anything and everything that you struggle with. <br />
<br />
My style of play is in line with 70's rock/blues. Clapton, Page, Hendrix, and Knoffler are my favorites.<br />
<br />
One thing I used to do was record rhythms on a cassette, then practice playing lead guitar to those tapes. Doing that forced me to practice many different things, even things I wasn't wanting to practice.<br />
<br />
I really wish I'd taken lessons. It would have saved me lots of trial and error.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oatasgai Alenxia</div><div class="date">04-15-2002, 05:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I opted to avoid formal lessons for both piano and guitar and went self-taught on both.  There are some things technique-wise I'm sure I'm missing out on, but overall I think I'm a better player for it.  Obviously you'll probably find people to argue either side of it.<br />
<br />
One thing that most guitar instructionals I've seen lack is any guidelines on posture, hand positioning, etc - if you can find a decent starter reference with that kind of information I'd advise looking into it.  Along with the usual fingering excercises, arpeggio drills, etc, you should be able to keep yourself busy for quite some time.  Don't focus so much on being able to play songs, that'll come in time.  Work on some drills, and really nit-pick yourself.  Record yourself if possible, play it back, and listen to your tone, etc...you are your own best critic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brannuer</div><div class="date">04-17-2002, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a lot of what you might term 'classical' training in brass instruments. I taught myself guitar, and it's what I consider my 'main' instrument now.<br />
<br />
Oatasgai mentioned something that is very important. Posture and physical positioning will effect what you do with the guitar a *lot*. Try to make sure you get this nailed ... sure it looks cool to windmill power chords, but that's about all you'll ever do if you don't figure out how to hold the intrument properly.<br />
<br />
Be very careful with any physical pain you experience in you wrist/hands. Playing any instrument is physical exertion, and though it seems stupid, you must treat your body like any athlete would to get it to work best. That means warm-ups and cool-downs. It means starting out at the 5th or 7th fret for a little while to warm up your tendons (not the 1st), stopping to stretch, and NOT pushing through pain. Of  course your fingers are going to hurt, but aching in your back/neck/wrist for any length of time is a sign you're pushing too hard and about to start doing damage to your body.<br />
<br />
I know it sounds too serious, but when you want to start playing Satriani, Vai, Knopfler, Van Halen, Gilmour or whomever you want to emulate, it's going to suck if the carpal tunnel syndrome you got is getting in the way.<br />
<br />
As far as practicing, quantity counts as well as quantity. When I was young, we had the phrases &quot;15 minutes a day&quot; and &quot;start slowly&quot; drilled into us. Sounds pretty simple, but if you're consistent,  you will notice significant imporvement in as little as a month. Consistency plays a big part in getting your muscles to remember what they're supposed to be doing.<br />
<br />
The last thing I'll say is when you buy the mags or books with that song you always wanted to learn, realize that what's there is a capsule of what the song was at a moment in time, not Scripture. Please don't become the guy in the music store playing the note perfect Satriani solo who couldn't jam with real people if his life depended on it. I did enough of that to last all of us a long time. Playing real music with real people is WAY better :)</div></div><hr />
