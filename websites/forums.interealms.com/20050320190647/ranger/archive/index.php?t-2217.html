<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Screeling</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I normally play about 3-5 times a week and I really just play 9 ball. I'm rated a 5, but most people gripe I should be rated a 6.<br />
<br />
My problem is such that when I practice, I can make most of my shots and get good shape on my next. My average is running about 3 balls every turn. However when I play against somebody I don't really know, I have a hard time keeping that. All of a sudden I can't shoot worth crap. The most easy shot is beyond me but for some reason I'm still able to get good shape on what would have been my next shot.<br />
<br />
If I play against friends, (have 2 friends that are both strong 7's) I can usually win 1/3 - 1/2 of the games. If I play against friends who only play maybe once a week, I just dominate them (usually win at least 6 games to every 1 of theirs).<br />
<br />
Can anybody think what my mental block is here without watching me play?</div></div><hr />

They just bumped me up to a 5 for 8-ball. Here's what I've noticed about myself: When I'm playing against a friend, I typically know how they shoot. Since I know what they can and cannot hit, I know what their trouble balls are. So long as they have at least one trouble ball, I know I can afford to miss. Knowing I can afford to miss, I usually don't.<br />
<br />
More later. I need to take care of a few things right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kedawen</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd say thinking too hard. I know when I played a new person and really wanted to do my best, I thought about every shot, visualizing angles and spin,  instead of just playing by  feel/instinct. Try playing a few warm up games with the opponent beforehand, with no intention at all of trying your best, just get a feel for the situation. <br />
<br />
I was by no means a great player in my time, but I usually drank more beer than I paid for at the local bar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tulouis</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 11:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd say thinking to hard. I find that when I am sober, I am at my second worst. When I am drunk, I am at my worst. When I am tipsy, I am a freakin king. I think it is the fact that I losen up, forget about competition, and just shoot on instinct, when I am tipsy, and that is why I play better that way. I have tried to play like that when I am sober, but it never works. Trying to play like that just makes me think even more :)<br />

EDIT: Fixed a confusing typo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tevyn</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the other things that I've noticed about teammates and higher rated players from other teams is that they tend to make things more complicated than they have to be. It's almost as if they feel that being a higher rated player means you have to take a bunch of fancy shots. A little bit of draw here, a little bit of follow there is all you really need, yet they continually try to force break-outs of balls that are either not problem balls or could be broken out much easier on the next shot. Think about your leaves, but don't make the leave the whole point of the shot. Unless it's an intentional defensive shot, the best leave in the world doesn't mean squat if you don't sink the ball. If you're as good as you say you are, then the leaves become less important. The follow up shot doesn't have to be a perfect set. It just has to be reasonable. You can miss your leave by two feet and still have a follow up shot. The best advice I can give is just to relax and have fun with it. If you miss a shot or a leave, work with what you have. Don't look back and don't get upset about it. To quote the great Yogi Berra, &quot;Half of this game is 90% mental.&quot;</div></div><hr />

What? This is the proper thread to put it in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 12:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to play a lot of pool in college, but no one wanted to play with someone majoring in math and physics - so I lost all my opponents. /shrug.<br />
<br />
I would bet it's a form of stage-fright. A lot of people perform better without an audience in whatever they do. It should get better with more experience in competition.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Whenever I play in a tourny, I bring a friend and have him play about 20 Metallica songs in the jukebox, that usually helps to get me pumped and the other person off wack;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Screeling</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 12:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know what assocation of rules we're under, but usually people are started at a rating of 4. I've never heard of a 3 playing in tournaments. So far as I understand it its something like this:<br />
<br />
4 - understanding of rudimentary fundimentals of the game and shooting.<br />
5 - better than average at making shots, normally doesn't run more than 2 balls, beginning to learn cue ball control and English<br />
6 - good shooting skills, decent cue ball control, decent grasp of shots with English, learning to play position better, will usually run the table out if ball and hand and 3 balls left on table<br />
7 - normally runs 3-4 balls every turn at the table. good shooting skills, good cue ball control, consistently able to use English when appropriate to get a better leave.<br />
<br />
I haven't watched any higher rated players shoot yet. I don't know that I agree I'm a 6 yet, but I will say I'm a very strong 5. I know what I need to do to bring my game to the next level, its just about practice now. I still occasionally have issues though with poking the cue ball instead of stroking through it. Old habits die hard. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Screeling</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I saw somebody's comment about thinking too hard and that may be part of my problem. Can somebody tell me a technique to help un-psych myself out when I catch myself doing this? I also get a little nervous around players I haven't shot against before. Aside from deep breaths, is there anyway to overcome that initial discomfort? Sometimes I do ok, but when that discomfort gets coupled with low blood sugar reactions, I'm basically worthless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tevyn</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you sure you're a 5 and not on my team? j/k<br />
<br />
I have a player on my team with the same problem and, well, the same problem. I had to race to get him a glass of coke during a match. He downed it practically in one gulp, settled down, and was fine for the rest of the match, which he won.<br />
<br />
There really are only three things that you can do to get over that problem. First, check your local league newsletter or area bar postings for tournaments. Go to as many tournaments as you can. Second, spend some time touring the local pubs. Play in as many different bars as you can, against as many different people as you can. Third, play as many matches as you can during league play. When you're not playing in a match, go play on a spare table if the establishment has more than one. Ideally you'll want to play against idle members of the other team rather than against your teammates.<br />
<br />
The best way to overcome the jitters is to go into the match having already won it in your mind. You're a good shooter and you know it. You have nothing to prove. It's not you against your opponant, it's you against the table and how the balls end up after the break. Your opponant is irrelevant. If he beats you because he's a better player then that's going to happen sometimes. It doesn't matter how good he is, all you need is for him to miss one shot and the table is all yours.<br />
<br />
Slumps: I look forward to slumps now. I used to hate them, especially when they lasted for months and months. Now I love them because every single time I've gone into a slump, I've come out of it better than I ever was. When you're shooting well, you're coasting. When you're in a slump, you're learning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Screeling</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope, wouldn't be me. I live in Tucson and the tournaments I play in aren't league, anybody can enter them. I guess I just gotta break the ice and ask players if they mind if I play a few games with them. I used to be able to psych myself out by being &quot;zen&quot; and just focusing on what was going on at that second and not thinking about winning the match but just making the shot I was taking. It doesn't seem to work these days.<br />
<br />
I'll give it a shot. (no pun intended)<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tevyn</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh. Sounds like what I do. Once I step up to the table for the lag at the beginning of a match, I do nothing but focus on the pool table. There literally is nothing and nobody else in the room as far as I'm concerned. When I'm shooting, I'm concentrating on the shot and where the balls are on the table. When I'm not shooting, I'm concentrating on the table and planning what I'm going to do if my opponant misses his next shot and I'm anticipating what I would do if I were my opponant. Everything else is completely blocked out. You've heard I'm sure of pro sports players who have a career defining game? They get into what they call &quot;the zone&quot; and no one can touch them. The trick is learning how to put yourself in the zone at will rather than riding it on those rare occasions when it happens spontaneously.<br />
<br />
Never been to Tucson, and Arizona is one of the ten states I haven't even been to yet, but just about everywhere I've been, most bars with coin-op tables work on a challenge system. You keep playing until you lose. Then you put your set of quarters up at the end of the line and wait your turn. On league nights in bars with more than one table, usually if I just start shooting by myself, someone will walk up and put quarters up to play a game. From there, there's usually four or five people waiting in line to play all the time. Now, if you play in a pool hall where the tables are pay by the hour, it's a different story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Screeling</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 05:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Naw, I don't play on coin-ops these days. I read once that its harder to put draw on a cue ball on coin ops because the cue ball is heavier and sometimes bigger than the rest of the balls. I have a hard enough time with draw already. hehe. <br />
<br />
I go to the pool halls here. They're not bad and generally less smoky than the bars you'd go to to play on the coin ops. Aside from that, I couldn't imagine playing 9 ball on coin-ops because if you snap that 9 on the break, thats pretty much a waste of 50 cents. The game is fast enough as it is. :)</div></div><hr />
