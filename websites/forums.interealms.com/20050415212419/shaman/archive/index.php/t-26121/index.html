<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lorianna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">On a raid last night I noticed something.<br />
<br />
I had set up /tar (pet's name) hot keys to keep leopard on a few pets.<br />
<br />
I could do this for all pets but the Beastlord's warder.  No matter what variation I put in as the warder's name, I could not get the hot key to work.<br />
<br />
Just curious as to why this was.<br />
<br />
Thanks guys.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just try /target beastlord_1001<br />
<br />
I always end up targetting their pet first unless they send me a tell so I can /rt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was doing this myself by making a hot key for each pets name and it was ok until AoE ate pets and new pets were cast.  /sigh<br />
<br />
I think there is a way to make a hot key that will target your pet without making the hot key with pets name.  Something like /tar %M or something.  Its a minor PITA to stop and have to re enter the pets name into a hot key when its recast.<br />
<br />
Anyone try this yet?<br />
<br />
Is there a command along the lines of:<br />
<br />
/tar %T's pet<br />
<br />
If so, then you would only need one hot key.<br />
<br />
Something like:<br />
/tar %t's pet, /pause 2<br />
/cast (#)<br />
<br />
This way, you can use raid box to target pet classes and then hit one hot key to cast Leopard on pet.<br />
<br />
I would be happy if they let a double click on a Raid box bring up a pet target if its available.  <br />
<br />
Right now, I try and get the Shaman who have the spell, to be grouped with the pet classes during a raid.  That way you just have to double tap the F1-F6 keys to get a pet target and then press your leopard hot key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When /targetting beastlords, the full name will target them, any abbreviation of the name will target their warder.  /Targetting magician/necromancer pets should work normally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Beorg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">When /targetting beastlords, the full name will target them, any abbreviation of the name will target their warder.  /Targetting magician/necromancer pets should work normally.<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually, Targeting the beastlords full name, or abbreviated name will target whichever is closest, the Beastie, the Warder, or the beasties corpse, Usually I get the pet or corpse, when I want the person, and get the person when I want the pet.<br />
<br />
Whereas, targeting the beast with the &quot; ' &quot; sign, i.e. &quot;/Tar Kitty's&quot; will only target the beasts corpse, if there is one.<br />
<br />
Like lori, I have tried a few variations of this, I will try what was suggested above, /target beastlord_1001, and see what that gets us.<br />
