<br />
Please ignore Mystic Holth's advice.  His Megelo is about the worst I have ever looked apon.  It is so bad that I suspect that it might be some attempt at humor.<br />
<br />
The debate between the merits of wisdome v.  ac  v. hp has gone on a long time and gets revived every time another druid starts a shaman.  The size of your mana pool has has no impact on how efficient a shaman you will be.   Your AC, regen, FT items, focus items, and eventualy your HP will have a big impact on how efficent a shaman you are.<br />
<br />
Look for items with High AC and hp on them as your first priority.  The 6 ac 65 hp rings are much better then the 7 wis rings that Holth has on his Megalo.  The shaman Jaundiced Bone armor has great ac on it and the helm,  boots, arms, and hands are all quite cheap.<br />
<br />
A great longer term item to wook towards is an Cerimonial Iksar Chestplate wich had 5 hp a tick regen on it.  It only has 19ac and no stats but the regen will have a very nice impact on your efficiency, and is a bread and butter 40s 50s level shaman item.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps a little bit, and it might be wise to spend a little time looking at threads that cover this issue,  and have a look at the Megalo's of a lot of Shamans in the mid upper 40's and 50's.  If you have a good idea where to go it will make the process of choosing equipment much less of a mistery.<br />
<br />
When I look at Holth's megalo,  the only items I would eqip are  the Silver Hammer Earring to replace my black saphire electrum,  and I would like a horse for outdoor grouping.  Much of the rest of his gear I would only use when working on trade skills and then I would hide my shame at equiping that junk by casting bear form.<br />
<br />
Lots of shaman items have some little bit of wisdom on it and over time you wisdom will increase without much effort.<br />
<br />
Holth,  if you Magelo is a true and acurate represention of your current state,  please have a priest kill the deamon druid spirit that has gained controll of your mind.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Holth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Excuse me, Radag, if I don't play my Shaman as yours. FYI, i'm not a druid playing a Sham, Holth is my main.<br />
I perhaps would have care of your &quot;advices&quot; on how to equip my char if you'd been a little more polite &amp; not so agressive. I never said that WIS items are a priority forever for a Sham, but, as I can see, you seems to know better than anyone.<br />
Bah, in the case of Keirstad, I don't think he can afford most of the items you talk about (he said he's just beginnning EQ).<br />
So, Radag, I play the game as I want, I equip my char as I want too, none of my companions had to complain on how I played my Shaman 'till now, &amp; I wish you an Happy New Year :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Boys will be boys<br />
<br />
Flexing over gear is a EQ mainstay ... for the Shaman's it's a debate about Wis ~vs~ AC ... with HP/other stat's thrown into the mix.    To be truthful ... it's really about time and effort.    If you have the time and done the effort for drops or plat ... one can get some really nice gear.    <br />
<br />
I would recommend spending a small bit of RL cash and using Allakhazam's premium services.    Then you can do searches for any combination of stat's.    Allakhazam's  also offers one of the better databases of EQ items for searches as well.    Then play around ... check stuff out ... create a wish list for gear.    <br />
<br />
Lastly ... if you are going to take the time to create a Magelo profile ... use the right numbers for your beginning stat's.    Strip down to nothing gear wise ... write your naked stat's numbers down ... and use those for Magelo.    (Sorry but that's just a personnel pet peave).]<br />
<br />
Edited because I can't spell Allakhazam's correctly ... bah</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>USMC4life</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for the advice, Much appreciated!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hroth,<br />
<br />
We can all play our characters any way we wish but you simply gave bad advice to a new player and statements about having a high wisdom making a shaman more efficient are simply factualy in error.<br />
<br />
Having a lage mana pool does give a shaman a larger safty margin but has zero impact on the efficiancy of a shaman.<br />
<br />
Also, I advised this young shaman to do a little research into the ac v wis debate and to look at a number of other players racks so that he can gain an understanding of how the shaman class functions based on gear selection.  I did not just tell him to go look for wis gear which I think is horid advice,  and I did not feed him some garbage about a large mana pool making him more efficient.  High end shamans do have large mana pools with great wisdom numbers but those numbers come as a benifit from being able to get high end gear, not from striving to get wisdom up at the expense of more important charicteristics.  My Gerka is not at that stage yet and my wisdom number are in the 145 to 155 range depending on solo or group mode, but I expent his wisdom to start increasing without giving it any special attention.<br />
<br />
At one time, a shaman on this board, did post a joke thread in which he created a druid shaman with a bunch of leather gear and wis rings and a paw of opolla in the prime slot.  Your gear is so druidic in nature it is almost hard to comprehend, and very close to the Magelo that someone created as a joke.<br />
<br />
If your feeling got hurt,  then get over it,  read, learn and get smarter.  If you had not posted bad advice for a young shaman I would not have said anything.   You of corse are free to play your character in any maner you personaly find rewarding.<br />
<br />
You might consider having a look at the debates over wis and ac and a look at a lot of other Magelo's as well.   At one time I was also proud of how high a wisdom my character had.  Learning that such pride is both misplaced and foolish will be painfull but profitable.<br />
<br />
What items a player can curently purchase is almost of no relavance (he does have 900p listed on his profile).  If he learns what the impact of different equipment choises will have on the way his character plays then he can evaluate his options for each slot without having to ask for advice.  He can evaluate each item based on ac , wis, hp, mana, and special effects.  If he gets some crazed druid wisdom garbage imprinted in his young shaman brain at this low level then he could end up looking like you.<br />
<br />
Holth,  It was kind of you to wish me a Happy New Year :) and I also honestly hope that your new year will be great as well.  I do not know you personaly and mean you no personal animosity.  You could very well be a nice, kind, and considerate person that would be a fine companion in Norath and a great person to know in real life.  Please don't take my evaluation of your gear as a personal attack.<br />
<br />
Fascaser,  <br />
<br />
If you Magelo comments are in referance to Holth's numbers for hp ac and atk....  he may very well have them right.  He has a paw in prime so his attack rating will only benifit from offense and not his weapon skills,  he has almost nothing in the way of stamina or +hp items so even thow his hp is very low and it might be accurate, and his ac rating does reasonably reflect his gear considering that his defense skill is only 172.  As surprising as it may be, his numbers could be true.<br />
<br />
*burp*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Please don't take my evaluation of your gear as a personal attack.  <br />
<br />
Radag ... outside of your &quot;evaluation of gear&quot; ... not only did you evaluate his gear you took great liberty of mocking the owner.    You jumped all over him for 2 sentences of opinion.   I'm surprised you didn't take his mother's name in vain as well in the process.    Want to do a little score keeping?<br />
<br />
1.   His Megelo is about the worst I have ever looked apon. It is so bad that I suspect that it might be some attempt at humor.  <br />
<br />
2.  Much of the rest of his gear I would only use when working on trade skills and then I would hide my shame at equiping that junk by casting bear form.  <br />
<br />
3.  Holth, if you Magelo is a true and acurate represention of your current state, please have a priest kill the deamon druid spirit that has gained controll of your mind.  <br />
<br />
Sir ... that's not eval'ing someone ... that's ripping.   But your whole condescending matter of &quot;If your feeling got hurt, then get over it, read, learn and get smarter&quot; is built on the fact that you may be someone smart enough to educate.   That's presumptuous on your part ... in fact arrogant.   So in short ... &quot;Please don't take my evaluation of your gear as a personal attack. &quot; is a false statement ... you did go off on him ... as such you can't back track now trying to come off as some good guy just doing your job without &quot;personal animosity&quot; howbeit that the person was in error concerning Wisdom gear for Shamans.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lastly ... Lastly ... if you are going to take the time to create a Magelo profile ... use the right numbers for your beginning stat's. Strip down to nothing gear wise ... write your naked stat's numbers down ... and use those for Magelo. (Sorry but that's just a personnel pet peave).]     Is just that ... a personnel pet peave of mine.   I see people all the time with incorrect numbers in their magelo's ... USMC4life may be right  /shrug  I'm not going to take the time to figure it out ... but it's good advice nonetheless ... which was my point.  <br />
<br />
USMC4life ... a &quot;Burp&quot; aside ... not all Shaman's will rip you a new one on here ... GL on getting new gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Fascaser,<br />
<br />
I in no way ever impuned his personal character, his ethics, his honesty or anything of that nature.  I did not call him names, or talk about his parantage,  his wife / girl / significant other.  The closest I cam to a &quot;personal attack&quot; was the last statement about getting a cleric to help him with his druid deamon.  This was an attempt at levity,  humor,  *gigle*,  however unsecsessfull it might have been.<br />
<br />
I have not in all my time ever looked apon a worse set up for a post 50 shaman character.  Not one.  This is a true statement.  When I looked at his gear the first thing that did come to mind was that joke thread where a person created a Magelo for the purpose of roasting the extreem druid - shaman.<br />
<br />
I also do put on wis gear when I do trade skills and I do put up bear form to hide the leather look.<br />
<br />
Furthermore,  I do sincearly wish him a great new year and I assume that he truly meant the same.<br />
<br />
An evaluation is opinion and I expressed my opinion of his gear in an open an honest maner.  I did this in the hope that Keirstad will not take Holth's advice, thus saving Keirstad from the painfull process of learning that big wisdom is not good at the expense of ac  / hp / regen / ft / focus.<br />
<br />
Please be so kind as to point out any area of my evaluation that you do not agree with.  Please point out any place where I called him a name, pissed on his mother, or kicked his dog.<br />
<br />
Also ...<br />
<br />
As far as the Magelo issue goes,  I was simply pointing out that if you where looking at Holth's [ you did not specify ] and thinking that he  was lazy in not getting his base numbers right,  then that opinion was probably in error.  I think the numbers do reflect his gear / skills and considering that he did take the time to provide values for his skills,  I would think that an opinion that he is lazy would not reflect the effort that he put in his Magelo. <br />
<br />
I do not know Holth.  My primary concearn was that he gave bad advise to a young shaman. I do honestly and sinsearly mean him no personal insult.  I have no sound basis in which to form an opion about the man.  I do have a large amount of information on which to form an opinion about his advice to the young shaman and how that advise was reflected in the gear he personaly chose for his character.  I am more then willing to modify that opinion if you would care to provide rational argument as to where it is in error.<br />
<br />
When I have a look at your Magalo,  I note that your gear selection provides evidance that you basicly agree with my assement of Holth's rack.  Not only is your gear significantly better then either Holth's or mine,  but you wisdom is significantly lower then his.<br />
<br />
Setting asside you assement of my character as presumptuous, arrogant and condescending,  how was the information provided in my evaluation of Holth's equiment not educational.  Is it your judgement that my opinion was in error? Did I fail to communicate that I thaught that his gear selection stinks?  Was my post some wishy washy collection of feel good drool that no one can gain any information from?  If you where a young shaman,  would my advise be of more use or Holth's?<br />
<br />
It is true that I am a blunt person.  I find that it is a lot more efficient then being overly nice, sensitive bla bla bla. At some point,  Holth will come to the painfull realization that his wisdom heavy aproach to playing a shaman has significant negatives.  It may not be untill he scribes torpor and gets Cani V but you, me,  and the rest of the crucable all know that if he continues to develope his shaman then that event will happen.  I hope that my posts will help him reach that conclusion sooner rather then later.<br />
<br />
You may not like the way I express my opinions,  thats fine, you may not agree with my opinions, that is also fine,  please be so kind as to refrain from making assumptions about my motivations.<br />
<br />
Honestly,  I also hope that you will have a great new year and that at some time in the future you might find it in your hart to overlook my blunt nature.<br />

<br />
I'm sorry if I was a bit sharp in my answers in my previous post, but that's the way I play my Shamm for 52 Lvls, now, and I never heard any complaints about the way I played it. So I was surprised the way you &quot;attacked&quot; :) me.<br />
By now, I read your comments, I'll search this forum for threads on WIS vs &quot;Other stuff&quot;, and I'll try to understand if I am wrong playing this way. (BTW, if you can link to one of this threads, it'll be nice).<br />
I consider myself still a young Shammy, and I'm fond of advices. If I got enough evidences that WIS is not the lone heaven, I'll change my mind.<br />
I gave USMC4life advices that worked for me. My intention was not to fool him on a wrong way.<br />
And I was sincere when I whished you an Happy New Year ;).<br />
And yes, my AC/Atk/Hps are the right numbers on my Magelo profile.<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
I can't show my Sign anymore... Strange. Not intentional to hide my Magelo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">OMG Holth....  You are so kind and open minded.  Thanks.<br />
<br />
I am not sure about recent threads over the ac / wis / hp because I have been away for some time and have only recently started playing again.<br />
<br />
The basic arguments are resonably simple,  and high hp is more of a gole to be acheived at the same time as you get Cani V.<br />
<br />
The two basic models for a shaman are <br />
<br />
Wisdom.. caster shaman.<br />
AC .... tanking shaman.<br />
<br />
The advantages of a high wisdom shaman are mostly found in grouping and having a large mana pool for healing when things get bad.  The large reserve of mana does provide a bigger margin of safty.<br />
<br />
The AC heavy shaman:  because we get the canibalize line of spells,  hp == mana.    We can improve how efficient we are buy converting our hp regeneration into mana as well as meditating.  With high ac the hp side of the mana pool is protected when you are getting pounded on in solo / group / or raid situations.  That preserves your health for conversion into mana wich means that in a given amount of time you will have more mana to use for casting.<br />
<br />
If you are a wisdom shaman then you are limited in the teckinques that you can use to solo and must be more carefull about gaining agro in a group.  A wisdom shaman can solo via pet kiting, root doting or any other variation that keeps him / her from getting pounded.  If you are a high AC shaman you just stand in the battle and let the slowed mob beat on you while you tank for your pet and add some free damage with a big 2hb or other weapon of choise.  This also gets your defensive skill maxed in short order which equates to free ac.<br />
<br />
In group / raid,  the high ac shaman has little fear of slow agro and can slow as soon as the mob reaches the kill spot.  This cuts down on the work the cleric has to do and it is much better to have agro on the shaman then on the cleric or enchanter.<br />
<br />
The high ac shaman can also do a very nice job in crowd controll buy using slow / criplle to gain agro on adds then moving out of mele range to root park.  With out a good base of AC and a nice hp pool, this is a lot more dangerous.<br />
<br />
Another consideration is the enchanter in the group.  I do my very best to make sure that every mezed mob hates me a lot more then the enchanter.  As soon as the chanter mezzes I slow or even before.  After slow I like to crip to gain even more agro.  If mez breaks the mob should run to the shaman and not the enchanter.    If a shaman is good the chanter never dies.<br />
<br />
AC has some limits.  If you get your ac up into the 1200 range it starts to have diminishing returns on damage mitigation.<br />
<br />
HP is more of a canni V thing and it gives you a better chance of survinving a slow resist on a rade target.<br />
<br />
Canni V remove a huge chunk of health  1900 and somthing all at once and converts it into mana.  A shaman with nice hp and torpor can manufacture mana at a tremendous rate.<br />
<br />
At this time, my gear puts me at about 1800 hp, 920 ac and 155 wisdom in 1hb / group mode.   When soloing with a 2hb my self buffed ac still breaks 900 and my wisdom drops to about 142 or so.  I have no fear of slowing for our gimp rades.  I can solo like a mad man with just pet tanking and slow spending no mana at all for damage.  All my solo damage comes from the pet and the hammer and my pull rate is all but constant.  I find a little down time to get more mana for the next slow or when I have a big chunk of buffs drop.<br />
<br />
My personal goals at this time is to...<br />
<br />
1) break 1k self buffed ac in solo mode<br />
2) add a big chunk of hp for when I can Can V<br />
3) get a horse and a JBB.<br />
<br />
I truly hope this helps and a lot of others can add much rich detail to this very basic outline.<br />
<br />
I personaly think equipment selection is fairly simple up too the Can V / torpor level.   After that,  I do not have a good feal at how to balance hp / resists and ac.<br />
<br />
*burp*<br />
<br />
PS  Sorry for the horid spelling and grammer....  this ogre is dislexic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Holth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thanks Radag,<br />
reading your post made me think of some aspects of the game - I realise - I did not saw so clearly.<br />
I'll begin to change my stuff slowly... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Radag's post is dead on the money.<br />
<br />
That is exactly what I do in groups and in raids.  <br />
<br />
With PoP hp is now king.  The more you have the better change you have to live if you draw agro.  <br />
<br />
For content before PoP you are going to be fine Holth.  I would however look for some ac items to augment your wis.  As you lvl you will find that most items have both decent ac/hp and wis.  Check the Magelo's of Henora or others that have high lvl toons.<br />
<br />
Enjoy the game.  That's why you play.</div></div><hr />
