<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">the emp is missing!<br />
i've been camping the emp in sebilis for awhile with no luck. 10 straight ph mobs. was he removed from the game?<br />
i've NEVER had to wait more than 6 ph spawns before getting an emp before.</div></div><hr />

Last time I tried it, about a month or 2 ago, I got 12 PH's. Haven't tried since.</div></div><hr />

<br />
this is crazy. our spells are rare enough drops when he does spawn.</div></div><hr />

I was in there a week ago. I believe we had 2 emps and 2 placeholders spawn. Didn't drop anything nice though.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>jathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">we'll after 15 staright PH i left. i hope this isn't a &quot;stealth nerf&quot;, reducing his spawns. like i said before, i never had to wait longer then 6 ph before he spawn for me.<br />
15 ph with no emp is insane.  /gate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">uh oh... I think this might be a stealth nerf. My pal and I went down there and camped it for something like 10 spawns. He appeared once, and dropped ****.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bahamute</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I spent about 40 hours the last week down there. I got AVatar and EoT nothing else that was worth alot. I got about 15 too 20 emp spawns in that time. I got up to 13PH in a row. I swear I came so close to throwing my computers out the window. I had to give up or I would have lost my mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">it is just the RNG being streaky.  I had 14 Emps and 19 PH's, then hit a string of 15 consecutive placeholders.  Been in and out since, and have seen Emp around 30% of the spawns since then.<br />
<br />
I would be happy if they took that dang Blood out of there, though.  He is rarer than the Emp, and harder (for me) to kill.  Last time I saw him he resisted my first slow, then promptly interrupted me to a quick death.  couldn't even get Spirit Call off, or Stoicism.  Blood always drains my mana pool so that I am rushing to get ready for the Emp spawn (I reallly love pulling the Emp before he can get a pet out.  That is such an easy fight then.)</div></div><hr />
