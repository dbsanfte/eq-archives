<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I had mentioned this in another thread, but I don't want to hijack the other thread.<br />
<br />
I tried out ME Toilers, but with the current LoS bugs it is just too annoying.  That and this morning I watched a robe and his pet slowly walk halfway across the zone to me and start attacking for no reason.  What the heck was that all about?<br />
<br />
I then went to BW giant fort only to be blind-sided by Ixiblat while I was still standing there summoning pet and buffing.  That should be fun getting someone to come rez me.<br />
<br />
I don't really want to go to the Hole, because if someone is there on the entrance, it is a huge waste of time for me.  I usually get about an hour at a time to play.<br />
<br />
I am looking for suggestions on good places to duo.  I am two-boxing, so I need somewhere where my druid can just sit there, stand up, cast, sit.  I have a lot of hotkeys for her.<br />
<br />
Some places that I was considering:<br />
<br />
WL, Sentient Suits.  I don't know much about these though.  I hear that they are poison and disease immune, but I'm not sure.  About how many HPs?  How hard do they hit?  Any resist problems that I can expect?<br />
<br />
Kael.  Can we work one side or the other at the entrance and get decent exp?  It would be good faction work too, but I want exp.<br />
<br />
BW, giant fort.  I could bite the bullet and try there for a bit.<br />
<br />
SD Plateau.  This was suggested, but I looked at the bestiary and it didn't look that good to me.  What mobs would be good to fight?  What HPs, what do they hit for?<br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  I kinda ran out of steam when I wasted a few of my precious few play hours travelling and dying.<br />
<br />
I have decent gear for a casual palyer, mostly bought.  JBB, Iksar CP, FT1 earring.  Profile below.  Druid is decent bought gear nothing special.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Tarelan</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Boring as hell, but decent loot/exp...<br />
<br />
I duo'd my Shaman/Druid on Sea Fury's in OOT up to their current levels. Been farting around doing a whole lotta nothing since then.<br />
<br />
They're decent up to about 54, but get slow after that. 54 was grueling and slow on those, but they should still be decent for you. They only have about 4500 hp's and hit like wimps (iirc the most they ever hit for was mid 90's). You'll max your defense there in no time.<br />
<br />
Try to get the Gornit camp and kill him every 3 or 4 pulls (he's a 6 minute spawn). Between his cash/fine steel weapons and the gems the Sea Fury's sometimes drop I wracked up almost 20k during my time there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the Seafury suggestion, but I just left there.  I did 49-52 there solo and then duoed my druid from 35 - 44 there while I gained almost 4 points of AA and finished 52 on the Shaman.<br />
<br />
I am unbelievably sick of Seafuries.  I did make some decent plat though.  I used it to outfit the druid and to finish the PoTC Earring and an Iksar chestplate for my Shaman.<br />
<br />
I would like to avoid going back there.  You are right it is quite boring.  I can live with boring, I just need to be bored somewhere else for a change.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I believe I was the one that suggested SD.   I solo'd there during several levels around 50's and can even find Dark Blue's around about and for sure on top of Plateau.    I also duo'd with my wife with her Ranger and pocket Druid.   <br />
<br />
There are numerous reasons to exp in that zone ... for one blocks/bricks of acrylia drop off Bloodtribe's which sell well in baazar ( or use them for smithing yourself).   Then there are ton's of drops, quest pieces, etc in SD.   True most drops/gear is 40's type stuff but at least they sell in baazar.  The main thing is not the pure exp per kill but could we do number of mobs, easy killing , safe spots to hunt, and loot last.   SD has all of these for the casual gamer ... and it's a popular spot on my server ... so it's best to check camps.   <br />
<br />
<br />
My choice was to do Bloodtribes and animals for a hour or 2 camp(Cheetah, Lightcrawlers, and Sunflowers).   If top of Plateau was open and I had time ... would do Aliens making sure to keep Magic and Fire resist's up.   <br />
<br />
** Bloodtribes **<br />
Bloodtribe range from lvl 35 to 46.   The are mostly warriors and shaman.   Slow the warriors and they are cake.   Shaman are bit tricker but they tend to use the same spells ... poison rain, frost strike, slow, and debuffing.   I would slow them nonetheless because VI loves to give caster's good melee ability ... and they can hurt if allowed to hammer on you.   Best spots for them are on the back of the zone closer to the Grey zone.  There are numerous caves in the zone that spawn named Bloodtribes after killing in them for awhile.   <br />
<br />
**Animals**<br />
Animals range a bit lower than bloodtribes but Cheetah's are the best ( lvl 35-42).   Animals are mostly warrior types with Cheetah's being very fast with SoW like speed.    Lightcrawlers are a bit slower than Cheetahs and Sunflowers even slower.   With slow ... single fights with Cheetah's are hardest.   Lightcrawlers and Sunflowers easy.  <br />
<br />
<br />
A few tidbits (taken off other boards) <br />
<br />
1. Wolf Form is KOS regardless of faction. <br />
2. If fighting aliens and sun revenants, use Magic Resist buffs. Some aliens do fire attacks.   Sun Revenants do curse and necro spell type attacks.  <br />
3. The walls are better than the center. Green mobs will aggro (sunflower, lightcrawler, etc.) <br />
4. Choose a faction. Sun Revenant hate everyone but don't kill both aliens and bloodtribes unless you want to aggro everything in the zone.  <br />
5. There are 4 factions of aliens, but 3 of the factions are at war with the one other faction. The Tro Jeg are at war with the Grol Baku, the Vas Ren, and the Cral Ligi. So if your faction with one side becomes KOS then go hunt the other. <br />
6. Most things cannot see through invisibility but some Sun Revenants will see through invis ... check them to be sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nana Neener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">on you might want to think about is the entrance at chardok ...<br />
<br />
Im unsure of the level required to single pull the mobs , but with pet , slow and jbb the mobs there are surprisingly easy .. they take a little while to die , but the exp. is great !<br />
The druid would be very useful for the snare ... no more walkers ! ;)<br />
<br />
might wanna check it out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I tried SD this morning for a little bit.  It seemed good.  An incremental increase over Seafuries, but nothing drastic.  I parked along the north wall of the zone just east of the Bloodtribe cave in the NW corner.  I just pulled wanderers (BT Warriors, Cheetahs, Lightcrawlers)  Exp seemed just slightly better than seafuries.  The druid was getting consistently 1% exp per kill, whereas the last couple levels in OOT some kills would not register any exp on the gauge.<br />
<br />
The BloodTribe Warriors were all dark blue to my 53 Shaman.  Some were white to my 44 druid, others dark blue.  The Cheetahs, sunflowers and lightcrawlers were also mostly dark blue to both.  On my druid's tracking, most things were at least dark blue to her with some whites and yellows.<br />
<br />
Loot wasn't very good, but I wasn't there long enough to really judge that.  I didn't see any named.<br />
<br />
I have a couple of questions still.<br />
Can you camp inside any of the caves or are they too full or too fast respawn?  What is the respawn time inside the caves?  How many wanderers inside the caves?  I tried pulling from inside the cave to my camp outside, but the mob just got lost and never showed up.  I will try moving inside one of the caves, I just didn't have time this morning.<br />
<br />
Are the Spiney weapons just the SD version of Fine Steel?  Do they sell OK or are they a waste of time to haul back to town?<br />
<br />
BTW on my server from 6:30-7:30am, I was the only one in the zone for almost the whole hour.<br />
<br />
As for Chardock, thanks for the suggestion.  I have grouped there, but not tried to solo.  I think that I will give SD a try for a little while longer and then I will give Chardock a try.  It seems to be busier than SD any time that I have been there.  Also, I can use my horse in SD which reduces downtime greatly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Answers<br />
<br />
Q.  Loots wasn't very good<br />
A.   Nah, it's not going to be great but if you do bloodtribes they drop both Plat, weapons, and ore.   The ore is the money maker ... save up enough and sell it to smithers for nice profit.<br />
<br />
Q.  Can you camp inside any of the caves or are they too full or too fast respawn? <br />
A.  I'm not a big cave soloer.   With it being a cave ... it's hard to escape which is always on the back of my mind while soloing for efficiency.   You also build up a huge agro radius after killing bloodtribes after awhile which makes it hard to single pull inside a caves.<br />
<br />
Q.  What is the respawn time inside the caves? How many wanderers inside the caves? I tried pulling from inside the cave to my camp outside, but the mob just got lost and never showed up. I will try moving inside one of the caves, I just didn't have time this morning. <br />
A.  Other problem with caves is the crappy pathing for most mob's.   Some will warp to you ... others will wander off a bit during the fight and warp back to you with all their friends.   Worse is letting a cave pulled Shaman gate which will always guarantee that he will return with remaining mob's from the cave.<br />
<br />
Q.  Are the Spiney weapons just the SD version of Fine Steel? Do they sell OK or are they a waste of time to haul back to town? <br />
A.   Hmmm ... since we have huge STA and ability to buff it up ... even getting a couple plat per spiney makes it worth topping off your packs before selling.   And you don't have to return to town to sell ... there is a vendor in the tower in TS that will sell/buy from you even as a evil (unless you have messed up faction by killing them).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>warmag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Here is one you might try since I seem to have done okay soloing as a 53 shaman here: The Grey.  You'll need an enduring breath item or lots of fishscales for this. I would probably only try the Shissar Stalkers there though. I couldn't solo some of the other mobs I experimented with near the zone line because a few of them are resistant to dots. The shissar stalkers don't seem to be resistant to cold nuke so I pulled with slow, used cripple, and no bear form (for the barbarian bash, which I needed to solo these). My soloing basically consisted of me hitting the thing with a hammer of rage (2hb bonus, and 190+ in the skill, plus str &amp; rage up for maximum strength points added to damage formula so nice 100+ hits from me), using alacrity to nix some of the delay, and bash to stun the mob. Throw in a few cold nukes but save a couple bubbles mana for healing the pet and yourself. Pet used for taunt and save most of your mana for heals. With a druid, this would be an ideal place because of the damage shield to help the battle out. Buff up good though, and have full mana because a 53 barb shaman soloing these is going to have a close battle, really close. I don't have jbb or epic or anything fancy gearwise, so it's workable, but the downtime for mana regain is unacceptable to me so it would be perfect for two boxing. - Warmag of MM</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>undies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">2 boxing the Grey with 51 shammonk was very easy at ML zone (stay on western side of zone). Watch out for shimmering rockfiends! Everything else was easy with very little downtime. Sham slows mob, buffs/hastes monk and adds a DOT if bored. Otherwise just meds/heals monk.<br />
<br />
Got bored though after getting 2 EB necklaces...still great exp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I spent some time in SD.  It was good.  I got a few decent drops to put on my bazaar mule.  Now that I am KoS to the Bloodtribes, things are a bit more difficult.  Maybe more annoying that difficult.  I often get adds, which I can handle, but they are annoying and decrease efficiency.<br />
<br />
So, I moved back to ME and Toilers.  That is going well.  They seem to have fixed the Line-of-sight bugs that were causing all of the problems on the hills.  With the money that I made off the drops in SD, I upgraded some gear (Crystal Chitin Gaunts and Chitinous Belt) and got my buffed AC up to 953.  Crossing that 50 mark has actually made a significant difference in the amount of damage that I am taking.  I seem to be getting a good pattern down on the Toilers and they are higher level than the stuff I was fighing in SD so the exp is better.<br />
<br />
Anyone that has any questions about our ability to gain aggro, I have a demo for them.  I cast slow and then EBolt, then have my druid dump 3 DoTs and snare and then sit down.  The mob doesn't even look at her.  It works out well, I think.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I just wanted to give an update to how I am doing with these two.  The druid is 95% done 45 and the Shaman is 67% done 53.  She is getting 1% per Toiler, he is getting about half of that.</div></div><hr />
