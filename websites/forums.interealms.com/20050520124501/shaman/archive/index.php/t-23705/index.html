<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Never finished my epic, and thus I don't have the option to change my title to Heyokah, however I found a freaking ton of others Icould be, I'll omit the tradeskill ones.<br />
<br />
Diviner, Seer, Ancient, Prophet, Oracle, Mystic, Lord, Duke, Master, Elder, Venerable.<br />
<br />
Why in the hell did they give us Duke and Lord? If I was using Duke, the paladin jokes and tells for BSS would never end... I did choose Lord for now.<br />
<br />
Diviner makes me thinks of the days of Veksar, Seer reminds me of veksar/droga, Ancient? Erm... ok so I'm old and.. not appealing.  Prophet is nice, but it just doesnt fit with my name.  Only one that sounds decent was lord. <br />
I am curious though, has anyone else had some different titles?  As a Vah Shir, I'm wishing I could have something like oh... say.. DAR KHURA maybe?<br />
<br />
And if Someone already has a thread like this, I missed it :p  Just curious what other titles folks have and what they may have done to get that title. Kinda wanna be Dar Khura really badly..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I dunno, after playing COH, I found the titles kind of blah.<br />
<br />
Still, Oracle beats the hell out of Elder and Venerable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wazbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For Heyokah you have to have done your epic.  If you have your epic and still dont have the title, try having your epic in your inventory somewhere and then it should work.  But other than that, I am not sure what would be keeping you from getting Heyokah.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Apparently I didn't read and you already said you didnt finish your epic, Oops &gt;_&lt;<br />
<br />
And Glor, I never noticed the Napolean Dynamite Quote in your sig.  That movie kicks ass!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Of all the titles I saw on mine, Ancient and Heyokah were definitely the best.<br />
<br />
I went with Heyokah.  I'm very proud of my epic, even though I only equip it during raids (I have higher mana pool with epic than I do with my mithril battle hammer).<br />
<br />
I'll be starting on epic 2.0 as soon as I can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Draconis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">58 with no epic and i did not get any new titles, just another thing that pisses me off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't get why I only have &quot;Journeyman Alchemist&quot; when my skill is 200.  Does it need to be higher?  Or something else?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">58 with no epic and i did not get any new titles, just another thing that pisses me off<br />
<br />
Titles have always been AA related (6 in General for Baron, 12 in Arch for Venerable and a whole bunch in Class for Elder). I would assume that just because we can pick which one we want, they are still AA related. I would bet you can't pick a title until you have completed the class AA requirement?<br />
<br />
There are two separate title &quot;pools&quot;:<br />
<br />
Class titles:<br />
<br />
Shaman, Mystic, Luminary, Oracle, Prophet, Soothsayer (yech)<br />
<br />
AA titles<br />
<br />
Baron, Venerable, Elder<br />
<br />
I think it's confusing because they are mixing class titles with AA titles.<br />
<br />
So, I when someone does a /who on me at 70 (like 6 months from now) they will see Soothsayer Gloriana (70 Shaman). If they see me in game, it will say: Oracle Gloriana Lheeah`Rio (Affliction).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I went with Ancient, just because it makes no sense whatever. I'll probably swap around Ancient, Heyokah, and nothing at all. I almost always run around in /sho 1 mode, but I guess that's odd, most people like seeing all that text on peoples' heads.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Looks like some of the titles are awarded from accomplishments too...thus the Heyokah for epic and some tradeskill titles.<br />
<br />
There were like 35-40 titles I could choose from on my title screen...is that more or less normal?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I didn't have that many, but I haven't done very much tradeskilling. I did expect more than Journeyman Alchemist for my 200 skill, though. =/<br />
<br />
If anyone wants to compare notes about what combination of levels/aas/skills yields what titles, perhaps I can make a chart of what the minimum requirements are for each title...<br />
<br />
I likes chartses!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Draconis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">reason it made me mad was because it says you can display things you have earned thrugh levels and what not so i was expecting to at least put a mystic or luminary title up but I got nothing, been holding out for 65 to get my aas and ive wanted a title for a while, think i might just grind out the last 3 i need for baron just to say i have one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have &quot;Seer&quot; and some people reported not having it. wonder what you do to get it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Peroxide</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I went with Ancient due to the fact I have been playing this game since it was released.  I feel Ancient in this game and it fits my Iksar Shaman.  I have epic and Heyoka just doenst sound that great to me.  I would love the title of Witch Doctor that does not exist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I was one that didn't get Seer, but as soon as I purchased OoW it showed up (yeah, so much for me waiting two weeks to see what it was like).<br />
I have 183 AAs currently (I'm thinking the other titles like Ancient/Seer/Oracle are based on number of AAs). I have Seer, Oracle, Prophet (clerics get Prophet I hear), Lord, Duke, Master, Ancient, Baron, Venerable, Elder, Diviner, Mystic, and Heyokah. No Luminary though? Weird that we have all the regular names we had except for that one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Scarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Luminary would have fitted right in with the new ability to make yourself glow. :)</div></div><hr />

Same here. Sent in a bug report after I figured out what was causing it.<br />

Bit annoying but very glad to see they put in Heyokah as an option. Good history behind it and unique for us. :)</div></div><hr />

Looks like you can get digital downloads from Ubi now also. Check the news on this site (http://www.eqloft.com/) and continue from there.<br />
<br />
I had some small problems with the order process (kept switching language to French and asked me to log in every now and then), but I was able to get the expansion. The CD key gets sent to you by email, and you can download the expansion after that. For some reason the install of the downloaded version did not go right for me and the patcher decided to get all the files again, but that's was not a big deal to me (I guess you could skip the entire download part anyway and just let the patcher get the files, as the product key is the thing that matters).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">omg thank you ryam!!!<br />
<br />
that did the trick, thank you very much, now i won't be the lowlevel of my guild for this week :) :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>vincenzovs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I have 225 AAs and have the exact same list as you Samanna except I have the male versions of the &quot;Royalty&quot; titles.<br />
<br />
Personally the way I roleplay Vincenzo there is no way that he is Baron, Lord, Duke etc, so I am discounting those. I think that's the default list for all classes who reach 65. I've seen every class with those as an option.<br />
<br />
The ones that come from our &quot;class&quot; names, e.g. Luminary, Prophet, Seer etc seem to develop with AAs. I heard a rumour of &quot;Visionary&quot; for prople with a lot of AAs. (not sure how many).<br />
<br />
Add to that the old AA titles which are still there should people want to keep them (Baron, Venerable, Elder).<br />
<br />
Then you got the tradeksill titles, Apprentice for &gt; 200, Journeyman for 200+, Master for 250?<br />
<br />
Finally there is Heyokah for the Epic Shaman which is the one I chose.<br />
<br />
I think this is how it's working.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Hmm, I have Gates_Manual.pdf but not Omens_Manual.pdf, and I did a full file check during the patching yesterday, with everything except Legends checked.</div></div><hr />

I chose Heyokah of course, and already got asked by a guildie 'WTH is a hayoka?'<br />
<br />
kinda nice that I have a title that actually MEANS something.  <br />
<br />
Spirit Sentinel says 'Yes, you have walked the Path of the Heyokah to its end. You have become what few have and we will now call to you as Heyokah. From now on, you are a direct link between the spirits and man. Whether your goals are to help us or master us, you are welcomed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had chosen Heyokah, but I'm already getting sick of explaining to people about what it means... and with the bug and all, I might change it to something else.  I liked Ancient, Seer, and Heyokah.  Wish I could be an &quot;Ancient Seer&quot;... that would rock.</div></div><hr />

I believe so. My brother, playing a Mage picked Magus as his title and another Mage in our guild without his epic yet with more AA&quot;s than him doesn't have Magus as an option.<br />

The word heyokah comes from the Lakotah (Sioux) and is used in reference to a particular type of shaman. According to tradition, the heyokah is one who has &quot;dreamed of the Thunder Spirits.&quot; This dream bestows great powers upon the medicine man/medicine woman, one of which is reputed to be an ability to influence storms. However, these powers have their price in that the shaman becomes a &quot;contrary/&quot; <br />
<br />
In his vision, the heyokah comes into direct contact with the life-force itself. This is symbolized by the Thunder Spirits that he dreams of. When this occurs, a death/rebirth sequence is begun, which gives the shaman the capacity to control some of the manifestations of life-force. This would include an ability to influence storms and, as is typical of the shamanic experience, the power to heal. He also becomes a very potent teacher. This last is where the &quot;contrariness&quot; comes into focus, in two ways. The first is that the heyokah is teaching us about our selves. By &quot;mirroring&quot; all of our doubts, fears, hatreds, weaknesses, etc. he forces us to examine what we really are. For example, if you have any self-hatred (a common malady in our society) this sacred teacher will make you look at it. The second aspect of his mirroring is that, as we are taught, the heyokah heals us of our hurts. This is the most important and remarkable part of the holy man's clowning. For this wonderful shaman takes our pain and transforms it into laughter. And what can heal a human beings faster than to laugh at ourselves?</div></div><hr />

Again, that was taken out of the SoE manual for omens. It doesn't explain all the Titles (like Heyokah - which is probably from completing the shaman epic?), but does explain most.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">So according to the manual (Omens_MANUAL.pdf), if you have Elder now you can also get Mystic, Oracle, Seer, or Ancient. There are no AA-based title rewards beyond the original AA standards (6 general, 12 archtype, 24 class).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>jador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">&quot;Ancient&quot; sounds cool with my guildmate's name, &quot;Ancient Greenfrog&quot;  :D <br />
Start wondering what is title of epic 2.0</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Epic clerics can get &quot;Curate&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">I just wish they would fix the journeyman thing for tinkering and alchemy...sorta rude for those gnomes and shaman out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">It's not a problem for gnomes, tinkering maxes at 250.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">When you hit level 70, &quot;Prophet&quot; also becomes available to you as a title.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">I believe so. My brother, playing a Mage picked Magus as his title and another Mage in our guild without his epic yet with more AA&quot;s than him doesn't have Magus as an option.<br />
<br />
As has been covered already, Magus is one of the &quot;Class&quot; level title for Mages. The Epic 1.0 title for Mages is Thaumaturgist (means 'one who perfoms miracles').<br />
<br />
Anyway, yes every class gets and 'epic 1.0' title, and presumably epic 1.5 and epic 2.0 titles as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">When you hit level 70, &quot;Prophet&quot; also becomes available to you as a title.<br />
<br />
I had &quot;Prophet&quot; as a title option at 65 the day Omens launched. Guessing it may be AA related. *Shrugs*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">Could be. Prophet is in my screenshot from day 1 on page 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Oddloots already posted the manual. Any priest class with 18 AA can have the Prophet title. Prophet = Venerable.</div></div><hr />

Doesn't seem to be many Shamans with 1.5 yet on my server so it's nice to have a unique title for the time being. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Barce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">The only one that I didnt see on the list probably because its damn near impossible to get is: Expert Artisian (250 all trade skills) One guildy has it.</div></div><hr />

- does anyone have info on the other classes' level 70 and epic titles?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Zeltaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">I have the title 'Ancient' available to me, and I've only got 72 aa, and I dont think it's related to played time, or how long you've been playing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">It appears that Ancient, Mystic, Oracle, Seer are available to a Shaman with 6+ General, 12+ Archetype, and 24+ Class AAs spent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Zeltaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">I asked a  cleric in my guild what new title he got from his epic 1.5, but he said he didnt notice a new one. A shadowknight replied and told me their's but I see you've already got that one :) I'm gonna prod the cleric again next time I see him and make him check in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">Groovy, thank you.<br />
