10 - Forage (yay iksar)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Khayla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">1 - Fast heal macro (Knargs)<br />

On the second bank i keep AA and backup items that get swapped to first page at times:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My favorite macros are:<br />
<br />
Canni<br />
/sit off<br />
/cast 4 (cannibalize)<br />
/pause 12<br />
/doability 2 (sense heading)<br />
/sit on<br />
<br />
I like it as within a few days my feeble sense heading went from 10 to 120! ;)  I hate that spinning compass.<br />
<br />
And my newest hotkey made at the advice of a friend because I was having issues remembering to send my puppy into battle.  (Cut me some slack I am only level 35!)<br />
<br />
/assist Puller<br />
/sit off<br />
/cast 7 (slow)<br />
/pet attack<br />
/cast 7 (slow again to catch the fizzles!)<br />
<br />
It works for me.  Everything else is a direct spell or simple announcement hotkey (/g %T is slowed).<br />
<br />
I love my UI as it puts two inventory spots as well as some armor locations right next to my hotkeys so my booties are only a click away rather then having to open the inventory and click them.  Egads that sounds lazy! lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i have spell slots sit cani 5 slow key  kraggs / raident cure   then i use actions window to assist tanks  rabid bear spirit call etc etc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I preannounce heals via a combined announcement/cast hotkey and postannounce debuffs, i.e. I have a special hotkey just for the debuff that only announces.<br />
<br />
I have an ASSIST hotkey and an assist key for somebody - a puller, MT, whatever seems reasonable.  I can pop around to the mob easily enough by targeting a melee group member and hitting ASSIST.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Eluj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I setup alternate keys for my spells using the number pad. Then it's a simple matter of hitting the corresponding number in my spell bank, then when the spells lands hitting the corresponding macro to say %t is ....<br />

6- /book<br />
7- spirit call<br />
8- guild list<br />
9- epic dot<br />
10- sow boots<br />

I have old hotkeys to tell raid or group slow, maloX, cripple, etc. but I dont use them much. I figure they can see what I'm doing or see the effects of it so why bother with extra spam. But that just comes with 3.5 years of working together, we can pretty much predict what everyone else is doing or going to do next.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zyphun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My hotkeys are related to the way I mem my spells...<br />
<br />
My spells are memorized like this...<br />
Canni IV, FA, Malo, Quie, Slow, Crip, (Swap), Heal. <br />
<br />
My hotkeys are set up like this...<br />
1 - Spell slot 5<br />
2 - Spell slot 6<br />
3 - Spell slot 7<br />
4 - Spell slot 8<br />
5 - /rt, /r As you wish, so shall it be...<br />
6 - Canni V<br />
7 - /rs [ %T ] is SLOWed.<br />
8 - /rs [ %T ] is CRIPPLEd.<br />
9 - /rs MALOS is on [ %T ].<br />
10 - /assist<br />
<br />
I've gotten so used to doing my spells just so over the years it's hard to break the habit. I have it set to my quick spells are easy to cast at hot keys 1 - 4. The not as time crutial ones are set up as spells 1 - 4 so I can get any of my spells quickly and just hold down the SHIFT key to get to the first four spells I've mem'd. I try to rely on mouse clicks as little as possible as I am using the mouse most often to target mobs. Hotkey five is my life saver a lot of times, as I use when the buff requests are actually coming in at a sane pace and it saves me from doing /targ over and over.<br />
<br />
On a second page I have 4 addition hotkeys<br />
1 - /corpse<br />
2 - Spell slot 2 (for Invis)<br />
3 - Mass Buff<br />
4 - Spell slot 4 (for Fo7)</div></div><hr />

I have other hotkeys set up in the actions window for other things I may need a hotkey for that i can switch out or just use from the action window when needed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Demisius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I&quot;m pretty lazy with my hotkeys.   My basic layout is:<br />
<br />
Bank 1: 1-8 == Spells 1-8.  It's easy, sue me :P   Yes alt is too much for me !<br />
1:malo<br />
2:quick heal<br />
3:turgurs<br />
4:canny<br />
5:Q<br />
6:FA usually<br />
7/8: Buffs or Dot's<br />
9: Inventory clicky (modrod/booties)<br />
10: Can 5 (No hotkey so I can see when it pops)<br />
Bank 2: Items/abilities<br />
1: Haste BP<br />
2: Malosini Neck<br />
3: Cure Earing<br />
4: Canny (dunno why)<br />
5: Q (same with Q.... )<br />
6: horse<br />
7: Radiant Cure<br />
8: MGB<br />
9/10 forget....<br />
<br />
Bank 3 holds my announces.  They sort of replicate my spell positions.  IE bank1/slot1 is malo, announce is bank3/slot1.   Turgurs is bank1/slot3, announce is bank3/slot3.   This really helps me with the announces because I cast 3 to slow, hit shift 3 and hit 3 again if I don't get a resist message and then hit shift-1 to get back to my default bank.   1/2/3/4 hold my most recently used spells.  Bank 3, 4/5/6 hold other slow announces.<br />
4: %T is SLOWED (He's also mezzed)<br />
5: %T is SLOWED (MA's mob)<br />
6: %T is SLOWED (SA's mob)<br />
<br />
<br />
I just started using the last 3 announces and one other shaman in the guild did too, I think it really helps in some situations.   <br />
<br />
<br />
Well modem finally finished this damn patch, time to go :P</div></div><hr />

note that all the spells in my bank are the drag/dropped spell gems, when i used to use hotkeys to case, i think i saw some lag before the pressing/casting happened, may have just been my eyes playing tricks though.<br />
<br />
i also slow first malo later on typical exp mobs, and don't use a horse, usulaly use f8 or mouse for targeting, and i don't use any announce messages</div></div><hr />

Then second bank is alot of Pet attack and back off commands. With pet hold tied in as well. And most of my Aa skills are on the secong bank as well. Including a no spam Canna 5  <br />
<br />
I tend to cast alot from my Alt keys so I don't completly spam people out. But I get alot more compliments than complaints. And I have found that the complainers normally are not people I enjoy associating with anyways.<br />
<br />
Bank three is Group invite and Camp and Such. Bank 4 is Sense heading and loc and corpse drag stuff  Bank 5 I really dont know. I think raid stuff Announceing a such but I rarely use it. Bank 6 is clickies and Spell book in Shift 6, 6 location. Bank 7 is bear emote hotkeys. :snuffles %t's hand looking for food. :rolls over onto her back so %t can scratch.. :growls at %t... Stuff like that.<br />
<br />
I had a canna hotkey with sit and everything but just got tired of losing control.<br />

When a shaman calls out &quot;resist&quot; you need to be able to target them for 1) heal or 2) to assist then slow his target, I don't see any other way of doing it..

<br />
Much thanks.<br />
<br />
The only one I know of (there might be more) is using pause, for example when I'm lazy and don't feel like chain canni'ing I have this one set up:<br />
<br />
/pause 35, /cast 8<br />
/pause 35, /cast 8<br />
/pause 35, /cast 8<br />
/pause 35, /cast 8<br />
/pause 35, /cast 8<br />
<br />
this way, it casts 5 times in a row. Of course, it fizzles once in a while, but for the most part its fine.<br />
<br />
for some reason, I believe a pause is the only additional command you can have on the same line (no /cast7, /cast8 for example), and the pause HAS to be first, even though logically, the pause occurs after you cast.<br />
<br />
So, now that I think about it, there really isn't any other commands you can put on same line, just a pause command and another regular command.<br />
<br />
I'm almost 100% on this one, I don't get too fancy with the macros, so if I'm wrong sorry to have misled you :)</div></div><hr />

Someone mentioned spell casting of the numpad - is there a way to assign different actions to the numbers on the key pad and the &quot;regular&quot; numbers?</div></div><hr />
