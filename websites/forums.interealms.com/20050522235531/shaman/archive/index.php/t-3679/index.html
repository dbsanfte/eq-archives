<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well it was brought up earlier that the 10% healing penalty that shaman and druids recieve had been removed on test.  Unfortunatly for us, our good cleric friends had a healthy dose of player hate'in for us.  Here are some quotes from out priest breathren.<br />
<br />
These are actual quotes<br />
<br />
I'm a 55 cleric and if I go looking for some exp, I'm damn lucky to find a group in less than 20 min of shouting &quot;55 cleric lfg <br />
<br />
 I see this as the end to my cleric. I already have a heck of a time finding a group <br />
<br />
IMHO, bots should be illegal and addressed in the EULA <br />
<br />
don't expect the cleric to support anything that adds more druids to raids <br />
<br />
I hate two-boxers with a passion <br />
<br />
When was the last time you saw a druid actually *get* something they asked for AND shut up? <br />
<br />
this *potential* change certainly hurts the cleric in his or her most important areas <br />
<br />
I'm not sure how I feel about druids having the best single target instant heal in terms of raw hp/healed <br />
<br />
And my favorite<br />
<br />
Basically I go to mooch exp off the solo'ing shaman. Kind of interesting view of clerical life I have because of it <br />
<br />
I found it a good laugh, hope you did too.  <br />
<br />
PS, all quotes came from actual clerics at http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well it's basically a fact of life now for all healers now. The more powerful classes become in relation to mobs, especially melee, the less healing they need. It hurts even worse for a Cleric because that's basically all they do. There are only a few zones legft where you need a Cleric and even that is debatable. What they really need to do is to make more zones like Cazic, this would help some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yay! I hope the clerics will come to this board and sift out nifty Crucible quotes, like this gem:<br />
<br />
We all know Clerics are gimps and good when you need a rez ! You couldn't pay me to play a Cleric ! Playing a Cleric is like watching two mosquitoes masterbate !<br />
<br />
I mean, just because it was said on the shaman board, all shaman think it, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Lately I've been in plenty of groups where the only reason to have a Cleric was in case someone screwed up and needed a Rez.  Even without Torpor, places like Velks, KC, Chardok or HS have no need of a Cleric for heals if the mobs can be slowed.  Even dealing with mob after mob that HTs for 551 in HS was easy for me with Regrowth and an occasional Sup Heal on the puller.<br />
But it *should* be that way, no one class should be REQUIRED to form a group.<br />
Watching our Cleric get up and melee in Upper Kobolds in Velk's was somewhat amusing.  Couldn't blame him though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have no idea what people mean when they say clerics aren't necessary.  Sheesh, if I go into Chardok, KC, or the Hole as the only healer, I'm hurtin for mana in a heartbeat.<br />
<br />
Maybe you're talking about lvl60 clerics though, and I'm mid-50's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Agreed.  Not like this is some tremendous change though.  10% on what, Chloroplast and Sup Heal?  Mind you, I'm used to going for the most challenging thing the group can do and yeah, no way I'd need a cleric for seb/hs if I had torpor or the Druid has DL but all of these places are considered non-challenging zones now.  <br />
<br />
You give me the option of going bard shaman monk warrior rogue cleric or X + druid and I'm going Cleric all day long and twice on sunday.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>fnord</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Another thread about Clerics? Its kind of hard to buy into the whole &quot;Shutup about Clerics, nobody cares here&quot; arguement when I see yet another one. :cool: <br />
<br />
I think its good to give the other classes better healing power, us Clerics take damage too and sometimes in the heat of battle we often forget to look at our own health because we are so concerned for the lives of our party.<br />
<br />
Clerics will always have a place, and the groups who choose to replace a Cleric with another class because they aren't &quot;needed&quot; as much anymore will simply end up &quot;/auc want to buy rez!&quot;<br />

I see no problems.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps if you had read or shared the whole topic in CONTEXT it would make sense.  Of course my shaman doesnt seem to mind me mooching so what does it matter to anyone else?  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Everybody has their role.  I ran across a cleric soloing very effectively in City of Mist.<br />
<br />
The problem isn't what the classes can and cannot do, it's what people THINK they can and cannot do.  Each class has its versatility, even if you have to look for it.  For shaman, it's just blatantly obvious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">if you move to harder places like juggs in sebilis, CT, the deep and such you'll appreciate a cleric.....no way is shaman healing efficient when stuff hits fast for over 180 and you want flowing xp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">heheheh -<br />
I go with Gloriana.  It only took me about three excerpts to decide the initial post was a carefuly controlled presentation.  I do NOT believe it represents a majority opinion of the shaman on this board.<br />
<br />
CALI - This board does not have an &quot;anti-cleric&quot; tilt.  Almost all shaman want to be able to keep up with heals in exp camps better, but almost all of the serious discussion concedes that clerics pay a steep price in exchange for their great healing abilities.  We - at least the posts I identify with - think shaman should heal better than shaman have in the past.  Not better than clerics do - or even as well as clerics do, minus CHeal.  just better than we have in the past.  <br />
<br />
(side note:  it is a running joke for shaman to ask for CHeal - no one takes it seriously here.  often tied to wanting a 1200 pt dd, lol )<br />
<br />
Shaman are, and imo should be, very versatile.  One of the advertised versatilities has always been healing skills.  I never understood why a shaman casting SupHeal would heal only 85.7% as many hp as a cleric casting the same spell.  (cleric heals for X+5% and shaman heals for X-10%;  ratio is 105 to 90.  pretty big difference, without considering the cleric gets gheal and supheal at a much earlier level than the shaman does.)  this change means we heal nearly as well as a cleric, with the spells we have in common - up to SupHeal.  Cleric also gets much better heals, which is as it should be, imo.<br />
<br />
no raid will be saying they don't need another cleric, because they have a shaman with improved heals from this patch.  a group pushing its limits will still need a cleric.  a group grinding exp at a camp regarded as very safe for their level will continue to be able to do so without a cleric.  or a shaman, or a druid.  in that case, any of the priest classes should be able to keep up with the damage from the mobs.<br />
<br />
Clerics should remain the best healers, and they will remain essential for raiding.   The two other priest classes should be able to do reasonable healing, as well.</div></div><hr />

It was patch day, someone told me to go troll around on the cleric boards if i was bored.  And I found some funny little gems for quotes here and there, thought id share.  I posted the link at the bottom of my post if you all wanted to waste time reading through the mundane crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">People who don't want Clerics in their group don't deserve to have them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Xalbus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Personally, as a shaman I don't WANT to be the prime healer for a group. My talents in group are so under-utilized. I get into groups where I try and do my Shammy thing to help speed up the kills (a good EB or 2 where it counts, a slow here and there etc and the mobs drop like flies) and I get yelled at and told to sit and med. Now if there is a cleric in group my response is simple. Let the cleric sit and med and heal. Dammit Jim, I am a shaman not a Dr! Shammies are in my experience, both as one and in groups as a chanter, under appreciated. Shammies are one of the most powerful classes in the game. There isn't much we can't do short of porting (and even that will be a lesser issue once the Planes of Power is released )and rezzing. We melee, DoT, DD, heal, buff, debuff, use pets I mean we are monsters on the battle field. Stop trying to jam me into a mold that wasn't made for me! I am not a poor mans cleric.<br />
<br />
As for the healing change. Don't clerics automatically get a bonus to it? I coulda sworn I read somewhere that clerics already get a bonus to their heal spell so it basically changes nothing other than we can heal 30 more points than before with Gheal etc.<br />
<br />
This game is about diversity. Every class is useful in certain situations. Hell we should just petion Verant to make a new class to make everyone happy<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>TalgurenXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Many exp spots become trivial for healing when you acquire Torpor.   Especially with 40 to low 50 level mobs.   Torpor has it's limitations for healing melee as you don't necessarily want your MT to be doing less damage during the fight.  Torpor makes up for this by essentially making it very difficult for you to run out of mana.  So slows and the occasional mid-fight sup. heal / chloroblast are no problem at all.  Torpor + Turgur's &gt; almost everything.</div></div><hr />

hhmm, I actually do waste my time reading through that mundane crap, daily.  I know where you got the quotes, who said it, and what it is in reference to.  It does look mean and trolly out of context but as Gloriana the Great already pointed out, that can be done on ANY message board.  Of course I also read this mundane shaman crap daily so perhaps its just me thats an aberation?<br />
<br />
I did happen to agree that non-cleric priests needed a healing upgrade, even greater then removing the 10% penalty as well as possibly a new heal spell.  Clerics still have the 5% bonus but it doesnt solve or make any problems for them.  <br />
<br />
I do not believe it is a class that is evil, I believe people do that quite well no matter what class they are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The 10% will not effect clerics at all.  If your a Torporless Shaman you can't heal a group and you need a cleric.  If I am doing CT or Juggs I want a cleric mainly because i cant stand fighters who gripe everytime torpor is on them lol.  Also because even a Torporing Shaman couldnt heal effectively enough at one of these camps.<br />
<br />
However for your normal XP group?  I can slow, and heal for 4 tanks in say your normal seb camp with no downtime at all.  This I think is the reason some clerics are upset.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hey don't get me wrong, I don't have anything against Clerics, they are always welcome in any group I'm in. Saves me from trying to be the Prime healer. I just couldn't play a Cleric, I tried one and hated every second of it before I switched to my Shaman. They are boring to play, but that's just my opinion. What do Clerics do other than, buff, heal, rez, sit ? Occasional nuke ? <br />
After playing a Shaman, Clerics are very disappointing..no SoW, No DoTs, No Pets, No cool Spears, No invis, No Slows, No Canni, Can't solo very well and especially no Cleric race has a tail ! <br />
My opinion certainly is not shared by every Shaman on this board but that's what makes this board so cool. We are all Shaman but, are all very individual even though we share the same class. <br />

&quot;We are also looking at some changes to help to make clerics be a little more well-rounded, along with addressing some concerns put forth by druids and shamans. Those ideas are still in the development stage, and we’ll talk more about them when we get done looking at the healing changes.&quot;<br />

I have a feeling clerics are going to be more than repaid back when for what they've lost by our 10% boost in healing powers. Hmm... remember back when clerics had their nukes increased in damage and all the wizards were getting all upset?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">For the clerics reading this board:  How the heck can we screw you getting groups, because we can now heal for 40 some more points with Chloroblast?   Please, spare me.   The healing penalty should have never been.   What was the point of it?  We're given healing spells that is suppose to heal a certain amount, but didn't.  Doesn't make sense to me.   If there never were a penalty in the first place, then there wouldn't have been a need for this hoopla.  Remember, you (clerics) still retain the 5% bonus.<br />
<br />
And I might add, only for those that have issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Katyana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">In my ideal group setting, I always include a Cleric. I seem to find myself in too many situations where I can not keep up with the healing demands and I have become rather attached to getting rezzed when I die. Not to mention my addiction to GAego. <br />
The complaint I am starting to have with many Clerics is the use/misuse of Horses. I do not use a horse at this time, but it appears to me that a Cleric on a horse must dismount to &quot;duck&quot; a Cheal and several Clerics I have grouped with have failed to DL or Remedy a quickly deteriorating MA in time. I do relish the added utility to the Shaman's role that the Back-up Healer responsibility grants, but I am not comfortable taking over all healing except Cheals. Perhaps I simply do not understand horses well enough to suggest that they are indeed responsible for this trend I mention and if anyone has some practical experience as a Cleric on a horse I would like to be &quot;set straight&quot; if my guess is incorrect. As with any class, the individuals who have mastered the characters abilitiies and employ good strategy when they play make the best group mates. I bow to all Clerics who call DA's and use them wisely. That is one ability that can really help the Shammy out when things get uncomfortable.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I doubt any clerics are getting upset over the removal of the penalty, that's a drop in the old hp bucket. What Clerics get upset over are the silly requests by some for complete heal or other heals where they can even more easily replace a cleric than has already happened in a lot of exp camps. If you take their heals or in other ways replace them because you dont feel they SHOULD be needed in exp groups, then you need to give them something in return. Or else no one will be a Cleric. Because all they truly offer is heals if things go right and a res when things go wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">How conveniently they forget that they are an essential element in AE groups.

<br />
Nothing.<br />
<br />
When you screw up, someone is dead and most likely irritated. Generally you will be blamed whe someone dies, whether you screwed up or not.<br />
<br />
You will hear melees yell because you cast CH too early.<br />
<br />
You will hear melees yell because you cast CH too late.<br />
<br />
You will be called to run across continents to rez people. Sometimes you will die going to rez someone else. Often times, you aren't compensated for the loss of your time.<br />
<br />
You can barely melee a light blue, and if you get attacked by anything more than a light blue without any offensive spells up you had better have remembered to bind.<br />
<br />
You keep people alive and you bring people back from the dead, nothing more, nothing less. Every now and then you'll come across the Cleric who thinks s/he's a wizard or thinks s/he's a warrior. Generally, these get deleted by about level 30 or they spend alot of time soloing in undead zones (I don't see the point in being a Cleric if thats what you do though).<br />
<br />
Being a Cleric is either very exciting or its very boring. Most of the time, its very boring. But its never useless, I would never delete my Cleric. I like the Shaman, but Cleric is always going to be my main toon.<br />
<br />
The only change I can see making to the Cleric is to get rid of that idiotic AE spell ('quake line) and replace it with an undead AE. It would make much more sense anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Konnen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Zorlac,  <br />
<br />
Where did you get the idea that clerics are an essential element to AE group?  Any priest class can participate in an AE group and keep up the heals.  Hell, I've seen 4 wizards and a shammy perform just fine in HS, and the xp was a flowin'.<br />
<br />
whatever...<br />
<br />
----------------------<br />
<br />
I am often amazed at some of the requests that various classes submit as 'balancing' to their class.  The druids get rapped alot for their requests, but let's also remember that they aren' t the only class that thinks they suck because xyz.<br />
<br />
When I chose to play a cleric, I understood that as part of my selection, I would gain certain abilities and have certain disadvantages.  When I chose my shaman, I also understood where most of the strengths and weaknesses lay.  With both classes, I strove to overcome the weaknesses and disadvantages.  <br />
<br />
While many people here say that playing a cleric is boring, my experience was quite different.  I *enjoyed and had tremendous fun* playing a cleric.   The same goes for my shaman, I enjoy playing the shaman but his abilities are so much different than a cleric.  Maybe the difference is that I realized early on that it's not the class that is fun but the people you are playing with.  If you find the game mindlessly boring then maybe..just maybe..it's not the game but the company you are keeping, or YOU.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying don't make suggestions to improve the class.  Far from it, finding problems that are actual problems and NOT class limitations, is important.  But many times I have seen people suggesting increase this or give that or heaven forbid, nerf them... I sadly shake my head and realize that people aren't in the game to have fun but to fulfill some ego trip that ultimately will ruin the game for everyone.</div></div><hr />

Yeah and when something goes wrong the shaman will pull the ressurect spell out of his arse and rez the chanter or the wizard or himself.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">They could give clerics 1 hit point and take away every other spell and ability they have except for Res, and they would still be the most powerful class in game, by far.  Of course, they'd also be very very boring and very muleable!  You could pretty much say the same for CH, though it isn't really muleable on raids.<br />
<br />
It is hard to balance a class that has the two most powerful abilities in the game *by light-years*, the class that the entire end-game is designed around, the *only* class that is essential for the vast majority of raids.<br />
<br />
Not saying that they shouldn't get some fun stuff, just recognizing that it is a delicate situation.  Scissors-rock-paper class balance is hard enough when you have classes that are (on a 1-10 scale) something like:<br />
<br />
soloability: 7<br />
raid value: 4<br />
xp group value: 8<br />
utility value: 3<br />
 or something like that, to compare with one another.<br />

soloability 2<br />
raid value: 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000<br />

They are just so obliteratingly more powerful than anyone else at what they do.  There are no other non-replaceable classes (unless you run into a locked door, heh). <br />
<br />
There needs to be some balance, and the only tool that Verant has ever and will ever use to balance anything in EQ is adding a nice, healthy dose of mind-numbing tedium.</div></div><hr />

The biggest problem I have with clerics is the average type of player who plays them ends up knowing nothing about the game and yet feels important and knowledgable.  Yet they know nothing but heals.  Until they twink and level up the twinks they aren't very good players.  Cleric is easy to play, too easy.  Only hard things are moving around or soloing . . . but with the demand on clerics, a cleric who is soloing is very rare.  <br />
<br />
Some people have said CT needs a cleric.  This is *mostly* true.  My planks group did just fine the other night for 5 hours with a 60 druid instead of the cleric.  Granted the druid was an excellent player, and this made a huge difference.  And Granted that our main tank was a paladin.  But I think this made the situation worse while better at the same time.  The paladin, without defensive, and with inferior defensive and offensive skills to a warrior made the job of healing more difficult.  But him being along provided a possibility for a rez for the other groupies.  <br />
<br />
But it's really not an issue.  I'd rather have had a cleric, thanks.  I was missing aego the entire time and that wasn't pleasant.  Sides, I had to provide too much healing and couldn't dish out as much dmg as usual.  The group was overall slower exp.  <br />
<br />
Cleric is usually better than a different healing class.  I don't think this is by accident, and I don't think it's a bad thing.  I also don't think cleric is a bad class.  It's just not a class that fits my personality.  I don't like being main healer.  It's too much responsibility.  I'd rather be the one needing the rez than the one who has to run across five continents to rez me.</div></div><hr />

I don't have Sup Heal yet, (only 49) but man do I not like being the 'healer' in any group. I'd rather find one with a cleriX anyday, cuz that's how much better they are at it.<br />
<br />
I don't see how cleriX can't find groups imo, mebbie they're just looking in the wrong spots. I know our last raid was canceled cuz we didn't have any clerix going. They are needed, Shams can heal, but by far it's not our 'specialty'. Slowin' bebuffin' dot'n ... man i love it when I get to play that role, cuz it's what we do best as a class.. not heal. lol<br />

btw awesome quotes, lol. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Feias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">It isn't so much the 10% that clerics are up in arms about if they are at all.  It was the ideas from Druids and ideas conceived that were along the lines of 2000+ hp instant heals given to Shaman or Druids.  10% isn't anything.  Upgrading a 500pt heal to 2000+ is a big deal that would put Clerics out of groups due to their lack of utility outside of CH.<br />
<br />
Clerics are needed for raids.  That isn't the point.  The point is that in many zones (most especially the ones most frequented and considered the exp zones) a Druid or a Shaman can easily fill their role and are often prefered due to their other abilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I guess I am old school, but in any dangerous zone I want a cleric along. Maybe at level 60 the other classes get so powerful that cleric healing is not needed, but prior to that I have a very hard time acting as sole healer, buffer, debuffer and snarer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Konnen: &quot;To Zorlac, Where did you get the idea that clerics are an essential element to AE group? Any priest class can participate in an AE group and keep up the heals. Hell, I've seen 4 wizards and a shammy perform just fine in HS, and the xp was a flowin'.&quot;<br />
<br />
LOL doesn't seem strong enough here. If only we had AE stuns, rezzes, better quick heals and better HP buffs you'd be right. Clerics are a core element, junior. The safe AE group is 3 wizzies (epic'd pulling), 2 chanters and 1 cleric. Shaman are not well suited to traditional AE groups, sad fact. <br />
<br />
Konnen: &quot;whatever... &quot;<br />
<br />
True dat~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Hmmm unless that shaman has quickbuff3. Because then a 3 sec Torpor is prolly one of the best heal spells in an ae group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, it's always been that way. In an easy zone (at any level) you've never needed a cleric. There aren't many high level zones that are easy enough for a druid to handle healing. ... even if you added an enchanter to slow the mobs, and we all know enchanters don't go anywhere w/o a cleric! :p  <br />
<br />
A shaman on the other hand, even w/o torpor, has a wider range of places where he  can cover heals but i don't think you'll find many people here that want to be the only healer in a good 6 person group. <br />
<br />
I tend to group with either a 59 or 60 cleric often. Since I don't have torpor, Cel Elixir is still a godly spell for me. <br />
It's better than C3 for giving me mana and who among us doesn't like Aego? Best thing about having a cleric in the group though, with a tough pull incoming I know I don't need to worry about healing along with getting the pull under control. Catching agro after a few resisted slows and still having to slow 2 mobs with one beating on you and the main tank going down in HP is just going to go a lot smoother with a cleric along. Not to mention the convenience of having a rez if something goes badly wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Banthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">one point you might want to consider is that with mudflation, total HPs are increasing. <br />
<br />
1. a while ago with the Warrior Re-Balance remember that ? back in the day before everyone and their granny with 6 AA points could crit. when warrior got crits, beserker mode, innate MR, and MORE HPs; all non-CH capable healers were made less effective.<br />
<br />
2.  before +50 and +75 hps items were rare, now there are +125 hps items.... and its only going one way.<br />
 <br />
now combine points 1 &amp; 2 and you have healers with less efficient heals ... re-dressing this somewhat is fair, easier infact that introducing heaven forbid a new heal spell.<br />
<br />
heal spells are more than just total HPs healed; cast time is all important as well.<br />
<br />
IMO this change makes NO difference to whether you have a cleric or shaman or druid in your group than last week.<br />
<br />
people just love to bitch .... strewth.<br />
