/e gulps...um Glori - 1) What was your major? 2) Did you ever live in University Towers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Double majored in political science and French.  I always lived on East campus.   I actually landed a job my sophomore year managing the convenience stores on campus (Bragaw, Syme, Quad, Tunnel) and got free room and a Gold card (meal card).  I lived in Syme until I graduated. (I know some folks think that its lame to live on campus the whole time, but my room was FREE and since I was paying for my own school it was a blessing)<br />
<br />
Oh wow, I went and looked up my old dorm, they have a model of the room I lived in for two years.  I had one of the big corner rooms in Syme, really one of the best dorm rooms on campus.  My senior year, my roommate graduated in December and I had it all to myself my last semester...bliss, I say!<br />

Wow, cool, I lived in Gold for 3.5 years, just across the Triad from Syme!<br />
<br />
Of course I graduated 9 years before you, but what the hey.  Gold, Syme, and Welch never change.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Wow, cool! So you know what I'm talking about when I say I had one of the great corner rooms in Syme!  I actually lived all over East campus, started off in Welch, second half of my freshman year moved to Berry.  Lived in Bagwell my sophomore year until I moved to Syme.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yeahup I know those rooms... I shared one my last two years at NCSU, they were fantastic compared to my first semester in Metcalfe.  You put a loft in one of those big corner rooms with the 12' ceilings and you had a two-story luxury apartment.<br />
<br />
Hey, I'll tell you a secret: I was an NCSU spy at UNC!  I went to UNC for two years of grad school 1983-1985, but I still played in the pep band at NCSU because all my friends were there...</div></div><hr />
