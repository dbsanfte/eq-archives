<br />
If anyone else has a good tip for making quick cash to get you that JBB or Fungi a bit sooner then feel free to post it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you want to make it really fast go to the Bazaar and buy low and sell high.  It's kinda of an evil thing to do, but you willl make money fast :)  Infact, thats how I made my last 20k that I had.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Crug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I see.  THat sounds like a plan.  I will try it once i get bored leveling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>glydor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I understand the idea of buy low sell high but i have trouble finding a popular item that would be easy to sell, any past experiences with peticular items?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">buy low sell high! you just need to be observant of the going prices</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Prices vary from server to server, so just look at a niche market and know your stuff.<br />
<br />
It is not guaranteed, you can get stuck with white elephants. So make sure you can afford to eat your mistake.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>uglytobone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Visit other class websites and find out what equipment and spells are popular with those classes. Especially good are the posts that list progressively better equipment by slot or effect. Look for posts that ask for upgrades-- sometimes people will list item prices.<br />
<br />
Print the lists or make your own depending on what you can afford to purchase at the moment. Spend a little time daily noting the prices of items on the list until you get a feel for the &quot;normal&quot; price of the items.<br />
<br />
Specializing in about 25-50 items is easy and only takes minutes to check.<br />
<br />
Other tips:<br />
-- Become familiar with prices vendors pay for items. You can make a quick 10-50pp per item buying from other traders and selling to vendors.<br />
-- Spend a small amount of money on cheap charisma items so you always get the best vendor buy price<br />
-- Sell sow potions<br />
-- Buy bat wings and bone chips from vendors and sell as a trader.<br />
-- Buy highly sought trade skill items from vendors and resell as a trader. <br />
-- Periodically check prices on Earring of Solstice quest ingredients<br />
-- When not playing, always have your trader up if possible.<br />
-- If you see a good deal on an item you want for yourself, buy it and set an unreasonable price on it. If someone buys it, you make a tidy little profit. If not, use it. But be careful here-- there have been times when I was bittersweetly disappointed to find out that the item actually sold.<br />
-- If other people are selling at a price below your breakeven price, set your price much higher until the lower priced item sells, then reset your price to a more reasonable price.<br />
-- Sell your items as quick as possible by slightly underpricing other traders. If an item is taking too long to sell consider taking a small loss to get rid of it.<br />
-- Keep an eye on WTS auction stuff. Some people just want to get in and out of the Bazaar as fast as possible.</div></div><hr />
