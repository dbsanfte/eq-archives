<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>tribblestump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been looking at some of the PoK focus effect items, and they seem pretty cool. I was wondering if anyone has done any of them, and if so how hard where they? Are they worth the time? What are you thoughts on a troll wearing things that are called &quot;Fine Antique&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you are under 49, and have easy access to the requisite items, they are well worth doing - decent stats and level 2 focus effects.<br />
<br />
Especially the Ring, with its Mana Preservation 2 (which will save mana on every leve 1 to 44 spell you cast). The AC, HP, and Mana aren't bad either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">These seem to be pretty easy quests for the quality of item.]<br />
<br />
I did the finely cut, diamond mask quest quite easily, and I do like the spell haste II effect.<br />
<br />
I'm doing the antique ring quest next time I have a few hours to play, looks easy enough and I'd like to see how manna pres. works out.<br />
<br />
I mean the quests are free, so what's the downside?<br />

Good Luck<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>tribblestump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">just did the mask quest twice, for Tribble and my ranger. I LOVE THIS MASK!!!! For my ranger it makes snare and fuzzy fear cast at 1.7 sec instead of 2, very helpful</div></div><hr />
