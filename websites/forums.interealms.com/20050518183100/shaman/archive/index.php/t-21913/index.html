<br />
What do you think of multicaster-spells?<br />
<br />
I mean, 6 shamans in a raid, 5 cast the charging part of the spell to the mob and 1 casts the executing part of the spell.<br />
<br />
The first 5 casts don't do a thing, but the last cast makes the spell cast more powerfull. <br />
<br />
Now, imagine a multi-shaman malo (-30*num_shamans to resists)<br />
Or a multi-whateverclass nuke (best_nuke_dmg*num_shamans*1.1)<br />
or multi-shaman slow (adds a -10 to resist-check per shaman)</div></div><hr />

There is a ton of ways to hand out raid utility. Clustering multiple players into one ultra-shaman is not one I want to ever see. I do not want to tape myself to other people and then watch them have fun, I want to have fun myself.</div></div><hr />

I'm sensing you don't like the idea..........<br />
<br />
:)<br />
<br />
I agree with you, it's not the way I want to play my shaman, although I do give credit to the poster for thinking up ideas and putting them out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">dood it worked for Voltron!<br />
I preferred the 5 lions over the 20 or so cars and planes.  :)<br />
<br />
Works for Power Rangers too.   :D  Though they both have the same issue.  Singly they get beat up.  United they kick butt.  And if they get their butt kicked united, make up some new name and look.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">This exact idea was called chants and it was something they though about doing, ie more shamans doig the same thing to increase the effectiveness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">That does absolutely nothing to solve the group issues of shaman, and I think you'll find thats where our biggest weaknesses lie. Not an idea I really like.</div></div><hr />

It would be sweet if the shaman morphed into the legs/arms, body, and head of a gigantic anima spell effect thing and then morphed back after the spell was cast.   :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Lol, 20 shaman merging into a bear the size of a dragon, that would be worth the price of admission to see. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />

Wonder Twin Shaman Powers- ACTIVATE! <br />
Form of A GIANT BEAR! <br />
Shape of AN ICE SWORD!<br />
<br />
The Giant bear then picks up the Ice Sword and WHACKS the begeeezus outta the mob!<br />
<br />
(note, no offense meant to the original poster, I couldnt resist. Its a reasonalbe idea, just not applicable)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>trolebus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hahahaha! <br />
I didn't think of all those toons when I wrote the idea. I took the idea from the assasin in Diablo2 (charging blows, then finnishing blows). The gostbusters thing is the most acurate to what I meant anyway (don't cross the beams!).<br />
<br />
<br />
I do not think adding more bots to raids is a good thing. I do not think forcing the raid leader to fiddle with class numbers to make sure you can use certain effects is a good thing. I do not think having players be controlled by other players is a good thing. I do not think being rewarded for not playing is a good thing. I do not think not being able to play yourself because someone else remote-controlling you is better for the raid is a good thing.<br />
<br />

<br />
I think you didn't understand my idea exactly. You will have to do the same if not on the boss mob. This is not auto-cast. I mean, now what do you do if you are not one of the 2 or 3 first shamans? This way, 4th shaman and the later can do something diferent in a raid. <br />
<br />
I understand the problem with bots. This idea would probably lead to an increase in shaman bots just for &quot;charging&quot; certain spells.<br />
<br />
I dont understand the remote-control thing. YOU cast the carging spell. YOU decide if you want to be in that multi-cast or not. <br />
<br />
Also, number of shaman for a given spell is not hard-coded in my idea. Any multi-cast spell could be done by 2 or more shamans.<br />
Example:<br />
SHAMAN1 casts &quot;Malosing aura&quot; (charges -30 vs all resists)<br />
SHAMAN2 casts &quot;Malosing aura&quot; (charges -30 vs all resists)<br />
SHAMAN3 casts &quot;Malosing aura&quot; (charges -30 vs all resists)<br />
SHAMAN4 casts &quot;Malosing aura&quot; (charges -30 vs all resists)<br />
SHAMAN5 casts &quot;Malosing bolt&quot; (-120 vs all resists) (-30*4)<br />
<br />
If Shaman3 doesnt cast his aura, then the last cast will be for -90.<br />
<br />
Anyway. It is just a crazy idea. :) <br />
Have fun!<br />
<br />
P.S. The giant Bear the size of a dragon could be a funny thing to see. And CAPTAIN SHAMAN sounds now like a nice name if I play CoH anytime soon :)</div></div><hr />
