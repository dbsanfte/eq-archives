<br />
1st october 2004<br />
<br />
<br />
12PM <br />
<br />
zoned into Wall of Slaughter and went to work forming a group. Loving the expansion! Slow mitigation in some zones removed which is such a breath of fresh air. Nice to have the abilities I worked hard for to actually work - if fizzles and resists were not bad enough now we got partial slows - Good Lord, who thinks up such things?<br />
<br />
12:30PM <br />
<br />
Group formed. Not many people in the zone, someone suggests hunting Girplans so off we go. Groups seems chatty and everyone is having fun. We discuss the expansion and we all agree that it is very good.<br />
<br />
One group member exclaims that there must be something wrong because we are having so much fun, we all chuckle and agree.<br />
<br />
Helping Druid to heal the tank.<br />
<br />
2:30PM <br />
<br />
GM spams serverwide message saying that some zones are being updated and reset, including WoS, no information on when this will occur or for how long.<br />
<br />
3:30PM <br />
<br />
Disconnected.<br />
<br />
4:00PM <br />
<br />
I log back in and go to work forming a new group, some of my old group is here so we hook up. We head up ramp, hard left along the wall. Feran Swiftclaw is up! Cleric and I full mana, everyone buffed - we pull.<br />
<br />
Hmmm, what is this? Partially successful?! Whaaaa? <br />
<br />
Druid cannot keep up on heals I try to heal tank but his hitpoints are dropping so fast my heals are like a drop in the ocean.<br />
<br />
Mobs seems to be zapping all our mana, no DoT icon though.<br />
<br />
Oom. Feran at 54%.<br />
<br />
4:05PM<br />
<br />
Sitting in PoK with the rest of my group, guess I better head back and get everyone rezzed and buffed.<br />
<br />
6:30PM<br />
<br />
Getting pissed off now, group has fallen apart several times and had 4 seperate corpse recoveries. <br />
<br />
Mobs seems to have had their attack rating/damage increased, I got a resist on a normal mob and was quaded extremely fast - my 5.5K HP disappeared in 2 swipes.<br />
<br />
Corpses everywhere in WoS now.<br />
<br />
Going to log, not having fun anymore. <br />
<br />
10:30PM<br />
<br />
Browse EQshaman.com - I notice some Shamans on the messageboard that think partial slows are acceptable. Makes me sad to see how far we have fallen and how brainwashed some of us have become.<br />
<br />
I ponder the response if a Cleric could only partially heal a tank or Necromancer partially Dotting a mob.<br />
<br />
Epilogue for the Day<br />
<br />
When I see my slow is mitigated it is like a slap in the face. I am not sure how to describe it but it makes me angry and sad at the same time. Fizzles and resists are bad enough now a 3rd restriction.<br />
<br />
Maybe Sony is, at some point, going to add an AA ability that increases slow ability? Such as first rank removing mostly, 2nd rank removing partial and 3rd rank removing all slow restrictions.<br />
<br />
They seem to add AA's to fix stuff nowadays. Doesn't make me feel any better, in 30 minutes they destroyed the fun me and 5 people were having.<br />
<br />
Forming a group in WoS is hard enough but now we have to be even more picky. To tank a named in WoS your going to need a big tank and most big tanks group with fellow guild members or leave a group at the drop of a hat just because they can. <br />
<br />
When slow mitigation was taken out I was able to group with my friend, SK, who could tank. Now his HP drops so fast it is not possible to group with him in WoS.<br />
<br />
Your also going to need a good cleric which means more time LFG or forming a group.<br />
<br />
This game sickes me sometimes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vulash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't mind partial slows on boss mobs.  Lets face it an encounter is tuned assuming it has a shaman slow on it.  If they decide x boss is going to be slowable then they up its attack rate or atk rating or min hit or max hit or quad v triple ect.  So the occasional immune I can deal with, and even though mitigation lowers the difference between us and other slowers raiders will still want shaman there to slow.<br />
<br />
Now that I've said that.  I agree with you 100% on xp mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't really care if they mitigate slow, or remove it entirely from the game.  <br />
<br />
What I do care about, however, is that we have not received any boost in any spell area to compensate.  <br />
<br />
We haven't received any significant boosts in either buffs/dmg/healing/debuffs that aren't normal power increases expansion to expansion.  <br />
<br />
Healing catching up to druid or cleric? Nope.  Falling behind in terms of pure hp healed.<br />
<br />
Dmg increased relative to similar classes?  Nope, our closes dot class, the necro, got a large boost in power over us with their new curse.  <br />
<br />
Buffs better in any way?  Well, now this is a debate I suppose.  They did change a few things to increase stat caps, and a couple % increase buffs, rather than only stats.  So, overall, our buff line did improve in a new way.  Is that improvement significant?  Enough to counter the continuing nerf to slow?  No way.  <br />
<br />
Chanters got a new haste with:  chance to critical hit(20) on it. Our only means to increase crits is our AA hot (which btw won't stack with our own buffs atm...sweet).   <br />
<br />
Ignoring stat increasers until someone proves in a parse that they mean something.  So we are left with:<br />
<br />
1.  7% avoidance mod (agi buff)<br />
2.  5% dmg mod (diaku buff)<br />
3.  5% dmg mod haste buff (anyone know what lvl haste?)<br />
4.  10% dmg mod FA<br />
<br />
Thats it.  That is the new spell line changes that are different from what we had before.  Everything else is a % increase of the exact same spells.  <br />
<br />
So, our slow gets mitigated from 75% to about 30%. We lose 45% slow in other words.<br />
We get in return 27% (7,5,5,10) worth of stuff.  But its worse than that, because the above items aren't % increase to damage, its a modifier of some sort.   It will not take a 100 hp hit and make it a 110 hp hit in other words.  <br />
<br />
I guess I'll have to wait and see after I get all the new spells, and then I can do a group dmg parse before and after.  Like (made up):<br />
<br />
Mob X 500dps<br />
<br />
If mob X slowed 75% does 7500 dmg to a tank over 1 min fight before slow nerf.<br />
<br />
now with mitigation<br />
Mob X slowed 25% does 22,500 dmg to a tank over 1 min fight<br />
<br />
IF, and only IF, after getting all the new buffs, a group is able to kill that mob in 30 seconds, thereby preventing 15,000 in damage, will I say that SOE has done their job and rightly compensated us.</div></div><hr />

Cant something be done about this? This isnt his forum and him linking to it is not legal right? I mean didnt we go through this before and he changed it?<br />
<br />
Reality is, he is using this forum to gather traffic for his site.<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
<br />
Feedbacked it on his site, but the stupid thing is broke. :(<br />
<br />
***Edit**<br />
<br />
Actualy i think he just made it so you can post this boards name. If you leave out Shaman's Crucible you can post.<br />
<br />
F'd up no?<br />
<br />
Anyone have the webmasters e-mail ? Im sensing a mission forming.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
&quot;so what level do yu get yur new slow?&quot;<br />
<br />
and when i tell them we dont get a new slow (the aoe thingy dont count... 18 secs - uhuh great) theyre very shocked.<br />
<br />
the other thing i find myself doing now is pressing my slow key harder just in case that it may slow the mobs more, desperation strikes!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It's actually screwed code on his feedback page.  Anything with ' in it causese it to barf back SQL at you.<br />

Despite the fact that named are now partially slowable in WOS, I can still duo them with a ranger in bazaar gear as a tank :)<br />

Internet files are public domain. Anyone can link to anything.<br />
<br />
It is considered 'polite' to distinguish between internal and external links, but it is not required.<br />
<br />
It is considered decietful to present external links as internal (like within a frameset), but that's not going on here. It's a simple link to the Crucible, just not identified as external in any way.<br />
<br />
And no, it was never changed.<br />

I think there are better things to get worked up over.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, I find that very hard to believe. Before nerf, yes, not now. They quad for like 700's how the hell you gonna keep a Baazar Ranger alive duoing? <br />
<br />
It's impossible. I would like someone to prove me wrong - Shaman healing a bazaar ranger on Feran Swiftclaw...</div></div><hr />

After the nerf, 1 mob dead, me at 50% mana, and both of us pissed.  I feedbacked a few times, but I know nothing will be done of it.  It is sad to see people excited for once only to have it snatched away in an instant, or in this case, a patch.</div></div><hr />

Maybe WoS is different than RCoD.  My RNG friend is Time+ geared, and what killed us was the rabid little doggie's proc.  Having this mob slightly slowed is a killer because of the proc.  I guess I have to go back to crippling mobs to help reduce their procs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Named Snake was a total gimp when it was fully slowable.  We haven't tried it since SOE re-introduced slow mitigation.  I also noticed that a few mobs see through invis now.  I never saw that before - maybe I was lucky before.  /shrugs<br />
<br />
Just pisses me off that there was a zone in which hardly no one xp'ed in.  It was quiet and relaxing just to hang back kill some mobs with the occassional named to unwind from a night of raiding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Rekcim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">You don't think that it was stupid that ANY tank could tank 2+ mobs in WoS??  A 6k tank should not be able to fight in a high level zone like that.  I mean this is a high end zone for 66+ min..  Yet I see level 65 bazaar geared tanks doing just fine here.  The loot/exp here is too good for any gimpy geared alt to be able to walk in and form any ragtag group and kill named after named.  I mean it was as easy as BoT for gods sakes.<br />
<br />
  I am not for nerfng slow, but I am all for making WoS a tougher zone.  No way some of the groups/people I have seen in there had ANY business being there.  It was like a bunch of kids on a field trip going nuts. BTW, if mobs do hit harder now, slow will even be that much more needed.  As it was you didn't even really need to slow the mobs there.  I can see the benefits of having such a great reward for little risk, but EQ hasn't lasted 5 yrs. by making stuff real easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I mean it was as easy as BoT for gods sakes.<br />
<br />
<br />
So what if its easy as bot, as a general rule I avoid popular places like bot/wos but where they hell are all of those people supposed to go when they ding 66? Can't stay in bot anymore so there needs to be a new gimp zone for people with ass gear or a few morons in the group.</div></div><hr />
