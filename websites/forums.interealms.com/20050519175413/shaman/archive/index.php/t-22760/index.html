<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It has been some time since our original list of 'Class Problems' was supplied to SOE. I understand that we were given the vague response of 'being evaluated' etc.<br />
<br />

<br />
1. Fix Shaman healing! We need larger, more efficient single target blast heals to deal with GoD mobs as well as group heals (perhaps group HoT is more in line with our class) to help in raid situations (MGB Option would be very helpful). [currently being evaluated] <br />
2. Improve shaman DPS and burst DPS. [currently being evaluated] <br />
3. AE Malos or lose the insane recast delay on Malos. [new item] <br />
4. Make FA less of a hassle, 25 minute duration, 5 second recast. [new item] <br />
5. An upgrade or addition to Cannibalization, allowing (at the same ratio), greater or more frequent conversions of HP to Mana. [currently being evaluated] <br />
6. Add direct combat effects to all of our level 60+ stat buffs. [new item] <br />
7. Reduce DoT aggro! [new item] <br />
8. Endurance regen buff. [currently being evaluated] <br />
9. Reduce the cost of alchemy components. [currently being evaluated] <br />
10. MGB Shrink. [currently being evaluated]<br />
<br />
But since you have a 'backdoor key' Sudedor,  have you heard if there has been any action from developers regarding these points?<br />
<br />
Any information however small will give us at least a glimmer of hope for the Shaman class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We, like you, are still waiting for this new list to be addressed.  As soon as we have a response on the new list, I'll post it.<br />
<br />
And no, we've not even been given a timetable on it.<br />
<br />
Unofficially, I'd guess we're probably looking at two weeks before we should even hope to see anything.  That is however merely an opinion at this point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just a point you've likely already raised with SoE Sud, but as a show of faith, I hope they release at least SOME class rebalancing changes before the OoW release.  Releasing balance changes as part of a &quot;new&quot; expansion is seriously lame and I'm sure will turn more people off of EQ and all other SoE products.  Why pay for something that should by all rights be in the game already?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Lol, it's not a matter of faith, it's a matter of selling Omens.  And my guess is they have us exactly where they want us and will dribble out a little bit before release and &quot;promise the rest will be evaluated&quot;.<br />
<br />
Purdy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd be tickled pink just to see what they consider the &quot;Class Definitions&quot; released before OoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not to sound overly pessimistic - I like to view it as realistic - but have we seen even one single official comment that there will be any changes made before OoW?<br />
<br />
I cant remember seeing any and I kinda understand that they want to put as many good things as possible into the expansion as possible to be able to sell it successfully. I just think its a very shortsighted business decision.<br />
<br />
0 &gt;&gt;&gt; my confidence in SOE doing anything not solely based on shortsighted profit</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You have every right to feel as you do.  I agree, it's time for them to start walking the walk.</div></div><hr />
