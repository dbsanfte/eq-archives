<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was playing for a couple of hours last night, when my modem <br />
disconnected. When trying to get back on, I got the following error <br />
pop-up:<br />
  <br />
Everquest Startup Error<br />
 <br />
You may wish to try rebooting, deleting EQMAIN.DLL and re-starting Everuest. <br />
If this problem persists, please contact Technical Support...<br />
<br />
 <br />
I keep getting this when starting up EQ. As soon as I hit play. I've <br />
deleted this file,  tried checking my disk for errors, defraged, no change. <br />
Rebooted several times. The only way to get rid of it is ctrl-alt-del<br />
<br />
Just to add to my pain, I was dead when I was disconnected so I <br />
have a corpse rotting in Crypt of Decay. What needs to be done to fix <br />
this?<br />
<br />
I made a post on Sony's tech support boards, but no response. I get<br />
better advice here, 'cause Shamans is be da most smartest.</div></div><hr />

let me see if I can verify my idea:<br />
&lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;alt&gt;&lt;del&gt;<br />
Test text<br />
&lt;/del&gt;<br />
yes, its the <br />
ctrl alt del <br />
you have in your text and which you put into the &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; brackets. Actually the del part.</div></div><hr />
