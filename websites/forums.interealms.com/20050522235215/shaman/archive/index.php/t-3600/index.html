<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Shamen and druids don't stack well on raids, and as secondary healers their capability for healing on raids is inadequate.  However, any significant increase in their ability to heal would make Clerics redundant in exp. groups.  This is my idea for a solution to this.<br />
<br />
It requires two components:<br />
<br />
Firstly, a new spell - called 'Empathic Heal' - and secondly a new AA ability - called 'Healing Empathy'.<br />
<br />
To use the AA skill 'Healing Empathy'  you target another healer and click the hotbutton.  Duration is until you perform another action.<br />
<br />
The spell 'Empathic Heal' works as follows: by default it uses the same amount of mana as Complete Heal, but only heals about the same as Superior Heal (ie. its useless).  However, with another healer focusing on you using 'Healing Empathy', you will heal for considerably more and for the same mana before.  With two healers focusing on you, you will heal for pretty much the same as a Complete Heal.<br />
<br />
The idea behind this design is:<br />
<br />
1.  None of the healers using the AA skill are using mana in the process, so a group of three could - by switching roles - all contribute effectively and all get to perform the main healing task.  So shamen/druids will stack better.<br />
<br />
2.  It's not much use in an exp. group as it requires too large a proportion of healers in the group to be effective.<br />
<br />
Well thats the idea.  Does it stink?  Does it form the basis for a better solution to the stated problem?  Would anyone want this?  Or am I just dredging up an idea that has already been dismissed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think you've found the problem alright - non-cleric priests want better healing, but upgrading their normal heals by any significant amount trivialises the clerics.<br />
<br />
Your idea is interesting, but I think the method you propose for activation might be a bit cumbersome.<br />
<br />
How about this (totally off the top of my head): A new spell which can only be cast on others. This spell is a &quot;healing buff&quot; - IE if you are buffed with this spell any healing spells you cast heal more HP. The duration of the buff is very short, or perhaps lasts for a certain number of heals. The spell stacks, so being buffed by 2 people would make your heal spells even better.<br />
<br />
Perhaps casting any non healing spell should cause the buff to wear off - not sure about this part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Grippa has an interesting thought - it could possibly use the old Scale of Wolf logic.  an attack buff or being attacked makes it drop.<br />
<br />
This could be used in exp groups, but it would limit the druid/shaman to healing buffing duties - no nukes, not even JBB, and no slowing ... so not much reason to pass over a cleric for two lesser priests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That suggestion is way too complicated for Verant to ever consider implementing.  They aren't going to majorly change the spell engine to allow casters to work together just so shamans can stack on raids.<br />
<br />
The healing buff idea in the 2nd post is cute, but there are no buffs that stack with themselves!  Once again Verant will not majorly overall the spell engine just for us and that is what would be required to implement this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My suggestion doesn't require the &quot;healing buff&quot; to stack with itself - even if it didn't the system would still allow 2 healers to stack.<br />
<br />
Point taken though, that anything that requires major code changes probably isn't going to happen. However, allowing spells to stack with themselves has been mentioned before - we would love it if EBolt cast by shaman A would stack with EBolt cast by shaman B.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mikar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If we have 5 shaman on a 40 people raid I still often wish we had more.<br />
<br />
Torpor + CannV just owns for healing <br />
- mages that make rods <br />
- clerics that use rods<br />
- casters that take AE dmg<br />
<br />
The fact that a shaman can Canni rather than use rods makes him very well suited for non-MT healing. So, very few groups on a raid dont benifit from having a shaman w/torpor. Without torpor its a different matter entirely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yup, this is the issue I brought up in another thread.  Raid Healing vs Exp healing.<br />
<br />
Shaman and Druids need a way to heal some large number of HPs, and do it now (fast casting) but limited so they don't take over in an Exp group.  It is well known that CH doesn't really heal the full HPs, instead it heals so much that effectively it achieves the goal.  Therefore it sounds like the game engine can't handle 50% heal or something similar.  When a Shaman or Druid attempts to heal the raid-buffed, 5k+ hp tank, chloroblast barely makes a dent.<br />
<br />
Keep the ideas coming, maybe we'll hit on something!<br />
<br />
Taladaen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Not everyone has Torpor though. No one under level 60 has Torpor, but a solution to allow shamans / druids to stack better on raids should take into account all levels, or at least all raiding levels which is probably 45+.<br />
<br />
In my limited experience, level 60 shamans stack reasonably well, as secondary healers. Lower level shamans don't stack so well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yes Taladaen, that's true about Complete Heal. You can see that it &quot;only&quot; heals 10,000 hp if a mob with loads of HP CHs itself - on a 100,000 HP mob that's not much healing :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Let me start by saying, I disagree that shamans and druids do not stack well on raids.  On the contrary, I feel they compliment each other extremely well.<br />
Hell, I save 600 mana with group regen alone when there's a druid in my group.<br />
To a degree, the same goes for group SoW, although I find that tanks tend to prefer Spirit of Billy over druid SoW, but not always.<br />
Druids are very underrated in grouping situations IMO.<br />
<br />
Anyway, that being said, I will agree that I would like to see more healing improvements, and I think your idea is pretty nice.<br />
I can't wait for them to lift that healing cap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I had another idea involving a pair of spells - one spell to summon some no rent objects, and a healing spell that uses these objects as a component. But I can't see how to make the fit the &quot;raid only&quot; requirement.<br />
<br />
I'm just mentioning it here in case it inspires somone :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My idea is intended to be easy to implement, if Verant's code works as I would image it to (OK. maybe thats a pretty big if).<br />
<br />
Each player character would require a single additional 8-bit integer 'count' variable in his/her data structure or object.<br />
<br />
On each player character update:<br />
<br />
If using the AA skill:  Increment the 'count' variable on the target caster's data structure or object.<br />
<br />
If casting the spell: use spell effect modified by the value of the 'count' variable.<br />
<br />
Finally, zero the 'count' variable.</div></div><hr />

For you: no point at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Grippa, thinking about what you said, why not have a heal, that does like 1,000 pt heal, but takes soemthing that weighs like 25 stones, and isn't stackable. On a raid, you just have a mage summon no rent bags and put them in there, and for exping, it gives you something to fall back on, or to speed up downtime. It wouldn't cost *a lot* mana wise since you can only cast it X amount of times before having to restock on components.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Gripa:<br />
<br />
My point is the game engine cannot handle a &quot;50%&quot; heal very well.  There is a GM style CH but my understanding is it is a &quot;reset&quot; for lack of a better term.  Removes all flags on target &amp; sets HPs to full.  I'm betting there is something involved in the game engine that if you cast a spell on a target &amp; you set the HP to full, it'll mess with all other flags on the target (Which HPs does it set to?   Max after all buffs?)   Otherwise CH would do exactly that, raise the current HPs up to max.<br />
<br />
Since the game engine cannot handle a &quot;true&quot; CH it apparently cannot handle a &quot;50% heal&quot; or &quot;75% heal&quot;.  The problem still remains, how can a Druid or Shaman heal a raid-buffed tank &amp; not throw off balance of a cleric in exp group?<br />
<br />
Taladaen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yup, I understood your point, sorry if I wasn't clear on that.<br />
<br />
You are correct - the problem is to find a solution that allows secondary healers to contribute a meaningful amount of healing to a tank with 5k (or more) HP.<br />
<br />
However we can't really speculate meaningfully about how easy it would be for Verant to add a &quot;50% heal&quot; facility to the game.<br />
<br />
To Batalon - remember shamans can summon 100% weight reduce bags too. I'm not sure the idea of summoned items is workable, as there's nothing to stop one shaman doing all the work, and thus nothing to stop it being used in groups.<br />
And the idea is to make healers stack, not to make us stack with mages :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Grippa makes a valid point that not everyone has Torpor, let alone not everyone is level 60.   This even applies to druids.<br />
<br />
The game shouldn't be 100% centralized on level 60.   Eventually people do get to that point, and the &quot;end-game&quot; usually involves a long string of 60's, but people 1-59 do group and xp and go on raids, and low hp crappy healing doesn't get anywhere when people start going into those harder dungeons in the 50's.  The trick is, if a decent instant heal is introduced sub-60, then Torpor will have issues becoming a &quot;lame duck&quot; so-to-speak.  Heck, if one is introcuded at 60, Torpor could have issues.<br />
<br />
I'm still all for an improved instant heal.  It doesn't have to be drastic, and by no means should a cleric feel threatened.  I'm pretty sure some guilds have had to postpone or cancel a raid, due to a low cleric count.  The game shouldn't have to revolve around that.   There should be compromises.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kongar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">This isn't going to help the druids, but for shaman the answer is clear to me.<br />
<br />
Alchemy.<br />
<br />
The skill is useless right now except for the occasional person with pp to spend.  My idea is to make a very difficult complete heal potion.   Not like the one we already get where you click the potion 10 times, get healed, then you start losing hitpoints...  Pffft, that one is lame IMHO :)<br />
<br />
I'd like to see a straight up complete heal potion, and you can combine them into a 10 dose CH potion - something that costs around 2pp per shot (20pp per stack).  It would serve both raids and exp groups rather well.  2pp is enough where an exp group shaman isn't going to want to be handing them out for free - a cleric would still be welcome in an exp group.  But a shaman could become main healer in a group for a few hours of solid exp for a cost of only 100pp or so...  This money could be made up by selling sow potions and CH potions etc.  I think it would balance well.  Clerics are still undisputed healers and they'll be picked up quick over potions, yet it allows us to be effective for a small cost when there's a lack of clerics available.<br />
<br />
Especially on raids this would be great - shamans just show up with the potions and start handing them out.  This makes us stack well as one shaman isn't going to want to hand out 200 potions (and us cranky shaman would never agree to that).  AND it can add us to the complete heal cycle without actually adding us to it ;)  Plus, how many times have you wanted to go smack something down, but oops, not enough clerics on.  Well, you just tell your buds to cough up some cash, you make potions, hand em out and let the tanks do their thing...<br />
<br />
Unfortunatley though alchemy kinda sucks.  But it could be a very cool skill - one that roleplays well and could make us a very stackable class.  Think of how much better things would be if our potions were actually reasonably priced, and if we had something to work for besides level 60 and torpor.   I'd spend 20K maxing alchemy for reasonably priced CH potions - I dunno - maybe I'm way off but youldn't you all too?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">A big-heal potion would be nice.  But 2p?  Nah.  It's something that folks would be willing to pay WELL for.<br />
<br />
How about a triv at 160, 100-150p per dose potion for a &quot;Ranger CH&quot; like 2500-3000hp or so?  I'd be willing to pay that to make 'em, and I'm sure folks would be willing to pay more to buy 'em.<br />
<br />
It'd triv at a level where it'd be extremely useful (56) and cost enough so that the tank holding them will hopefully pause a second or two before using it to heal 1.5 bubs of damage (cuz you know some will).  The price, though fairly high, isn't prohibitive for somebody at that level.<br />
<br />
Oh, and the stinging wort potions... I think you lose hp from the 300 extra max it gives you, not from the hp you currently have, as far as I can tell.  I haven't noticed my actual hp drop unless I end up full health as it wears off.  I'll look more closely, though, to be certain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Isazo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Make a class (or archetype) AA skill with a 72 min refresh, 5-min duration that gives 100% chance of critical (double) heals during the duration.  Second level reduces refresh time to 48 min.  Third level reduces refresh to 24 min.<br />
<br />
Generally speaking for post-HoT raids (ie, one or two main target mobs, not just an endless stream of 'yard trash' mobs) you end up wanting improved healing abilities maybe 5 minutes an hour.<br />
<br />
Ie, a Vindi raid.  You buff, clear to arena, clear whatever mobs are needed for your pull strategy, and then pull vindi.  Shamans / Druids (even clerics?) activate the 'always crit' AA skill ... and our chloroblast now heals around 700+ a shot.<br />
<br />
If SoRZ pops maybe you wish you had saved your timer.<br />
<br />
Perhaps even make the AA skill require a component ... say a peridot.<br />
<br />
A Zlandicar raid ... takes most of an hour to set up and work your way down to his lair.<br />
<br />
This won't replace clerics in XP groups ... being a good healer 5-25% of the time isn't enough.  It will make shamans / druids heal meaningfully better on raids.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just my thoughts.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Mitrian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Heck, I'd be happy just to see another 150-200 points of healing added to Chloroblast.  To be more useful on raids as a secondary healer, nothing short of CH and non-EE rezzing would leave clerics as a mandatory requirement.<br />
<br />
Aside from a more useful Chloroblast heal, maybe a small improvement to the Healing Adept or Healing Gift AA abilities.  Instead of 2%, 5% and 10%, make it 5%, 10%, and 20%.  Those are both level 55 abilities.<br />
<br />
One question I have is why paladins get Healing Wave of Prexus when all other non-cleric priests don't even get a single target instant-heal spell that does as much healing?  HWoP does about 600 points of healing to all members (with 2-second casting time).  Pricey mana-wise, but at least they get the option.  I would love to see something similar added to shaman or druid arsenals.<br />
<br />
Replacing clerics in exp groups?  Any way you look at it, as long as they have CH and no one else does (pallies aside), they will still be wanted in exp groups.  But personally I don't see a big deal with running exp groups without a cleric.  Shoot, if the group's purpose is simply for exp... then why should any class be specifically required.  You can take a group of whatever classes you want and find good places to exp grind or farm.  Maybe I'm missing the point of the discussion as far as that goes, I'm not sure.<br />
<br />
As for using Alchemy?  I see that as a completely different topic, since it doesn't really make the shammy more useful *during* the raid.  Just means the melees would need to have some in inventory.  And don't underestimate Stinging Wort.  (By the way, as it fades, it only drops your maximum amount of HPs, which means you only lose actual HPs when you are at full health.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">The sort of code that Grippa's suggestion would require is already in game I think. Ever fought Xerkizh the Creator? His curse makes healing spells only heal ¼ what they normally heal. This seems to imply that they could put a buff in game (make it cleric castable only) that raises the amount of hp healed per heal spell, something pretty trivial like 5% or maybe 10%.<br />
<br />
The spell should probably be short duration, under 15 minutes or so. This would prevent people from treating clerics like enchanters, and just using them for buffs and not grouping with them.<br />
<br />
They could also put the new spell on a cleric only item, so clerics wouldn't have to use up another spell slot on it.</div></div><hr />

I guess personally I would rather have potions that are useful and bought in large quantities, than to have potions that are there to make a profit from.<br />
<br />
My complaint with alchemy is that potions are too expensive for the benefit they provide.  You really think people would pay hundreds of pp for a healing potion?  I guess I'm missing something...<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm wrong here, but most shamans probably don't like being the main healer.  Make up some potions and let the tanks heal themselves.  This way groups can camp stuff they normally couldn't do without a cleric.<br />
<br />
And to be honest 2pp per shot would probably add up in an exp group.  I wouldn't want to play potion healer at 2pp per shot indefiantely - nevermind the fact that I actually have to stop doing whatever to make them.  I dunno maybe I just don't get it...<br />

It shouldn't? I know we don't have 15 level 30ish guilds on Fennin battling to see who gets to take out the evil witch Najena. We do however have a mad rush when any number of rare level 50+ spawns pop. PoP is coming out to even more cater to the high-end content. It isn't a coincidence.<br />
<br />
CrustlyOldShaman: &quot;Shamen and druids don't stack well on raids, and as secondary healers their capability for healing on raids is inadequate. However, any significant increase in their ability to heal would make Clerics redundant in exp. groups.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frankly, I'm just mystified at the healing upgrade talk on this board.<br />
<br />
First off, aside from rote healing, the two things that makes clerics valuable in exp settings are rez's/buffs. Bigger heals for us won't change that. Right now with torpor I find I can keep tanks alive and kicking at most any exp camp, including duo-ing at the CT zone in. Giving me a 500 point heal won't mean no clerics.<br />
<br />
Second, ***, are you really that bored at raids? Aren't the best debuffs (malo/malosini/slow/ae slow/cripple/ID/PoI), second best buffs (KF/brute/cat/avatar/group regrowth) and patch heals enuf? Fine, torpor the mod rodding wizzies/clerics, hand the MT a Kiva's potion, JBB a few times (hush iksar, it was hyberole to prove a point :p ) and send dogdog into battle against VaDyn or whatever. If you're still bored, melee some! Rabid bear!!<br />
<br />
No, most raids don't support 4-5 shaman well. Hell, most raids don't support 2 chanters well, but that doesn't mean they aren't core elements. We are terribly versatile, and at the same time, don't sacrifice group/raid desirability and solo power in being so. <br />
<br />
I just don't see how anyone can honestly think, for a second, that we aren't mission critical to raids as we sit right now.</div></div><hr />

This idea is a good one anyway, because it helps druids and shaman without their full spellbooks (and below level 60) as well. More choice is always good. I think most druids (and shaman) dont even want to be in the CH-cycle on raids, but it helps their ego if they could if they huddle together :)<br />
<br />
And that solution doesnt hurt Clerics any more in XP-groups, because not much would be needed to make them the worst choice of the three priest classes in XP-groups.</div></div><hr />

While I wouldn't pass up on getting a better heal spell (prior to Torpor), I'm certainly not unhappy with things as they sit already.  Those of us who do not have Torpor (regardless of our level) are sometimes frustrated at our lack of healing ability, but it's something -- for me at least -- that is relatively easy to get over.  And yes, we will always be mission critical on raids, unless we not the primary debuffer/buffer.  After that, in raids, we can participate, sure, but our nuking/meleeing, while better than nothing, is not what I'd call fulfilling.  (Luckily for me, for the past ten levels or so, I've been our guild's primary shaman, so I've always been very busy.)<br />
<br />
But overall, I'd agree with you, and certainly can't complain about how things are now.  But I always like to consider what could be improved.  The chances of any of these suggestions being implemented to any degree is slim.  The conversation/debate serves two purposes:  1) It's fun.  2) We learn things if we stop defending our perspectives long enough to listen to others.<br />
<br />
I'm interested to hear more ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Nah, I didn't. The spell exists so you can't balance/unbalance a class based on something many if not most level 60 shaman have (read: most does not equal 100 percent). That's like saying you can't consider manaburn an asset to wizzies or AM3 to rangers because most don't yet have it. It's still a factor, like it or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">If they fixed the Torpor drop tables then shaman wouldn't really have anything to bitch about. Yes it's a powerful spell and yes it totally changes your shaman's life... but Verant already knows that priests need more healing power, but I think most people here would agree shaman already have quite enough at 60 provided they have Torpor. Just let more shaman get Torpor and the problem will practically solve itself. Well, for shamans anyway.<br />
<br />
As for Druids, give them Torpor2 but with super nasty side effects. Like 400m for a 2400hp heal in 24 seconds that mezzes you during that time. Or turns the target into a tree or a stun. Something so that the target is pretty much &quot;dead&quot; for the duration of the spell (blind don't count because good tanks can fight blind anyway). Call it Tranquility or something else nature-ish. Group only of course. Maybe a 9 second cast? With the right AA a Druid could be throwing out 3.5k heals for ~350m every 5 seconds or so... and when you're full hp you just click it off.<br />
<br />
Druids don't get Canni, so it's no big deal giving them a good ratio spell (even though still inferior to Torpor).<br />
<br />
It can't really be used for CHeal rotations on the main tank because &quot;removing&quot; him makes things just go bad. Much like Torpor does anyway (For an uber raid Torpor is a 65% slow. 200% -&gt; 70%).<br />
<br />
You can use it to heal secondary melee in raids even though they'll hate you for it, but who hasn't had a monk/rogue/ranger bitch at them for throwing out a Torpor?.<br />
<br />
Should be fairly beasty heal in exp groups, and you may or may not get away with using it on someone that's actually fighting. Depends on the place, group, etc.<br />
<br />
To me it looks like a caster CHeal. Most raid buffed &quot;robes&quot; aren't going to be much over 3k and if they're &quot;AFK&quot; for 30 seconds or so, meh. That's probably not going to kill the raid... hopefully. ;)<br />
<br />
Shouldn't replace Clerics in exp groups (less so than a shaman does) because if you're in a place where you really neeeed a cleric (aka CT) 600hp a really isn't all that much, and the PC you're casting it on WILL lose taunt (right before whatever he was tanking eats you for healing him).<br />
<br />
To me it seems like it'd work pretty damn well for raids, and be capable of &quot;filling in&quot; for exp groups. If anyone sees something blatantly stupid though feel free to point it out. Once I got a good idea down I might go anon post it to some druids. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">actually removing someone from play for 24 sec makes this spell suggestion basically worthless, maybe for a wiz or a chanter now and then, but basically it'd be a killer, i sure as hell would find something nice and nasty to say to whoever cast it on me :)<br />
just too limited, and druids have the instant heals, we have the dotheals(torpor vs nt)<br />
<br />
torpor is really limited on raids, it's nice as backup, but the grp only and slow limits it's usefullness ALOT.<br />
<br />
as for the original idea on this thread, i can see it now:afk sleeping, my turn to focus today, no thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Agrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Lets see... more healing more healing...<br />
a new spell or aa ability to increase our healing output, quite a few valid ideas, heres another...  <br />
<br />
Instead of trying to increase the amount of healing we do, we instread make a spell to lower the amount of damage the tank takes, best way I can think to do that is to reduce the number of times the monster can hit your tank, therefor you need to heal him less.  We could even call this new spell a &quot;Slow&quot;.... Turgur's Insects maybe?<br />
<br />
<br />
fix this, change that, gimmie more, make me better...   are we playing the same classes here?  I perfectly happy with my class, I dont need more to equal a cleric... I can be main healer in almost ANY 50+ location<br />
<br />
Sorry if this sounds condisending, but you poeple need some more confidence in yourselves.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I can't cast torpor outside group in raid. Yes, I Torpor slow and snare. But it's not my main job to keep MT alive in raid !<br />
Yes, chloroblast is not a very good heal to keep a MT alive in raid, but it's not doing nothing ! I rarely need to CCC (chain cast chloro) MT on raid. <br />
<br />
My jobs in raid are =&gt; debuffing, buffing and keeping my group alive as a good secondary healer.<br />

if you want to be main healer, go play a cleric.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Perhaps I ought to clarify something: we do not NEED this ability.  This isn't a post on the lines of 'oh fix me Verant, for I am broken'.<br />
<br />
But there are guilds that have to cancel raids because they haven't enough clerics.  The Clerics they do have are under pressure to attend every raid.  I read the Cleric message boards -the thread on EQCleric about raid burn out includes plenty of posts to that effect.<br />
<br />
For those of you who don't want this ability, I suppose you might be concerned that your guilds might force this role on you.  Other than that, are there any other causes for objecting to it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I agree with the crusty one. My suggestions are not intended to be along the lines of &quot;shamans are worthless unless we get these super duper new heals, everyone petition verant now plz thx la~&quot;<br />
<br />
I was merely floating ideas to be commmented on. If we arrive at something that could be a worthwhile, balanced addition to the shaman class, all the better. If we just brainstorm loads of ideas and arrive at nothing, we haven't lost anything.<br />
<br />
I do seem to be getting the impression however, that the naysayers are all oracles with torpor. Some people obviously believe that no one counts in this game until you get to level 60, and if you ain't level 60, then s t f u noob and get levelling.<br />
<br />
I personally think that classes should be balanced at every level. I respect that some shamans don't want to be healers, but some of us don't have a choice, and some of us want to take that role, at least some of the time.<br />
<br />
So, like Crusty says, we aren't saying shamans NEED any of these things, merely that it's an interesting line of thought to persue, maybe something will come of it, maybe not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Need as in we're broken without, of course not.  Need a way to be able to do a significant amount of healing on a fully buffed tank so that the role can be filled by someone other than a cleric in a raid?  Yes.<br />
<br />
A cleric _should_ be better at healing but even in my lowly 55 level perspective I see how many of our guild tanks have so many HPs that trying to heal one of them up will drain my mana tank dry.  If druids &amp; shaman can do some healing on raids we won't have to call so many off because not enough clerics online.<br />
<br />
Druids have a harder time because they can't dump most their mana on heals &amp; then just fill up as fast as us, this is the key to the problem.  Giving shaman a larger blast heal helps during the fight itself but isn't needed for between fights healing.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">clerics are just too required at raids and too useless in xp grps :)<br />
<br />
if youre not in a raiding guild you may not know this.<br />
making druids and/or shm's at least able to heal on the lower type ubermobs would really help.<br />
secondary healer me butt, i have close to 4700hp buffed, i heal for 524(or whatever sh is, i cant remember), warriors in guild have over 7k hp, i still heal for 524, it's not even a dent :) so it's torpor or chainhealing in the hopes that you just &quot;might&quot; be the extra drop that keeps a tank alive.<br />
<br />
now, our mana regen is up the roof compared to druids/clerics, which is why i'd suggest we get the dotheals, druids get the better instants(since you cant stack 15 dotheals, it's just cast it and wait till it's done) i'm slowly beginning to believe we might as well get torpor without the penalties and keep it as is otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I too would like a better heal for on raids.<br />
But healing isn't my role.<br />
Debuffing and buffing is my role.<br />
I throw backup heals where I can, and torpor those in need in my group, like casters or tanks if we are light on clerics.<br />
If we get any form of bigger heal, it should be rather inefficient IMO.   We aren't healers.  We are a healing class, but clerics and druids are meant to be better healers.<br />
I'd like to see a heal given to us for about 1000 damage heal, but cost about 400 or 500 mana to cast it.  Clearly an inefficient heal ratio, but a large size.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">yea, we dont need or deserve the same type of instant heals a druid or cleric should get, my point is, clerics are too dominant as healers, had you needed 1-2 that would be just dandy, but you want tons of them.<br />
some spreading out would be nice(this would obviously mean clerics need more diversity as well)</div></div><hr />
