<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i was thining about this. i dont want to be a cleric and i dont want to be a druid.<br />
<br />
I do want to be able to heal and heal enough to be useful if it all goes wrong, but i mainly want to do damage.<br />
<br />
I think i would like to see shaman do more damage than druids, but ofcourse not healing so good. Now with mitigation of slows this can happen, with slow now being reduced in effect, i think that our dps should be u/g rather than our healing.<br />
<br />
my thinking is cleric highest heal lowest dps (but enough so they can solo if they want ) druid the middle for both , shaman worst healer best dps.<br />
<br />
how to do that is the question? u/g our nukes? unlikely, u/g our rain spell? good possiblity. make dots faster acting.  we could with a mixture of slight dd u/g , large rain u/g and fast acting dots do a lot of damage (question of agro) I quite like our rains spells so upping them would work for me. maybe a slightly more dps type pet (cant tank but good dps).<br />
<br />
anyhow that my thought.  obviously buffs shared by all preist classes. debuff? with slow decreasing in power malos isnt that much extra. cripple? hmm depends if it becomes a cripple?<br />
<br />
anyway just my own feelings. I like the ablility to heal but i dont want to do it as main stay, i would have made a cleric if i did damage and perhaps debuff was why i did a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thornebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Seeing how we are a Chain Class. We should be able to get in tight and muck things up more<br />
<br />
Be able to OT higher end mobs for a &quot;short&quot; bit. and I am not trying to make us into a tank or anything like that. But we are a Chain Class.<br />
<br />
We should be able to cast buffs on Melee's that they want and look forward to having.<br />
<br />
Then be able to add DPS to the group by both use or Melee and Mana without going OOM in one fight.<br />
<br />
Then drop Spot Heals and help out the Main Healer.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Jack of all trades is a good concept. We used to be very good in all aspects including dd, dot, rain, pet, heal, slow, debuff and buff.<br />
<br />
It's just that the game outprogressed us.<br />
<br />
If they just took us and multiplied our abilites by 1.5 it would be where id like us to be. They could cut a bit on slow immunity and mitigation also.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
increasing our mellee is another way to help damage, but to be able to do that effectively, we would need a few more mellee like skills, or possible spells that add these (self only maybe)  somin like the rage line where it add double attack, increase mellee skills etc for a constant mana drain?.  and more importantly faster spells .<br />
<br />
higher dps could come from all things put together. certainly if i could hit for what meleel hit witha  50 weapon rather than the 210 i capped at it would make a different, beast witha  45 dam weapon was hitijng for 300+. melll crits etc would be nice as hybrids get dd crits.<br />
<br />
better defense would be nice too.<br />
<br />
but i not that bother how i do dps, just that i want to do dps rather than heal:) (but be a good choice for back up)<br />
<br />
at this point a complete redifining of the class might not be a bad thing, we have way to many things that where add as after thoughts and then not continued. and some things that where good but didnt reach there full potential because of our other abilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">anyone good at tables?<br />
<br />
we could do a skills tabels from scratch<br />
<br />
i would say defensive offense along the lines of mellee, no duel wield , double atack but late maybe level 50, but only going to 150 at 65, with aa to increase that.  ? and maybe 1 or 2 disciplines?<br />
have a slam/bash skill.<br />
<br />
<br />
various buffs, similar to what we have , with % modifiers coming in about levle 55-60.<br />
<br />
dots completely revamp. curse spell keep, desease remove. poison hmm? i was never that fond of desease and poison as a shaman, curses and spirit magic is what i see. (basically maybe 1 line of fast/ high damage dots)<br />
<br />
dd  yes spirit strike and cold. one being smaller and fast cast the other being higher and longer cast (or maybe recast) so at 65 1k nuke in 3 sec, or 1.5 k nuke recast 20 sec.<br />
<br />
slightly buffer pet, but still very much 4th (possible based on a beserker type?)<br />
 <br />
new :)  alchemy makes poitons that help in fights like a acid bomb, smirnoff cocktail? useing throwing skill (so we need a throwing skill) relative cheep to make ( 5 to 10pp a go) but do some decent damage close to nuke damage  (1k)<br />
<br />
debuffs?  slow?  well keep that roughly as is but change the levels or make it scale with level better.<br />
<br />
malos sure would fit with spirit magic.<br />
cripple?  i can live without it.<br />
<br />
heals , well about where they are, hot starting at lower levels though and better at higher, direct heal close to what we have now, maybe slightly higher (thats god heal)<br />
<br />
cures yes cure all. fits with shaman.<br />
<br />
 new :) one less set spirit call, calls a fallen comrades spirit to corspe, not a res just summon someone to corspe , but needs a corpse to work:)<br />
<br />
try get that into a table?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Itemization screwed us, really.<br />
<br />
We play a game where the first concern of the developers is how to place a warrior with 500AA's and 10,000 unbuffed hitpoints in &quot;danger&quot;.  We were extremely adept at lowering that danger, therefore we got nerfed -- hard.  <br />
<br />
We used to be like a ninja standing next to a samurai.  When all the nasties came flying into the room we got to do cool stuff.<br />
<br />
Today, we're like a ninja standing next to superman ... as a meteore shower strikes.  <br />
<br />
The very last concern of the developers is shaman.  The only thing they could do for us in the land of 10K tanks is to mutate us into something different, which would A) be a lot of work and B) cause a lot of bellyaching.  It's far easier to string us along (just like monks) with crappy upgrades to crappy buffs that they pretend matter (/wave Ryan) and let attrition convert us into beastlords and (my guess for the next golden child) 'zerkers.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">i want to be seriously noticed by sony as being in a class that is more broken than any other.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I want to be a battle priest.  <br />
<br />
For the first 2-3 years of this game, that's what we were.  Our damage was found in the strength of our arm and the power of our dots.  But it was also amplified by the melee of our group, because our buffs magnified their dps, making them stronger.  We weren't the strongest healers, but we could manage.<br />
<br />
Today, it would be nice to see this type of priest reimplemented.  <br />
(1) I wouldn't ask for dual wield or double attack, that's a bit over the top.  But give us bash.  We melee'd more than clerics ever did, and it'd be extremely useful to the shaman who enjoy melee'ing today.  <br />
(2) Upgrade our buffs with real combat effects that melee actually want.  By doing this, you upgrade shaman shaman dps indirectly, through the group we are apart of.<br />
(3) Fix dots!  Make their agro comparable to nukes, up their mana efficiency because they don't always last the full duration, make them resist on a per tick basis, fix itemization to make dot focus effects more available, and then give us comparable AA to crit like the nuking classes.  Anything less is just wrong.<br />
(4) Upgrade our debuffs.  Malos does not need a long recast.  Cripple is worthless.  We are slotted to have the highest mana costing root with the lowest debuff of any class in the game.  It's a single spell, but in this spell we see the injustices present in every other spell line.  Just have to ask myself where all this hate is coming from...<br />
(5) Why can hybrids outnuke us?  Up velium strike's damage by 150 dmg, reduce it's cast time to 6.25 (same cast time as all other priestly nukes) and call it a day.  There's simply no valid reason for why this would be overpowering.<br />
<br />
The changes necessary to turn us back into the battle priest we knew and loved when we played this class are not daunting, overbalancing, nor are they even particularly hard to implement.  They're what every shaman for the past year has been clamoring for, and it's simply intolerable that Sony thinks they can overlook this class's most fervent desire to fell useful and wanted once again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I want DoTs redesigned to mesh with the modern game.<br />
<br />
I want debuffs/buffs that mesh with the modern game.<br />
<br />
I want debuffs/buffs based on the BoV/PoC concept that expand the utility for a well played shaman.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
<br />
1) A BoV type slow with the following characteristics:<br />
  - relatively large damage buffer<br />
  - fast casting<br />
  - a small resist modifier<br />
  - slows by 10%<br />
  - is not affected by slow mitigation<br />
  - stacks on top of all other slows for a max of 75%<br />
<br />
2) A BoV type slow with the following characteristics:<br />
  - very small damage buffer<br />
  - very fast casting<br />
  - no resist modifier<br />
  - slows by 40%<br />
  - is not affected by slow mitigation<br />
  - stacks on top of all other slows for a max of 95%<br />
<br />
I would use the former in groups to make shaman superior to other slowers. It could be used in raids to shield tank switchs or in a chain to reduce healing requirements by a %.<br />
<br />
I would use the latter as an alternative form of CC. Not as good as mezzing, but effective enough in most circumstances that a group can do CC content without a chanter. It wouldn't displace a chanter since the spell would complement a chanter if present, making CC that much more secure.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of things that you can do with spells designed around the basic concept behind BoV and PoC. I'd like to see Sony show some imagination and revitalize buffing/debuffing classes that way.</div></div><hr />

http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4884&amp;source=Test<br />
<br />
cast in 6.35 sec? long casting time? and it alot short with focus effects and more damage (1705 norm) , our best dot without focus is bane at 2100, butit takes 30 sec for that, druid can cast  4 nukes in that time easily, which is 6820 dam. <br />
<br />
now we can stack dots , although over 3 we tend to get summon by mobs so lets add our top desease and poison dots. BoS is 1600 over 30 sec and desease is 655 over 30 sec<br />
<br />
so total of 4355 againt 6820. now it not exact as druid can also dot and we can also nuke alittle , and you have to take the time to stack though dots whcih is about 8 seconds each so 24 sec to stack them.. at the end off the day i still think the dd will easily out dps us.<br />
<br />
even the lower one at 1500 a go, is 6000 damage. not inculdeing better crit aa, increase dd base damage  etc.<br />
<br />
tell me you still think druid dd is pointless?</div></div><hr />

He drops just under the same nuking DPS as my mage when I can't use bolts. <br />
<br />
DoT dps doesn't really count with how broken they are. Even in my gimp ass, healer heavy group, the second we get a charmed pet I put them all away and we don't even haste the pet. <br />
<br />
Personally I'd love to see shaman be the priestly kings of dps and dps enhancment, melee buffs that directly increased damage, make all dots 5 tics or less with the three different resists for various situations. No more dot agro then nuke agro. A pet that can put out more DPS then a shadow knight pet at the least.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
i agree in groups only dot i have memed is bane, but more likely i have tears of saryn and a dd up. which for the sorter fights is lot better i find. and with aa i crit vs for 2k fairly regular which is nearly our highest dot in one go (though with dot crits and ba not sure how much more a dot would be but probably not that much considering it might not run to full)]<br />
<br />
with tears i get anywhere form about 2 hit =1300 up to 3250 although that is rare (2 crits), but i often get 1950 (3 hits or 1 crit and 1 hit)<br />
never had 3 crits :) anyone have?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I know exactly what I want.<br />
<br />
I started playing Everquest as a melee character. Through most of my career, grouping with friends, I never had a Shaman around. It was always Paladin, Druid, Enchanter, Cleric, Monk and Bard. Sometimes interchanging the Druid with a Necro. It wasn't until late into my time as a level 60 character (back in Velious, when that was the cap and it was still rare to /who all 60 and see your list cut short) that we added a Shaman to the group.<br />
<br />
Holy ****ing ****!<br />
<br />
That's what I thought when I saw a good Shaman in action. The Shaman made *everything* smoother and all around better. Stat Buffs (when they meant something), attack, DPS, heals ... the Shaman was the perfect fit to any group. When I wasn't around the Shaman could let anyone, even the Druid, tank with his slows and heals. <br />
<br />
Any one person in that group could have been missing, and the Shaman made up for that.<br />
<br />
The Shaman was desirable.<br />
<br />
Now we're left behind by a game that evolved.<br />
<br />
I was on an Elemental-level pick-up raid with some friends the other day. We had a Shaman applicant from the server's current top guild there that didn't know about Nihil and Turgur's overriding one another. He eventually admitted that he was just a bot being turned into a main because he was bored playing a Knight.<br />
<br />
What do I want? I want to evolve along with the game I play, not be left several expansions behind, teased with class-defining spells set as ancients that the casual player, who deserves it just as much as anyone else, will never see it. For that matter, chances are I'll never see it, either. <br />
<br />
I don't want to have to rely on a Carpal-Tunnel inducing spell from several expansions previous and an AA ability to regenerate my mana, and then atop both those things be penalized on both spell cost and duration for it. (I would like to be able to chat with my group occasionally rather than tapping that stupid Canni button furiously, joke around in /gu without waiting for downtime, etc...) I don't want my heals to mean almost absolutely nothing in the end unless I get a lucky critical heal, even with Elemental arms and full healing AAs. I don't want to feel that my defining spell has been mitigated to the level where both a hybrid and a fellow spell-caster's slows are practically the same thing with very little, if any, difference.<br />
<br />
I want to be able to make people say 'wow' and tingle in special places when they see a Shaman in their group again.<br />
<br />
And I'd also like some competent people handling the changes, for once.<br />
<br />
The last one is just wishful thinking, though.</div></div><hr />

So wrong it isn't even funny.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">druids will out dps a shaman in just about any situation you can define.<br />
they have some very very nasty dots, sure not as many as well have but then again they dont have to spend a full minute truly piling on the dots to do damage, sure I can load up 10 dots on a mob ( yeah I have done that to seru...didnt want the faction hit) but it takes so much time that our once unique ability to stack dots is marginalized almost to the point of uselessness.<br />
nukes, dont even begin to compare, druids get nukes in the 2k range and the get MULTIPLE nukes in that range, shaman on the other hand get 1 1k nuke. they get pbae's, ae's, rains?<br />
debuffs, druids get all the debuffing they need, and their spells come with massive resist mods. shaman on the other hand get debuffs that HAVE to be cast every fight if we want to be effective.<br />
no I'm not trying to turn this into a druids are uba shaman suck thing, I just have no delusions about the relative power.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>psosnake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">i want to be a buffer/slower...no one wants us anymore really, high end geared peeps dont need our buffs...chanters slow just as good...seems shamans are stuck being wanted at LDoNs and the lesser. I pull in LDoNs to have something fun to do, pull wit slow tank grabs, and take a beating while slowing the others f any come. thy should make shamans slow either stick or be resisted and never mitagated and let chanters slow be resisted or mitagated</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Druids are already Second Best Class at Nuking, right after Wizards.  Their Omens Nuke does about 20 more damage than the Mage nuke, just barely inching them into a technical second.  They also, unlike mages, have the ability to nuke with all three resists, wheras Magicians lack cold based nukes.  Druids, along with wizards, also hold the AoE power to quad in lower areas.  Although it's a little off-topic, they also share teleportation abilities to a degree.<br />
<br />
Shaman becoming the highest nuker out of the three priest classes is incredibly unlikely.  I would rather see our buffing upgraded to being the best out of all priest classes (other than HP/AC, that is, which should stay with clerics as it always has, imo).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">What do I want?<br />
<br />
-I want to be able to heal well enough that I can be the 2nd main healer in an Ikkinz trial, seeing as I'm a priest class and all.<br />
<br />
-I want to be able to melee for appreciable dps, like I used to be able to before Kunark came out.<br />
<br />
-I want for my &quot;fast&quot; dots to go full duration before your average mob in an xp session dies in 45 seconds.<br />
<br />
-I want for my nuke to finish casting before your average mob in an xp session dies in 45 seconds.<br />
<br />
-I want for 90% of my buffs to do anything.<br />
<br />
-I want for the aggro on my dots to be dropped hardcore, such that I might not actually get permanent aggro by doing 1/3 the damage of a single wizard nuke.<br />
<br />
-I want a group 60% haste buff.<br />
<br />
-I want the 100k I spent maxing out Alchemy to do more for me than just getting people interested in my qok.  ;)<br />
<br />
Most of all..<br />
<br />
-I want for reasons to have a group of 5 people say &quot;you know, we could really use a shaman right now to complete the group&quot; (casting Malos on Pooka in vxed/tipt doesn't count).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Shamans serve as priests to the tribal races of Norrath, able to draw upon the power of the spirits and focus it for their own purposes. Shamans are primarily a magic-using class, able to wear chain armor and wield blunt weapons and spears.<br />
<br />
Shamanic magic has two main focuses - enhancing the mind and body of the shaman's allies, and weakening or damaging their enemies. A shaman's enhancement spells are always in demand, massively improving the strength, stamina, health, and other physical aspects of the shaman's group. Shamans also are able to heal their allies and have excellent health regeneration spells.<br />
<br />
The weakening and damaging spells in the shaman's arsenal are tremendously effective in battle. The shaman attacks his enemies with diseases and poisons that cause massive damage over time, while using cold and ice magic to inflict damage directly. A brutal line of crippling spells can slow a monster's attacks, hamper their resistance to spells, and lower their physical prowess.<br />
<br />
Shamans are a well-rounded class with strong abilities in both group and solo situations.  An experienced shaman can turn the tide of any battle, bolstering their allies while weakening their enemies significantly. The shaman is an excellent class for players who enjoy working in groups<br />

Thats what I want to be..<br />

That is SoE's official description of a shaman.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Shaman. Similar to a Cleric, but closer to a tribal witch doctor, the Shaman can be found amongst the more primative races. Her primary focus is healing, but she can employ many augmentation and offensive spells as well.<br />
<br />
This is what I started with...would be nice if that was still true.</div></div><hr />
