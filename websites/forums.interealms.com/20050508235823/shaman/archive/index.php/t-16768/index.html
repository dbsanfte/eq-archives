<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can anyone give a detailed description on how large the knockback is with level 3 virulent paralysis?  A sceenshot would be great.  According to raw data off of lucy, the pushback is appearantly &quot;16&quot; but that doesn't really mean much to me.  270aa and still not sure if I want this AA or not =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vixy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I could rave for HOURS about the wonders of VP!  <br />
<br />
First off, only VP3 knocks the mob out of melee range - this is AWESOME for dungeon crawling and CC, and only a 2 minute recast.  In most cases, it lasts as long as our 64 root!  It's great for getting mobs away that are beating on you/others.  Also, you can face in what direction you want the mob to be propelled to, and then cast, and voilla - there it goes!<br />
<br />
Now, it's still worth having and using at vp1 and vp2 levels, and I still rave about it, but vp3 is almost GODLY.  I love love love this aa, -almost- as much as Can5.  it NEVER leaves my hotkeys, even though I have root memmed.  In most cases I'd say, halfway across a ldon room, would be a good estimate.  I suck at determining feet.  Well out of melee range, though.<br />
<br />
Just one thing.. it's very hard to cast if you're being pounded on by three mobs at once.  It is more likely to be interupted than slow - so slow something first if you have a train beating on you, then cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I only have VP1 and really rate this aa, very useful, esp. in Ldon and nice for breaking up cluster of mobs. Good Comedy value as well ;) <br />
<br />
I use it all the time, which means I should probably suck it up and buy level 2-3...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vixy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Another note.. I had only vp1 for the longest time!  I loved it but didn't think vp3 could be THAT much better, so it was like six months later before I bought vp3.<br />
<br />
WELL - it just IS that much better!  if I had known how much MORE awesome it is at vp3 level, I would have immediately sunk all my points into it!<br />
<br />
&lt;3 the VP3!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Etric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">PST me Jinheim.  I have vp3 and I'll show it off for ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I can attest to how hard VP3 rocks.  What I find amazing is doing these LDON missions people are asking what is moving the mobs around.  VP is really that rare that people don't know about it?</div></div><hr />

VP3 will knock the mob three-and-one-half dogdogs away from you.<br />
<br />
Note:  Yes, I measure everything in dogdogs.</div></div><hr />

What I worry about is that VP1 is small enough so that you have more control over it.  Like say you're near another room with mobs in it further in-- with VP1 you can propel the mob a few feet into it without getting agro-- but with VP3 you'll prolly knock it right into the mobs getting adds.  Seems like VP3 needs a lot more room than VP1 does.<br />
<br />
That make sense?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kamm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I love Vp3. Cleric golf can be amusing when your bored. See how close to a medding cleric you can land your mob. If you have a grumpy cleric, It best not to play.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Henchman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have never posted here in the 8+ months I have been reading these forums.  But after seeing the cleric golf.....<br />
<br />
That will be my only purpose for getting this ability now.  Thank you so much for the laughs and the new idea. <br />
<br />
<br />
LMAOOOOO, just too funy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Grammar:<br />
<br />
Yes, with VP3 that situation actually could arise.  I am not sure if you would get the agro immediately, or when root broke, or when you next did something harmful to the mob, but there is the definite possability of sending the mob where you don't want it.<br />
<br />
That being said, the mob always moves in the exact direction you are facing, so if you want it moved into a corner, face the corner.  If you want it moved off the the side, face the side you want it to go.  The mob will not go through walls or anything like that, so you've got pretty good control of where you want to put it.  &quot;Knockback&quot; is kind of miselading -- it should really be called &quot;knockwhereverimlooking&quot;.  This is true of all knockback effects, like enchanter stuns, paladin stuns, wizard knockback spells, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
I usually put it directly on top of whoever is annoying me the most at any given moment.  I'm sadistic that way, sorry.  :)</div></div><hr />
