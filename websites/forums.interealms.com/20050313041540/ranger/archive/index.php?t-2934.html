This is just for fun. The adventurer can charm a leet for 12 hours and have a little pet. Higher levels of this mean that you will be able to charm higher level leets - Leet, Eleet, Leetas, and finally Soleet.<br />

(that won't make much sense if you never played AO)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I stopped playing the game about a month after it came out. They should never release a game without its major plotline hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Relv</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 04:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea I don't play AO anymore but I thought the leets were pretty cute, so just thought that was cool.  Wish EQ rangers could do the same with wolves and wolf form.</div></div><hr />

<br />
im pretty sure it shouldn't</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
And yea that'd be a nice touch to transform to differnt type of wolfs, doesnøt have to have differnt effects. Just differnt illusions would be nice depending on levels or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
quit AO after 4 weeks of trying, not my style. i found the leets' comments amusing though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If AO was half as finished as Luclin was it would have been <br />
a better game.<br />
Even when AO was released it was barely playable.<br />
<br />
Leets look like dewinged parrots to me. :p</div></div><hr />

It was like September when they said it would be a few weeks till Chapter 2 was up.  Have they said anything about that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joseffe</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 10:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">June 1st  they will release chapters 1 thru 12 :)<br />
