<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xaresh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK.. I have asked everyone that I can think of and no one can help me.  I talked with my GM from Bristlebane for half an hour and he had no idea what was going on.  I have done my epic 4 times up to the point of getting the Shield of Falsehood.  I have received the shield 5 different times because I discovered I could just talk to the wandering.  My faction went up from indifferent to warmly.  But the spirit will not give me the gem that I need to continue to the Spirit Sentinel in EJ.  I got Black Dire's pelt in a Mistmoore raid the other night.  Can I turn that in and get the rest of the epic started without the gem from the Wandering Spirit?  I am so frustrated it's insane.  I've been working on this since December and am stuck.  Someone please help!<br />

You too seem to be the victim of the recent patch, with un-announced changes to our epic. :(<br />
<br />
Look here for my tale a few steps later in the path for the Spear of Fate:  http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=1515<br />

Feel free to add a comment about your troubles, or I'll update it later myself.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Are you sure you don't already have the gem?  It's called a &quot;sparkling gem&quot;.  Check all your bags and your bank because if you already have it, he won't give it to you.<br />
<br />
Also, I could be wrong on this one but it may be worth looking into: you say you are just &quot;talking&quot; to him ... are you turning in Woe/Envy/Marr's Promise also?  In some quests, you won't get an item back (e.g. the sparkling gem) if you don't actually turn anything in.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Just read the 2nd post (must have been made when I was writing).  Ouch.  I don't know what you do now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Don't u have to be near max ally to turn in the tear, and MAX ALLY to turn in the scale? From what I can tell, this just makes you not able to do Ghisok 40 million times...<br />

Turnining in diary from neh, hit ally<br />
Turning in tear,got message my faction could not get better.<br />
Turning in scale, got message my faction could not get better (again).<br />
<br />
Now, my faction may have been a little higher, since I had to repeat the erud's crossing part about 10 times (those sharks just love me). And I turned in a spare set of ghiosk books as well (shrug, they were gonna rot).<br />
<br />
The bug appears to be that quests based on faction were fouled up. Folks allied to coldain were having their 7th shawl eaten, other folks were getting message &quot;I will not aid beings like you&quot; when they /conned ally. I wonder what will get broken in the patch to fix this defect in faction code?</div></div><hr />
