<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i play a female ogre shammy lvl 52, and its great being the only female ogre shamn over lvl 50 on my server heheh.<br />
<br />
But thers hardly any guilds on kael faction, and the ones that are on giant faction  are 60+ guilds.<br />
<br />
LAst month i found out that ogres have a 15% exp penalty  ACK!<br />
I avoided trolls and iksar cos of the high exp pen, and now i find out that i had one all along. DUH! whys is that info NOT in the players guide?  because verant are sneeky underhand bastards that why(<br />
<br />
however till luclin i didnt really have a choice, as i have tried babr shammy and gave up at 30&gt; they run too slow and night vison is a pain; i am a melee orientated shaman and babrs are just too wimpy for my style of play: ogre was the obvious switch.<br />
<br />
so anyone know is vashir have a exp penalty??<br />
<br />
i am assuming that barb and vashir have a 5% penalty??<br />
<br />
btwi hear that haflings get a 5% bonus&gt; so tha fastest lvling class is hafl rogue, as they have the lowest exp per lvl required. Not that i fancy trying a rogue personally, too entrenched in shammy ways: if i swoped classes id move to sk or monk, or at a push chanter.<br />
<br />
ok so anyone have info on kitt kat exp penalty?  its a damn shame they cant bash   /cry  <br />
well at least i get to cough furballs in mobs faces  heheh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">HFL: 5% bonus<br />
BAR: 5% penalty<br />
OGR: 15% penalty<br />
IKS/TRL: 20% penalty<br />
Rest: no bonus nor penalty</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">halflings and barbs should NOT have bonuses or penalties IMO, dam arslings<br />
<br />
<br />
edit : class bonuses and penalties where removed a while ago so any arsling class will need the same xp to lvl as any other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lovista Atreides</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">While they did remove all penalties for certain classes, they decided to NOT remove the bonuses of 10% to Warriors and Rogues because they didn't want anybody to feel nerfed.  So the fastest leveling race/class is a tie between halfling warrior and halfling rogue.<br />
<br />
That is all :)</div></div><hr />
