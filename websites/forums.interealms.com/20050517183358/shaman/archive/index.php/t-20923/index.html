<br />
EQ has been more work than play for quite a while now, and it's time to tend to RL.  It's also time to make a g'bye post, and try to stop reading ALL EQ boards, if I really want to quit.  I think treating EQ like a cigarette or heroin addiction is really the only way to get away.<br />
<br />
Yes, this line is getting tired, but it bears *cough* repeating.  This board has given me the tools I needed to make myself the kind of shaman that people sought out regularly.  I want to thank those of you who are still left - for the advice, for the guides and walkthroughs, and for the insight that kept this game fun a lot longer than it would've been.  UgZug's alchemy guide, the hunting ground posts - these things (and more) meant I could supply myself and my friends with toys and ideas.  I'm grateful to all those who shared their hard work, so the rest of us didn't have to reinvent the wheel.  *grin*<br />
<br />
The people drawn to the shaman class (those who chose it without knowledge of or regard for in-game balance issues) I've found to be (in general, of course there are exceptions) exceptional people.  It's one of the reasons the Crucible always stood out to me as one of the most pleasant EQ boards to come to.  It's been a real pleasure to exchange information with all of you.<br />
<br />
No, I couldn't always do it, but I TRIED to remember where the name shaman came from, and to attempt to do it justice with the things I said and did while borrowing that name.  It's certainly not an empty exercise, and I'm looking forward to rolling up my WoW shaman, if only for a chance to continue attempting to keep those ideals in mind.  (google searches on shaman and heyokah are very good reading, especially if you enjoy RP'ing at all in game)<br />
<br />
Ramble, ramble.  Be good to yourselves and each other.  Remember that EQ is a fun game, but a crappy job.  If you stop and realize that playing this game is less fun than your job... remember that you're paying THEM...   Good luck, bears.</div></div><hr />

Enjoy the journey in RL.  Congrats on your freedom.  So many of us are heading that way, it seems.  I know it's been nagging at my mind, as well.<br />

Be Well,<br />
