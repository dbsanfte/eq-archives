Shields and blocking<br />
 <br />
<br />
We're planning on reviewing the possibility of giving an innate chance to block when using a shield.  We've been hoping to do this for a while, and it should be getting a realistic review in the near future.  We'd like to increase the value of shields, and make it a worthwhile choice for players who might normally dual-wield weapons or use a two-handed weapon.  We plan on balancing this against classes which use shields by default, and therefore wouldn't be making any trade-offs to equip a shield.<br />
<br />
Im truly hoping that shaman fit into this category, but unfortuantly Im not optimistic.  <br />
<br />
Ive carried a shield for 60 of my 61 levels now.  There was one level where I used a 2hb, but that was mainly an accident as I flew through level 53 so quickly (bout 4 hours).  Because most 2HB weapons dont give the stat increases that a shield and spear/blunt combo does many shaman feel required to carry a shield of some sort.  <br />
<br />
Because of our role in groups/raids, Shaman also take a beating.  Its pretty much unavoidable.  Thats why we can wear chain armor and use a lot of good AC items.  But our Dodge skill, like all wis casters, is capped at 75, which means nothing.  I can count on one hand the number of times that Ive actually seen dodge work for me, and I dont have to use three fingers (Thats two times for you ogre shaman out there...).  <br />
<br />
Id like to see this innate ability given to the shaman class.  Most of us carry shields so large they cover our upper torso's and heads; why not make it so that we can dick behind the shield and mitigate a round of combat or two.  Is it unbalancing to save the shaman in your group a little pain?  I really dont see how.  In fact, I would like to see clerics and druids included in the ability.  I think the time spent in implementing this would not be unappreciated by any wis caster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I doubt that wis casters would fall into the categories described by the devs, neither would the Knights. Wis casters almost never use 2h (unless they have one of the really nice ones like the PoFire one off birds) and Knights have such wild 1h weapons they already use shields a hell of a lot.<br />
<br />
Would be damn nice to have, but I am not optimistic.</div></div><hr />

There was a time when shaman did tradeoff for a 2h weapon.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Personally think that the Dervs were aiming this at Warriors and possibly Rangers and Beastlords (Not sure if those classes use shields or not, I always dual wield with my BL, but he's only lvl 36) I actually used 2hb exclusively from 16-57, going from a Groaning Mace to Barb Spiritist Hammer to a Corpsegrinder. I switched from Corpsegrinder to a Thunderous Mace and Tae Ew Shield at 57. Stats all stayed more or less same, HP did not change at all, but AC went up +50ish with shield, and as said above, most Shaman will use a one hander and shield for the AC and stat boost</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unless SoE is planning on adding some absolutely insane warrior 1hb weapons and some sick shields I cant think of a single reason that any warrior would even consider using a shield.  Dual wield is the ONLY thing that gives them an edge over Knights.  2 hands swinging and hoping for a proc or some good hits is the way most warriors are able to retain agro.    If they arent dualing them they are only doing half what they could be.  They have some insane 2h weapons right now that are finally getting warriors to open up to giving up the dual wield, but untill the 1hs sword drops that is 75/15 with EB and the 200AC 500hp shield with FBVIII on it I dont see how a 1h/shield combo is viable for a warrior.  <br />
<br />
Rangers might use this functionality, but rangers are all about damage and most rangers I know do more damage plinking than swinging only 1 sword.  <br />
<br />
BL, monk, rogue dont use shields, so any effort in applying the ability to these classes is wasted.<br />
<br />
So who is left?  Wis casters and INT casters.  In my mind this should be a caster ability.  Casters have very few mitigation abilities.  Shamans and clerics are the only casters that are actually geared to take a few hits but that is a measure of raw AC and not any mitigation calculations (dodge, repost, parry, etc)  INt casters and druids fair far worse than we as they wear cloth and leather which doesnt have near the raw AC that our gear does.  Why not give casters a few saving throws behind a shield instead of watching them melt under even a slowed onslaught?<br />
<br />
Its late and Im tired (and slightly drunk) but it makes sense to me.  show me where Im off base.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Since most shamans already now use a one-hand weapon (or even a non-weapon) and a shield I doubt SoE will focus much energy on making shields more useful for us.<br />
<br />
And for my ranger to switch from a Windblade to a 1-hander and a shield it will have to be some quite monumental changes I can promise you :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, you make quite an eloquent case for why a Warrior or Ranger would not want to use a shield Thorzion. Personally, I use 2 handers with my Warrior. GSoT holds agro nicely in Valor, and either that or my Windblade outdamage any one-hand combo I own, though I admit to investing my plat in good 2 handers, so my DW set up isn't two Fleshgrinders or anything better. One of these days I'll drag some unsuspecting friends to Droga for the new agro pair that drops there.<br />
<br />
Let me use the same logic you did on why this is not an int caster/wis caster ability. Shaman and Clerics already use shields in most cases for the AC benefit knowing they are going to take a beating, so they fall under the catagory of classes that use shields by default. All int casters and Druids lots of times I see carrying a book or doll or stein or some item other than a shield in their off hand, presumeable for focus effect and/or stats. Why should they give up their effects/stats for &quot;an innate chance to block when using a shield&quot;? Those 5 classes are all about mana pools and effect focci, and they are supposed to give up their bread and butter for a chance to block a blow on the off chance that they did not properly manage their own agro? Casters are supposed to go splat quickly. They know the job is dangerous when they take it wearing nothing but a flimsy robe.<br />
<br />
And the reason I believe that this is aimed at melee that do not normally use a shield is this quote We'd like to increase the value of shields, and make it a worthwhile choice for players who might normally dual-wield weapons or use a two-handed weapon.<br />
<br />
Nowhere in the article does it say how they plan on making it a worthwhile choice, so I'm not going to speculate on what the Dervs would have to do in order to make a Warrior or Ranger sheath their offhand weapon and strap a shield on the arm, but once they do figure out a game plan, then it will be up to the players to decide if it's a good trade-off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thorizon I am afraid you are off the mark a tad. Warriors in the upper Tiers of PoP rarely use dual wield, in fact not a single one of my guilds tanks uses DW any more. Those that lack Blades of War (Rallos Zek in Tactics) use Stone Etched Warsword (PoEarth mudwalker ring), Vanazir (Time Saryn) and one uses the 2h off General Durav (PoFire).<br />
When tanking bosses and trash in elemental planes and Time DW is a death sentence due to the wild riposte skills of the mobs. Plus the big 2h weapons have massive damage bonusses and aggro inducing procs.<br />
A couple of them occasionally switch into Furious Bash shield (poEarth Arbitor) and Bloodfrenzy or BoC, but it's exceptionally rare that they do.<br />
Our Rangers do use shields when they are on crowd control kiting simply for the extra AC.<br />
As a rogue I never use a shield and am stuck with DW due to not having a 2h pierce option, but my role is DPS, however I do suffer rather badly when someone aggro flips a mob and get 2k+ ripostes.<br />
<br />
Having read through the developers statement the idea is to encourage use of shields in those who would not normally use them, Wis and Int casters routinely use a shield so while we as shamen would benefit from this change I suspect that we wont be included.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the Umbracite swarm orb out there, anyone Vex Thal and up likely has that instead of a shield, depending on what they chose to go in those three slots.<br />
<br />
Not to say I wouldn't like to have a shield heh :)<br />
<br />
Don't think it'll affect anyone but melee types, although you could make an arguement for shaman being included, since they are the most militant of the priests.  Personally, I'd rather see the Dodge cap of 75 get upped to 125 or more myself, its kinda antiquated from the first days of EQ when mobs that hit as hard as pop mobs didn't even exist as an idea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let me translate this for those of you not fluent in sonyese:<br />
<br />
<br />
This eye candy will sound really impressive, but in reality have no purpose in our game other than something to point at and say &quot;See! We listened and gave warriors a new ability!&quot;. If all goes according to plan, we will be able to ignore the deterioration of the warrior class for another 3-4 expansions *easily* thanks to this masterful subterfuge on our part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Cirin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I dont really see why boosting our defensive abilities would present a balance problem at all. Especially with a shield...while we will never become as proficient with weapons as a melee class, I dont see why it would be unrealistic to be able to defend ourselves as well as one. As someone mentioned above, our dodge cap should be raised, and I think we should be able to block and maybe even parry to a certian degree. We arent supposed to be the front line necessarily, but as warrior-priests we are defintiely in the thick of things more often than not. I can only hope  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Odesin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Seen talk of warriors and rangers, but what about the paladins and shadowknights. Most I have seen tend to stick with a good two hander...maybe the changes would make it worth while for them to swap out in some situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">(in cased you missed it, this will be a bone thrown to warriors to stop the complaining, that will do absolutely nothing for their gameplay issues)</div></div><hr />
