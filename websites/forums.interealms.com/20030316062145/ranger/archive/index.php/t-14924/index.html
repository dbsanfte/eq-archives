<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jmtasu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm KoS to Dain, need to do my 9thj ring, any easy way to get faction? Tried killing TMax's throne room tonight, but thats a pain and need at least 1 very good group.<br />
<br />
Was thinking about turning in lots of toes and making the sandwich for the shawls.<br />
<br />
Anything else?<br />
<br />
Have been told I can sneak up on dain, but can't figure out how to do it without gettign aggro, seeing you can't turn in while invis anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Andruil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I managed to do it by redoing the rings and shawls a few times.  Pain in the tail and boring as heck, but it works.<br />
<br />
The easiest answer that I've found yet is to find out when Tormax is going to be killed.  Be in zone and launch an arrow at him.  A couple of those hits should get you set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>MistmeTunare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">just do coldain rings 1 - 7 a couple times.. my personal favorite is going into the bazaar and looking for rygor invasion plans.. easiest and fastest way to get faction hits imo.. oh and you can also MQ ring 7 for a good 6 - 8k so good luck..</div></div><hr />
