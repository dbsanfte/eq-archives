yeah, thanks god. Did you see though that the group version lasts less long than the single version, barely one hour :/ (single only 1:12 hours so not much of a difference). <br />

Well, better than agi, thats for sure even though I still expect to get tells for Wrulan.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You guys complained that you had buffs that didnt matter, now you are complaining when you get ones that might matter???<br />
<br />
Sheesh!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You guys complained that you had buffs that didnt matter, now you are complaining when you get ones that might matter???<br />
<br />
Which guys?  <br />
<br />
Guy_1 complains about one thing, Guy_2 complains about another thing.  You lump that all together dismissively as if it's the same person, representing everyone.  That's a very lame argument.<br />
<br />
It's pretty obvious why talking that way works in your own head, though.  You say &quot;you guys&quot; because you aren't a shaman, Tugela.  You are a warrior with a shaman buff bot.  You play the warrior because it's fun, and you don't play the shaman because it's not fun -- you just drag it around because it's a useful buff bot that demands maybe 5 % of your attention.  So it's not as if you are part of the group that cares about shaman class improvements.<br />
<br />
The part I don't understand is this.  What do you as a warrior get out of coming here to the shaman board and making little sniping attacks like you do?  You've got yourself a sweet set-up:  you've got a 65 warrior main and a 65 shaman buff bot, and you think it's pretty cool.  Well then, why not just have fun playing it?  <br />
<br />
Can it be that you can't really be happy unless you come here and make your little cutting remarks to people who are trying to figure out  -- not always successfully -- how to make the shaman a fun class to play?  I would want to think better of you than that.</div></div><hr />

wow...slight over reaction there.  Tugela was right by the way.  They improve our buffs to include something useful on top of stat increases and you got nothing but complaints.  The funny thing is, I have never heard any other class besides a shaman say that stat buffs are useless</div></div><hr />

<br />
Uggok hit the nail right on the head.  What you guys need is a single buff that takes care of everything at once and has a useful duration, rather than half a dozen buffs that each do one thing or last for short periods of time.  <br />
<br />
Shamans need an active, exciting role to maintain interest and draw back those of us who have left the game. This is apparently not being understood by developers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I for one like this new buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>LachdanonColdpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well obviously you cant give the spell a long duration, or people would just ask you for it, and then go level for 2 hours without you. The short duration isn't to piss you off, its to make you a &quot;wanted&quot; group member again. <br />
Idk if you remember, but I think we were the king of buffs at one point. And im pleased as punch to be recieveing decent buffs again. If you feel that landing a buff on a tank, and refreshing it isn't effective or enjoyable, then perhaps you need to reconsider what your class is. <br />
<br />
Last time I checked, tanks liked more damage, as apposed to less damage. Everyone beniefts from more DPS. If you feel unappricated when you refresh their buffs when they start to wear out, Then perhaps you should look at clerics. They've been Refreshing and Refreshing people's HP from the begining of time lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yes, if it wouldnt have been groupable it would have been a P.I.T.A. <br />
<br />
However! It gives us NOTHING new to keep us occupied in a stimulating way at a raid.<br />
<br />
On the contrary, what it really does, is add a small small tiny bit to our desirability. Nothing to make us a better choice than a BST in a GoD group though...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well obviously you cant give the spell a long duration, or people would just ask you for it, and then go level for 2 hours without you. <br />
<br />
Yeah, we all know how clerics and chanters are hosed for ever getting a group because their buffs last a long time.<br />
<br />
The short duration isn't to piss you off, its to make you a &quot;wanted&quot; group member again. <br />
<br />
We all know this, but it is a crappy way of doing so. <br />
<br />
Idk if you remember, but I think we were the king of buffs at one point. <br />
<br />
We were only the kings of buffs to people who didn't parse and thought that all those green numbers must mean a whole lot because they meant a lot in D&amp;D.  Remember DEX helps wizards crit!  We now buff much better than we ever did before because we have FA  (useful despite the annoyance) and can cap haste.  <br />
<br />
And im pleased as punch to be recieveing decent buffs again. If you feel that landing a buff on a tank, and refreshing it isn't effective or enjoyable, then perhaps you need to reconsider what your class is. <br />
<br />
If you find watching your buff timer run down and refreshing buffs to be an engaging, challenging or exciting gaming experience, well, I don't really have anything to say other than &quot;I disagree.&quot;<br />
<br />
I am a loss on the &quot;reconsider your class&quot; comment since when I started this class it rocked with unparallelled debuffs, excellent heal efficiency, solid dps, and about 2 buffs to cast on most raids.  You seem to enjoy being a buffbot, so I guess you are happy that SoE agrees with you.  Saying that this is what our class has always been, however, is not true.  You could have erased every single buff from a Kunark shaman's book and they still would have been an obscenely powerful class.  Buffs were a miniscule portion of a shaman's power then.<br />
<br />
If you feel unappricated when you refresh their buffs when they start to wear out,  Then perhaps you should look at clerics<br />
<br />
I don't feel unappreciated, I feel bored.<br />
<br />
They've been Refreshing and Refreshing people's HP from the begining of time lol.<br />
<br />
Healing is a lot different than rebuffing.  Healing in most difficult encounters takes at least a little bit of judgment.  On the other hand, it would be trivially easy to program a bot that rebuffs everyone every x minutes.  If it can be done trivially by an automated bot, that is pretty strong evidence that it is not particularly entertaining for actual human beings.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, to clarify.  I am not saying that these buffs are bad.  I am just saying that they are irrelevant to our real need, which is a viable active role in contemporary Everquest.  I have a strong suspicion that SoE thinks that buffs like these fix many if not most of our problems (if they even admit we have problems), and that is BS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kenneth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I guess I don't get it.  It is the upgrade to Agi, except better b/c it doesn't buff the stat; it goes straight to the effect.  I guess it doesn't bother me that much b/c I already waste my time keeping wrulan up.  (I fully expect that this will overwrite wrulan too, so you won't have to worry about casting both.)<br />
<br />
I would love to have the upgraded stat buffs in an all-in-one style buff though.<br />
<br />
And, I would really like it if Champion (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=5417) (which is the upgrade to FA) had a longer duration than 6.5 minutes.  (Though it may change, I won't hold my breath.)</div></div><hr />

Seems to me like some people like the improvement, some think that it's still lame, and some think having more buff spells to swap around will get aggravating.  I don't see this thread as nothing but complaints.  Sure, it includes some complaints, but also some speculation, some worries, and some generic frustration.<br />
<br />
I've read parses at Steel Warrior and Ranger's Glade about the very small effects of stat increases.  Worthless?  Well, no.  Significant?  Stamina has a real effect, but it diminishes quickly at high levels; and as for the other stats:  well, no, the difference they make in dps is very very minor.</div></div><hr />

Buff spells are something we should be casting every now and then! I personally hate having to repeatedly recast the same spell on our main tanks not mentioning any spells in particular (FA) because they think it's needed. <br />
<br />
<br />
Buffs should have at least a hour timer at high levels. <br />

This is a good spell. It will not need to be cast every 7 min it will last for a while it has a use with in a group. Now we need something to do after we buffed and slowed the mob!</div></div><hr />

Gotta agree with litgruv on this one. ANd for those that say long casting buffs are a bad thing, whats gonna happen when someone dies? They want to be rebuffed and don't want to run to PoK to get them, they want the buffs when they get rezzed. Take away rezz and clerics aren't needed in a group for most encounters because druids can heal good enough, but players want to be rezzed, they want to be buffed back up afterwards also. <br />
Nice buff IMHO&gt;</div></div><hr />

To be usefull in most fights, BoV needs to be refreshed on a constant basis. On large targets we are talking 20-30 seconds. Except in specific fights, and depending on cleric availability (more often than not they can't be spared from the chain), you typically get BoV at the start and it isnt refreshed. So, you lose the benefit very quickly once you engage. It's primary application in most engagements is to improve tank survivability on the initial engagement or tank switches, times when healing might be a bit ragged.<br />
<br />
If people dont like casting FA, they will loath BoV. The new AGI buff on the other hand will work for far more than even the longest fights. Both spells will be used in conjunction of course, but the fact is that the spell in its current form should become one of our more valued buffs. Making our buffs more useful is one of the things the class asked for, and is apparently recieving.<br />
<br />
I'm curious, how are you parsing this spell on test when its a 65+ plus spell which is presumably available from OoW content?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">It's not whining if it's appropriate.  Yes, we've asked for new buffs.  We also asked for buffs that had a decent duration (ie, NOT avatar).  If they give us nice new buffs, but make them 2-3 minute duration where all we do is sit around and wait on buff timers . . . F 'em!<br />
<br />
I know for a fact at least 90% of the people here resent having to cast avatar in it's present incarnation.  1 minute recast, 6 minute duration = massive annoyance.<br />
<br />
If, as it currently appears, SoE is going to try to turn us into a 'enhancement' class instead of a priest (someone else can track down the thread where they list shaman descriptions), and they aren't going to give us dps, but instead try to make us groupable by having decent, but very short term buffs, I for one am going to retire.  That is a perfectly valid reason to bitch.<br />
<br />
Sure, you're groupable, but do you really want your major contribution to the group to be 3 or 4 spells that you have to time religiously?  A series of spells that don't really require you to pay attention--just come back to keyboard and refresh?  Can you think of anything less worthwhile or more boring?<br />
<br />
Healing, dps, ability to tank, crowd control, long term buffs.  Those are the important factors, but only the first 4 determine groupability.  This appears to be something that escapes SoE.  :p<br />
<br />
Good buffs (short term or long term) aren't going to make us fun any way you cut it.  They are a patch for a class that's still fundamentally broken.<br />
<br />
Step in the right direction, but not there yet.  Don't abuse each other over these spells--they just don't matter yet!<br />

change the title of this post to &quot;the new agi, but better&quot; please. currently its totally innacurate based on what the spell you're referencing actually is.<br />
<br />
er? if you read the post I was refering to the way this spell will become even more of a pain in the ass to the shaman community than FA is. I actually think it's a nice spell but if you do any raiding, you'll quickly find out that FA /tells from every melee and DPS class in the raid can be a major pain, especially if your spell set-up does'nt allow for FA. The irony is that we get a spell that not only every Melee will want, but every class and his pet! <br />
<br />
The duration debate took over and was very intresting, for this to be effective in a raid situation the only way you'll be casting this is per group, MGB's will be blown on more important buffs Fos7, ToT's and maybe AG if you have more than 2 - 3 shaman in raid. Saving an MGB to rebuff a raid incase you wipe, would in my opinion force this to be done by groups rather than MGB.<br />

Well we are a buff class, so it being a pain in the ass is something you need to get used to. Its not like we are the only class in the game with pain in the arse things to do.<br />
<br />
You think MGB's will be blown on other buffs. Then wouldnt it stand to reason that this will help shaman raid desirability. I mean you are talking atleast a desire for 2 more shaman per raid. And even if you dont have a MGB present, why is this that much harder to cast by group then any other spell ? Ive done many raids where i was the only shaman or 1 of 2 and you blow your MGB on focus then canni and mod rod for the mana for the rest, having the clerics heal you when your low on heal and the necros feeding your mana pool.<br />
<br />
So from my pointof view, no matter how you look at it, it will be a good thing cause in the end itll be a better buff and beyond that its exactly what we asked for. Thats right, the whole community asked for this and we got it, so to sit here and complain about it being a pain to cast is just plain silly IMHO.<br />
<br />
But thats just my angle.</div></div><hr />

How exactly will this become a pain in the ass?  A spell that's TGB'able with a 1 hour 3 minute duration and a 525 mana cost is a joke to keep up on a raid.  Swap it in once per hour and recast, simple, done, over.  Don't have to think about it again for an hour.  54 man GoD raids = cast the spell 9 times, canni up, mem something else.  FA is 6.5 minute duration buff that needs to be memed at all times if you want to keep it up on multiple characters.  The leap you're making in your post is ridiculous.  Hitting 9 groups with a buff every hour is not even in the same PITA ballpark as FA, or the same league, hell its not even a vaguely similar concept.<br />
<br />
er? Did you read your own post?  Did you read the spell data before you made the post?  have you read the spell data YET?  If having ONE GD group buff to cast on top of Fo7 and SOMETIMES ToT, with 3 shm to split up the casting.....<br />
<br />
I've done plenty of raiding, its about the only thing I do in EQ anymore, other than some occasoinal item farming for friend's quests, trials to help flag people, etc...and I'm failing to see the collosal problem a 1 hour 3 minute duration (+scr +scrm +foci...) GROUP BUFF will cause.  I am failing to see how this is in ANY way the &quot;New FA??? BUT WORSE!!!!&quot; and I am failing to see what the hell your point is OTHER than that, which you haven't even attempted to make a reasonable case for.  <br />
<br />
I read the post, I saw what you were referring to, and I'm telling you that you're wrong.  NOT that I disagree.  This is not a matter of opinion.  I'll repeat it again, a 1 hour duration no recast group buff is not going to be even close to the PITA that a 6.5 minute duration, single target buff with a 1 minute recast time is.  Even if everybody wanted Ancestral Grace casted on them 5 times before they were satisfied, this would not be AS MUCH of a pain in the ass as FA....and you're trying to say its going to be MORE of a pain in the ass?<br />
<br />
To put it in perspective, I think 1? of our pally's has MGB, and they don't bitch about casting BSS, which has a whopping 15 minutes of extra duration; in Ikkinz trials, our necro doesn't have MGB, and he doesn't bitch about keeping DMF up to deal with the gfluxing mobs, the beastlords save MGB for paragon, and they don't complain about keeping SD up (45 minute duration...), hell plenty of raids we save cleric/druid MGB's for MGB heals, and they don't complain about single group buffing 9/kaz (though admittedly there are typically about 2x more clerics and druids AT LEAST at a raid than there are shaman)...casting group buffs without MGB isn't a big deal.  I take it you didn't raid much preluclin when we had to cast Focus of Spirit single target and group stamina on raids?  THAT was a PITA</div></div><hr />
