<br />
DING 60!<br />
<br />
Wish it came with a large chunck of Mithril so I could catch my blacksmithing up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>LARRY</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Grazt ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Grats,<br />
<br />
What do you have planned next?<br />
<br />
I'm in the Euro final beta and have chosen (and will choose) a PVP server so that I've got options if/when I hit 60 :) I'm a slowarse player though so that will be a long time after the game gets released in the UK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well on the alt side things there is still alot for me to do. My wife plays now and she zoomed past my alts so will catch up with her and play with her. <br />
<br />
Also have a few friends from eq who all moved seemingly in the same month and all were stuck with dialup and now couldnt find wow in their stores. So will be playing at the front end with them for awhile finally. <br />
<br />
As for 60 plans. Started my tour yesterday of all the instances. Plan on hitting everyone. From the little ones i can solo through and the medium ones to finding groups for all the higher ones. Also still finding all the zones I might of missed and the mobs in them. <br />
<br />
   Tackling Elite mobs too see which ones i can take and which ones send me packing. <br />
   <br />
 Honestly kinda enjoying not grinding any exp for a bit too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Why don't you knock out two birds with one stone and take your EQ friends through the instances ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Melkiah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">grats on 60, but are you saying that you skipped all the instances on the way up, just to grind to 60? If so, you missed out on a lot of fun, as instances at the appropriate levels are where wow really shines imo. rfc, wc, gnomeragan, sfk, sm, uld, zf, atal hakkar, mauradon, etc were more than worth hitting. I hope you didn't skip all of them, cause learning the dynamics of the higher level instances is gonna be tough without that background, particularly the raid zones. not impossible, just tough. many groups won't have that kind of patience =\  <br />
<br />
side note, a fun instance to solo through is Gnomeragan. when i started enchanting, I began hitting the lower lvl instances pretty hard for blue drops to disenchant, and this one was my favorite. once you get the key to the workshop, you can skip a lot of it and head straight to the last few bosses. neat zone. <br />
anything lower than Gnomeragan is just way too trivial to bother with, and the loot is pretty poor. I cleared sfk several times one week, killing everything, and only got a cpl blue drops and a handful of greens. it's not worth the time unless you are leading lower lvl friends through it. i haven't tried to solo sm yet, but I think parts of it would be very fun and still challenging at 60, particularly some of the bosses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/agree.  Instances with a good group of friends are the best part of WoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Nah didnt skip them. Did some in pickup groups. Ive done a ton of quests and worked on my professions (mining 275 blacksmithing 245). I didnt want to get all my alts to high that i really want to play so stayeed focued on my main after I got into the 50's. <br />
<br />
See my friends are just going to be getting in but unfortunately in staggered amounts so just having to play it by ear and see how they want to play.    <br />
<br />
   Thinking going to have some varied levels but it might be a week or two before they even really get playing. Long term plan is to do all the higher ones together. I'm not going to ruin the lower ones for them Thrashing through with my main so I'll either do them with an alt or just go for the heck of it solo is what i meant. <br />
<br />
Is part of the reason I hit 60. People get tired of me asking &quot; you get wow yet? you get wow yet?&quot; lol. <br />
<br />
So think running around solo in some of them will just be way to kill some more wait and when ready go through with a level appropiate person. I dont ruin the surprises. <br />
<br />
Is hard to be patient waiting for them to be able to join me in wow I'll tell ya that. I'd been grouping with them pre pop and LDON and luclin so looking forward to doing these instances with them. Ive enjoyed the ones ive done alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Speaking of instances i forgot to ask.<br />
<br />
Anyone have an absolute favorite one?<br />
<br />
Part also what i meant by running to all the instances is finding them and any that need keys getting them. Doing the one for scholo ( think its that one , Argent dawn person gave me the quest)<br />
<br />
Ive enjoyed finding the quirks of each one ive been to so far. Did BRS other night but didnt get to finish to many wipes. <br />
<br />
So anywhoo enough of my babble any favorites out there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Sounds like a lot of Alliance out there, so I'm not sure how much it's gonna mean, my saying that Wailing Caverns is still my favorite instance, even though it was 20 levels ago.<br />
<br />
I think a lot of it has to do with what kind of group you had, and whether you hit it at, before, or after the ideal level range.   We hit WC at the perfect time.  Had some deaths, but finished the whole thing in two attempts, did some wonderful things for our gear, and really strengthened the way our little group of 3 works together.  I think it exploited a lot of the weaknesses in our group that needed work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">So far Maraudon has been my favorite instance but I'm only 53, a warlock, and an alchemist.  Maraudon is almost exclusively full of demons and elementals.  Being a warlock, I can charm the demons and mezz demons/elementals so that was a good deal of fun.  Its also just a really, really, big instance.  We were there for 4-5 hours clearing different things and not because we were slow.  There are some really neat looking areas in Maraudon as well.<br />
<br />
Being a warlock and alchemist one of my favorite potions are the elixir of shadow powers.  They take 3 ghost mushrooms and Maraudon is a great source for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I like gnomagedon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I leveled from 18 - 24 exclusivly in Wailing Caverns on my pvp Shaman.  Same group of 5, we beat the whole thing 2x over 5-6 sessions.  <br />
<br />
My personal favorite instance was Blackfathom Depths.  I've done Gnomeregan and below.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Scarlet Monastery and Maraudon.  Both follow the similar setup that I like best -- multiple actual instances for 1 &quot;dungeon&quot;.  Go through 1 part, get a key that lets you do next, etc.  Then when you get higher, you can just run the main one a few times to get loads of loot =)<br />
<br />
Uldaman boss fight is a lot of fun, but the rest of the instance gets a bit tedious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">One of my favorite fights was in the Zul'Farrak. After getting the prisoners out the fight at the top and down the stairs was really fun to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Maraudon is the best for shaman loots.  I've gotten some really lucky drops.  First time I went, 5 minutes in, an epic shield drops and I won the roll.  I've gotten new bracers, gloves, neck, 46dps staff, and best off all, a Charstone Dagger off the Princess.  36dps and 2 mana regen every 5 seconds +11 int.  Goes great with the epic shield :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Wasnt a big dungeon fan untill Maraudon, tons of drops, and I was wide open and fun.<br />
<br />
BRD sucks so far.<br />
<br />
There is two differnt instances in Maraudon? we did the princess one, didn't know was others?<br />
<br />
Mill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'm only 35 now and the only instances I've done are:<br />
Ragefire: Didn't like it; quite boring to me. Really simple, but then it's meant for like 15's so it can't be too hard.<br />
<br />
Wailing Caverns: Wasn't too bad, some fun parts but wasn't fantastic either.<br />
<br />
Blackfathom Deeps: (I think that's what this one was, it's way out in the booners, with just a crappy little horde outpost with a flightmaster some quest givers and like a baker or something on a beach with lots of crabs around). It was pretty fun, but I went through it at too low of a level; so nothing would land; with people who were too high for it; so we just blasted through it to get me the endquest reward (15+ attack sword). I'd like to go through it at the appropriate level with one of my alts some time.<br />
<br />
Gnomeragon: I though it was fun actually, though the alarms could get damn annoying if you missed one. My friends hate it though; so they took me through once and won't go again. <br />
<br />
Some junk one, right next to thousand needles: Bleh, not fun; just boring.<br />
<br />
Scarlet Monestary: I had a blast in this one, but because we didn't have any form of CC, and we kept getting adds from hell; kept it chaotic. Which I love.</div></div><hr />
