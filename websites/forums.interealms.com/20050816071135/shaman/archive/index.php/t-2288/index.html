<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">with luclin, and the intro of racially specific pets, why dint they change the shaman ones too?<br />
<br />
they should be an opaque version of the bst ones.<br />
<br />
FURTHER maybe they should have a religion based form spell&gt;&gt;&gt;each deity has a associated animal, wich the shamn can turn into aka the bear form<br />
<br />
kinda buggers up vashir tho lol&gt;&gt;&gt;they agnostics DUH!!!<br />
<br />
its great to see more religion specific trade items, and maybe in POP there may be more religion specific spells??</div></div><hr />

And no beastlord pet for me thanks, I want one with the old drakael dire wolf graphics...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I want my pet to be opaque, a little bigger, and have a new attack animation.  As someone else said, the attack animation looks like a cat covering up its sh1t with litter.</div></div><hr />

I must say that BL-model pets would be cool.  As would a neat rabid bear graphic.  Not that I would want them to take anyone off the DoT-stacking project to work on them, of course :)</div></div><hr />

I dont want a different looking pet.  I like having a pet druid/ranger.</div></div><hr />

Yes, this still happens occasionally even with the new pet models ;)</div></div><hr />

If you have Luclin models turned off, your pet still looks just like a druid in wolf form.  I have an old slow laptop that runs in this mode.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, they are good ideas, but they won't be implemented unless all the various pets and deity forms are already in the global models file.  VI is struggling with a huge number of models that can appear in ANY zone - wolves, elementals of various kinds, bears, all the PC races (male and female), skeletons, imps, etc.  All of these models have to be loaded into the global common model file, which always consumes memory no matter what zone you're in.<br />
<br />
Adding 8 or 10 new models to that file just isn't going to happen.</div></div><hr />

After Luclin I actually changed my /pet attack button announcement to read<br />

SIC 'EM DOGDOG!!!  SHAKE HANDS VICIOUSLY WITH %T!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Mez be more then happy to share pet models wid the beast masters.  No need to have any new models in da global at all for dat.<br />
<br />
They can also remove da new shaman pet model for all I care... like da old one better.<br />
<br />
Looks like there is a strong coralation between race and thinking the dogs are just fine.  Wolf looks good next to a barbarian.  Not bad next to a Ogre or even Troll.  Wolf looks very stupid next to da Iskar or da Cat.<br />

I can't get Jobober to say that anymore, since June 5 pet patch :( What's up with that?</div></div><hr />

Give me the wolfy and give the Iksar Beastlords a furby or something :D</div></div><hr />
