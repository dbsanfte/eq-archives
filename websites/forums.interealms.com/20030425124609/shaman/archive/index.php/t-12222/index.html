<br />
Can you all please give me some advice on what items I should upgrade.  I currently have 30K to play with.  I know I must get HP/AC items.  Also his AC is around 947 unbuffed and Wisdom is 197 but for some reason I cant get Magelo to show that.  I:ve been thinking to lose some wisdom, possibly to 165 or so, and get more HP and AC items.  Thoughts on that please?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.  Here is my link<br />

<br />
Looking at your equipment you're pretty well kitted out for your level, upgrades are going to come as you and your fighting force progress.<br />
<br />
Face and primary slot are about the only slots that I'd be concerned about upgrading urgently, personally, you'd lose some of that wis you mentioned there and losing some for some HP isnt a bad strategy at all.<br />
<br />
I didnt hit 2k unbuffed till 60 but it was pre-luclin and PoP and it certainly wasnt 1.9 at 58, doing good :)</div></div><hr />

bp - drop for tae ew bp <br />
cloak - if possible a hiero would be decent but not really needed with the hp and mana on your current one<br />
head - slime covered rubicite coif<br />
<br />
Other then that there isn't much. Unless your really willing to drop wis for hp then get grey flesh sleeves and barbed dragonscale boots.</div></div><hr />
