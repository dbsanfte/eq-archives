<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Crug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am on Xegony server and until recently, I was leveling up at HHK killing nobles and bards.  Well I was sick of all the waiting for the camps to open up so I decided to try Sebilis.  I was in Seb a while back, but could never get a group since it was always filled to the brim with 58+ characters farming AA points and what have you.<br />
<br />
Well I zone in to find only 20 people in the zone.  I shouted for group and on first shout I got invited.  I was shocked and I headed immediately to b1 where the group formed up and then headed to Pickler.<br />
<br />
XP was great and I got some nice loot in the form of precious gems and some randomly dropped items (Seb Scale, Dragon Horn Ykesha, etc).<br />
<br />
I made about 500pp from the gems and loots in oly about a 2 hour session.  Plus I got over a bubble of exp in addition to regaining lost exp from a death.<br />
<br />
This is THE place for 51+ (I am currently 52 and I plan on staying for as long as I can).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1 bubble in 2 hours? Is that one blue bubble or one orange?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Crug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yellow my man yellow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Good luck to you Crug.  I worry though, that sooner or later you'll be so sick of frogs you won't be able to stand it.  I know I was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Crug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I just want xp.<br />
<br />
<br />
ANd moneys that JBB isn't just gonna walk up to me and tell me to take him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">ANd moneys that JBB isn't just gonna walk up to me and tell me to take him. <br />
<br />
LOL. I just had a funny image in my head of a walking talking JBB begging my to take it. :p<br />
<br />
I want to try this because HHK exp seems to have slowed down. Was probably just bad luck getting all the light blues but I still want to try some place new. I'm not sure if I can get the seb key though. I can probably kill the frogs but I heard I need IVU to get past the &quot;undead&quot; mobs that are supposed to be crawling through that area. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Run through Trak Teeth, find the ruins (they're behind a bloody hife wall). Keep to the right side of the &quot;pavement&quot;, following the edge. you'll find a fallen pillar that's kind of pointing at the building that has the tunnel to seb. Though you can hear the ghosts, none wander the area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've been in Seb recently and love it, however there are some downsides. Sometimes you can walk in there and get a group ASAP and have a great time. Then again other times I've been there it's been packed to the rim with peeps and impossible to find a camp. Be prepared to die, man those froggie wizards are my bane --  their nukes hit me for 600+ and I have pretty good resists. Be prepared for long CRs and lots of delays in getting people to Seb and to a camp.<br />
<br />
A few days ago I was in pickup group that decided to just wander around and we ended up going to the bar/arm and it was a total blast.  BUt for every group like that you end up in a group that can't go very far because of a lack of enchanter/cleric or levels or the place is heavily camped and have to settle for the rock area which is painfully slow xp.<br />
<br />
I actually get better XP soloing but nothing beats a good seb group for fun.<br />
<br />
Hint: get your abjuration up to 200 before seb. The talisman  of shadoo/jasinth group buffs are really helpful and it sucks to fizzle those so much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I got my key and got in to seb tonight. Only 10p people on. :/<br />
<br />
Tried to get a group for like half an hour and I couldn't so I just camped. Gonna try in a minute now that I've taken a brake. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Armak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">1 year ago I were in Seb all the time,( Im max ally with Cablis and Trak hates my guts). I had tried in KC at lvl 51 and been fed up with all the idiots. So I came to Seb and found people who knew how to play. I had a great time and alot of fun and learned alot from all the good players.<br />
<br />
3 weeks ago and decided to revisit Seb. I got a group pretty quick but it was something that irked me. The people in the group asked strange questions and made some strange remarks. But what the heck. disco were open so we claimed the camp.<br />
<br />
while going down the Dhall i began to notice strange things, people in my group made very stupid things and soon we had to run for the exit. Lucky no one was camping exit and I had not lost my SoW.<br />
<br />
After that I started to chat with them and lo and behold, most of them had got tired of KC and decided to go here. <br />
<br />
I tried 2 more days and some groups. Almost every group were full of KC fools. Seems they have moved to Seb but havent learned a single thing about dungeon crawl.<br />
<br />
I got PoP soon after so I left Seb, but my memorys of the funny times in Seb were indead soiled by that experience.<br />
