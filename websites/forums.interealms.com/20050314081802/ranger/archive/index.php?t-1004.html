He's a shy person who finally got up the nerve to ask some girl out. The girl told him no at school, and then sent him this letter: He showed it to me today, and by the way he looked after getting it you could tell that he's not going to ask another girl out until he's about 30. Here's what the letter said:<br />
<br />
(Edited),<br />
<br />
What the hell did you think you were doing? How did it EVER penetrate into your ugly ass head and into that tiny brain of yours that I would EVER consider even being seen in public with your fat ass? When I saw your mounds of fat waddling towards me today, I was scared. I thought that maybe I should run. Never did I imagine that even someone as worthless and stupid as you would stoop so low as to ask me on a date! It took me a few seconds to register that you were actually serious, and then I was so disgusted that I could have puked right there. I want to know who gave you the idea that I could even stand you, so I can personally set them on fire. I'm better than you. The guys I date don't cause seismic disturbances when they walk. What? Are you going to cry now? You had no chance at all. You have no chance with anyone. Sacks of s*it don't get girlfriends. What's it like in your deluded little mind, anyway, where people actually care that you exist? Go shove a box of Twinkies down that ugly hole in your face and stay the hell away from me. Or better, find a cliff and throw yourself off of it. It would make the world a much better place, not to mention a safer one. We have enough earthquakes.<br />

This guy is only slightly overweight, but apparently some people can't see that. Is there anything I can tell him after this ordeal that would make him feel better, because I can tell he's feeling pretty crappy right about now.</div></div><hr />

She is truely a selfish, worthless b*tch that needs to be put in her place.  She is obviously so self centered that she doesn't know that everyone, not just *PoPuLaR* people have feelings.  Her little letter was completely innappropriate and I'd like to find out where she lives...not to ask her out, but ask some of my fellow female ranger friends to give her a nice ass kickin!   No person, no matter how fat, small, ugly, nasty...whatever, deserves this chick.  No matter who she gets, they are much better than her because anyone who can write something like this to someone doesn't deserve anyone, not even the person who asked her!</div></div><hr />

I remember highschool, by the time I hit highschool people had me so convinced i was worthless socialy that when my future husband asked me for a date I actualy asked him &quot;are you joking?&quot;  I seriusly was not sure if he was messin' with me.  I   dont think any organism on the planet can be quite as cruel as a highschool student sigh.  <br />
If I was you, I would tell this poor kid that she wasnt good enough for him.  She obviosly wasnt nice and would have treated him badly even if she had said yes.  He needs to look for a nice girl who's lookin for a nice guy, wenches like that one deserve themselvs for company. <br />
 He obviosly has a good friend in you since not only did he come right to you for comfort of some sort, but you went right to others for advice to help him feel better.  If he has more friends like you he should be fine, make sure he realizes it's your REAL friends that count.   The people that are there for you to help you when you need it.  I doubt he will ever feel GOOD about the incedent, but he should be able to realize what an unmitigated bitch that girl was.</div></div><hr />

Just let him know that not only are there nice girls out there who don't mind a bit of extra weight, there are actually some that *like* their men with a bit extra.  <br />
<br />
Just be there for him, and listen to him, and try and mitigate the damage by pointing out all the girls that *do* talk to him!<br />

I really don't consider those things I absolutely must have, but everyone needs someone to hold onto sometimes.  Prom is in 2 weeks or so and it's stuff like this that makes me hesitant to ask anyone to go, already being an extreemely shy person in RL myself  :(<br />
<br />
This person obviously has some serious problems if they were that mean to your friend.  If it were my friend I would tell him that she is the one that is missing out, and that someone as stubborn and bitchy as that doesn't deserve a person like him.  <br />
<br />
Then again, there is this saying my dad likes to use and I try to base my actions off of when someone offends me: I don't get mad, I get even.</div></div><hr />

Someone needs to walk up to her and slap her around a few times.  It's people like this that made my life in high school miserable.. I just happened to have a popular cousin whom I got along with really well, and to find out that half the cheerleading team wanted to be friends with the class nerd (myself) only so that they could try and catch my cousin's eye hurt.  Tell your friend that got the letter that the little child who wrote that letter to him will never grow up, and that someday, he'll go back to the class reunion, happy, very successful, and gorgeous, look over, and see that she's turned into a frumpy little housewife with 4 kids and will never have held more than a minimum wage job.  <br />

Chicks like that need to be thrown into a pool of sharks.. of course, with her acid tongue, she'd prolly poison the poor shards</div></div><hr />

Tell your friend he's lucky she said no, girls like that destroy guy's souls.  <br />
<br />
One of the things that he should remember is that the more attractive and popular a teenage girl is, the more likely she is to be a status 'ho.  Steer clear and stay sane.<br />
<br />
Look around and check out the girls who aren't the raving beauty queens.  Take a look at the ones who are band geeks, computer nerds, library assistants, or do something off the popular track.  Trust me, they could use a friend.  They enjoy dancing, movies, good conversation and dining out as much as the Britney wannabees, and are usually brighter and better people as well.<br />
<br />
Beauty is ony skin deep, ugly goes straight to the bone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buntar</div><div class="date">04-10-2002, 12:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, that's probably the meanest thing I've ever seen anyone do. I wouldn't doubt her friends helped her/pressured her into writing it, but maybe not.<br />
<br />
Your friend doesn't deserve her, nobody does.  I can only hope someday someone treats her this exact same way.  <br />
<br />
Tabres, don't worry about asking a girl out.  If she's this mean you don't need her anyways and you should be glad you found out before hand.  I know it's easy to say and not do it, though. I've had a huge crush on a girl who I know likes me and I haven't asked her out yet.  I know what it's like to be nervous about girls, even though I'm a really outgoing person.  Go stag if you have to.  Dancing is lame.  Just goof off.  <br />
:)<br />
<br />
Edit: Good idea.  I know 2 wrongs don't make a right, but they can be fun!  Have your friend send her an email something like this:<br />
<br />
Dear xxxxx,<br />
<br />
I'm sorry for the confusion.  I thought I was asking out a very nice girl, and I could grow to look past her somewhat unattractive facial features and ill tempered body distribution.  I figured that one who looks such as yourself on the outside must have some redeeming qualities somehere in there. I suppose everyone is wrong at least once in their life.<br />
<br />
Once again, sorry for the confusion.  Hope you find someone willing to love you for what you are.  You might try looking for a man with thick glasses and breaking them before he sees you.  Just a suggestion!  <br />
<br />
Peace.<br />
<br />
Note, this wasn't made to make fun of the way people look, just that with how vane she is if you can convince her she's not good looking it could be hell on her mentally.  Maybe she'd rethink the way she acted, but that's probably going too far.  Sorry for the long winded post. :)</div></div><hr />

This was authored by a group of people.  This would explain why it is so cruel.  She was being as hateful as possible to show her friends she had no intrest in someone the &quot;crowd&quot;  didnt approve of.  And they where helping, each trying to one up the other with cruelness for her contribution.<br />
<br />
Actually my biggest concern is why your friend asked someone out he obviously knew nothing about.  Was his effort based on looks?  <br />
<br />
Im getting too old to play nice so Im just going to say this bluntly........ as cruel as she was, he just earned a life lesson.  AND if he is going to let some little snot he doesnt really know get to him then he needs to work on his OWN self esteem issues.<br />
<br />
And as far as revenge, that is a waste of his energy and time.  Revenge is a childish action and would damage himself more than her.<br />

Reading that makes me want to cry - I can imagine what it must've felt like to receive something like that.<br />
<br />
Remind your friend that someone who is so f'n shallow and cruel could NEVER be good enough for him.  It'll probably take him a long time to get past such a horrid experience, but it sounds like he has a very good friend in you, so remind him, every day, what an awesome guy he is and how stupid that shallow b*tch is for tossing him away.  Remember, b*tches like that usually end up being miserable for the rest of their lives because they married a pretty-boy bastard who treats 'em like crap (hey, what goes around comes around).<br />

Hopefully one of these days that pathetic excuse for a woman realises what she threw away by being such a wretch.</div></div><hr />

Silly, don't you remember being in highschool?  :)  You see someone in your classes, she's attractive, popular, friendly with the &quot;in-crowd.&quot;  You're drawn to that energy, you develop a crush and fantacise about what an awesome person she must be and how great you'd get along . . . okay, maybe I'm romanticising, but hey, if the guy's as shy &amp; sensitive as he sounds, it's probably not all that far off the mark.<br />
<br />
Anyway, what better way to get to know someone than by going on a date with them, where you can presumably talk to them and find out what lies behind their appearance.  But whatever his motivation, it's too bad this fellow had to find out what kind of person she is in such an awful way.</div></div><hr />

hehe, call it tough love :D......What if she had said yes?  Could you imagine being married to this woman?  :p <br />
<br />
Just wanted to point out that he is not blameless (from what little info we have).  <br />
<br />
Anyone seen the new penzoil commercials?  Good example of how to approach relationships in life.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Thorneblade<br />
<br />
[edit] Opps oh yeah, about going out and getting to know someone.  That is a great idea.......however I would hope that you would just talk to the person enough to know wiether or not she would go off like this girl did........BEFORE you ask!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zhemau</div><div class="date">04-10-2002, 02:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The thing about a letter like that is that it seriously makes me wonder as to all her insecurities.   I can't imagine a normal, average, run of the mill person being able to author something as hateful and hurtful as that.<br />
<br />
My sincerest thoughts go out to your friend - it's never easy to face rejection, especially when it is done so tactlessly as this was.  Just remember... &quot;if you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day.&quot;<br />
<br />
The flip side of this is that after seeing that letter, it should be enough for your friend to realize how poor a choice she was for a crush... her true colors have shone through.  I know that when I had a big crush on a girl recently and she started doing some stuff that I didn't expect from her, well... the attraction quickly started to fade.   He can do roughly one million times better :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Samin Rainbow</div><div class="date">04-10-2002, 03:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First thing I would tell him- Don't let one person's views or attitudes ruin your outlook.<br />
<br />
Then explain to him these are HS girls. Highschool is a time in most ppls lifes' that is possibly the most screwed up in terms of point of views, attitudes, common sense, political standings, understanding anything to do with life, etc. Face it, at that point in your life, you are pretty much clueless about anything.<br />
<br />
Also, explain to him that the world is made up of nice and mean ppl. Nothing you can do about it. Just keep looking for the nice ones. Laugh off the mean ones. If it's only words, then TEPHLON baby- NO STICK!  I would tell him he will be better off, once he can laugh at these guys and gals, and NOT take them seriously. Face it, they are losers.<br />
<br />
Tell him, we have all been there at some time. Heck, I went up and down for the first 29 years, then I found my wife and soulmate. He will be better served to keep trying, and if nothing else, spend as much effort on other things besides girls right now.<br />
<br />
Find alot of things to keep your mind off girls. Sports, games, schoolwork, jobs, etc.<br />
<br />
Also tell him, that ole Samin didn't go to either junior or senior proms in high school. I broke up with my girlfriend in my senior year, and would have went stag (plus spent lots of money) so me and a friend who was in the same shape went out and enjoyed the nightlife instead. I have never regretted missing the prom one bit too. Face it, most proms are just an excuse to get to the party afterwards, so it's not a big deal if you go ahead and find the party first lol.<br />
<br />
Tell him to hang in there, and learn to laugh at jerks. It pisses them off when you don't take them seriously hehe.:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">04-10-2002, 04:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is this real?  I mean, did you really see a copy of this letter and is that word for word?  This isn't just some forwarded urban legend?<br />
<br />
If it is real, then the girl is a Witch with a capital B.<br />
<br />
Firstly, now that he knows her true colors, he should know that she's obviously not the perfect gal for him.  Hell, with an attitude like that, her life will be one of misery unless she changes it soon.<br />
<br />
Secondly, high school girls are flakes.  Seriously, they just are.  They don't know what the hell they want.  By the time they graduate and hit college, it finally dawns on them that they were complete idiots in high school and try vehemently to look for guys who don't treat them like pieces of crap stuck to their truck tires.<br />
<br />
I know that does little for your buddy at this very moment.  Just focus on other things other than girls.  Education will be much better in the long run at his age.  High school relationships last about as long as a rare spawn in EQ.  Those girls will eventually pull their heads out of their butts and figure out what's really important in a guy.  Just be patient.<br />
<br />
Finally, if your friend feels like he needs a girl to be happy, he needs to REALLY re-prioritize his life.  No relationship will ever succeed if you don't first love yourself.  It just can't.  It's a codependent relationship when that's the case.  Tell him to build up his self esteem and like himself for who he is.  Excercise is probably the greatest antidepressant and endorphin releaser that I know of, and it's all natural.  If he likes who he is, not only will he not give a rats ass when beeyotches turn him down, but he will attract REAL girls.  Self esteem and confidence is a huge turn-on for girls.<br />
<br />
Good luck to him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The guy should straight walk up to her and hit her in the jaw.  <br />
<br />
But baring physical violence, he should give the note to an administrator.<br />
<br />
Giving the note to an administrator is kinda boring though, i know two wrongs dont make a right, but write her a letter.  <br />
<br />
Or just embarrass her, in the middle of lunch get up and go talk to her, then as shes saying leave me alone or something like that announce loudly &quot; No i wont go to prom with you so and so&quot; <br />
<br />
Just do something tho dont let her get away with that.</div></div><hr />

Hehe Numbuk, I was just thinking of this most amazing phenomenon.  Note that ALL women are evil from about age 14 to about age 19 (some don't ever get over it).  I don't know why it is, but females of the human species in this age bracket are capable of the greatest spiritual and emotional evil that you will ever see.  Am I generalizing?  Yes.  However, I'm basing it on personal experience, I'm allowed to generalize.  At any rate, men in this age bracket are evil, but it's more a physical evil.  They're into the shoulder punching, locker slams, and whatnot.  That pain goes away.  The emotional pain will still sting every once in a while for years.<br />
<br />
Your friend just got a dose of this.  It's impossible to avoid, as hormones and peer pressure tell you that you HAVE to find a girlfriend.  So he'll be back in the saddle looking for this to happen again soon.<br />
<br />
What was really funny to me though was watching what happens in about junior year of college.  The &quot;popular&quot; girls realize that their football stud won't be getting that NFL draft, and he's likely looking at a career as a high school gym teacher.  You'd be really surprised how popular chemists and engineers get when these women realize where the best shot at a decent salary is.  The sad part of the cycle is that a lot of the men don't see it happening, and don't mind they're being used.<br />
<br />
Do I have a point?  No, not really.  It will get better, but likely not as long as you're in high school.  I found that in college, people didn't identify as much with the cliques and were more likely to be friendly.  High school is pretty much where cynics get their best life experience.<br />

<br />
However, I'd tell your friend to count his blessings that she said 'no.' Think of how bad it would be to have a bitch like that for a girlfriend.<br />
<br />
All I can say is what I used to tell my little brother when girls treated him badly in high school: It does get better. The whole world is not made up of girls like that, and you will learn that the women who are worthwhile value heart and mind over cars and hardbodies. It doesn't seem like it now, but it won't be long at all before smeg-heads like this little prima donna don't matter any more.<br />

My senior year, I didn't have a date for prom. I asked a guy I'd had a crush on since 5th grade. After wo weeks of not getting an anwer from him, I found out from his best friend that he had asked a girl from another school. He didn't even have the guts to tell me himself. What's worse - I had to spend a week at state knowledge bowl with him, and a week at state science fair.<br />
<br />
I went to the opera on prom night, with my mother.<br />

High school romance sucks for just about everyone, boys, girls, the teachers and the parents. It's what happens when your hormones are telling you you're mature, but your bodies and minds haven't really caught up with them yet.</div></div><hr />

Hehe Numbuk, I was just thinking of this most amazing phenomenon.  Note that ALL women are evil from about age 14 to about age 19 (some don't ever get over it).  I don't know why it is, but females of the human species in this age bracket are capable of the greatest spiritual and emotional evil that you will ever see.  Am I generalizing?  Yes.  However, I'm basing it on personal experience, I'm allowed to generalize.  At any rate, men in this age bracket are evil, but it's more a physical evil.  They're into the shoulder punching, locker slams, and whatnot.  That pain goes away.  The emotional pain will still sting every once in a while for years. <br />
<br />
<br />
Someone tell my poor sister that guys are not emotional screw ups in HS.  A guy she really liked asked her to the prom 4 weeks ago.  She was very excited.  She has always dreamed of going to the prom after she would help me get dressed for mine.  She thought it made you a princess.  Anyway, mom and dad went out and bought here a nice dress and shoes costing over $500.  Same guy ends up going back with his old girlfriend and didn't even bother to tell her.  His best friend had to break it to her and she is now devestated.  So it is not just girls that are messed up.<br />
<br />
As for the prima donna, not all HS girls are that way.  I know I wasn't.  I do remember being scared of not being in the &quot;in crowd&quot; but I would never do this to another person and I know alot of my girlfriends wouldn't either.  This girl obviously has some growing up to do or she will find herself one lonely old maid.<br />
<br />
Tell your friend he is better off and there is a girl out there just dying for him to ask her out.  I firmly believe that there is someone for everyone.  I may be romantic and stupid but that is my belief.</div></div><hr />

It may have been funny, but I think he should let it slide.  He needs to work on his self esteem a bit imo if he can let someone like that bug him, as mean as she may have been.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To retaliate the same way would be stooping to her level. The letter was very childish. She obviously is pretty sick girl. Especially after that last comment. I pray for your friend that he will get over it and look for a more sane girl next time. To be attracted to someone like that can be a problem also.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) She has shown that she is obviously beneath him. To deign to answer her letter would be to give her credit for being worth the time to compose and deliver a response.<br />
<br />
2) The better revenge is to make her think her letter had no effect. If he can look happy and normal when she's around after that letter, she's going to stew about it inside, and it will eat her up.<br />
<br />
I don't know who said it but &quot;Living well is the best revenge.&quot;</div></div><hr />

And as far as revenge, that is a waste of his energy and time.  Revenge is a childish action and would damage himself more than her.<br />

You know normally I would agree with you.  But, I look at it like this.  A man kills someone.  People recognize it was a mean and horribly cruel thing to do but don't lash out at him or punish him for it.  What is to stop him from doing it again?</div></div><hr />

I mean, did you really see a copy of this letter and is that word for word? This isn't just some forwarded urban legend?&quot;<br />
<br />
I completely feel for this kid.  I remember high school as having plenty of humiliating moments.  However, I look at it this way, if this is a real letter from one person or a group of people, at least they didn't post it on the internet with his name and picture, or put it in some other public place in the school.  It's a cruel and horrible thing to have done, and I hope the person or persons who wrote the letter get some serious mental help.  I also hope the young man continues to trust his real friends enough to share his pain and to deal with it as well as he can.<br />
<br />
By the way, let's not make this about how girls and women are all cruel or stupid or flakes.  Suffice it to say, both boys and girls are fully capable of cruelty, stupidity and hatefulness.</div></div><hr />

Revenge and punishment are not always the same thing.  What is to keep her from doing this again?  Simply put, Karma.....as Daffious put it, &quot;What goes around comes around&quot;.  The more people she hurts, the lonelier she will become.<br />

She's also a kid and kids are cruel one day she'll grow up and relize how the real world is.  Highschool is a brutal envirment where you have tons of people who think they have life figured out and haven't lived life yet.<br />
<br />
I can remeber myself in highschool I was an *******, I can still remember a kid that I teased so badly he actually switched schools in highschool.  However today I relize the error's of my ways and hopefully so will this girl and hopefully your friend will come to relize that life doesn't end in Highschool infact it hasn't started yet.  I just wanted to remind folks that these are kids and that she will grow up.</div></div><hr />

Not hard to get that mental image. It's really funny how a group of people will do what an individual alone will not. (Herd mentality, I think it's called). Personally I doubt she'd have been that cruel, without the others involved. At least, this is what I think.<br />
<br />
As hard as it is, your friend needs to be encouraged to overcome his shyness. As a guy who never dated in high school for the same reason, I know the difficulty involved. Too bad I didn't find out till later that there was a couple of girls who liked me back then. <br />
<br />
If your friend can overcome his shyness, he may find out the same thing. = ))<br />
<br />
*edit*  I was shy, but not overweight. I had the opposite problem, 6' and thin as a rail. I got to live with the 'beanpole'  jokes, add the last name Cobb, and you can imagine what I got to hear from most folks. ; )</div></div><hr />

I just said that as a sympathetic generalization (if girls can call *all* men &quot;pigs&quot; after a break-up, then I should be allowed to do the same to them! *evil grin*)<br />
<br />
A lot of  high school girls are wonderful people.  The best ones aren't the ones that stick out though.  Some girls are just as shy and nerdy as us video gaming guys, but those ones are also just as intelligent, loving, and unselfish.  Girls get hurt just like us guys because of stuff based on looks.  Where guys get shot down outright, girls feel it by not even getting asked out.  My mother was of this crowd and she still looks back on her high school years with sadness.<br />
<br />
My advice:  make friends with everyone.  Like I said before, girls really like self-esteem and self-confidence.  And that can be summed up in one word:  attitude.  My close friends and I were probably the real definition of &quot;popular&quot; in high school.  Not because of the people we hung out with, but because we made friends with everybody.  And I do mean everybody.  Nobody was shunned.  And if some people didn't like us, we really didn't care ( we even kinda made fun of the &quot;popular crowd&quot; quite often, and that only scored us more points with the masses.  It's all attitude and how you carry yourself.<br />
<br />
I need to keep reminding myself that, even now.  It's easy to forget sometimes.</div></div><hr />

However, I'm going by my own experience.  I didn't see guys being vindictively nasty, just stupid, thoughtless, and childish.  I knew firsthand what cold, calculated torment was all about.  And her name was XXXXXXXX (don't think I'm that stupid after the internet lawsuit).<br />
<br />
I suppose there are some who look back fondly on high school, I'm not one of them.  I was just trying to get across that as evil as that letter was, to me it's not unexpected or uncharacteristic of the high school experience.  It's painful, regrettable, and uncomfortable.  But it's also going to shape your friend (hopefully for the better).  Maybe this will show him the type of person he doesn't want to be associated with, and he'll be better for it in the long run.<br />

<br />
I was in a very similar position when I was in high school. I was a big old nerd, and asked out the popular bitch that was everyone's main delight. Well surprise surprise, I got blown off *hard.*<br />
<br />
I was mainly embarrassed and felt like a big loser, but sucked it up, went to college, came out of my shell, and graduated. I am convinced that people change 100% from high school to college, because as others have already stated, high school kids really don't know what the hell they want. <br />
<br />
Anyway, a year ago when I got a job downtown I stopped into a bar after work for some drinks with coworkers. Lo and behold, who is my server? She looked pretty worn out and frazzled too. I loved it. She didn't recognize me either. <br />
<br />
I made sure to hand her a great 1 dollar tip on my way out as I told her that I hoped she was doing okay, because she looked SO much better in high school and I never expected her to end up being a sad cow waitress at a bad Chicago dive bar.</div></div><hr />

That said, the comment about the internet lawsuit made me realize that the letter he got is perfect grounds for a frivolous &quot;emotional distress&quot; lawsuit. That would really be the most damaging; you hit her parents in the wallet and see how happy her life becomes. <br />
<br />
However, as revenge tends to go, that would also be most damaging to your friend in the long run. He would get zero respect and zero friends in high school, and he'd have to go to college in Brazil to outrun the &quot;guy who sued a girl for shooting him down&quot; stigma.</div></div><hr />

, to your sister I would give some tentative advice.  My highschool did things backwards and made the junior prom the BIG one, the all out blow out, dressed to the nines shindig with prom queen and all.  But that was the one I had no date for.  I went stag, I was on the rocks due to a guy I had been crushin on who had dated me for over a month going back to HIS ex and saying we had never been dating.  So I guess I can sypathise.  I cant honestly say I enjoyed that prom.  I had friends who had dates, I was an emotional wreck. . . t'wasnt pretty.  BUT, the Senior prom I went with my future hubby and had FUN.  It was held in the cafeteria for cryin out loud lol. they tried to give out some superlatives that werent in the yearbook and gave me &quot;most likely to marry a horse&quot;  but I still had fun :)<br />
It's really state of mind, if her friends are gonna be covered in dates, I would take that dress and save it for senior year so I could blow em away.  But if her friends are gonna go stag, go have FUN!  Make this kid realize what he passed up on ;)<br />
<br />
Now so far as HS girls and HS guys. .  I hate to say it, but in my neck of the woods, they are still like that lol.  I work with 45 year old highschool kids rofl.  Rumer mills, cliques, the whole bit.  It's different enough that I can fit in, but I NEVER fit in well with the women, for some reason I have more fun with the guys, it's funny watchin them ogle the other women hehehe.  In HS niether would have anything to do with me, I had *counts mently* . . .roughly 5 friends throughout HS.  That was it, they were close friends, and I still keep up with them when I can.  We just seemed to be the only sane kids in the school at the time.  When I met my hubby I was 17 and he was 22, he was scared to ask me out, and I never thought he looked at me.  I was one of the outcasts, nobody looks at us!  My friends supported me throughout everything one way or another.  So I guess it took a mature 17 year old girl and a normal 22 year old guy to be able to find similar maturity levels hehehe.<br />
<br />
But really, in friends AND in dates/partners it's quality you want, not quantity or look.  You want a friend who will look out for you, like here.  You want a girl/boy friend that see's you for who you are, not who you look like.   When I look at HS pics I realize with a start, that I was actualy good looking!  Hourglass figure, not too short or tall, loooong brown hair and super pale, clear skin.   But the &quot;in crowd&quot; ousted me so often I never realized it.  You cant let these people rule your opinions about yourself.  More often then not, they are DEAD WRONG .<br />
<br />
ok startin to ramble so I'll end this post lol, dont let the in crowd rule you, they arent as smart as they think they are ;)<br />
<br />
(edit: put up the pic I was talking about for ****es and giggles, http://www.angelfire.com/rpg2/tymoriaspics/pictures/temp.html<br />
just to prove how bright the cliques are, this is fat to them lol, pic will be coming down in a few days though, not sure I like having RL pics available rofl)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinara</div><div class="date">04-10-2002, 02:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is extremely sad. I always wonder what makes someone be so cruel to another human being. I mean, seriously: what does it accomplish? Perhaps it makes her feel better about herself, but if that's the case, then she has some very real issues.<br />
<br />
The only thing I can do is reiterate what other people have said: he's lucky she said no. Going out with this person would mean he'd have to be subject to a lot of abuse. Contrary to what we hear on a regular basis, women are just as likely to dish out emotional abuse as men are. <br />
<br />
As for all high school girls being evil, this is certainly not the case. It wasn't for me. High school was one of the best times of my life. Funny, I wasn't in the &quot;in&quot; crowd, but I was always considered pretty (always in the fashion show, talent show, prom queen when I wasn't even graduating! Now there's a shocker). I always felt that treating people with the utmost respect was the key to being happy with who you are. At 16, my best friend was a 19-year old. He weighed 250lbs, wore glasses, and had thinning hair. He was by far the best friend I've ever had - to this day. Being around him taught me a lot about how to treat others - just by watching how he was treated. People would make snide remarks behind his back, and I was even once asked by a kid in my class: &quot;How much does he pay you to be seen with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
As a result, I always made sure to treat everyone the way I'd want my friend to be treated. If I was asked out by someone I wasn't attracted to - I always said yes. We'd go out for coffee, and I'd try to figure out things I liked about this person, making it clear that I wasn't looking for a relationship. I made so many friends that way... no wonder I had more male friends than female friends my entire life.<br />
<br />
Anyway, tell you friend there are nice girls out there, and he'll find someone perfect for him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lets forget about just High school girls, Guys are just as bad, High school is this massive competition for social status that as we grow up relize was retarded.  The Fear that nobody will like you is huge everyone wants to be liked.  Depending on what social circles your in dicatates your behaviour due to the peer presure of impressing friends ect..<br />
<br />
Myself I was sarcastic wise cracker who made everyone laugh I was class clown through humour others had fun and the preasure for me to continue busting jokes was firmly implanted in my highschool years.  The Problem was that I usually made jokes at others expense and I'm positive that yes those people despised me however I didn't care cause the people I hung with Liked me.  I didn't see it as a problem not till I was older and *Caugh* Wiser.  Not till I grew up.<br />
<br />
From someone that caused torment in Highschool trust me when I say do your best not to let it get to you or your letting the tormentor win.  From experiance to try ing to get back at the girl in the letter will most likely only cause you more problems.  Sticking up for yourself is always key but only if your the type of person that can fight fire with fire if its not in your nature you'll just be throwing on the wood.  Giving this girl more crap to lob at you.  I see lots of advice on ways to get back but the best advice was mentioned about the person who met the old crush later in life.  She hadn't changed and look where it got her.  Just shrug it off move on and do what you want to do.  Don't give her the satisfaction of trying to trade insults with someone it will most likely just get you in further over your head.</div></div><hr />

In HS, I was labeled early-on as a 'brain,' and the school was VERY small.  I graduated with 48 students in my class.  Only 10 were female.  It was never blatant like this, but I had a friend hook me up with a date for my prom.  She was very nice looking, and I couldn't understand why she was so cool toward me when we left.<br />
<br />
My friend later (years later) told me she had heard some of the girls in the bathroom speculating on how much she had been paid to go to the prom with me.<br />
<br />
I got over it, and as other folks have said - sometimes it is a spur to action.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tirunedeth</div><div class="date">04-13-2002, 09:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didnt date much in HS. I had been working full time and going to school since I was 14. My parents had divorced and my Mother working two jobs and still couldnt make ends meet. So as soon as I hit 14 I got a job to help out. So I had no time for dating. I was also horribly shy, and never asked a girl out the entire time. In HS I was the mysterious quiet type. ( that's what I was told after HS) The few dates I went on were cases where a girl had the nerve to come up to me.  I never turned anyone down. I figured she had the guts to come to me, when I don't have the guts to talk to anyone, there's got to be something there worth going out to see. None of my dates in HS were ever serious, but the one that always struck me as the best was a girl that was a little overweight and people bothered her at school. She came up to me at a birthday party and we talked for rest of the tiem we were there. Frankly I found her beautiful inside and out. We went on two dates and the day after the second date she told me that she didn't need me anymore. I dodn't really understand that comment, but took it in stride, it hadn't been serious and I wasn't  heartbroken by it. Later my sister (two years younger and at the same school) explained it to me. She had used me to make herself more popular. I hadn't really thought anything of it when she requested the dates take place at the two biggest hang outs of the in-crowd. They couldn't figure out why I ( who didn't go out with anyone) had gone out with her and started talking to her then. <br />
High school girls have a lot to deal with. Being popular and struggling to fit in, isn't easy. Not all of them feel the need to 'fit in' but those that do, can be some of the cruelest people. I'm sure whoever wrote that letter knew that her image was going to take a shot in the arm and she probably would have been ridiculed by her friends by being asked out by this person. Was it right to write this letter. Hell no. I guess what I'm saying is I'm sorry for the guy that recieved this letter, he didn't deserve this and he has my deepest sympathies. I also feel sorry for this girl though, that she feels that she has to demean this guy to make herself look better, it's kind of sad.</div></div><hr />

That being said, Im all in favor of revenge.

If her friends enthusiastically supported her in the writing of that letter, they will eventually turn that same cruel creativity on each other. If her friends didn't help her write it, they will eventually see her for what she is and will shun her. She'll end up alone. If she's lucky she will see her folly and change her ways, if she's not, she will grow old alone.<br />

The old saying that beauty is only skin deep, is so very true. LOL. A lesson learned at the cost of $1700/month in alimony.<br />

Tell your friend to find someone that shares his interests, his values, and can make him think. I think that he'll find that she's just as beautiful in his eyes as any super model could ever possibly be.<br />

So very true!<br />

When I read that I felt kinda ticked off as how a little girl in High School would have the nerve to destroy this boy's feelings like she did. What type of person gets off and writes a note to him saying all that? Tell you friend she's nothing more then coward, why didn't she tell him that face to face? damn HS note passing still around? I hated HS notes being tossed around.. &quot;Hey give him/her this note for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
If it was me, I would've poured mustard on her the next day!<br />
<br />
And Ven? You didn't have a friend to turn to in HS? well you got a few of us here at the glade now. :)<br />
<br />
/raises hand to Ven.</div></div><hr />

Just makes you/him sink to her level.  Back at my old job, all the girls seemed to love watching &quot;Jenny Jones&quot; on my lunch break.  I can't count the number of shows where the theme was &quot;You dissed me before, butlook at me now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Every single person who &quot;looked better&quot; than they did in high school (very relative term... I thought a lot of the girls looked better before surgery)... every single on of them, had turned into exactly the kind of person that they hated.  They were pompous, arrogant, and just downright cruel.  Using negativity as motivation to better yourself is one thing.... using it by means of revenge and becoming that which you hate is another.</div></div><hr />

Obviously she is filled with anger towards something else much bigger. This poor girl apparently has some serious insecurities and self esteem issues.<br />

Find out what they are, then use 'em against her. :D<br />
Yeah, OK, not your typical Vladimirr answer, but I'm in one of those moods today  (/evil grin)</div></div><hr />
