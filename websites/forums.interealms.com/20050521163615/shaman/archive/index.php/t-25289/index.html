<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jahvah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">*** Update Message 12/17/2004 *** <br />
------------------------------------- <br />
<br />
We apologize for the recent issues with our attempt to ease backflagging. Our coders and designers have worked tirelessly through the night to come up with tonight's update which should resolve the backflagging solution issues. We have also identified a few other issues and added corrections for them as well. <br />
<br />
- Backflagging issues have been resolved. <br />
<br />
- Raids can again enter Anguish. <br />
<br />
- Huntress / High Priestess titles should now display correctly based upon gender. <br />
<br />
- An itemization issue in South Karana and Splitpaw has been corrected. <br />
<br />
- The debuff in the Muramite Trial of Efficiency will not cast as often. <br />
<br />
- The mirrors in the Tower of Frozen Shadow should once again function properly. <br />
<br />
- The Monk AA Hastened Purification of the Body has been corrected to be 10% of the newly reduced reuse time for Purify Body. <br />
<br />
- Added the spell Tranquility of the Glade to the ranger's repertoire, which rangers can recieve by turning in a rune. <br />
<br />
- The berserker ability Crippling Strike should now have a fixed duration <br />
<br />

Not as exciting as the 12/15 message, but I thought I'd share</div></div><hr />

<br />
It used to be 5 mins, was it bugged so it casted more often in the 15th dec. patch so they're setting it back to 5 mins, or will it now be longer?</div></div><hr />

 <br />
From what I heard it was chain casting after the first patch.  I assume it will be back to every 5 minutes now.</div></div><hr />

ROFL that must have been a suprise!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">was like once every 5 secs I think after that patch.  No clue what it will be changed back to though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Spell is live.<br />
<br />
But....<br />
<br />
Rune turn in for this spell is borked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">what do you mean red.. and what the heck does the spell do anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think that's the new harmo, heard a ranger talking about it in a group a few days ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Val, all classes that had a level 65 mob lull/harmony spell pre-OoW recieved and upgrade to lvl70 in OoW.  Except Rangers.  Clerics, Enchanters, Bards, Monks, and Druids recieved a upgrade yet according to Brenlo Rangers recieving an upgrade would be unbalancing.  Tranquility of the Glade is basically a carbon copy of the Druid harmony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">oh, you kow what..i was reading this post on some named creatures and they were mentioning using harmony of nature's serenity instead of harmony to be able to solo pull the named.  I just now realized when you said that that was a druids spell (was on my new ranger yesterday and noticed that he didn't have the spell, but didn't look it up to see the actual statistics on it.. my bad).</div></div><hr />
