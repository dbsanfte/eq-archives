<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Am I the only one who is upset by how Shamans are represented in these comics?<br />
<br />
For lack of a better word Pennywise is an idiot!<br />
<br />
I present these strips as evedince.<br />
<br />
In This (http://207.44.131.131/archive.html?58?#53) Comic we can plainly see that Pennywise is a sad little wisdom whore, scared to bejesus that she might get agro for a fraction of a second. Gee I don't know how to tell if something is agroed enough, I have to ask the freaking warrior when I should slow.<br />
<br />
I then present this this (http://207.44.131.131/archive.html?58?#55) well she didn't even try to debuff reists, they when the mob of course resisted slow what does she do? &quot;OMG Please root it little druid!&quot;<br />
<br />
Then this! (http://207.44.131.131/archive.html?58?#56) So after the mob resists the slow and the mob is rooted, now you have a unslowed mob rooted 3 feet away from you. What is the last thing you would want to do? Thats right, sit down and mem a nuke!<br />
<br />
Go back to pedeling your sow potions you froglock scale wearing looser!<br />
<br />
EDIT: Aparently W T F withought the spaces is a bad word :p</div></div><hr />

If u don't get the jokes and if you don't like it use the back button.<br />
I read it and i think it's hillarious. Liek the gnome and the dorf tripping out &quot;Whoa that's some gooooood kei man&quot; :D<br />

Edit: Ohh almost forgot i am headed to the /gu comics site now need me to order you some Boo frickin' hoo juice? You get a better deal if u order 2 50 gallon drums.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ahh the ever-famous, &quot;If you don't like it, it's because you don't understand it&quot;<br />

Did I ever say the comic was not funny or amusing? <br />
Nope, I find it quite funny actually.<br />
<br />
Reading is fundamental, **** off!</div></div><hr />

Yeah i guess so. Its a comic dude get over it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Also soulsorm should win some sort of award for proving himself an idiot so quickly.<br />
<br />
You say that if I don't enjoy something I should simply &quot;hit the back button and ignore it&quot;<br />
<br />
Thats fine, its your opinion afterall. But maybe when your telling someone to &quot;just ignore stuff you don't agree with&quot; you shouldent do it in a post when you are doing THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF THAT<br />
<br />
Maybe you should really practice what you preach man? What a hypocrite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hmmmm jesus i can't let this go sorry but u sir are a moron.<br />
You are complaining about a comic's view of the shaman class when the comic has already made fun of the game several times and it is a COMIC GOD  DAMNIT. That one shaman in the comic is also not meant to represent ALL shamans. Not all the ppl who play a class are intelligent but it does not matter cause it's JUST A COMIC.<br />
Gee why don't they have the casting time there for the spells the shaman is casting? Would that be more realistic?<br />
OMG shammy memmed a nuke....GASP oh no dear god what are we gonna do.<br />
It's a freaking comic if you do not understand it don't read it or make your own comic in which not only will u draw the correct armor on the shaman but also remember to show what gem slots hold what memorized spells also. I can't read? I read the comic and it didn't upset me cause i understood it. YOU are the one bitching about a simple cartoon. What an idiot sigh.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Eh, its jokes, sometimes jokes arent based on reality. I didnt really think they were too funny , but that druid and dark elf were drawn real nice, wink wink, knudge knudge, say no more ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sheesh, so much anger :)<br />
<br />
  I liked that a shaman was even represented, and was eager to see how they worked the slow into a &quot;real life&quot; translation :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">These character names I am pretty sure were taken from my server.  At least some of them.  Neotrunx for example, the paladin . . . I took him on his first trip to HS. <br />
<br />
Other than that . . . ya the shaman looks like a goof, but what can you expect?  He's gonna get the punchline somewhere . . .</div></div><hr />

*cough* Pennywise is a TROLL.  If you dont like it, make a comic of your own. ;)<br />

lol, you notice they look like cheech and chong?  :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">So much anger soulstorm. Though no matter how many lame insults you spew out it simply makes you look like more of a hypocrite, not detract from it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Nice comics, i think you're geekometer might be reaching the critical stage if you're reading THAT much into this COMIC.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I believe you are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">humm.. where do you see that the troll is meming a nuke?</div></div><hr />

The battle was apparently organized pretty quickly for a troll shaman who was parked in the bazaar.  Maybe he wasn't prepared for it.  He still put the fear of Innoruuk into that gnome!<br />

<br />
The significant difference here is that he didn't post what amounts to a rant about someone's elses artistic effort posted publically for the enjoyment of anyone that cares to stop by.  He was probably stunned that anyone (read &quot;you, Mrens&quot;) could be so uptight that they'd have a hissy fit over a comic about something completely ficticious.<br />
<br />
Irony : One troll (of the message board variety), calling another troll an idiot.   :rolleyes: <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I can't believe this pinhead decided to post a topic about this.  I'm more upset as to how Mrens is representing the Shaman class!  LOL it's a comic you idiot, I can't believe you are pissed about a comic based on a fantasy game.  Reality twice removed, get over it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'm more upset about the missrepresentation of the bazaar arena..<br />
<br />
I can not believe that went on, without a team of 65's jumping in and killing everyone then corpse camping. Or at the very least, had some Gnome clerics sitting up outside the pvp area, healing and buffing the monks!!</div></div><hr />

Actually, I think you did it faster, my friend. :(</div></div><hr />

/agree<br />
<br />
SoulStorm is in a battle of wits against an unarmed opponent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">then present this this well she didn't even try to debuff reists, they when the mob of course resisted slow what does she do? &quot;OMG Please root it little druid!&quot;<br />
<br />
Straha had asked Pennywise to have Anna do something useful with her spells. What sort of useful things can a low level Druid do under those circumstances? Root. Thats about it. Penny was actually being smart and utilizing his teammates limited abilities to their fullest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I personally like the way the gnome was frozen stiff after an ice nuke and trying to tell his buddies &quot;Shh.h..h...sh..sh.a..m.mman....&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">To show you how petty this h8ting about the comic is, I give you the following link:<br />
http://pub149.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessage?topicID=29664.topic<br />
<br />
Yes, it's The Grove!  Anna is a Druid, Straha makes her constantly look like an idiot and the Druids LOVE IT!  GEEZ!  If even THOSE guys get it........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I love this comic, I have no idea how anyone could complain about it other than to troll.  Which, if it's the same Mrens from that 'other' board, is exactly what he's doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I dunno...  I kinda took Mrens' post as tongue-in-cheek, although the later replies make me question that.  ;)  Amusing comic, though - I really need to find the time to read through it all some time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">wish it was daily..:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>zolexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">With out going into frame by frame explanation here, Penny casted one slow it resisted. What she sat to mem was another slow while it was rooted (dont believe me, look at the spell effects).  A few frames later we saw the gnome freezing from a nuke.  <br />
<br />
She was told to have Anne 'be useful' hense having the druid root.  I have no doubt she would have handled it herself if the druid failed, but she wanter her to try first.  <br />
<br />
Penny didnt cast early for one reason...she was getting revenge for the frog comment!  Re-read, you'll se he making the crack about a frog shaman might cast faster, and Staha conceeding.  <br />
<br />
Anyway...as was said, it's a comic, supposed to be funny.  I find it hysterical.  And as a few posts ago said, the druid community loves it, necros love the &quot;blarg, death, fear me&quot; line, every class shown thus far is in awe of this work.  It's the subtle humor in here that makes things funny.  Read the message board for the comics site.  Usually any odd/interesting questions that arise are answered there.  Even a few shamans that were questioning Penny's actions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Vivyenne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Wish there was a Penywise T-shirt :(  Already have the Anna t-shirt for bf being a necro, but alas, no such luck.<br />
<br />
Pennywise is the name he took the name from for the shaman but the shaman in the comic is named Penywise (as long as we're nitpicking)  :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I think it's a damn good (and funny comic), lots of amusing touches and certainly not offensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I thought Pennywise is a guy? lol I know trolls are ugly but is it a guy or girl?  :confused:</div></div><hr />
