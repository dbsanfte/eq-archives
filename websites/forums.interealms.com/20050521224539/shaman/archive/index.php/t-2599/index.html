If you're level 35, you could do the totemic armor quests.  It's an olive colored plate look on shaman and it looked pretty fabulous to me with old world models on barb females.<br />

Also dont forget the shield!  I have an orb of the infinite void for my shield (it has the glowing insubstantial look), I think the only better shield graphic is the Shield of bane warding.</div></div><hr />

For me, I like the look of old school A: Rubi,B: Rune Etched. New world, I would say SS armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The fact that I never got a full set of RE is one of the great tragedies of my EQ career.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Gloriana, silver clad wonder woman is a mental image I shall treasure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Heh, I've always tried to play to being a fashion-shaman... through the lower levels I tried to get gear that looked decent..<br />
<br />
Some of the costumes I've had that looked good were....<br />
<br />
mid 20's  A Full suit of Blackened Chain from Runnyeye with the No drop Kilt off of Martar... that item was hoss to have just to say you helped kill Martar :)<br />
<br />
mid 30's  A full suit of the Imbued Northman Ringmail... I was one of the first on my server to wear Blue Chain.. it's was unique looking.<br />
<br />
Into the 40's I began focusing on Stats over looks, and I began to look like I'd been equipped at a Yard Sale.   at 54 I finally bought an Ulthork Hide Tunic because I was so sick of looking at the Bloodstained Tunic I had on.<br />
<br />
Later, after I joined a Raiding Guild, I fleshed out a very good looking outfit.   It was Vindi BP, Vambraces of Discontent, Onyx Chain Leggings, Boots of the Dead Dream and a Mithril Helm.<br />
The look was a full suit of Plate in all Dark Browns and Blacks.   I actually looked more heavily armoured than the Barb Warriors in Luclin since I hab plate graphic sleeves and leggings.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now that I've become an HP whore, I've begun to take gear based on stats over looks again...   I'm back to the yellow-green Kael quest chain sleeves, and Serpent Skin Greaves (?)  It's a leather based leg slot item that drops off Rhag 2, terrible AC (15) but good stats (5 Str 5 Agi 10 Wis 10 Sta, 40 HP 40 Mana, +5 MR,FR,CR)   As it is, I'm so far over the 1100-1150 soft cap that I don't care. :)     The kilt has a graphic of a Dark Purple Kilt with Bare Knees.    So once again.. I'm looking like I geared up at a Yard Sale. <br />

Anyway, functionality &gt; fashion, but for lvl 34-35 range and I would say totemic looks the best.  Ulthork is also cool-looking, and (if you can get it in a group or from a generous person) Ry'Gorr would be nice, too.</div></div><hr />

Fashion?  Maybe.  But more along the lines of 'Variety is the spice of life.'  Sure, we're all shaman, but we all choose different looks for different reasons.  Gloriana likes tossing braids:). Morkoraz doesn't think there is anything wrong with form fitting swimwear:). And so on and so on...<br />
<br />
We all look as bad as we wanna be...thanks for sharing everyone...I would encourage you to continue.  I've really enjoyed it.<br />

...but for your level it's a bit far off. <br />
I have no pic on it, but as soon as you can afford it... run buy some barbed ringmail... I remember feeling I was the prettiest troll in all worlds (old graphics) when I got my set of it ;)<br />

/edit: Just found an old pic of me with half the set (bp+legs) but will give you the general idea of how it looked :D<br />

As a barb shaman, I've always been partial to Halas' children.  Never thought I would ever prefer the 'look' of a troll.  But both of you look killer!  Mums you almost look like you ripped your wolfcallers off of someone elses body and then stapled it back together.  Que buff!:)  Looking forward to someday receiving my own set of velious armor...</div></div><hr />

Wanted to enlighten all who are not used to see pretty trolls around you, that female trolls (luclin graphics) in any kind of plate bp is the worst thing ever created in this game! In fact so bad (and this hurts to say) I'd even prefer to take on that goblin look we saw on the board just the other day. I have to sneak on my Vindi bp after the fight have begun and then keep blinding the rest of the crew with FoL all the time so they cant see, but still can fight the closest mob /nod /nod</div></div><hr />
