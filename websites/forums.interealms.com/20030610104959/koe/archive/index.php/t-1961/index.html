<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Boogahz Dokupuppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently had the pleasure this past Saturday of riding in my friend's dad's Chrysler Sebring convertible and let me tell you how nice it was. It had a great sound system, a nice leather interior, and did I mention that it was a convertible. Okay, I'm a poor guy who doesn't have the luxury of riding in such nice automobiles so this was a trip for me. It's sad but these types of luxuries are what push me to succeed. Like I was saying though, I not used to this sort of activity, but I learned some major faux pas that should be avoided next time, given that my friend ever lets me ride in there again. <br />
<br />
First of all, convertible owners and drivers get really offended if you tell them to lower or raise the roof while the cars is doing 60 mph. They are so protective of their cars. <br />
<br />
Having no roof over your head eliminates the privacy that one would have in a normal car. I only suggest dancing in the backseat if you actually have some skills. <br />
<br />
Even though you see people do it on television and in movies all the time, jumping in and out of the car without using the door really makes owners upset. <br />
<br />
With reference to the previous one, jumping out of the car involves landing on your feet in a graceful movement, not falling out headfirst whilst hanging on to the seatbelts. <br />
<br />
When you're in a classy car and you pull up next to another classy car, that Grey Pupon joke is no longer amusing. <br />
<br />
The strong wind that rushes by you while riding in a convertible is a main factor when choosing a prank to pull. Stealing someone's hat and holding it high above you is not a smart joke unless you have a burly grip or you can afford to but them a new one. <br />
<br />
You shouldn't interrogate the driver on how they were able to afford such a nice vehicle and suggest illegal gambling or drug dealing, especially not while being pulled over by a police officer.</div></div><hr />
