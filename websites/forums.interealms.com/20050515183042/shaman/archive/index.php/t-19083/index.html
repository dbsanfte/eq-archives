<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I see alot of talk on the boards about shaman wanting upgrades.  We are falling a bit behind but where does out power come from.  I have always seen the shaman as the melee buff king.  Acumen, for the stamina regen which is now sadly obsolete.  FOS, for the strength, dexterity and a side order of hitpoints.  Strength raising attack rating and dex adding more procs from the melees weapons.  What I really want is for FOS to become the melee equivalent of an enchanters VOQ/KEI.  Every pick up group I am in I hear the wizard or the cleric say &quot;I'll be right back, running to pok for KEI.&quot;  With melees basically maxed str and dex, our meleeing enchancing buff has become nothing more than a hitpoint buff.  What i would love to see is them to revamp the FOS line of spells.  Not a new buff that would take up yet another buff slot, but a soild FOS update that makes melees cry without it.  Adding time level melee focus effects would make this happen.<br />
<br />
I would like to see the following added to FOS<br />
+30 accuracy (lowers hit/miss ratio)<br />
+30 combat effects (increases proc rate)<br />
+2 shielding (lowers damage taken)<br />
+20 Strikethrough (You swing, they dodge, you strikethrough and hit them anyway)<br />
<br />
This would make melees stronger and give us more of a role.  Maybe these number are too low, or too high.  I just want to see melee get more from FOS than 544hps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Koridar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Heck, there isn't a single Tank or Knight who doesn't have Max Str in my guild atm =( and the rangers could get their str buffs from Daiku. I'm down with adding +20 strikethrough. Or perhaps more ATK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I also think that FoS needs something new.  Something like Ceno's proposed would be cool.  Also...longer duration, please.  It's just sad, compared to virt or kei.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ceno, make sure you vote for &quot;buffing&quot; in Henora's poll thread!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I personally feel our focus line and the cleric virtue line should have the hp values switched(virtue and seventh directly, then cleric hp buffs altered to scale to that value).<br />
<br />
After that, I'd love to see some of the melee effects added in lieu of str for sure and maybe dex ir not outright added with our current stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Islowem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">As you stated, dont know those exact numbers would work out, but this is a VERY excellent suggestion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Virulence</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Some kind of melee modifiers would really breath some life back into the shaman. I agree, your basic statistic buffs just don't really do much toward the higher end of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I like that list.  Maybe even stretch it and add some raw +atk to go with it.  Say 25 or so.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I like it. I wouldn't mind a self buff too with hps like Clerics and Druids get that is overwritten by 9 or Virtue/Symbol or both. Our rage self buff is pretty sad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Good idea but it also made me think of something else.<br />
What about FoS,Fot7 etc being able to put people over the stats cap.<br />
Maybe not the full str etc given but say someone with325 str etc could go to 350 but only with FoS/Fot7<br />
This is probably totally unworkable but hey just brainstorming here :).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">When they put in melee modifiers into Time equipment I always thought that we would get spells with similar modifiers.  Either on the focus line or a new lines of spells/buffs.<br />
<br />
Of course they haven't even indicated that they are considering this through the beta spells ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Glencannon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">What I don't understand is why Virtue has 1400 hps, and FOS only has 540.  Our HP buffs have gotten steadily worse compared to clerics over the years; didn't they used to be more like 60% of the cleric HP buff, instead of the 40% we have today?  <br />
<br />
I mean, c'mon...Pot9 has 618HPs on it...exactly when did the Druid line of buffs pass ours?  (Let's not even go into the mana regen inherent in the buff)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Come on... Comparing Aego or Virtue to Focus is coy at best, dishonest at worse.<br />
<br />
Focus of the Spirit (and the upgrade) is a combo of our HP buff line with our (mostly useless nowadays) STR and DEX line.<br />
<br />
Aegolism and Virtue, on the other hand, are the combination of the *2* different and separate HP buff line the clerics had (and still have, by the way... look up Faith and Kazad on the cleric line-up). And they get to pay a peridot per single cast for it too.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, comparing the HP of the Focuses to the HP of PoCabbage and Po9 is right on... Talisman of Kragg should have been comparable to Natureskin, FoSpirit to Cabbage and FoSoul to Nine. Now, there is a place where we got systematically undercut.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">This is probably the best idea that I have read / agree with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I really like Ceno's idea. Adding some attack to it is a good idea also. I also think we should get more hps, why should druids be able to provide a better buff than us, and lets just admit that we'd all trade Fot7 for Pot9 anyday. I know I would, more hps and mana regen instead of str and dex is a way better buff and we all know it. Druids suck, they don't deserve any good buff spells but they own us in hp buffage, and they got better travel spells also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">As much as I'd like to get away from the buffing world when it comes to new spells, Ceno's ideas would give some much needed spice to a bland and deflated buff-line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">i completely agree with this suggestion.  making fo7 a kei equivalent for melee's would be absolutely amazing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Fynris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Just in case SoE is lurking on here somewhere, I'll throw my vote out there... I think Ceno's suggestion is definately a positive step toward giving Shaman a much needed lift...<br />
<br />
/agree Ceno</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I have never seen shamans as the melee buff kings, because we have never been the melee buff king.  When I started playing (Kunark) everyone knew that stat buffs did rather little.  Clerics and Enchanters were always the dominant melee buffers, because they had the best varieties of the buffs that mattered: AC, hit points, and haste.<br />
<br />
Really, it wasn't until the introduction of ferine avatar into the game that shamans were significant melee buffers at all.  We were unequalled debuffers, and fair damage dealers (remember how ebolt was incredible for its time) with some backup healing ability.<br />
<br />
And frankly, I have no desire for them to radically transform our class from a debuffing/dotting class into a buffwhore/twitchbitch class that might as well just be the bot of a real character.  Because buffs are either things that bots can do trivially or else they are short duration, long recast pains in the ass like the avatars.  There is no third option.  If buffing is what the class is about, then the class is an avatar dispenser or a bot to shove in the back to rebuff every couple hours.  Neither of those options is appealing in the least.  <br />
<br />
I am not a buff whore.  I am not a twitch bitch.  I AM NOT A BOT.  I am a shaman, and I want to stay that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I don't know what game you're playing Uggok but it's not the same one the rest of us play.   Shaman have always been king of buffs,  every stat we can buff and we do it well.   I also disagree that everyone knew that stat buffs are useless back in the day.  Hell people STILL bug me for agility and strength, arguably the two most useless stat buffs.<br />
<br />
I love this idea Ceno,  kudos!   Now lets all get behind it and make a formal request.   If they did this to focus and upgraded our patch heal that's about all I could ask for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Purrlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Great idea. Where do I sign up?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Now this is a great suggestion.  Though you still see people who are fussing over HP amounts between various buffs.  Again, modifying melee skills would enhance one of our underutilized strengths (buffing).  People arguing about HP and stat values that buffs give will only result in &quot;Focus of Aura: 800hp, +100 STR, + 95 DEX&quot;.  That will be fun for like 2 days until we realize we got screwed again.<br />
<br />
We can make (expensive) potions that give mana preservation for certain types of spells.  Why not make this a shortish duration buff (10-minutes, no horrible recast time like FA, hopefully with a group version).  Also buffs that would increase spell damage by a bit as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We were the king of melee buffs?  Only if Agility and Acumen are &gt;&gt;&gt; Virtue and Haste.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Mitrian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I would stand behind this idea 110%.  I've been disappointed with Focus since PoP released.  Giving it a little better HP boost, and some effects which will get the melees addicted...  Bravo, Ceno!<br />
<br />
I have discussed the possibility of focus (style) buffs for a long time, as well, as jzak mentioned above.  Nuke focus, mana focus, whatever.  They make sense.<br />
<br />
And Uggok is right about the value of so many of our stat buffs.  We were, however, kings of the buffs.  If only because everyone wanted them, regardless of their actual effects.  Unfortunately, we're not even perceived as such now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">would be nice if they added even endurance regen onto it *hint hint*</div></div><hr />

<br />
watch the trolling there young lady. =P<br />
<br />
The focus line should be the ****ake mushroom of all melee buffs, or close to it. At a bare minimum the str in focus should be changed to atk, or atk added to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Even if nothing else was changed I'd love to see FoSoul/7 last a lot longer.  IIRC it lasts (without EE or SCR) 1 hour and 20min.  Even with EE4 and SCRM it would last what 2hours 20min or so?  Virtue seems to last forever sometimes.  And why does Soul/7 Last 1hr 20min and Spirit lasts 1hr 40min??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Great idea!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">that would be cool. also maybe add in an endurance regen to the buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Kind of agree, but I think it needs to be a bit different than what you suggested Ceno.<br />
<br />
In my mind, Focus should emphasize the defensive aspects of classes, while Ferine Avatar emphasizes the damage dealing aspects of classes.  So in this case, Focus would have more shielding/spell shield/avoidance/hp/resists whatever, while FA would add strikethrough/combat effects/accuracy/atk/overhaste.  <br />
<br />
In this way, Focus would be extremely useful for all classes, even casters, while melee would also gain substantially from FA (allowing casters to drop a buff from their lineup since it won't significantly help them).<br />
<br />
Two of our buffs would be substantially better, and not just one.  And while FA needs a few tweaks to make this truly viable, I think it'd go a long way towards making us melee buff kings once again.  But that's just my take on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I also agree.<br />
<br />
If we are the stat kings then give us stats that will truly make a difference. Even giving attack alone to us in FoS would let us raise the bar over the BST's with avatar and FoS.<br />
<br />
This isnt class envy, but i solidly feel we should be noticibly better buffers then our hybrid bretheren.  I mean can a ranger heal better then a druid ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I think the cry for a shaman to come buff is in great need. we should be comaparlable to being needed like a cleric buff or enchanter buff. How many time do we see Any KEI or Virtue as we pass through PoK??? How about some Any Fo7 (revamped version) being /ooc'd for us?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Yeah. Any of you (okay, on alts) heard &quot;can't go in yet, no Shammy buffs&quot; from the MA before an LDoN?

Actually, the buffs aren't worthless, just that they are capped before they can do full effect.  Str adds to ATK, plain and simple.  Agi adds to AC, plain and simple. With enough STR and AGI, you could add 200 atk/ac.  The problem is that the cap is too low.  If people could actually get the full STR/AGI buff we can give, something along the lines of <br />
<br />
(throwing Dex in too, just cause of procs)<br />
<br />
FO7 75STR/70DEX<br />
Daiku 45STR/35DEX<br />
FA 140STR/140DEX/140AGI<br />
Wrulan 60AGI<br />
<br />
That is 260STR/245DEX/200AGI<br />
<br />
I'll have to log a melee on and check the exact numbers, but that does = a substantial ATK/AC boost if people could get the full effect from it.  If they could, don't you think Melee would like to be fighting with 500+ STR/DEX/AGI if they could?</div></div><hr />

Upon further thinking, they aren't going to let us 'overbuff' like bard overhaste, so just give us comperable effects as to what the extra stats would, like you said, +ATK, +AC, +TO PROCS...etc and more HP's to make up for the STA cap.</div></div><hr />
