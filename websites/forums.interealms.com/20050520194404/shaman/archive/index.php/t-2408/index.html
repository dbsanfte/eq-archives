<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can anyone tell me how to raise faction with the halfling/dwarf community in Shadowhaven (the area across from the SoulBinder, down the hall toward the Echo/Deep area?<br />
<br />
The are not on the same faction as the rest of SH; I think killing bandits in FG might help some, but I'd really prefer a quicker (and less dangerous) way if anyone knows one.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">run the &quot;traders of Shadowheaven&quot; quest several times.  I took me 6 runs to be at least apprehensive with all SH factions.  If you bind at Henry and gate back you can do that in less then 30 min, don't forget to refresh sow in the bazaar, only zone it works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't know the minimum you need, but running Trade Commissioner Henry's quest 20 times put me at max Traders faction and apprehensive for the three House factions.  Another 20 times brought House factions up to amiable.  So it seems this quest increases Traders by 100 points and Houses by 10 points each time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>BryeLLe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You can also do Steano/Gearo quest that raises Traders and Stout faction (not sure of the others, might raise them all) and Mistala raises Traders, Guards and Fordel (Pally side) faction. <br />
<br />
Gearo only involves SH and Bazaar, it's much easier to do than the Henry quest. BTW, Gearo seemed to be broken this weekend though. He wouldn't give me the gems to take back but still accepted the tailoring items with faction. About 20 trips got me to apprenhensive.<br />
<br />
Did the Mistala quest 3 times (run out to Dawnshroud and back) and that got me indifferent to Fordel.<br />
<br />
I've only done the Henry quest twice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Do the Shady Bandit's in FG either for exp or faction hits.    A run of 2 hours (Exp'ing and Ring hunting) took me to at least Indifferant to all SH vendors including Dwarf and Halfings.<br />
<br />
Added advanage of getting a Shady Bandit ring but it's like 1-100 kills ... at least it seemed that way to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So I thought too, till one innovative soul doing the quest figured out that the operative word is GEM and not GEMS like the gearhead asked for. That fella got SoW for the duration needless to say.<br />
<br />
Why does VI make it so easy?</div></div><hr />
