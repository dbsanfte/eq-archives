<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I want to hunt in KC when I get some more levels, and was wondering, how many times do I have to kill Gornit to get indiff(so i can trade, and is the banker actully on the same faction?). I've been killing him for a couple of levels, but not sure what my faction is standing with them. BTW Gornit gives - Pirates of Gunthak and + Firionia Vie</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">So, you're trying to get FV faction?<br />
<br />
Another option is just to go crazy killing goblins in the LoIO.<br />
<br />
With Luclin, all faction isn't quite as important..while in Kunark, it's just a quick run to the DL spire and then up to the Bazaar where everyone can bank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A LOT.  Faction is FV is a biotch to raise for a Trollie, and some (I think either Paly or Ranger) will be KOS to you no matter what.  They can be avoided though.  With enough kills you should be able to bank in FV.  One word of advise, kill the rest of the pirates in the camp as well, they all give +FV faction hits.  So you should get 4 + FV hits per cycle.  Also, I thought that &quot;named&quot; mobs give a bigger faction hit then your run of the mill Goblin_01, so Gornit and friends might actually be a quicker way then the common &quot;kill Goblins until you bleed&quot; school of thought.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lumppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you want FV faction go to Warsliks Wood and go to the goblin fort there and whip out goblins in mass. While you are at it you may get the Shrunken Goblin Skull Earring to drop off Grachnist the Destroyer. I don't know about your server but on ours it sells for 5k plat. Not a bad way to work on faction. Both my troll warrior and troll shaman have max FV faction and can shop and bank in FV using this method. Plus I sold maybe 6 or 8 earrings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You cant park your pet overnight anymore, since mobs wont agro pets. You can park yourself at the pet though so the goblins will attack you and pet will assist. Just hope that the lvl 40 goblin in the tunnels dont come helping.<br />
<br />
Its better to get faction in Warslik Woods(loc -2750, 460)<br />
<br />
Its virtually limitless of lvl 1-4 goblins there. I did get max FV faction back when mobs would attack the pet. Was just to park pet at that location and go sit at a safe spot while you slept :)<br />
<br />
There are 2 places that still will be kos in FV though, Its the Shamans in the house at the docks. Requires quite some work in Halas to fix that one. The last one is the mob thats on the ring going around the city. To fix this faction, just give Muffins to Pandos Flintside.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You can forget about unattended factioning with a pet, it's not going to work.  Pets are now neutral and mobs will not attack it.  You could stand at a goblin spawn point yourself to attract agro and hope your pet continues to guard you without wandering off or losing its path, but that's simply not safe.<br />
<br />
It takes 2000 points to maximize any faction.  As an Iksar, I gained FV faction mostly by killing many goblins -- at one point per goblin -- at the goblin fort in Warslik's Wood.  (I also got a Shrunken Goblin Skull Earring this way.)  I am now maximized at indifferent; I can set foot in FV and bank there, but I still can't go into the Shaman hut to buy spells because of Alex McDarnin.  Alex is a non-merchant barbarian on some unknown faction other than FV, and he agros.<br />
<br />
I don't know how many points of FV faction Gornit gives, maybe I'll find out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gothlips</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">FV Faction.... Hunt in Dalnir, dungeon in Warslike Woods. There drops no drop &quot;Canines.&quot; Turn them in to Captain Nealith in FV and in return you'll get pos faction with FV, some cash, and &quot;Trail Mix&quot; which is a hearty meal I believe.</div></div><hr />

Not sure this is true. <br />
<br />
1) Certain factions are set. As a Monk worshipping the Tranquil I can get to no better than Indifferent to Troopers of Cabilis.<br />
<br />
Now I used to be ALLY with them until VI fawked around with faction. /e rude.<br />
<br />
2) To get from KOS to Ally with the  Dizok (Queen in particular) losers (The new Chardok quests) takes 3500 hits. Some  things  : Goobo skin, Mt Death salt give a faction hit or + 3, but sure as Stuttgart takes more than 2000 Mines of Nurga kills to get the final quest.<br />
<br />
BTW here's the po.op on the quests for Chardok. Hope I don't ruin the day of any Uber out there by posting this L337_sploit_Strategy:<br />

<br />
1) The reason an outsider can get no better than indifferent with Cabilis is because outsiders start with extraordinarily low natural faction, and it takes 2000 points just to get up to indifferent.  You can go no higher because you have upped your faction by the maximum of 2000.  And if you had only gained 1900 points for example, you'd be apprehensive.  Same situation with Iksars in FV.<br />
<br />
2) I'm going to guess that the reason it takes some people 3500 points to bring up their Chardok faction is because that includes making up the 1500 points they lost while killing Sarnaks in LOIO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have read (correctly or incorrectly) that faction is on a sliding 4000 point scale from -2000 to 2000.  I think certain faction levels are wider than others (sort of hell levels).  For instance, I would bet scowling is -2000 to -1000 or so, and threatening is probably about -999 to -500.  My understanding was that Scowl, Threatening, Dubious, and Apprehensive are all -2000 to 0, and that Amiably, Kindly, Warmly, and Ally are all 1 to 2000.  Indifferent is a small faction somewhere right around 0.<br />
<br />
If that is correct, then if you were max KoS to the sarnaks, it would take you 4000 low level goblin kills to get to max ally, assuming no nameds, or turn ins of salts or skins.<br />
<br />
I'm sure someone here has a better understanding though, and can probably post better info!  :)<br />
<br />

<br />
P.S.  Please note, I am not claming that indifferent is a range of 3 kills.  It's just a range somwhere around the zero faction number.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Faction Ranges:  <br />
  -xxx to -751    ...scowls at you, ready to attack<br />
    -750 to -501    ...glares at you threateningly<br />
    -500 to -101    ...glowers at you dubiously<br />
    -100 to   -1    ...looks your way apprehensively<br />
       0 to   99    ...regards you indifferently<br />
     100 to  499    ...judges you amiably<br />
     500 to  749    ...kindly considers you<br />
     750 to 1099    ...looks upon you warmly<br />
     1100 to xxxx  ...Ally<br />
<br />
Can find this out yourself by giving Muffins to Pandos Flintside or some other of this type of quest.<br />

<br />
Faction is all relative, so it doesn't really matter where you put 0 at.  What matters is that &quot;indifferently&quot; is a range of 100 points, as seen in the table Fatsow posted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Figured out today that Gornit gives only 1 point of + Firiona Vie faction -- equal to killing a level 1 goblin whelp in Warslik's Wood.<br />
<br />
Mass slaughtering of the goblins in WW or LOIO or FV is the way to raise FV faction, Gornit isn't going to do much for you at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Nyte - thanks for the info. I do know that VI fawked with faction as I used to be ally to the Troopers, continued killing in Seb and found myself indiff one day. Su.cks ot be one of those who turned in 8000 bone chips.<br />
<br />
My question is - can you bottom out faction or is faction repairable?<br />
<br />
Necro on my server said he had 0 luck raising his Chardok faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yes, you can bottom out faction. Its -2000 faction points from base. So you can repair it, just that it might take an insane amount of work. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">dont waste your time getting fv faction, why bank in kunark?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Go smash things in KC, just run to the spires in DL when you're done and hitch a ride up to The Bazaar. No need to bank in Kunark at all if you have Luclin.<br />
<br />
The timesink required to get good enough faction to bank isn't worth it.</div></div><hr />
