<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A question for you sir.<br />
<br />
I saw on your magelo profile you have Spell casting fury 3, you also have Healing gift 3 and healing adept 3 and a heal 3 focus item.<br />
<br />
Can you tell us what the effect on Chloroblast is with all of that. And if possible Super healing  as well. (You also have spell haste, so Sup heal should be a good heal spell with all that AA)<br />
<br />
Also with Spell casting fury 3 do you torrent alot? What is the best hit you got off a single torrent cast? Any quad 1080's?<br />
<br />
I am just curious. I don't raid much, so the gear that all of you have will pretty much be unavailable to me. But XP is always available. <br />
<br />
Just a curious shaman who wants to learn from someone who has already gotten the skills.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My guild has started a Monday Poker night. We pick someplace and go. Can be because we have never been there. Or we need something. Or whatever.<br />
<br />
Last monday was DN. 95% of the people on the run had never been there. We had 12 people mostly 54ish in level. <br />
<br />
Got to the Pabalas. Whacked a few. Then they whacked us. <br />
<br />
It was fun. Got a 30 40 Bow for a ranger. And the headress dropped. I about died.<br />
<br />
Tonight City of mist. Goign to whack a few reavers and will probably go upstairs for giggles.  I am not taking a map. It will be more fun if we don't know what to expect. I am trying to remember the risks from 2 years ago when I went with Feather alot. Or when I went to talk to Neh Ashir.<br />
<br />
The game is fun. Despite Verant.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mudcrush Durtfeet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, first off I don't yet have spell casting fury 3, nor a spell haste item (though at raids I wear a Naki's studded ring).<br />
<br />
   I have rarely gotten more than one crit from torrent of poison, which I only use if either a) we are getting just solo mobs and/or b) we don't have a mezzer.<br />
<br />
   Yeah, I am uber healer.  Basically, let's say Chloroblast heals for 500 base.   This makes the math a bit easier.<br />
<br />
   My aa skills increase that to 550 and crit heal is 1100.<br />
<br />
   What healing focus 3 does is do a random 1 20, then add that percentage amount of healing regardless of aa skills or crits.<br />
<br />
   So I heal for 505-600 with no aa skills, or 555-650 and crit for 1105-1200.<br />
<br />
   Of course chloroblast is a bit less than 500 base, so my crit heals are generally a little higher than 1000, occasionally lower.<br />
<br />
   Often I wear a crystalline torque or talisman of evasion.  With the torque, all my spells cost 10percent less mana.<br />
<br />
   With the talisman all my dots and debuffs cost 25 percent mana.  When xping this is often the better deal.<br />
<br />
   I also have affliction extension and haste 3 items so my dots and debuffs cast in only 2/3 the normal time and have +20% endurance.   It owns for xping, at raids it's good to have longer lasting turgur...  :-)   I figure that's a bug and debuffs will eventually cease getting these benefits but for now life is good.<br />
<br />
   I also have qb3 so I have 1/2 cast time on torpor, celerity, and most buffs.<br />
<br />
   So although I often don't have spell haste, this usually only affects PA, chloroblast (already fast), and my cold dd.<br />
<br />
   If I want to NUKE a lot with cold dd, I have a white dragon scale cape I can use for improved damage 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Makata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I can understand wanting Buff Duration thing for torpor, but why does QB matter? Is it seriously that hard to channel thru a torpor even when the mob is slowed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have QB 1 + Enhancement Haste III and Spell Haste III.  I love it, I flat out love it.  The only thing stopping me from pressing on til QB III is my own slow AA exp gain so 9 points seems huge to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Six seconds is a looooong time to wait on a heal-over time spell. I can see 3-second torpor being pretty huge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">2 more points to qb3!<br />
<br />
Soupy is right, 6 seconds is a long time to wait for a heal over time spell.  Slowed lizards in CT, mobs in the Deep, ssra, etc etc can still hit me for 400-500pts a round (double attack in the 200s).  The first round of my torpor heal will do less than they hit for.  I slow quickly and often have more than 1 hitting me at a time too, so quick torpor is my life saver.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The effect I'm most pleased to have is Affliction Efficiency 3...  Comes off my Boots of the Dead Dream  (Drops off either Feshlak or Dagarn in NTOV)<br />
<br />
Ruduced Mana cost on all spells labelled an &quot;affliction&quot;... and trust me, for Shamans.. that's almost all of them.<br />
<br />
Slow, Malo, Malosini, Root, DOT's, Cripples....  basically all your debuffs and offensive spells get a reduced mana cost.. it's amazing how long my mana lasts now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Good point Warg.  Dam, maybe I shoulda gone for those instead of the vindy ones.  I should look up other AEIII items maybe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jukax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have Spellcasting Fury 2 (took it for fun, since I didn't have torpor at the time and ND / CS wasn't yet implemented), and I just checked over my old screenshots. Best nuke I've had yet was for 1327 damage with Ice Strike, with a mage + damage bracer on. Regular crit nukes with Ice Strike do 1125 at level 2 of SCF with no focus item. SCF level 1 will make Ice Strike do 900 damage, and SCF 3 will make Ice Strike do 1350. So, with SCF 3 and a mage focus item or an item with Improved Damage 3, you would do up to 1350 + 20%(1350). If my math is right it works out to 1620 max for Ice Strike, which is pretty nice =)<br />
<br />
SCF works with Torrent of Poison as well; I've used it very rarely though. Torrent hits for 900 at SCF level 2 with no focus item, but the problem with torrent is that it's resisted a LOT. If not full resists, then lots of partials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Heya Juukak, just so ya know, there have been a couple copies of Torpor for sale in bazaar last few days. Barley is the only name i remember, but was only like 85k so if you have that saved up yet you might wanna try contacting them. Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I should have Spell casting Fury 2 soon. (Maybe tonight or tomorrow depending on xp groups.)<br />
<br />
900 crits on rains will be nice. I wonder how much my Barb hammer crit will be and Poisen wind censer will be. Mmmm<br />
<br />
I will get spell casting fury 3 after that then head into Natural durability. (Grins)<br />
<br />
So much AA. So little time. (Sigh)<br />
