<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It was always true before, and I think that if it changed I'd probably know about it, but better to be safe than sorry...<br />
<br />
I just (after 4 years) got a new computer. While I go between sessions of wanting to throw the thing out a window because of how incredibly stupid and lame WinXP is, vs times when I'm in awe of just how much faster it is...I wonder about EQ.<br />
<br />
I do not especially look forward to downloading LoY and LDoN again. On dialup this is a multi-day adventure that I'd just as soon avoid. My current plan is to take the hard drive out of my old machine, plug it in, and copy the files directly over...will this still work, or has EQ insinuated itself into the system registry now and actually requires a real install process?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">To my knowledge, you can still copy the whole EQ folder and it'll work. I, myself, formatted my computer about a month after pop went out, and found myself in about the same situation. Went over to a friend's house and copied his entire EQ folder to my hard drive with no problems.<br />
<br />
If it turns out that you copy it over and it doesn't work, try installing the CDs that you have and then copying the folder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Seems to mostly work.  Just make sure the new machine has the DirectX8 files on it.  I tried to just copy to one with only DX9, and it wasn't too happy about that.  Is okay if you install 8, then upgrade to 9...  Just not with 9 only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The only problems you run into by doing this are when you sign up for a new expansion. EQ will check the registry to see if it's installed or not and give you an error. I'd also advise against it if you're moving from Windows 98 or ME to XP. If you're going from XP to XP I would suggest installing EQ and all expansions normally to get them embedded in the registry, then overwriting it with the files from your old HD to avoid patching.<br />
<br />
I did the download over dial-up (26.4 no less). One overnight session and one day at work took care of almost all of it. At worst it's two days of time not at your computer. It isn't as bad as you think :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What you do is load all the exspansions on your computers new hard drive like your installing it for the first time.  Once you have done this all registry entries will be correct.  Most of your files will just be out of date in the EQ directory.  At this point the easies thing to do is then copy all the files in the EQ directory and sub-directories to the new hard drive into the EQ Directory.  <br />
<br />
This will make sure 99% of your files are upto date from the last time the old hard drive connect to the EQ servers.  After doing this I would also make sure you goto the advanced settings section of the patcher and uncheck any exspansions you dont have (Legends) and select all the ones you do have (LDoN, LoY, Ect....).  That should cut several hours off your down load.  Also if you do know your going have multi hour down load just before going to bed is nice time to do that or while your off at work depending on if you have people at home while your off at work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You can just copy the eq directory and re-use it. However you also need the registry entries. Just run regedit and export any and all &quot;Sony online&quot; or &quot;soe&quot; keys under software.  Merge them back into new registry and never have to reinstall. Ive done it many times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">However you also need the registry entries <br />
<br />
There are no registry entries. It's just an exe with a huge friggin folder attached. Copy at will, I keep mine backed up on CD (ui and all) and every time i re-do my machine I just copy it back over and go to town. <br />
<br />
I re-do my machine fairly often, just for posterity's sake. I'm forever messing with it and trying different things, so it's kinda necessary to have backups hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I second this, I've never had issues with EQ and reg keys at the netcafe I run.  I suspect it stores the last username entered in the registry and thats about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Actually, I'm pretty sure nothing is stored in the registry at all. The last username is stored in a text file in your EQ folder called equname.txt. I searched my registry and couldn't find anything, although I very well could have missed it. If anyone finds registry stuff relating to EQ, please post it :)<br />
<br />
I believe because of this that you can simply just copy the folder. I've done it multiple times and it always seems to work great for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Copy at will, it should work fine.</div></div><hr />

Lor is right. I've copied mine tons of times, between win2k and winxp no hassles. win98 would work the same, with the only difference being the dx version and possibly the video settings needing tweaking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>skwayb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The only registry entry that is made for EQ is in the ADD/REMOVE Programs.  You don't even need that entry.  You can copy the entire EQ folder to another machine and log in without installing a thing.<br />
<br />
Done it many times on WinXP, Win2k, Win9x... As long as you have Direct-X 8 or higher with the corresponding Video Drivers for your Card you will be fine.  I run Direct-X 9 on my machine and EQ runs fine.  Just need to have the correct video driver.<br />
<br />
Your mileage may vary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I copy between my harddrives when i make a fresh system install, works just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Koridar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Or if you really wanted to you could make a second partition on your HD and stick your EQ folder there and Format the rest and install.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yeah eq still seems to be pretty good or bad, depending on how you look at it, for a windows program. If I had to bet I'd say my current copy of eq was installed on a machine running windows 98, 2 motherboards and about 3 or 4 hd's ago. That same directory has been copied around for ever and a day and the machine is now running win2k. Was even running eq from 2 different os's from the same dir for a while and everything was fine. Just make sure you have dx8+ installed on the machine and it should be fine.</div></div><hr />
