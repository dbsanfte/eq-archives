<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Malliss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heya shammies.<br />
<br />
<br />
I was wondering, is 57 as bad as 56!?!?!?  56 is AWFUL!<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any advice where to get good xp?  Solo or partnering? <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Batuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">57 is slightly tougher than 56 from what I remember.  Take this advice:  don't look at your experience when you are in 59.  Just grind it out and quit looking at the experience bar.  :)</div></div><hr />

I totally agree.  I am one of those obsessive people that constantly look at their xp bar even tho they know it wont have moved and I think it made 59 even worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Every level from that one is worse than the one before.  If you think 56 is bad, 59 will make you cry.  <br />
<br />
I recommend getting off the &quot;treadmill&quot; and trying a new sort of group.  That level is fine for trying a new dungeon, a new camp, a new group composition.  Have something you want?  Put a group together to try to get it. <br />
<br />
