<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ralence</div><div class="date">10-26-2002, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I picked up the first level of it as soon as I hit 61.  Best part is that most of PoP is outdoor zones, and Guardian of the Forest &quot;bugs&quot; wolf form.<br />
<br />
  If you use GWF, then guardian, when it wears off you lose the wolf illusion, but retain the benefits of GWF, which for me is great, because I despise wolf form illusion.<br />
<br />
  Other than that, its a small dps increase every 15 minutes, and for some of us, every little bit counts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Reandn</div><div class="date">10-26-2002, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh heh I wondered about that.  I noticed on Lucy that the wolf form illusion of the two effects went in different slots, so I figured they stacked.  Then I wondered &quot;when GoF wears off, will they be smart enough to leave the illusion up for GWF?&quot;  <br />
<br />
My money was on &quot;No&quot;.   <br />
<br />
Nice side benefit.  I wonder if you still get the faction adjusts for wolf form, even though it's not visible?  That one could go either way,  really.  Depends if their bug is just visual or not.<br />

Its great because most things i've seen the planes are KoS to wolves. But after I cycle through Guardian I have Wolfform Speed w/ none of the faction hits.</div></div><hr />

I dont notice a HUGE increase in damage or anything ,but I cant say I parse ;) I do however notice that I get to go wolf form indoors and scream 'RABID PUPPY!' at my group, which makes it worth a mere 3 points to me ;) ;) ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
One word of advice... careful where you put the hotkey. You know when folks accidentally defensive or weaponshield? Imagine accidentally guardianing in the Plane of Justice and suddenly watching all the big men with hammers cahrge at you as your 0 sec cast wolf form takes hold.<br />
<br />
Puppy jam. splat. Ow.<br />

It seems cool.  You get about 137+ to attack (or something like that), and it recycles every 15 mins.  The nice thing is that it works indoors and outside.  And you turn into a black wolf  =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kelador</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 08:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's fun to use... I've been using it in conjunction with avatar, VoG and crippling claudication and getting great ATK ...up to 1747 so far... just need to get a bard in the group too... its great for going 'full burn' on Trueshot.<br />
<br />
One caveat though - it does take up an extra buff slot, so make sure you have one free, or it burns the ability and doesn't take hold.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">logolas</div><div class="date">10-29-2002, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This sounds like a SWEET ability....is this one where you hafta go up in increments (1-2-3) and if so how much does it improve each time? just a couple questions.<br />

Illusions make you kos to almost all mobs. I did press my gurdian hotkey and I aggroed half the forest so we got whiped...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinuvian Mistwalker</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 06:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah dont use this AA in Planes where you aren't kos to everything. Cos if you do, you'll aggro the mobs that are close to you but not normally kos.<br />
<br />
E.g. frogs and travellers in Plane of Storms.</div></div><hr />
