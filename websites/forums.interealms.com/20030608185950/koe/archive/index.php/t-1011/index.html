Mexl has told me he would love to lend his small but mighty gnomish frame in this endevour.  However, not knowing your group setups as of yet, I will offer up the following choice:<br />
<br />
Adelrune level 54 wizard<br />
Mexl Level 44 warrior<br />
<br />
Please choose which you think is cuter....er I mean who is better for your raid.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jice Virago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">... but not sure what The Corps is doing this weekend.  I have some practical advice for you from our own three group experience here:<br />
<br />
#1) Two Enchanters is a bare minimum here.  There is just too much screwed up pathing here to have anything less.  Also having 2 chanters makes doing Lord Rak a walk in the park (I wont post why here, but send me a tell in game if you are curious) giving access to the Atrimonious Shield and Ornate Runed blade.  Also as you approach the upper levels the mob density increases dramatically.<br />
<br />
#2) Leave your bards at home.  Their songs will agro about 5 billion mobs if they sing next to a wall.  Every time we have taken bards along past the locked door and they sang at all we have gotten our asses force fed to us.  I hate leaving bards behind (our guild uses them extensively) but this is one case where its just not worth it.<br />
<br />
#3) If you think a spank is imminent when your on the upper bridge, Dive off so you can get your corpse back in a recoverable spot.  Nothing sucks harder than having a dozen naked mele and no lockpicks on your rogue.<br />
<br />
#4) Reavers can be pulled without a rogue if your SK is a crafty bastard.  Use of Wave of enfeeblement when standing next to the door will yank all the reavers out, as will fearing a single skelly into the door.  Your SK then FDs, monk tags, and viola you get a nice easy reaver single pull.  As a side note, you can get to the bridge without a rogue, but its tricky and involves abuse of the Gravity Flux spell (and a lot of luck).<br />
<br />
#5) Bring a Necro, this zone was made for them.  All of the undead mobs have horrid MR in the zone (easy pickings for Thrall of Bones) and selective mana whoring will make life a lot easier on everyone.<br />
<br />
#6) Dont pee in the bushes, thats poison oak.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aziz Al'Qadir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hey there Barain...<br />
<br />
Count me in as well! I loved the last raid in CoM - great zone - fun people.<br />
<br />
I wish to offer my services as a 51 Wizard, or if you need an additional tank, I can bring my 41 Troll Warrior, Petunia Swampflower. She may be a wee bit low for the zone, but if there is a need - I can have her there in time for the raid.<br />
<br />
See ya soon!<br />
<br />
Aziz Al'Qadir - 51 Human Wizard<br />
Petunia Swampflower - 41 Troll Warrior<br />
Amir Ar'Rahmanu - 26 Dwarf Cleric<br />
Shhifty Faastfingers - 18 Halfling Rogue</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lokes Sindre<br />
54th Cleric</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Truant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">side note, unless you planning on getting creative. You need a rogue with 201 lock pick to open the doors. that's 51+ tho of course you can have others. But as far as door duty goes...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Chadias Spirithealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Sounds fun, never stepped foot in there =) Since my xp bar isnt going anywhere... lol ... not to mention I could use the Jade reaver count me in. I will see what I can do about getting you a Chanter... =) *wink* I just might know one. hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rave</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Barain, I would love to attend again. I liked this zone a lot. We were quite successful last time. Plus, I have slim hopes of a Wu's quivering staff. The only thing that stopped us last time was bedtimes.<br />
<br />
I will happily bring Rave (53 necro) and Lumen (49 monk)<br />
