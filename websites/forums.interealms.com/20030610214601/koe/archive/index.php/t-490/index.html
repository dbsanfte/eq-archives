<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone know where I can buy a fire emerald?  Or what mob drops it?  I think Seafury in OOT does.  But does anyone know of a vendor?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drolgin Steingrinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can buy Fire Emerald from most jewellery merchants.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">really?  I checked a few and they didn't have it.  I'll check others.  thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drolgin Steingrinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I know the jewellery merchant in FV carries it.<br />
<br />
There are two types of jewellery merchants: One has highlevel gems and metal bars, other has lowerlevel gems - the ones that act as reagents.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I believe only &quot;full line&quot; jewelry merchants have them. For instance; I don't think you can find it in Freeport; but it should be at the vendor in EC in the last village before you go into WC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ah, I know of that vendor, forgot to check her-<br />
Thanks so much!<br />
And yes Drolgin, I know what you mean, usually it's with the high level gems and that's what I've checked :)<br />
Thanks again!<br />
<br />
ok, I'm editing this message so not to post a whole nother message.<br />
I checked EC vendor, didn't have.  Checked Neriak, didn't have.  I bought a Fire Opal in Temple of Solusek Ro, anyone have an idea if that's the same thing?  I'm guessing not.  Hrmm... any other suggestions?  I guess I still need to check FV</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>burien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yad im assusming u can get fire emeralds in felwith in shopof no holds or in quenos in jewelry box, or maybe in highhold. these are alos the only places (that i know of) that sell rubies.  oh yeah, thuraden too im sure.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ah!  I finally found it! Thanks a lot, it was in felwithe :D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">LOL</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bagfra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I do believe, the Mugshot would have a say about this, since the Mugshot is a VERY educated ogre tank, speaks most languages, does not eat dwarves, hobbits or other little creatures and he takes a shower more often than any barbarian (not that it says so much, since everybody does that)<br />
<br />
So please do not be a prejudist, when it comes to ogre.. the Mugshot will prove you wrong!!</div></div><hr />
