<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is my summary of 6 months worth of discussion, analysis and polls on the Crucible. I will probably edit in some links to some of those later.<br />
<br />
This post is mainly going to address the issues of elemental+ shamans. Some of the changes will of course benefit lower level or lower AAd shamans as well. Overall however I believe that most shaman problems concern the post-elemental part of the game and thus this proposal is centered on fixing shaman issues in that content.<br />
<br />
General Shaman issues:<br />
* Shamans have received less upgrades to every single one of their spell lines then all other classes got to their comparable spell lines for every expansion since Kunark. Shamans want at least some of that lost power back. This includes DoTs, nukes, cannibalize (already being adressed), buffs (partially being adressed), heals and pets.<br />
* Shamans suffer more then any other class from the short fights of LDoN and GoD (and to a lesser degree PoP) as well as suffering more then other classes from slow mitigation. Shamans want increases to their healing to at least partially make up for the lost power of slow.<br />
* Shamans still stack poorly on raids. This can probably be adressed (or mostly adressed) by the improvements outlined above.<br />
* DoT aggro is utterly out of control. DoT aggro should be decreased to the level of an equally damaging direct damage.<br />
<br />
Specific shaman issues<br />
* When acting as a healer shamans rely on slow to be able to heal at all. Any resist causes the shaman to go into chain healing mode which will at best negate the incoming damage. There is no time to attempt to slow again, which is what shaman healing as balanced around. Shamans would like an emergency ability (most likely as an AA skill) to address this.<br />
* The shaman group haste is still inferior to the single target spell.<br />
* Shamans are still unable to shrink their pets.<br />
* The Avatar line has an effect which is not even close to being in line with the mana and time required to use it (not to mention having to lose a spell gem to it). This is even more pronounced as players cap their stats.<br />
<br />
That being said this is the list of specifics:<br />
(Items of minor interest to either the majority of shamans or of low balance impact are in italics. Critical issues are bolded.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Healing<br />
* Spot Heal<br />
Improve Daluda's Mending to heal 1900 damage. Increase the mana cost to 600. (Also adjust the OoW heal accordingly.)<br />
<br />
* Group Heal<br />
Add a shaman group HoT. It should heal 420 points per tick (same as Quiescence) and cost 900 mana.<br />
<br />
* Emergency Heal<br />
Add a Spirit Shifting AA in three levels (4/4/4 points at levels 61/63/65). This ability will drain 12/25/40% of the shaman's HPs and give them to his current target. The casting time should be no higher then 1 second. The reuse time should be 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mana Regeneration<br />
* Cannibalize<br />
Shaman spells are balanced on the assumption that shamans regenerate mana much faster then other classes. As other classes have received a much larger increase to their mana regeneration over the last expansions then shamans did shaman mana regeneration is in need of an upgrade. This can come either in the form of more efficient cannibalize spells or in the form of cannibalize spells that basically combine several castings of cannibalize into one big cast, thus freeing up time for other tasks.<br />
The current ancient cannibalize spell is a good spell, but something so central to the shaman class should not be available to a select few. Make the new cannibalize spell a purchaseable spell in PoK.<br />
<br />
<br />
Damage<br />
* DoT aggro<br />
Decrease DoT aggro significantly. A DoT that does 2000 damage should not add more aggro then a direct damage spell that does 2000 damage.<br />
<br />
* Poison nukes<br />
Increase Spear of Torment to do 900 damage. Up the mana cost to 370.<br />
<br />
* Ice nukes<br />
Increase Velium Strike to do 1300 damage. Up the mana cost to 430.<br />
<br />
* Poison DoTs<br />
Increase Blood of Saryrn to do 400 damage per tick. Up the mana cost to 650 to match that increase. Add a -30 resist adjustment. (Also change the OoW poison DoT accordingly. Also apply the resist adjustment to lower level poison DoTs.)<br />
<br />
* Magic DoTs<br />
Increase Bane to do 500 damage per tick. Up the mana cost to 600. Add a -60 resist adjustment. (Apply equivalent changes to the other spells of this line.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Debuffs<br />
* Balance of the Nihil<br />
Up the resist modifier on Balance of the Nihil to -55 to match Malos.<br />
<br />
<br />
Buffs<br />
* Avoidance<br />
The replacement buff for our agility line has a listed effect of 7% avoidance. In actual play this seems to work out to an actual 4% avoidance. It should be improved to 10% (listed) to produce an actual 6% avoidance effect in game.<br />
<br />
* Damage<br />
The replacement buff for our strength line has a listed effect of 5% melee damage. In actual play this seems to work out to an actual 2% damage. It should be improved to 10% (listed) to produce an actual 4% damage effect in game.<br />
<br />
* HPs<br />
The OoW shaman stamina buff currently adds stamina past the stat cap. Shamans fear that stamina will suffer from additional dimishing returns past 305. If the spell ends up adding less then 200 HPs to a stat-capped 65 warrior it should be removed in favor of a non-capped effect, similar to the other buff replacements (stun resist or shielding seem appropriate).<br />
<br />
* Focus<br />
Increase the HPs on the OoW version of the focus line to 850. Remove the strength and dexterity components and replace them with +melee damage to match the standalone buff.<br />
<br />
* Focus<br />
Increase the HPs on Focus of Soul to 650.<br />
<br />
* Avatar<br />
The effect of the avatar line is not at all in line with its cost. Either substantially up the effects of this spell line, add a group version of the spell or substantially up the duration.<br />
<br />
* Group haste<br />
The shaman group haste is inferior to the single target spell. Up the haste to match that of the single target version.<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
* Pet<br />
Make the shaman pet innately dual weild (currently it dual weilds once given weapons).<br />
<br />
* Pet shrink<br />
Make the shaman pet shrinkable again.<br />
<br />
<br />
-- Adjust other spells accordingly&quot; means that the spell in question should receive the same percentual improvements compared to the base spell as comparable spells of other classes get in that expansion. --<br />

I'd have to agree with the changes proposed to the nukes.  At first look, they seemed outrageously high, but I've been looking at the idea of our place within the nuking hierarchy.  Wizards and Mages clearly should be on top.  How the rest filter out I'm not sure.  I personally have no problem with Druids and Enchanters being able to nuke better than I can.  Necros and Clerics?  I don't like that some much.  Hybrids?  We'd better be able to nuke better than them.  <br />
<br />
A quick summary of nukes:<br />
<br />
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td &gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Class&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td &gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Spell&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td &gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Cast Time&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td &gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Recast Time&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Damage&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Mana&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Beastlord&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Trushar's Frost&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;3.2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;30&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;742&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;274&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Beastlord&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Frost Spear&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;3.2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;30&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;675&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;250&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Cleric&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Order&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;6.5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;1210&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;401&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Cleric&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Condemnation&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;6.5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;1100&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;365&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Druid&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Sylvan

align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;430&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Druid&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Winter's Frost&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;6.35&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;1550&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;390&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Druid&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Summer's Flame&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;6.25&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;1400&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;355&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Enchanter&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Madness of Ikkibi&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td

align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;1100&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;300&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Mage&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Firebolt of Tallon&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;2000&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;500&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Mage&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Rock of Taelosia&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;6.35&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td

align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;1300&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;465&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Ranger&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Sylvan Burn&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;3.5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;30&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;770&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td

align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;220&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Shadowknight&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Miasmic Wind&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;0.5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;45&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;660&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;247&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Shadowknight&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Spear of Decay&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;0.5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;45&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;600&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;225&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Shaman&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Spear of Torment&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;4.2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;675&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;275&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Shaman&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Velium Strike&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;7.8&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;925&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;300&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Wizard&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;White Fire&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;3015&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;704&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Wizard&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Strike of Solusek&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;2740&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;640&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Wizard&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Black Ice&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;1045&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;280&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;<br />
<br />
In terms of efficiency (straight damage per mana) we rank as follows:<br />
<br />
Wizards are the tops with 4.28 dmg/mana (SoS and White Fire)<br />
Mages next with 4 dmg/mana (Firebolt of Tallon)<br />
Druids next with 3.97 dmg/mana. (winter's Frost)<br />
Enchanters with 3.66 dmg/mana (Madness of Ikkibi)<br />
Shaman with 3.08 dmg/mana (Velium Strike)<br />
Clerics with 3.02 dmg/mana (Order)<br />
Necromancers with 2.79 dmg/mana (Neurotoxin)<br />
Rangers with 2.78 dmg/mana (Brushfire)<br />
Beastlords with 2.7 dmg/mana (Trushar's Frost)<br />
Shadowknights with 2.67 dmg/mana (Miasmic Wind)<br />
<br />
I was a little surprised here, I expected Sony to give us much less efficient nukes to &quot;balance&quot; against cannibalize.<br />
<br />
Your changes to the nukes would result in a slight decrease in the efficiency of our nukes leaving us exactly where we are.  This is fine.  However it neglects to take in account the changes in dps this would results in.<br />
<br />
A simplistic look at dps would be to evaluate the potential dps from chain casting the nuke (casting nothing but the nuke in question). To calculate this, we need to take the refresh time into account.  The results are as follows:<br />
<br />
Wizards are tops with 301.5 dmg/sec (White Fire)<br />
Mages with 222.2 dmg/sec (Firebolt of Tallon)<br />
Druids with 206.7 dmg/sec (Sylvan Fire)<br />
Necromancers with 130 dmg/sec (Neurotoxin)<br />
Shaman with 108 dmg/sec (Spear of Torment)<br />
Clerics with 89 dmg/sec (Order)<br />
Enchanters with 86 dmg/sec (Madness of Ikkibi)<br />
Hybrids are all less than 25 dmg/sec due to the long recast times on their nukes 30+ sec.<br />
<br />
This analysis is not accurate, fights do not last long enough for nukers to fire off unlimited nukes (disregarding mana constraints)  Instead I like to look at an 18 second window for nuking.  Still sticking to one spell, we get the following dps numbers:<br />
<br />
Wizards with 335 dmg/sec (White Fire)<br />
Mage with 222 dmg/sec (Firebolt of Tallon)<br />
Druid with 189 dmg/sec (Sylvan Fire)<br />
Necromancer with 144 dmg/sec (Neurotoxin)<br />
Shaman with 75 dmg/sec (Spear of Torment)<br />
Cleric with 67.2 dmg/sec (Order)<br />
Enchanter with 67.2 dmg/sec (Madness of Ikkibi)<br />
Ranger with 42.7 dmg/sec (Sylvan Burn)<br />
Beastlord with 41.2 dmg/sec (Trushar's Frost)<br />
Shadowknights with 36.6 dmg/sec (Miasmic Wind)<br />
<br />
I'm still not satisfied with this as an adequate picture of true nuking ability.  Let's assume instead that each nuking class is willing to devote two spell gems to their nukes and is willing to cycle through them to achieve maximum output of damage over the same 18 sec interval.  The numbers:<br />
<br />
Wizards with 335 dmg/sec (White Fire)<br />
Mage with 222 dmg/sec (Firebolt of Tallon)<br />
Druid with 189 dmg/sec (Sylvan Fire)<br />
Necromancer with 144 dmg/sec (Neurotoxin)<br />
Cleric with 128 dmg/sec (Order and Condemnation)<br />
Enchanter with 128 dmg/sec (Madness of Ikkibi and Insanity)<br />
Shaman with 88 dmg/sec (Spear of Torment and Velium strike)<br />
Ranger with 81 dmg/sec (Sylvan Burn and Frozen Wind)<br />
Beastlord with 78 dmg/sec (Trushar's Frost and Frost Spear)<br />
Shadowknights with 70 dmg/sec (Miasmic Wind and Spear of Decay)<br />
<br />
Now the number start to reveal a problem.  Shaman are dipping dangerous low into the realm of hybrid nuking, still better but barely.  Ideally I'd like to see our nuking on par with Clerics and Enchanters, but I'd accept being somewhat below them.  The changes proposed put us at:<br />
<br />
122 dmg/sec (Spear of Torment and Velium strike)<br />
<br />
We're still a step behind Enchanters, Clerics and Necros, but enough ahead of Hybrids to be considered viable sources of dps. (All this hinges off the assumption that while DPS from DoTs can be good, they just don't cut the mustard on the shorter fights)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>TeodorL</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Of course the above ignore resist checks - with resist checks our dps from nukes is what, 0? :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>jraven1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Another minor request that has been discussed: shaman should be able to bash with their shields.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Looks great, thanks Murtak!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The summary looks great Murtak. You seem to have gotten to the core of the issues.<br />
<br />
My addendum:<br />
<br />
I would like to raise my voice for the changes, when and if they come, to be available to a wide range of players. Not just the uber-guilders.<br />
<br />
My feeling is that spells should be roughly the same for everyone but gear should set people apart.<br />
<br />
If SoE does not make the same spells available to everyone, some people will end up being less shaman than other shaman. Spells are what makes us shaman, gear and skills is what make us uber. Restricting key-spells for only a few is bordering on segregation.<br />
<br />
AA's are more fair since everyone can with a little time put into it aquire the AA's the prioritize. Still. Thats a lame excuse for key abilites.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I really think that increasing mana cost on our nukes is a mistake.  By doing that you are increasing only our &quot;burst&quot; DPS ability.  You aren't really giving us the ability to contribute consistent DPS to a group.  That to me is key.<br />
<br />
It's not how much damage you might be able to do on this one mob, it's how much damage you can do to each and every mob we face.<br />
<br />
What might be interesting to find out, though I have *no* idea how, is how much damage a wizard does to each mob, on average.<br />
<br />
Sure, we can look at their spells, add the cast and recast times and see what their potential DPS is . . . but how much are they actually doing in &quot;live&quot; situations.  I'm fairly certain they aren't sitting back chain casting their top nukes.<br />
<br />
Food for thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Food for what thought? What does comparing potential shaman nukes to wizard nukes have to do with anything? I don't think any of us are asking to do anything close to the nuke damage of a wizard. Personally, I'd like to be able to get ONE nuke off before the damn mob is dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>TeodorL</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I wasn't really comparing potential shaman nukes directly to wizard nukes, but rather trying to create a picture of nuking as a whole.  Looking at the balance of nuking as a whole, we can see how we fare in the &quot;balance&quot;.  I don't think shaman nukes should be anywhere near the level of wizard, magician or even druid nukes.  However I would like to see some of the power wielded by clerics *boggle* shared by shaman.<br />
<br />
As far as being able to get one nuke off before the mob is dead, we still have Spear of Torment =/<br />
<br />
Kidding aside, the time on our nukes is indicative of the role we shaman are expected to play.  With their short recast time, the longer the fight the more effective our nukes become.  Clerics and Enchanters are saddled with long recast times on their nukes.  But with shorter fights and pulls sometimes taking longer thant fights, being able to fire off your best nuke in 6 seconds rather than 7.8 can make a world of difference in your ability to contribute.  The 8 second recast time on their nukes (as opposed to our 2) seems like not such a horrible drawback when you only have time to drop one nuke on the mob anyways.</div></div><hr />

Got to say I disagree on this a bit...its fine for druids to beat us in either burst dps or burst healing...but its totally broken that they beat us in both, and really by a considerable margin<br />

<br />
What I was saying is this:<br />
<br />
We all know that Wizards have, by far, the greatest nuking ability in the game.  I agree with this and in no way have I ever said that this should change.  I never intended to even insinuate that we should be close to their ability.<br />
<br />
What I was pondering is more a question of what a Wizard really does.  I know he doesn't start chain casting nukes on incoming.  How many spells does a Wizard cast on a per mob basis?  How much damage does he actually do on a per mob basis?  What percentage of the mobs health is actually taken away by a Wizard?  These are the things I was pondering.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
Pondering this whole DPS issue further got me to thinking.<br />
<br />
122 dmg/sec (Spear of Torment and Velium strike)<br />
<br />
We're still a step behind Enchanters, Clerics and Necros, but enough ahead of Hybrids to be considered viable sources of dps. (All this hinges off the assumption that while DPS from DoTs can be good, they just don't cut the mustard on the shorter fights)<br />
<br />
If we feel that 122 DPS is an acceptable level of DPS for the Shaman, then perhaps we are a lot closer than we think to where we wish to be.<br />
<br />
Tears of Saryn + Velium Strike:<br />
<br />
Assume one wave of Tears is resisted.  (Yea, that does suck, but its reality).  Anyway . . . 2 waves of Tears + Velium Strike = 123.6 DPS.  Add in dogdog's 25 DPS and we're just below and unhasted Ranger, generally thought to be around 157 DPS.<br />
<br />
More food for thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Very nice post, perhaps the best summary of Shaman issues I have seen.<br />
<br />
I would like to throw out a few (tweeks) if you will that you might consider adding.<br />
<br />
1) Pet innate duel wield.  Although I agree 100% with having puppy duel wield, I think that giving Shaman perhaps a couple of levels of weapon summoning spells (with procs) may be a nicer fix (in that &quot;perfect world&quot;).<br />
<br />
2) Nukes: I think that a slight reduction in casting times on our DD's is warranted - perhaps 25%.  I'm with Gloriana on this one, not even being able to contribute ANY damage because of our slow casting nukes is enemy #1 - especially on clearing mobs in raids when you do not have slowing duty.<br />
<br />
3) I think that asking for our ancient canny spell to be &quot;store bought&quot; may be a bit ambitious unless it is 50k+ which would require a time sink to make the plat.  Otherwise perhaps make it obtainable for all Shaman with some sort of Quest.<br />
<br />

PS: It's about the burst damage! Fast fights are the new EQ and that is to be the continued according to the developers.  I couldn't disagree more with Sudedor on that point or on the &quot;phantom 120dps&quot; which really is about 50% of that because most of us still have to malos, slow, buff, heal and canny here and there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">For gods sake Purdy read in context.<br />
<br />
That figure is based on the assumption that Slowing is irrelevant in the encounter.  There are many mobs that die in under 30 seconds in current content.  For those mobs, Slow is not relevant as it is mitigated and only affects 30% of the fight.  This is about being able to make a difference in that fight, where we are NOT slowing.<br />
<br />
If you aren't to that content yet, great.  Enjoy your Shaman.  If you are, I cannot understand why increasing your sustained potential DPS isn't an option you care for.  I for one would like to be relevant to a group in all content, outside of my increasingly devalued ability to Slow a mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I wouldn't even count rains in the equation unless they adjust or tweak them. They are highly situational - you have to avoid hitting yourself and not have mezzed mobs plus the resist rates are atrocious. Tweak our nukes up a bit, lower cast times, and do something about DoT aggro for the love of little monkeys!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">That was kinda my point Litch . . . I'd like them to look at the built in 20% resist on rains and remove it.  I agree, there are situations where they just aren't viable, but in judging what has happened in the past and applying it to the future I think it more likely that we could successfully petition for tweaks to current spells than we could successfully petition for entirely new spells or radical changes to existing ones.  (Gah - thats a helluva run on sentence).<br />
<br />
As far as DoT aggro goes, I'm letting the Necro Correspondent do a lot of our work for us.  They are hardcore on the warpath to get that fixed and frankly, more power to them.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Sudedor sorry for the tone of my previous message.  I did take it in context, but I do not agree with the underlying assumption that there are times when slow is near worthless (except perhaps when an enchanter pet is tanking).  In all other cases, even in 30 second fights I can't imagine a better use of mana than slowing for a shaman as long as you can slow somewhat early in the encounter.<br />
<br />
It has been my experience in tipt, vxed etc. that even if you have a really tough tank and a competent cleric that 1) the cleric constantly runs low on mana even with a shaman slowing on incoming and keeping Q on the tank 2) the cleric is unable to safely use ch without a slow because the mob might get a lucky quad in.<br />
<br />
I suppose that if you substitute a second cleric for a shaman and the clerics only use their GoD fast heal and alternate medding then it would work fine (and probably be safer), but you would lose shaman utility and dps as a tradeoff for that safety.<br />
<br />
But anyway, I continue to think that our slow is not worthless even with mitigation because it allows a single cleric to do 90% of the healing thru their efficient ch and not run out of mana in a fast pulling group.  Also, its all about burst damage for shorter fights because without the burst damage Shaman fall significantly short in most encounters vs beastlords.  Additionally, we need burst damage because we Shaman do not want to become buffing bots which would happen if most of our damage is thru indirect longer duration buffing.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I agree, we need more burst damage, but we also need it to be sustainable.  I'm digging hard to find out how much burst damage we feel is acceptable over what amount of time and then see if it can be balanced against the true &quot;DPS&quot; classes and not turn us into gods.<br />
<br />
The best chance of us getting changes are to stay within the framework of spells we already have and tune things.  Thus a hard look at Rains.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gumurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">i defininitely like all the things you referred to Murtak, especially the group heal, of course we all know that Quiescence, our heal over time spells, are most mana efficient and do a great job also... a group heal over time would be awesome.. even if it was like a 30 minute reuse it would still be awesome... spear of torment, definitely needs to be increased in damage, even if the mana was significantly increased, with all of my spell crit aa's, i crit quite a bit, does some pretty decent damage compared to dots especially if you have the mana saving focus..<br />
<br />
The idea of the basically... cannibalizing your health for others safety, alot like the paladin AA act of valor, i think that is also a good idea, developers should definitely think about that.  Could come in very handy, nice work Murtak.</div></div><hr />
