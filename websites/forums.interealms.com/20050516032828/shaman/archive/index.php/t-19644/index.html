<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Mind you im talking per sitting. So when you talk about LDoN, talk about it in the respect of time the first mob is pulled, to the time you leave.<br />
<br />
Do you mid 50's find its better exp in LDoN or in PoP?  If PoP what zones are you leveling in? Feedback please.<br />
<br />
No level 65 PoV input please, cause as we all know, thats a different world.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was 55 I think when ldon came out, so I cant speak for that.  I found podisease courtyard to be quite nice at that level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I doued my ranger at that level with my shammy in dulak, ranger was 54 when I was 52. Got a solid 8-10% xp per hour, and thats before the group xp changes so would be more like 10-12% an hour now. Not uber but pretty decent, fairly low risk and the loot was way better than PoP. This was before ldon also so not sure if thats any better or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When I was playing my Cleric, I could routinely make 20-30% regular xp on an LDoN mission IF the other group members were of a higher level than me.<br />
<br />
At 60 I was grouping with 65's and leveling fast using LDoN.<br />
<br />
If your not in a group of higher toons then I dont recommend it.  You will go nuts with people selecting Collect 20 so they can get quick points and leave.  Won't get any xp either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There's like a whole forum devoted to this, odd that this thread hasn't been moved there. But at 52 HHK nobles are best still. they go light blue at 53 IIRC. Elements at Nadox lava zone in are good XP if they are still dark blue, don't recall exactly when they go light. Did the boats in Dulak through most of my low to mid 50's - safe easy solo. Of all the solo spots in the game from 56 up, I found velks best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gakal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I found POI very quick xp at that level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I find LDoN is good in the low 50s but really dries up around 54-56+ unless you are way below the group.<br />
<br />
For example - did an adv the other day with my 56 bard, everyone else was 58 except one other 56 char. We killed fast, finished adv in about 45 mins and I got 6% xp. Factor in the time spent running there, buffing, getting adv (but not any lfg time) its about an hour for 6% xp. I don't think that's anything special.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest doing your LoY spell quests if you haven't already, and get some xp there whilst you are at it. Then try to get xp groups, either in PoI (if you can get a factory group, that's superb xp!), PoN across the river either at docks or zo2, or PoD at the castle. Its been too long to remember what rate of xp to expect there but those were teh best places when I did it.<br />
<br />
If you're talking solo, I think you might struggle in PoP (depending on gear), and have more luck in dulak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Cool, honestly im asking for my SK more then anything else, but good suggestions. But im really trying to figure out if LDON is better then PoP at that level or if they are atleast close.<br />
<br />
Its obvious that PoE and such will &gt; LDoN, but the question is will PoI or PoD &gt; LDoN at that level.<br />
<br />
Ad your right, i should have posted this in the other forum, im so used to talking here i just forgot /shrug.<br />
<br />
btw, im not doing his LDoN quest spell. Its a pain in the arse i think for a slightly shorter FD. I dunno, but im just not that bored yet lol. I would definetly be camping them all with my shaman then logging him in and looting the parts. My shaman has other things on his mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Solo - Nobles in HHK.  See the hunting forums.<br />
<br />
Bards there go LB at 54, nobles go LB at 55 (some may be LB at 54, vague on that.)  At 55 I was still getting fast exp and decent cash loots in HHK.  At 56 I moved to Katta and thot I shudda moved sooner. .... all pre-PoP, of course.  53 to 59 was the fastest leveling I ever did, and these were still hell levels at the time.  (okay, it was also the only time I concentrated on leveling, too)<br />
<br />
PoP would be much faster exp, but on my server, it has become bring yer own group, or PL, in PoN, PoI and PoD.  Dunno about PoJ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Litgruv,<br />
<br />
The higher level spell quest netted my bard 20% xp, just from the turn in, and I did it in my 50s (52-55 or so). Factor in the level of some mobs there, you may be surprised with the xp just hunting parts, but it will all depend on the specifics of the SK quest. Not saying you should do it, but don't dismiss it out of hand :)<br />
<br />
I'd say at 52 you will do well if you can get LDoN groups with an average around 55-56 or so. Anything less than that and a good tier 1 PoP group at the camps mentioned above is gonna be better (if you can find such a group these days :()<br />
<br />
HHK as mentioned, good spot if you are looking to solo but may be perma-camped on some servers.<br />
<br />
Once you hit 55 or so, you really need level 60+ groups in LDoN to get any decent xp at all (or do hards, not really experimented with that at 55 though).<br />
<br />
And for reference if anyone else reads this after a search on LDoN xp - LDoN XP prior to level 50 is great, and prior to 45 it just blows the lid off anything else besides bards AE kiting 25 cougars at once or similar &quot;classes are balanced&quot; madness.</div></div><hr />
