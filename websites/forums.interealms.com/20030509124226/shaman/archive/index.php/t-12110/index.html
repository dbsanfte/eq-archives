<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Gloriana has lost her password.  She sent a PM or something to Sunmoon about it with her email addy but couldn't get thru.  I can also send her email addy as well in a PM if needed.  PM me please.  It would be a shame to lose such a respected poster as Glori over a technical difficulty.  <br />
<br />
The rest of this thread, feel free to dedicate to Glori raves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I hope Arriana has her PW too, whatever will we do without BOTH of them :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I wish there was something I could do.  :(<br />
<br />
The only people who can do something about it would be Sunmoon or Thantu.  Thantu I haven't seen in weeks and Sunmoon made it very clear to me that he was too busy to work on the boards right now, in a recent email.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Get her to register a temp account and PM thantu with the account name and original email address along with the new one - I had the same problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sooo...<br />
why not just start a new account?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just got back in today.  Whew.  Was going through posting withdrawl (twitch, twitch).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sooo...<br />
why not just start a new account?<br />
<br />
Thats kinda like saying .. why not start a new shaman cause you password isnt working on your 65 with 210 AA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">postcount means that much to you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Eh ?<br />
<br />
Its about your name and what was yours.<br />
<br />
If you concern is post count , anyone with admin status can modify any profile in here to reflect whatever count you want.<br />
<br />
Think of it like this... You have this nice lil honda , its been really good to you and you have fond memories of it , well one day it gets stolen but someone comes up and offers you another honda that is kinda like the old one. Sure its a nice honda and will do just fun , but really you would rather have that old honda back cause thats where you proposed to your wife or something.<br />
<br />
Sentimental value i guess would be a good description.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think the point is, this is GLORI and we want her back!  Get with the program Sunmoon!  Quit slacking!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">More Glori..less chatter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm sorry everyone, Im cleaning house tonight, but will go through the emails tonight for lost passwords and fix them up at about 11:30pm EST.<br />
<br />
Again, I apologize for it taking so long, but have a TON of stuff going on right now.. hell, I haven't played EQ in a month! :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jing Drinal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The same thing happened to me. I made a new account. I have not been able to post as &quot;Jing&quot; since the boards were changed. It says my password is invalid, although I haven't changed it in years. It also does not recognize my email address when I try to have my password sent to me. I emailed Sunmoon a few days ago about it.</div></div><hr />
