<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lulian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You should raise 1hb, 1hs, piercing and 2hs.  If you have the patience raise your 2hb as well.  There are too many good weapons of all types to limit yourself to one type.<br />
Even at higher lvls (55+) you won't use your bow all that much until EQ/AM.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The only time when you are able to use your bow more effectively than you will your melee weapons is when you have AM3/EQ.  And even thats debateable; some would look at the most uber weapons available and think that the bow does not even do that much over time.<br />
<br />
Work on your weapon skills.  AM3/EQ is level 59 and 45 AA points.  Thats at a minimum.  During the gaining of those levels and AA points your melee weapons will be the weapons of choice; you'll far outdamage your bow with them.</div></div><hr />

WHAT?!?! You don't want to nuke even?!?! Oh come on now...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Daesun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You must, must, MUST max all your weapon skills.  I've used all sorts of weapons in my EQ career; each class of weapon at one point was essential for increasing my damage output (Swiftwind - 1hs, Hammer of Battle - 1hb, primal brawlstick - 2hb, etc).<br />
<br />
Towards the later levels, you'll easily max a weapon skill even if you've been neglecting it, but start early and save the hassle of whiffing for a couple of hours before you become proficient.  Get a dex buff from a shaman or enchanter to increase the speed of your skillups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ruparin01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Your main weapon skills plateau at 39, and won't get any higher til 50 or 51. <br />
<br />
You have the time to max lots of skills in those 10 levels of grinding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dinfalas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Utilize all weapon skills, young padawan..<br />
<br />
That is all..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Yuma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Definatly get all your weapon skills up because situational weapons you might have a Swarmcaller for slows but your 2hs suxxors and it hardly procs, that and its cool when friend brag about how good thier weap is and when you try it you out dmg them with it 10 fold.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Roophus Gunthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Aye, best to get both skills up.</div></div><hr />

Thanks, that's a nice way to put it.  At 30th level, I have 1HS maxed, 2HS at a little over 100, and Piercing at 70 or so.  I want to get 1HB and 2HB up there as well, but it's just been very slow to do three different skills as it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rieker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I say be  weapons master. Right now I am 45 with 200 in 1HS, 1HB, AND 2HS. There are some very nice weapons that are ranger only so when I group, I usually get them by default. Since 40, I've been maxxing all those out and I am working on Piercing and 2HB. It makes it interesting, sometimes annoying. Just imagine seening someone come up and ask you for a port because you got a Nature's Wrath and a Treeweave on...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Samanthie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well hon, I understand your plight.  At level 20 you may not have saved up very much pp yet, and you might have the funds to buy only 1 nice weapon.  Try buying a centi short sword first.  If you have the money left over at level 20 then buy a centi hammer.  Both are cheap on our server, and you can use them for skill gains.  Carry around a piercer, a 2HS, and a 2HB as well, even if it is nothing more than fine steel at first.<br />
<br />
During those times when you are LFG, waiting for friends to come, or are generally just bored, look for a group that is killing mobs and ask them if you can hit on thier Blue conned mobs for skill level.  Most groups will not mind the extra DPS, and you can work on your skills while waiting for what ever reason.  When you hit your skill cap for that level, work on 1HB then 2HS then 1HP and finally 2HB (or what ever route you want to take)<br />
<br />
If money is not an object, well then take the time to select really nice weapons that you can swap around for the different situations that you will be in.</div></div><hr />
