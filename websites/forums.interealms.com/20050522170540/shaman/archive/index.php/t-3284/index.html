<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I tell you, iam losing patience hehe, I recently switch to giant faction about 3 weeks ago.  <br />
<br />
In that time I had about 5 Icewell Raids killing royals, I leeched 2 dain hits and been killing wolfs and and their masters in GD collecting heads a couple of hours a day every other day or so since then.<br />
<br />
I am still Scowls Argggggg!<br />
<br />
Just what does it take?<br />
<br />
I am not even up to the head turn in part yet? I wonder how many heads am I going to have to turn in to get ally with Tormax?<br />
<br />
Any advice to raise faction up faster?   <br />
<br />
The Icewell raids have been knocked out since Guild started with ToV, most are already ally, so I am pretty much stuck killing the young in GD unless someone has better suggestions, I take it the hits I get from the little guys arent that big. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">har har har yeah it sucks.<br />
<br />
go kill in SS, duo with a monk or other mele killing cubes, wurms and wvyerns. That will give big +zek hits<br />
<br />
go kill in the mines in GD, the blue guards give pretty big zek and riff hits. Get yurself about 60-75 coldain heads killing the greenies down there also.<br />
<br />
turn in heads to the recruiter for big +riff hits<br />
<br />
turn in heads to capt. bvelos for big +zek hits and smallish +tormax hits.<br />
<br />
since all the dain kills I wouldnt imagine it will be that hard to get non kos to tormax with about 30-40 heads.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Which giants are you /con'ing that says you still scowl? Most giant outside of kael itself are on kromrif faction (including GD/EW ones).  zone into kael and make a friend target a kromzek and a tormax and run back so you can /assist and /con, with dubious zek you can hand in heads/paws to bvellos in the bank, and with a coh you only need max ally zek and dubious tormax to do the <br />
quests</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks guys, yeah I am conning the ones in GD/EW, I will check Kael when I get a chance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I soloed 4 days straight in skyshrine maybe 10 hours a day, went from max ally cov to max ally kromzek if that helps.  Oh, was killing the Fe'Dhars and Lararith/Jaelk, not the mobs by zone in.  If you can solo in there, more power to you, if not, get a melee and tasher/occluder friend as mobs in ss have abnormally high resists (obviously crucial for slows).<br />
<br />
And loot is just awesome.  Think I made about 100k's worth in that 4 days, including some goodies I kept for my monk like oiled greaves, mantle of absorption, focused ethereal earring, and medium coin purse.  Just an overview, but if ya wanna know more, feel free to ask, might even start a new thread about it.<br />
<br />
Oh, and question: I'm max kromzek now, but my kromrif/tormax faction remains untouched.  Is this gunna be a major problem for questing armour since I'm max kos to both even though it's zek faction you need to quest the armour?  Might sound like a noob question, but been on cov faction for a long long time.</div></div><hr />

Continue with the Icewell raids, Skyshrine only gives you Zek faction and not Riff.  The GD dorfs give small faction hits but drop heads which give large faction hits when turned into Captain Bvellos.  Do not give heads to the Kromriff Recruiter, there is no Tormax faction hit when you turn heads into the Recruiter, only from Bvellos do you get Tormax hits.<br />

<br />
Where abouts were you soloing in SS?<br />
<br />
I have a 52 warrior I can tandem with and would much rather be getting xp then killing greens.<br />
<br />
Also, FWIW, Dain kills only give you Tormax, not the rif/zek factions</div></div><hr />
