<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok, just got my epic 1.5 - and I'm wondering who else put it straight in a bag since it's worse than their TA.  I would love to see it to become range equipable, but before I waste time on feedback and bugging everyone I know I'd like to know how many have a similar problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Usually equipping TA, but switch to epic during some fights and when there's plenty of shamans in the raid. Epic is really good but you can't beat the click slow in many occasions. <br />
<br />
I still think epic is well worth having for the click effect even when you have TA, plus the quest was pretty cool :) Also, it is prereq for epic2 which is probably going to be very nice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty much exactly what he said.  I use TA about 95% of the time even though I have 1.5.  Having clicky slow is just so hard to get rid of when you have been using it for so long.<br />
<br />
If they made TA clickable from inventory then I would wield epic 100% of the time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
I was thinking about that, but that would make it all/all usable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you got 1.5 just for clicky, then shouldn't be a prob....  didn't they make it clickable from inventory a few weeks ago?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yep, and that's all I got it for.  Well there are a few situations when I would sub in epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am probably one of the rare ones who have kept epic equipped.  The epic could use a physical facelift (not stats), yet I've grown to keep it equipped instead of the TA.  I think a major reason for it is I use Nihil as my primary slow, and with it usually landing the first time around, I don't click my TA as often as I used to (just got Nihil about a month ago after trying for 8 months).  However, I do switch to TA during times when slow resists my be harsh, and when multiple mobs are in camp (xp or raid) and need the TA for longer lasting durations on tank or chanter mezzed mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not necessery there are lots of clicky items only classes listed can use from inventory.</div></div><hr />

Why would that be?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Bah, clicked on the wrong choice. Have both epic and TA, equip TA and slot epic for clicky.<br />

If I get my epic I will *never* equip it. never. I know what it looks like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ghwerig-AO</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Only time I equipped the new 1.5 Epic was in the Weaponery trial in MPG while in Rabid Bear form since it was the only blunt weapon I had at the time.  Anyways, it the new epic has been bagged since I got it, and Ive only ever used the clicky effect 2 times so far.<br />

I don't have both (may have one, the other, or neither).<br />
I have both and primarily equip 1.5 (TA situationally).<br />
I have both and primarily equip TA (1.5 situationally).<br />
I have both and swap them in and out as needed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>jador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">TA require equipment to work,  but EPIC 1.5 is &quot;INV  CLICKABLE&quot;.   After used Epic 1.5 effect, reuse timer show at Inv slot(white fogs cover on epic 1.5 inv slot).     Often use it while group need heal or multi inc.     Only time equip epic 1.5 is avoid agro vs hard hitting raid mobs or be puller.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Galiden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Only have TA, will not equip epic if I do get it.  The clicky is nice, and I may have it equipped when I am the 5th shaman on the raid, but otherwise no.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats not true, there are plenty of inventory clickable items that aren't all/all usable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gakal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">TA over epic every time, epic just gets clicked from inventory.  Of course if soe wanna be my hero they can make TA clickable from inventory.  ;)  Then i can equip my epic......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I equip TA and click Epic from inventory. If Soe ever changed TA to click from inventory I would switch in a heartbeat though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dunno, the enchanter epic is really bad.  <br />
<br />
Grats on finally getting the TA though.  I know it took a long time for you.<br />
<br />
If I ever got a TA, which isn't happening anytime soon, I'd equip it over the epic any day of the week.<br />
<br />
But you need epic 1.5 before you can get epic 2.0, and I'll bet epic 2.0 is not too shabby.</div></div><hr />

About ****ing time man.. congratz :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Frakass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">what about hammer of hours (for focus) ? looted that one tonight cause it was roting, stats are very similar to other two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I think the Enchanter one is great, that moving eyeball cracks me up, lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">The enchanter one looks a lot better with the particle effect, from what I've seen. it has this hallucinogenic look.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not at all, try doing the staff of temperate flux on any class other than wizard, it doesn't work but wizards can use from inventory. Which is a shame cause it would have been a sweet pulling tool for my monk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">TA only all the way, not that I even own OoW =P</div></div><hr />

I've had the Epic 1.5 for several weeks and had found I'd actually grown rather fond of it (even persuaded myself that the agro reduction focus works).</div></div><hr />
