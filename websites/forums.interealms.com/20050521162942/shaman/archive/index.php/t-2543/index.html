<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kakkaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I need help in completing the last part of my epic...so far I have gotten to the end myself, but doing rak alone isn't an option and I don't have a guild....so where is a good place I could get ppl together or does anyone know someone that could get ppl together to help me out on the rak part of my epic on 7th?<br />
<br />
Info would be appreciated<br />
<br />
Thx<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Join a Black Reaver raid, which should be quite common. These days even a single group (of very well equipped people) can kill the reavers.<br />
<br />
Then find a couple of mages to help you out, and a cleric. When the reaver killers spawn Rak, do your hand in and send in the mage pets.<br />
<br />
Of course there are details like where to spawn Rak, clearing adds etc etc, but you get the basic idea :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If he's joining a reaver raid, you have to hope they already have a rogue to get them to the reavers :)<br />
<br />
My point was, piggy back your little Rak-killing group on someone elses raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You really don't need to much these days to do Rak.  A decently geared group of 60s can handily defeat him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You try this crap on some and you will be flamed into oblivion. Market channels are for sales and auctions not LFG'ing/ Raiding.</div></div><hr />
