Extended Affliction seems to be worthless now since it doenst really help our poison dots and most encounters dont last long enough for our disease dots.<br />

<br />
Absor says (and I agree) that DoTs are underpowered, especially in groups.  He says (and I agree somewhat) that the Affliction focus effects are too good to be applied to spells like charm, slow, or root.<br />
<br />
Here is the fix:<br />
<br />
tell a programmer to systematically increase the duration, decrease mana cost, and decrease casting time of all DoT spells by 10%, making sure that 6 tick spells actually go to 7 ticks - something which doesn't happen reliably with the focus effect =(<br />
<br />
Now, change the &quot;Affliction&quot; focus effect back to how it was the last 9 months (remove the &quot;hitpoints allowed&quot; restriction), except decrease the effects to 18% haste, mana saving, and duration.  These are effects that high end players can get (Solusek focus) so it would not present any game balance issues.  If charm is intended to be excluded, that can be done easily enough (I do not think it should be)<br />
<br />
This is the only solution that satisfies the SoE's stated (and legitimate) game design aims while not screwing and enraging the affected customers to the point of leaving the game.  That's right, we're customers.</div></div><hr />

Increasing the length of my dots is NOT the solution.<br />
<br />
More dps with a shorter duration is the solution. PoP mobs are dead in ONE dot.... dots are virtually useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Uman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yeah a focus that increase dot dmg per tick would be much less quirky (especially on 6 tick dots) and would make much more sense.<br />

What I proposed is a good solution within the existing framework and with minimal effort on their part, which doesn't even mean they'll do it =(</div></div><hr />

Mamas, Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Shamans<br />
<br />
Absor made a clarification the other day about something that was missed in Tuesday's patch message:<br />
<br />
With the patch on February 4th we fixed a bug with Affliction foci, but we failed to mention it in the patch message. We corrected a bug that was allowing these foci to work for too many spell types, including things like snares and slow. Affliction foci now only work on damage over time spells. <br />
<br />
We apologize for not mentioning this fix in the patch message. <br />
<br />
The very high savings in cast time and mana, as well as the extended duration, were planned to only work on damage over time spells. These spells needed more help than all other detrimental spells. The affliction foci for haste and mana are dramatically better (more than twice as effective) than other items of the type. The extension focus is better than any other as well, though not to such a degree. These items are only so much better than others because they were intended only to improve the effect of damage over time spells to bolster their value. <br />
<br />
We fixed a similar bug in June of 2002. Some time between then and now the bug resurfaced. The bug was fixed while another was being addressed, and because it wasn't the targeted bug fix it didn't make it into the patch message. We certainly wouldn't have left this information out on purpose. <br />
<br />
We understand that this change has an effect on some players. But these foci have always been intended to work exclusively on DoT spells, and we do not plan to undo the bug fix. We'll look at other detrimental spells and see if there are some lines that should benefit from similar focus items, but that will be done on a case-by-case basis and not by reverting this recent bug fix.<br />
<br />
The response from the shaman community was loud and immediate: the vast majority are outraged by this change. Some players have spent the better part of nine months (and copious amounts of platinum) planning their gear around obtaining these focus effects in order to benefit spells like debuffs, slows, and roots. With other changes since PoP's release that have negatively impacted the role of shamans, many are throwing in the towel out of frustration.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I know, people say that all the time, but in this case it's more than usual.<br />
<br />
Enchanters are also feeling the impact of this change, as the Affliction focus was benefiting their charms and debuffs as well. Other effects (such as Focus of Solusek) do still benefit these types of spells, but items with this effect are fairly rare.<br />
<br />
If you look back at the June patch message to which Absor refers, you will indeed see the following:<br />
<br />
- Spell duration foci designed to affect DoTs (the Affliction line) should now work reliably. <br />
<br />
- The Affliction focus line should now only be affecting spells that do damage.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, Alan is correct in saying that the Affliction line was never meant to affect spells like debuffs and charms, and the fact that they were doing so was a bug. While it took an awfully long time to be fixed, that doesn't change the facts. Players who take advantage of an obvious bug, regardless of their motives, have to live with the consequences if and when that bug is fixed.<br />
<br />
That said, I have to agree with the shamans when they say how horribly this situation was dealt with, and SOE really needs to stop handling problems this way.<br />
<br />
I'm not arguing against fixing bugs and exploits. These things have to be fixed for the good of the game, even if it means players lose something. But communication about these kinds of things needs to improve about 1000% on Verant's part.<br />
<br />
When you go nine months without fixing a bug, players stop thinking of it as a bug and start to see it as a feature (insert old programmer joke here). They come to accept it as just a part of the game, making character decisions based upon that bug being the status quo. While this is presumptuous of players, they can't really be blamed for doing so.<br />
<br />
It is completely unreasonable for SOE to mention something in a patch nine months ago and expect people to remember it. When it was clear that this bug had resurfaced (again, MONTHS ago) somebody at Verant should have mentioned that this was due to be fixed. Give players some time to prepare for it--don't just pull the rug out from under them. There was plenty of opportunity for Alan to pop into a Crucible thread and say, &quot;Look guys, please be aware that the Affliction focus was never meant to affect anything besides DoTs. We will be fixing this in the near future, so be aware that the change is on its way.&quot; While there would probably be just as much bitching, at least players couldn't complain that the fix came out of nowhere.<br />
<br />
This should have been done for wizards and monks a while back, and it should have been done in this case. What makes this whole mess even worse is that the fix wasn't mentioned in the patch message. How many times do major changes get omitted from patch messages? Far too often. No, I don't think it's done maliciously, but it's way, way too sloppy to be acceptable.<br />
<br />
If this change was a fix to an AA skill, players would see points refunded. Given the fact that players have spent lots of time and money investing in items like the Circlet of the Falinkan and Ceramic Skulls of Decay specifically to benefit debuffs, charms, and slows, these items should be tradable (or craftable) into items with identical stats but a focus effect that would impact the desired spells--maybe a toned-down version of Focus of Solusek or something.<br />
<br />
The vast majority of players really didn't know this was a bug that was due to be fixed. Making them suffer for it as if they had been consciously exploiting something is wrong, especially when game balance wasn't cited as a mitigating factor in the decision to make the change.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, shamans and chanters, that I can't get behind the notion of returning the Affliction line to what it was--bugs need to be fixed, even after months and months. But you are right that this situation was handled miserably, and changes like this shouldn't just be allowed to tumble out of the sky on a regular basis at the expense of so many honest players.<br />
<br />
Pretty nifty how I probably just alienated both sides of this debate, eh? Kind of begs the question...</div></div><hr />

<br />
So if it was 9 months ago, but on the Crucible it would be ok.  Riiiiight, I buy that.<br />
<br />
<br />
I do have a question though, what AA were we supposed to buy because of our foci item?  I am unaware which one affects click items.<br />
<br />
Also, how would SoE know how much the foci was bought for to reimburse?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I believe the AA situation was just a point about compensation for time spent on a feature in the game being changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Being given aa because of a change to equipment foci makes even less sense than giving money and DKP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Mythix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">jaedan, its not that they are suggesting giving AA's back to people he is using an example. <br />
<br />
when they reduced the affect of manaburn (I think thats it the wiz AA) they offered AA's(that they had spent) back to compensate for the change. <br />
<br />
so he suggested the quests to get the focus effects (watered down) on the items people worked for</div></div><hr />
