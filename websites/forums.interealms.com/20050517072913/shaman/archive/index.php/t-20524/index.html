My shaman armour just looks like crap now, but it appears to all be there.  On my Troll Beastie, it looks like half his armour is just gone.  I about freaked on the login screen...  It is there, just doesn't show up.  Any way to fix this, it looks like he is a newbie character with lots of armour missing.</div></div><hr />

You have Velious armor turned on with Luclin models??  Go into your eqclient.ini and look for velious graphics (sorry don't remember what the lines are and at work so can not look) if they are set to true change that to false...</div></div><hr />
