<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dacron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There is a spot that I have found after a suggestion from a Mage friend of mine. Good xp, consistent spawns and fairly safe. It seems to have been made for Melees and Casters alike from levels 25 to 30. Once you reach 30, move on.<br />
<br />
Got to the entrance to Dalnir in WW. There are two rooms of Hulking brutes that can be pulled singly w/ out agroing the others. <br />
<br />
One room has a three spawn, while the other has 2 spawns. It is hardly camped at all and you can clear each room, med and start all over. At level 25 and 26 I was clearing approx 2.5 bubs of blue xp.<br />
<br />
Check out the map on EQ atlas and have fun.</div></div><hr />
