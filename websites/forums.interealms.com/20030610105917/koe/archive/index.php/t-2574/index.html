<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We did it again friends! A mere week after asking, all of my communities (and even the two guilds I host) more than came through and have given us another 6 months of uninterrupted service! :) <br />
<br />
*cheers*<br />
<br />
So, no need to send in any more money for now.. save it for the next donation drive. I wouldn't want to sit on extra money for 6 more months.. would be too tempting ;)<br />
<br />
So, thank you ALL again for keeping this amazing place alive. I'll be adding all of our current donors to our Donor page. It's not much, but it's the least I could do!<br />
<br />
This time, I had a lot more donors! I was surprised as I thought participation would drop off some.. but noooo, it went up :)<br />
<br />
Again, we had a VERY generous max of a 500 dollar donation, and all the way on the other end, down to $2.50. You know what though.. they all meant the same to me. They all meant that you want to keep this place going and I'm bursting at the seams with pride!<br />
<br />
Thank you all very much, from the bottom of my heart.<br />
<br />
