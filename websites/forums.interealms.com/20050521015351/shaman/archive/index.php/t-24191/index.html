<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>selligonir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello Everyone!<br />
How do you get a 68+ mission in draniks?  I had thought that you needed to have a 67 or under character get these missions to even get one that has Place Holders.  But it appears that there are 67 and under missions and 68+ missions.  How do you get the 68+ missions.  Is it as simple as having a 68+ get the mission?  Can someone coach me on this please?  <br />
Many thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>selligonir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thank you for your reply.  Maybe they are just bugged on my server because up to a couple days ago when a 68 plus got the instanced there were no place holders.  But I will check it out tonight!<br />
Many thanks!<br />

The Level variations have the placeholders in different places. And sometimes Different names. <br />
<br />
Good luck<br />

<br />
Thanks a ton.  Do you happen to know the name of the different place holders in higher level instanceds?  For example do the two place holders in Murkgliders still have two place holders?  etc.  any help you could give would be greatly appreciated!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The name of the place holders stay the same. (Tattered Wing Bat and Hideous Rat in Murk's Hive) The actual named are different however.<br />
<br />
In the level 68+ dungeon the two place holders will be very close to each other. One in the pool room and the other at the end of the south hall from the pool room.</div></div><hr />
