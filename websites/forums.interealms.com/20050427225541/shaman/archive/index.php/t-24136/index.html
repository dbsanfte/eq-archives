<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sudancia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">No doubt about it, it was a pickel.  Malo took in the first few seconds of the named, but slow was a new issue.  Chanters said over and over that they tashed him and it landed.  I being the highest lvl shaman attempted 9 slows, all to which failed to stick, how this is possible I dont know.   There are a few boards that say, if your a 55 shaman  as long as a chanter tashes andyou use a malo line your slow will stick easy.   Nope, not that simple.  I am not calling those boards liars, but I think they were..........LUCKY.   I followed the advice on someone who said that if you want it to stick easyier you need to get in melee range of the mob, and I did.  I didnt work like I planned out.   I was also my groups healer.  The mob tended to do something like a chain stun/DD AEO cast.  The AEO isnt that large but dang if your caught in it, it will cost you to cast and or get away.   My slow was resisted 9 times and the rest of my mana was to keep me alive or those in my group.  I was able to canni but to little or not success.<br />
<br />
After the fight, chanters said Tash stuck,  I know my Malo stuck, and a 66 ir 67 BST claimed that his slow stuck.  No one could confirm that by his OOC but that what he said.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>garborg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Took the 65 shaman 55 seconds to get him slowed though.<br />
<br />
With mobs of this caliber of resists I will have Malo, Malosinia, Tugur's, Malicious Decay, and Cloud of Grummus. I will land Malo, try sinia, land decay, try sinia, then alternate between sinia and Grummus. When the reists are that high I dont even try Tugur's until sinia is in. The magicians on the raid should not be doing anything else either untill your's or their sinia lands and is called.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Never had a problem slowing him.  Malos, then turgurs.  Usually first time, maybe one resist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've been able to slow him several times without too much trouble.  Sometimes a resist or two.  I just wait for the call on Tash, land Malos, and start chain casting Turgurs.  I'm sure at least once or twice I landed it without any other debuffs on, since I wasn't waiting for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sudancia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What level were you when these stuck without question guys?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rascalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This fight requires you to stay out of the dragons AE.  Just have a shaman chain malos and you chain slow.  I am not sure why this works I thought I read somewhere that the dragon dispells himself with one of the AE's.  To keep it on him just have one shaman chaining malos, this has always worked for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gooshemz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've fought this turkey more times than I like to remember.  Even with Malos and tash he can be very hard to slow.  When my shaman was 63 I've casted slow the entire fight and never slowed him.  There is no guarantee he will be slowed before a tank or two drops.  We sometimes killed him via the dps route before he was ever slowed, but if you don't have very high dps and he resists slow he can wipe you easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Landed Malos on him, chanter landed tash, and Turgurs was good to go, first try. Never got a &quot;wore off&quot; message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Doesn't the dragon rule apply to this guy and you have to belly slow him?  (you'll get the resisted message if you're not in melee range).<br />
<br />
I could've sworn this was the case, and it would account for the drastically different impressions of the ease of slowing him...  But I never could keep straight in my mind which critters required this and which didn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Doesn't the dragon rule apply to this guy and you have to belly slow him? (you'll get the resisted message if you're not in melee range).<br />
<br />
I think it may be... I never had any issues slowing him from levels 57-61ish (last time i fought him), but I always stood under his belly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I can confirm that you do NOT have to belly cast on Xanamech. I've slowed him multiple times from range, and only been resisted once. I'd suggest that level is probably the key to the resist rate. Get some levels and you'll hit him more consistantly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>dams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">what is your charisma?<br />
<br />
/snicker</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Slowed him from range before at level 59 no problem, had one shaman on malos, one on sinia and the rest of us chained, got slow to land first try and snuck it in before the 65's in my guild in fact. Might have been lucky but I do know he doesn't need to be belly slowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I've stuck slow on him plenty, always standing either next to the MA or directly across the mob on the other side from the MA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">well, it really just sounds to me like you've just had a severe run of bad luck...I've killed Xanamech 3 times, each time slow has landed within three casts of turgur's, and I tend to slow early on in the fight, ~97%, obviously almost immediately after malos lands....<br />
<br />
but it really just comes down to luck, I've had average green mobs resist my slow several consecutive times on numerous occasions...and high level names resist nil....Xana isn't really any more resistant than any other small raid mobs I've seen...</div></div><hr />
