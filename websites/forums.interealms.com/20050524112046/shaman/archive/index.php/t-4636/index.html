<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Patch message from test included:<br />
<br />
<br />
DoT Stacking: Many player-cast Damage over Time spells now allow multiple versions of themselves to land on a single NPC. This only works for spells that are already on a creature, and does not allow for inferior spells to stack along with superior spells. (Example: Two Necromancers can both land Boil Blood on the same target. However, Heat Blood, being an inferior, will still not stack.) Please note, there is at least one bug preventing some spells from stacking that we've already fixed and will be shipped fixed next test patch. <br />
<br />
<br />
So does this mean that we can no longer stack our DoT lines?  Will be a shame if we cant, althought tbh I havent done that for quite a while.  I used to quite a lot as a lower level, I would stack 2 poison dots rather than a poision and disease as the mobs where dieing too quick for the disease to get full effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Im looking forward to stacking 20 Epic dots on one mob :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">But, will our Epic Stack over Splurt?  Currently the two do not stack and Splur does more than our Epic, so is it a 'higher level' spell or not?<br />
<br />
I kinda winced at the removal of lower line dot stacking, but I don't do it anymore either.   Just epic and Nife really on normal solo fights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I am pretty sure that Splurt and Epic stack now Fenira.  At least I was reasonably sure they do.  Do Heat Blood and Boil Blood stack now when cast by the same person?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Heat Blood and Boil Blood have never stacked. Therefore it's understandable (but not perhaps desirable) that they don't stack under the new scheme.<br />
<br />
Shaman DoTs (eg EBolt and Venom of Snake) have always stacked - so it seems a reasonable guess that they will continute to stack under the new scheme.<br />
<br />
However we'll only find out for sure when someone from test posts here to tell us! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">OK, the real question is, can we stack the same DOT cast by the same person?<br />
<br />
I was under the impression that they were adding support for the same DOT cast by different people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rikkardo Montalban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">&lt;twitch-twitch&gt; I dont think they'll allow same-dot-same-person type stacking.  Screw a guild-raid, I'll sit my butt and solo some real stuff if that happens.  Yeah, 20 epic dots chaincasting...<br />
<br />
But on the other hand, it would make it kinda worthwhile to get my epic now, seeing as it was pointless to have it when you had 3 other featherstickers with ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Delirios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Curse of Spirit has stacked with Splurt for very very long time. Cant even remember if I had my epic when I saw that fixed in patch message months (if not a year) ago.<br />
 Dont worry about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">And Verant said from the start, DoT stacking only affects DoTs cast by different PCs.<br />
<br />
Think of it like this:<br />
<br />
When you cast a DoT, the mob gets an effect called &quot;Envenomed Bolt&quot; or whatever. Any subsequent &quot;Envenomed Bolt&quot; will overwrite the one currently on the mob.<br />
<br />
In the new scheme, when I cast a DoT the mob gets an effect called &quot;Evenomed Bolt - Grippa&quot;. If I cast another DoT, it has the same name, so overwrites the original. But &quot;Evenomed Bolt - Twoflower&quot; is a different spell (for these purposes) and thus can be on the mob at the same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If they allowed DoT stacking of the same spell from the same person it would be insane.  If they bugger up the implementation and allow this for the first day or two I am taking some time off work to get some aa points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>sharden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Can you imagine the personal hatred the mob will develop of you if they allowed a single shaman to stack 5 EB's?  ::shudder::   <br />
     I managed to stack Bane, Pox, and EB on a Diablo last night in VT by delaying a sufficient time to sit down and mem the new one, cast it, wait a few sec, sit down mem next one, etc....  I was only the shaman that got malo in not the slowing one,  however I still got on rampage after the 3rd DOT.    <br />
     Heh I wonder if a necro has managed to pull mobs off VT capable guilds with 50+ members beating on it......(curious if their DOT's generate the same agro level as ours on these mobs, you wouldn't think just the DD component addition would tip the balance that much)      I was suprised to get all 3 in before agro (careful delay timing helps).  Regardless, its pretty scary being the shaman having the slow cast in and then trying one of our DOT's.........</div></div><hr />
