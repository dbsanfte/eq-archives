<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>senkai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi, I was hoping someone could help me to answer this question.<br />
I was wondering if gear with a &quot;Recommened level of...&quot; tag can be equipped on a level 1 character? If not, then what level must a character be to equip items with a &quot;Recommended level of 51? or 53? And Just for further clarification, this is not gear that has a &quot;Required level of...&quot; tag, it is just &quot;Recommended level of...&quot; Can I equip, for example, a &quot;Metal Linked Crown,&quot; or a &quot;Large Smoothmetal Torque,&quot; and what about the &quot;Earing of the Solstice&quot; on a level 1, 2, etc. character? Thanks in advance for your help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There are both recommended and required level tags placed on items.  If a particular item has a recommended level of say 51 and a player lower than 51 equips it the stats that are in red are what the character will get.  Once the person becomes the high enough to use it 'properly', they will get the full strength of that item.<br />
<br />
If there is a required tag on it.. no one below that level can equip the item.<br />
<br />
*edit*  The earring of the solstice has a recommended level of 51.. the easiest way to see if your character can use an item is to have someone link it to you in game.  If you see red stats, those are what you'll be getting when it is equipped.<br />
<br />
I do not know if the flowing thought on the earring will be affected though =/</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have Leaf Scale Gloves and a Metal Linked Crown on a level 22 shaman,  been using them since level 7.   Both are recommended level 50.<br />
<br />
They are useable but you can get much better stats for the same money due to the penalty for not being the recommended level.  Check my magelo to see the penalized values at level 22.  They will be much worse on a level 1.</div></div><hr />
