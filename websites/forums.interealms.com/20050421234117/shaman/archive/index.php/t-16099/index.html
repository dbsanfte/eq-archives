<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Lag is a bit irksome in the outdoor kunark zones to get there (OT book to FM), but the entrance mobs in Nurga are now blue to a 51.  Popped in there with an alt and got 1% exp for the one kill my little druid managed before she got chased out (alla's still has 12% exp modifier listed for this zone, not sure if that was changed in the revamp or not).<br />
<br />
Track down a map of named spawns and you can help out your pocketbook while you're here.  The max number of people I've ever seen in this zone is three...  Coin drops fairly well, probably 5p or so on a good drop.<br />
<br />
Don't forget to strangle a couple of goblin whipcrackers on your way in for some free pup weapons.<br />
<br />
Oh, and you'll also be building up chardok faction in case you ever want the ring or cords.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just as you go up the waterfall in nurga is a pool with 2 goblins in it, and 2 tunnels leading off of the pool. In the pool a named mob spawns, stabber remmy. Remmy has dropped a shoulder item that was an upgrade to my 61 necro, and also a pair of gloves that I sold for 3kpp on torv. i recommend just camping that pool, if things get hairy its a quick run to the zone, remmy spawns alot, and if ya should die its a quick and painless corpse run. Get in to deep at your level and you'll find yourself in trouble. Once the pool spawn is broke theres a single mob up the path to the right, and a wanderer comes to the pools edge on the left. <br />
<br />
Further in to the left is some casters, they can be nasty so might wanna have resist gear on as long as it doesn't strip down your hp's to much. Good idea to have resists buffed, and also might want some cures memmed also. Make sure ya have root and gate memmed, ya can bind right at the entrance then run back to kill again if ya get raped by a bad pull. Mobs don't hit as hard as pop mobs, can't remember how hard they hit for. Be careful on initial spawn break, ya can try to pull one of the pool mobs to the top of the waterfall with slow then root it there and gate to get the other mob back to its spawn, then run back and summon puppy and waste the first mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sandadarz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So are you saying I should hunt in the Nurga zone? Whats that?</div></div><hr />

Mines of Nurga is a dungeon that you get to from Frontier Mountains. Try to check this topic about soloing there:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">HA! Gukak, I just posted the same site link (ezboard one) on another Nurga thread link on these boards ... that is a very nice, well done, informative post at that link.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">An older place at 51 (much slower too, unfortunately) is the Seafury Cyclops out in Ocean of Tears.  Very nice and quiet place, with just a few people that come in to camp the jboots an island over from you.  Very calm and serene, and you can just relax on the beach with relatively little danger.</div></div><hr />
