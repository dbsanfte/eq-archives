<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Jesus, is everyone like this and im just now seeing it?  Did i used to be like this and now only realize it cause im gaining some what of a life?  The server goes down and these people turn on blizzard like they are the worst comapny ever. I dont get it. There is such little to deal with in the way of problems save 1 day that i just cant comprehend why they post like that there.<br />
<br />
Its making me sad cause to me WoW is all new and so much fun and i had hoped to be a productive part of the forum and learn much in the way of gameplay from there, but i find myself  unable to deal with the threshhold for pain that i must endure when i read these whining spoiled lil shizits posts there. I mean seriously, save the first day i think WoW runs as good as EQ ever did and they had years to perfect their product after the first day of launch.<br />
<br />
<br />
Or maybe its just a sign of the times and the gaming community isnt to blame. If it is thats even sadder that we live in such a instant gradification world that is so intolerante and lacks complete understanding of issues in a technical world as far as server stress and network bandwidth or how about giving enough time for someone to polish their product.<br />
<br />
Just glad its not like that here. Atleast there is still a safe haven in this forum where people dont whine like childeren that dropped their suckers everytime a server goes down or a issue needs to be delt with.<br />
<br />
Whew. Just needed to vent that i guess. Cheers to the mature adults that have obtained the wisdom and understanding to deal with issues in the real world.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">While I disagree with their way of bringing issues up there are issues that Blizzard simply has refused to answer. For instance DAILY server shutdowns at certain hours. Those hours badly hurt australians who made a petition which after 600 or so replies was locked down. Not 2 hours ago many many servers were down and people had been posting for over 2 hours before that saying how it was unplayable on most servers. Blizzard locks threads and moves on. Don't get me wrong i don't like whiners but a &quot;Yeah guys we know we are on it give us an hour or so&quot; would be great at times like these. Whining does have its place when the person who is whining is right. And it adds insult to injury when there are a few valid (rare heh) and active posts and they are dying for a blue reply and somebody from blizzard simply answers another post which was a joke with a &quot;heh&quot; and moves on skipping the threads that really needed the reply.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Litgruv - avoid the boards.<br />
<br />
A lot of issues: lag, idiots, etc., will disappear when the free period does. Not all grant you, but some.<br />
<br />
Of course I wonder who buys a MMORPG and only plays one month, but hey, once there's a monthly fee, we can only hope that some of the 1d10ts leave.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">blizard forums are also populated by younger more ... socially inexperienced players, so i expect to see trash talk.<br />
<br />
most of the people playing WoW have never played MMO's they are not used to SOE patch days where the server goes down 7-10 times randomly befor they make a patch to fix the last 3 patches.<br />
<br />
so far, in all seriousness, this game is too fun for me to get mad at blizzard.<br />
they have made me a loyal fan for life, as long as they do whats right and fix the problems as they get the chance. besides we are all adults here, lets not turn this small forum into the preschool blizzard has over there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
What do you mean used?  :D<br />
<br />
The WOW Euro boards are dead, and the US ones are full of idiots. I think Faern is tight and it will die down a bit once people have to start paying a monthly fee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>drib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There is zero information on those boards other than the official Blizzard announcements.  Don't bother with the WoW boards for class information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sebanis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Wow, it's funny you bring this up. This is EXACTLY the thing that kind of put me off from the game during beta, was the sheer amount of idiocy running both in game and on the boards  :)  I was really hoping it would decrease after it went pay to play. Since I live in Asia the game isn't slated for release here yet and with the localization issues, I'm not even sure I want to play it if I -have- to stay on an Asian server  :p u know how that goes.<br />
<br />
Great game, crappy community (generally speaking) but I think as the game ages things will get better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The official board is filled with whiners that seek attention and fanboys that seek to flame anyone who questions Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Sadly the amount of usefull information on that board has declined more and more with since the start of the closed beta.<br />
<br />
The only reason to visit those boards is to look for UI mod info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Oh I hear ya.  The server went down for maintenance for 5 minutes, yes just 5 minutes!  And there was already another thread started about how our server should split and all the Australians are to blame.<br />
<br />
 It was annoying to have the server down the entire 2nd day but now its fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In my experience blizzard only locks threads that have personal attacks or are straight out flames. I admire this. In the EQ forums if you did this you got answered and it fuels that kind of behavior.<br />
<br />
If you make a intelligent, thought out and more to the point, calm and cival post, it will never get locked. But thats mu experience. I dunno, it just seems like i learned my lessons here. The squeakiest wheel doesnt always get the grease.<br />

I know, im hooked on cosmos now. I tried the gypsy mod too, but cosmos is the all on 1 solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">There are a lot of bnet kiddie l337 d3wds on the boards and in the game, but that is to be expected.  Its the intolerable server stability that sends them into conniptions.  I for one agree with their ranting for the most part, not that is does much good.  My server has been down easily a quarter of the time I have been available to play so far.  Rant on you crazy diamonds.  <br />
<br />
WoW's official forums will never be a decent research source.  They consider that kind of thing &quot;spoilers.&quot;  No different from EQ there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">EQ's boards used to be much worse.  Eventually they locked them down and every post was screened before publishing.  WoW's community is no different than any other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">EQ1's boards used to be pretty much the same, they were a sewer of hate and whining. Sony rightfully dumped the EQ1 boards a month or two before PoPower's release.<br />
<br />
Oh I see Krup has written a similar post but I'll post anyway, yeah that's how it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Most the moaners are probably the same ppl that made a noise on SOE's boards when they had a problem, now they stopped playing EQ1 and expect all their problems to just vanish with another game. No matter what you play online their are going to be issues with the servers, EQ1 after the start and again after some the notorius patching was awful yet still we played, SWG in the start was horrible but eventually it stabalised.....WoW will be same as they work out the little bugs you cannot find in a beta test and their will always be some, as its impossible to try every combination of commands and some only come to light after release.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think people will get angry if they can't play because servers have crashed.

<br />
You should be able to use at least parts of both.  Some of the cosmos code isn't setup well to be self-contained, and so it interferes with our other things (mostly the action bar stuff).  I haven't used Cosmos in a while, but I think the gypsy unitbar, buffbar, and general addons should work just fine with Cosmos.<br />

You can make quest text stop fading and just appear. You can have it show how much time bugffs have left. It even has an option to warn you when a buff is about to expire. You can also make your own notes on the map. Not to mention 3 full EXTRA bars. All the spells and abilities you ever wanted :)<br />

Sadly i did that more then once in EQ lol.</div></div><hr />

Yea I use this as well. Cosmos pisses me off for some reason. CTMod is the best UI I found for WoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Elazule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Or maybe its just a sign of the times and the gaming community isnt to blame.

<br />
<br />
I think that this is just a general truth and some perception. The people who are tolerent are not going to scream and make a fuss while those who are the actual minority make the majority of the noise.<br />
<br />
It also seems to be a current tendency at least in america that many people have come to expect more and more for less and less. When a problem occurs or any interruption people expect there to be over compensation for their &quot; inconvenience&quot;. I think this is further substantiated by what i call the mc donalds coffee lawsuit theory. In short for a minor problem people expect to receive more than they are really entitled to. I work for the cable company (yeah i know boo hiss) and i get the same treatment all the time. People want a months credit to their service for an hour of no cable.<br />
<br />
In addition these days of modern society people need something to hate and bitch about. We do not have any major major wars( yeah i know iraq, however it is not a huge menacing enemy that looms over every nation forcing people to band together), we do not have any major famines or shortages on supplies in the countries that can afford this kind of service. So what else do they have to do? Well they can sit and bitch about something that is out of their control and villify the very people/companies that are doing them a service.<br />
<br />
Lastly i think the other human nature of where one bad thing equals 20 good things. No matter how much you do that is great the bad things always stand out far stronger than the good. <br />
<br />
Anyways thats my 2 cents on the whole subject. IIt is a great game, and yes there ar eminor inconveniences, thats when i pick up a book, play another game, go read, make a call ont eh phone, pay my bills, do laundry or whatever. Just because i pay monthly does not mean that nothing will ever go wrong. People seem to think that when u pay money it is a promise of perfection. Life is inconvenient, get over it. Enjoy it whens it good and it all goes right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kykha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">It's true you will see more whiners on those boards then happy people, after all the happy people are playing.<br />
<br />
There's nothing wrong however in posting errors and things that go wrong, posting it 1000 times gets annoying, especially when there are insults towards people with a different opinion.<br />
<br />
The ranting about moderators not answering is not entirely true, when there's a problem they generally respond ONCE on the topic, no need to repeat it just because you didn't do the effort to read the other 99 posts previously posted, which should be sufficient untill they have more news.  <br />
<br />
I prefer these forums to discuss about WoW and even if I probably won't play a shaman as my main I intend to come here.<br />
<br />
If I get to play off course, I'm from Belgium, I need to wait and I'm jealous of you all!  ;) <br />
