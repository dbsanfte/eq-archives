<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>moops</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I think I read somewhere that fungi staff will still snare you while on a horse but does it overwrite the horse icon buff like it does with sow or does it just snare you? If you can just click of fungal regrowth &amp; have horse speed with out recasting ( think horses have a pretty long recast ) this would make a horse pretty nice to have for me. I also like to use the sow regen fungi staff casting trick so is it possible to stack these with a horse like you can with sow? <br />
<br />
thnx <br />

Moops<br />
<br />
ps where the heck do you even buy horses? I assume somewhere in Luclin</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Horses are purchased in the Bazaar zone in Luclin (right off the Nexus.)  There is a stable with vendors that sell the various horse types and colors.  To assure the best prices, make sure your CHA is at least 110 (anything over 110 doesn't affect prices).<br />
<br />
I don't know about the fungi staff snare... that's a great question.  I've got them both, but the first thing I did when I bought my horse was to turn off the horse/elemental models.  You get lots of benefits from this:<br />
<br />
 You keep your sow speed instead of the horse speed (the speed of the cheapest horse is slower than SoW- turning off the model removes the horse speed effect... so you can cast SoW on yourself, click your epic boots, get snared by the fungi staff, etc.)<br />
<br />
 You can duck (to interrupt spells)<br />
<br />
 You don't have the acceleration effect<br />
<br />
 You don't have to see the horse head all the time<br />
<br />
 You also keep the automed feature.  Basically, when you're standing still and not attacking, you're medding (you don't need to sit down... and you can med while casting/JBB'ing/etc..  If you swing a weapon or move, it doesn't count... but if you're standing still, you're medding... this is huge.  One quirk, I've noticed that sometimes the mana bar doesn't update from automed until you do something to trigger it.  For example, I'll stand still for a minute and the mana bar won't move.  I'll refresh my SoW, and my mana will go UP two bubbles (because it's just now refreshing from the past few minutes.) <br />
You probably weren't getting replies before because the board has been bugged- no one could reply to any threads for a few days.  It seems to have been fixed just this morning.<br />
<br />
By the way.... if you have the fungi staff, the epic boots are your best friends.  Click off staff effect, click boots, ready to go...</div></div><hr />
