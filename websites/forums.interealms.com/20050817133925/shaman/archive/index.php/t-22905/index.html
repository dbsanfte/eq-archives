<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gunny</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've thought about making a toon on one of them PvP servers, a Shaman of course, but I want grind out Gundaam some more.  <br />
What are those servers really like?  I imagine it's something like a cross between reruns of Oz and being nestled in the belly of the all-powerful Sarlacc, where you can find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Horomen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ive always wondered too....considered making a toon on PVP servers several times, but I always figured it would be pointless since even the newbies probably have tons of resist gear from their mains or their friends. Perhaps this is a flaw in perception but it would be interesting to hear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">PvP servers have everything non-pvp servers have, and then a little more. The main difference is that constant feeling of insecurity, ranging from holy hell run fer yer life to just a small twinkle of looking over your shoulder. I guess you could say it's similar to what you felt whenever you entered a new zone as a newbie, but stronger. You won't shake your pursuers by zoning here.<br />
<br />
Of course there will be the bad seeds, particularly in the form of low lvl overtwinked gankers who smacktalk, but this is also the beauty of it. Sooner or later you WILL get even with them, something you simply do not have the tools to accomplish in a non-pvp environment.<br />
<br />
Most important of all, go in with an open mindset and remember it is a game. Don't play on a pvp server striving for character progression. Play to progress your own skills at fighting others and enjoying it, even in defeat. Obviously a couple gear upgrades (and clickies!) and more levels will help out, but this should not be the focus of your time.<br />
<br />
As for shaman pvp, stay below lvl52ish.<br />
<br />
If you ask really nicely I'm certain some high levels can jumpstart your careers. There are very few true newcomers to the pvp servers, so you should be able to find someone to help get you started. If I was still playing I'd hook you up for certain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gunny</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, I hear it's best to know people, and not to drop the soap.  I think it would be fun though.  When another player does another player in, can't that player loot the felled player?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>phatteydump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A few couple notes from a troll point of view:<br />
<br />
1) Dont get bothered by the twinks.  The thing about pvp server twinks is they never lvl.  Just keep grinding the exp and eventually you will be 8 lvls higher then them.  At that point, no matter what they have for gear, you are gonna get your sweet revenge.<br />
<br />
2) Like the above poster said, if you dont plan on progressing very fast or at all, i would not suggest getting in range of 65 lvl chars. ~i am guilty of this and i pay for it dearly sometimes~  They will resist every time and you wont, end of story.  But if you do want to progress, ya evetually you will need to lvl, but try to find a guild that is already started in progression so you will have a good gang to back you up when needed.<br />
<br />
3) Dont carry very much coin (at least on VZ/TZ). When you die, all the coin you had is now in the pkers pockets.<br />
<br />
4) Get a close grp of friends and stick by them.  On tz people like to get &quot;hunting parties&quot; together and go kill people soloing or small grps.  But most often if they see 5 or 6 people they will leave the grp alone, or attack and then its all fun because the numbers are even.<br />
<br />
5) Give the trolls hugs from time to time.  We lost our city a while back and we are still not over it, we need the lovin.<br />
<br />
6) Look me up if you need help on quests/gear camps.  I usually solo when i get online unless i get an ldon grp and if im free, im more then happy to help a shaman out.  Even if you are a barbie or a kitty.  Frogs im still getting to like just cause you are a shaman and the spirits would not like me to kill you.<br />
<br />
FYI that is all coming from a TZ point of view.  I dont play the hardcore pvp servers, but i like my home and i would suggest it.  But dont let the (pvp-teams) tag fol you, there are no more teams, at least by guild standards.  Every guild now is xteam, save a few dark only guilds.  Most people will respect you no matter your race, and the ones who dont will let you know very clearly.<br />
<br />
My 2cp...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Asta gave a pretty good image of PVP. It's like EQ with the extra flavor of uncertainity of when you will be ambushed by 3x woodelves hell bent on beating the snot out of you etc.<br />
<br />
Mass-pvp is a great thing, imagine whole guilds having away at eachother all over the zone.<br />
<br />
Regarding loot:<br />
<br />
Vallon Zek and Tallon Zek only allows looting of coins.<br />
<br />
Rallos Zek allows looting of droppable items except for your main and offhand (correct me if im wrong).<br />
<br />
Sullon Zek, im not sure about.<br />
<br />
* * *<br />
<br />
As a shaman, you will be good up to lvl 52 (like Asta said). At lvl 65 you have problems dealing damage due to resists and dots being curable. You might find it easy to stay alive though because you can outrun and outheal many classes.<br />
<br />
At lvl 65 your main PVP strength comes in mass-pvp (from one group encounters and up). Shamans can debuff and heal and be a great support to the more offensive classes.<br />
<br />
Oh, and stay away from bards, they need to eat the Nerf Bat in PVP, badly...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>phatteydump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Oh, and stay away from bards, they need to eat the Nerf Bat in PVP, badly...<br />
  What? being able to cancle out 4 buff slots (making debuffs/dots useless on bards), insane resists from songs, very compareable melee if needed, of course never being able to be caught cause they have selos, regen songs putting most bards standing regen to close to 50/tick, all while running of course, charm, mez, ability to pull a train out of hell and &quot;fading memories&quot; it right when the train gets to you so you die in less then 2 rounds of hits? thats not unfair :P<br />
<br />
/sarcasm off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gunny</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ok, this is some good stuff.  Gives an idea about what it's about.  I have a question though, about the bazaar.  Can you fight the traders?  I think I know the answer.  I guess I'm wondering if there is any &quot;safe&quot; zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There is no pvp in the Bazaar, PoK or PoT. All safe zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">On sullon as a hunter playing for the good team, I devoted at least 3 hours of my day to hunting the low level evils and neuts.  It kept the server clean of bluebies.  Quite frankly, if you're going to play on sullon or rallos, you better have thick skin.  If you're hoping to reach level 10 on your one night off, you better expect to be ganked by 2 level 65 shadowknights looking for some late night fun.  Your nights will be ruined regularly, your server will be full of drama, you'll constantly be looking over your shoulder for 60 levels, and life in EQ as you knew it before will never be the same.<br />
<br />
And I say this in the nicest way possible because it was the most rewarding 2 years of my EQ life.  If you thought killing a PoP god for the first time was an accomplishment on Bluebie Ro, try doing it when you have 66% of the server trying to train you.  They don't want you in their backyard and if you think you're going to just walk in, you've got another thing coming.<br />
<br />
It's kill or be killed because I just kicked you in the face and took your epic mob, you know, the one you've been camping all night.  You have two options, grab your corpse and get out of my zone or bring a possy.  You just better hope yours is bigger than mine.<br />
<br />
That's pvp and it's the greatest thing EQ ever had to offer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Rallos loot rules include one piece of droppable gear (not main hand/offhand/range/ammo iirc) and cash, its also ffa pvp withing 5 lvls.<br />
Sullon is ffa pvp for ALL lvls after you ding lvl 6. yes a lvl 65 can gank you at lvl 6. there are 3 HARD coded teams, you cant heal or help the other teams in pvp so no worries about some evil killing your good while his goodie cleric heals him and you cant do anything about it. Sullon loot is cash + you get an insignia thats virtually garbage because sony was on crack when they implimented the system. the advice for shaman is valid, stay low 50's or be prepared to lose every time you fight. its possible to malos and then dump your entire mana bar on someone and end up with them at 100% life thanks to gimped spells and messed up resists.<br />
<br />
I havent ever played blue so I really cant compare the 2.<br />
<br />
look me up on Sullon if you roll up a good or a n00t,(I can give you some minor twink stuff easy enough) if you plan on rolling evil you might as well stay on your blue server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>CasmussSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yeah, I wouldn't reccommend starting a shaman on sullon. There isn't much low level pvp to be had. It is a gankfest, and shaman aren't exactly the best gankers. If you plan on making it to higher levels, it can be done without too much trouble due to the server xp bonus and the very low population. If you scout around a bit, you'll find you can have many zones to yourself. The downside is that at higher levels, you can't land a spell as a shaman on anyone with decent gear, so solo pvp is pretty much out. PvP in groups can be pretty cool, but lamers usually turn it into a trainfest. At least they made a rule against same team training now - that was a nightmare that you won't have to deal with if you come to Sullon. Hopefully the promised pvp changes will address make shaman more viable in high end pvp, but I'm not holding my breath. Good luck on whatever server you choose!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Another thought that just came to me.  I've said this a number of times and been scoffed at, especially by people in guilds at the higher end.  You'll never play the game at a higher skill level than when you do on a no rules server.  If you start from the bottom on a zek and work your way up to the top without help, especially on sullon where anybody and everybody can and will try to kill you, you deserve to be there.  <br />
<br />
I won't lie to you though, most of the pvp you see there won't be pvp.  Bards will be training you like it's their job.  Wizards and Shadowknights are phenomenal gankers.  Pvp is about killing, it's not about honor or what is right.  There is no morality to it.  It's about the adrenaline rush you get from knowing that you just caused a person hundreds of miles away a night of endless agony.  It's about sneaking up on that wizard who just manaburned you when he is in the middle of a kite, and dispelling his mobs so that he eats an experience death.  You may not think you will enjoy those sorts of things, but very few things on blue servers will match the real threat of player vs. player combat and the addiction of that adrenaline rush.  <br />
<br />
But back in the day, to get to that point meant you had to deal with me for the first 55 levels and I ensured that your night, everynight, was hell.  If I didn't kill you, I'd follow you around and make sure you had ensnare on you, everywhere you went.  The people on zeks are real bastards.<br />
<br />
My best experience in EQ was the first time I got revenge against another player.  Was playing on Rallos with my lvl 15 shaman, soloing down in Kurns tower.  Here's me, my first red character, quietly leveling away.  Had earned myself a couple pieces of leather armor, and wracked up a couple plat after 4 hours.  It was going to buy my new spells and I was about to ding.  I wasn't really paying attention, I didn't know any better.  I didn't check to see who else was in the zone, why would I have.  Within moments, an ugly twinked out sk ran down and ganked my few plat.  Didn't get my level, couldn't buy my spells, lost my corpse.  Found him the next day, fighting a badger, deep under kurns.  He was at 10 life when he killed the badger and bent down to loot it, still unaware I was watching him.  One nuke and he was dead.  Walked over and intended to get my leather bp back he stole from me the day before.  He was wearing a cloth bp but I took it anyways, just to spite him.  It wasn't until he sent me hate messages that I realized I looted his fungi.<br />
<br />
That's why you'll love pvp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>tonce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I actually play a ranger on sullon zek and I love it.  The fact that you can just walk up to somone kill them and keep killing them or train them or corpse camp them is great.  I think everyone should have a toon on pvp at some point in their EQ career.  It really has made me feel better about not quiting this game 2 years ago, cause I can just log on sz and let some aggresion out by killing newbies or just plan being a bastard to someone.</div></div><hr />

I guess it takes all kinds but this is exactly why I think PvP are over run with little kids (only speaking from a few weeks experience on VZ).  It's the mentality of I'd rather spend my time slowing you down than being &quot;productive&quot;.  Dont get me wrong... I see the attraction of sneaking around someone fighting a mob waiting till he's beat up and cant defend himself before attacking...er...well... okay I dont.  But still if it's your thing then I guess that's cool.<br />
<br />
I do find it funny how folks on Red servers feel the need to hold their status as a Red player over the Blubies.  Me, I like hanging out with friends going and wailing on mobs and progressing.... maybe if I had a lot more time I'd play on a Red server because you can progress slower.  But considering I work from 6 to 8 most days when I do get to play I dont want my whole night ruined by a some random guy running past looking for kicks.  <br />
<br />
Like I said it takes all kinds and I gave it a shot but it wasnt for me.  I think everyone should try it for a bit and if you enjoy it stick with it because it's 100% different than the EQ on Blubie servers.  OH and if folks do give the neg rep bumps &quot;Shut up blubie!&quot; at least post your name :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
PVP Everquest = [Everything that is frustrating about regular Everquest]^3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gunny</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">This is all a good read.  Makes me want to start up a toon right away.  Not sure which server though, probably one of the more &quot;hardcore&quot; ones.  I can see that sullon probably wont have much low level PVP, but it might be fun just trying to level, and being a target for anyone and everyone.  I was thinking shaman, cause I was thinking defense, and it's the class I know.  I'm sure it'll be tough in the end game, but end game isn't my plan.<br />
<br />
Do you guys that play on these PVP servers have like, arch-rivals?  Certain PCs that go out their way to mess with your game specificly, and vise versa?  And can rangers track PCs on these servers?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Definitely, different mentalites. Personally, it would make me much happier to see someone in a tough fight and heal them and give someone a happy night.<br />
<br />
Just two nights ago, I was hanging out in POE zone in, waiting for a group to get started. A paladin came running up to zone with a gator on her and started to take it down. The paladin was getting her ass kicked, so I slowed the mob, healed the paladin and threw a Q on her. She won and thanked me. I didn't get any exp, but it felt nice to be helpful.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't enjoy a PVP server, at all!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">People seem to think that just because we fight eachother, we have no friends on our server.<br />
<br />
Let me put it like this:<br />
<br />
We have to depend and cherish out friends even more, because without them, life on the Zeks would be truly hard and meaningless.<br />
<br />
The focus is on &quot;we against them&quot;, where &quot;we&quot; is more important than them. We have many enemies, who we fight at different times, but we have only a few friends, who we stick together with always.<br />
<br />
We fight hard but we stick together harder. :)<br />
<br />
Besides, the servers have different categories of mentality. I like to think of Sullon like a gang-war and Vallon/Tallon like a fist-boxing fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>PanzerCat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I played a PVP for six months and it was about worthless.  Most of the time you actually do have retarded 12 year olds running amok killing all the lowbies.  And yes, its common practice to have some complete wanker train you while camping an epic mob.  For those who enjoy ruining others days, you need help, if it takes a pc game to give you an adreniline rush you need to power down and get out more often.</div></div><hr />

My feelings exactly.  I have been too busy with work lately, but when I had time I would just pick a newbie and say &quot;congratulations&quot; hand them 50-100pp and buff to high hell.  9 Times out of 10 I'd follow the little turds around slowing mobs, keeping them hasted and healed and what not... even yelling at them to &quot;KILL FASTER! I wont let you die!&quot; :)<br />
<br />
I'm so much more into helping folks have a good time than getting my kicks knowing they are having a bad time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">&quot;Red&quot; servers were one of Verant's best ideas back in the day. A PvP outlet for PvP-minded individuals made it significantly easier for the rest of us to pursue PvE activities in relative peace and quiet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Truthfully, while slaughtering the lower levels did let out a lot of anger (and you'll be frustrated a bit if you play long enough), it's true intent was to bring out the higher levels.  Once you start griefing a zone like the Overthere or the Field of bone (FoB was my favorite), those low levels instantly call in their friends.  You call in your friends, and bam, before you know it, you have a brawl.  You know there's a good time going on when you're running through PoK and 20 people are sitting at the FoB or OT portals, licking their wounds.<br />
<br />
Though I don't harbor the whole blue bashing sentiments, you'll find that that mentality really doesn't exist in most people on zek servers.  Like with most things, there are a vocal minority who might say things like this on forums.  Though I think it's mostly to get a rise out of people.  Though you might tend to be a &quot;bit&quot; more aggressive when you play on a zek, I think the current zek players on this forum have shown repeatedly their good character.<br />
<br />
And though it is extremely frustrating, like somebody mentioned, it can also be the most rewarding.  The servers are a bit different, like vigdis mentioned.  Hard coded teams on Sullon meant that there were definite sides.  I've read lately that many people's idea of a fun mmorpg has faction as a major part of it.  On SZ, If you see a troll or an ogre, you either run or you get your buddies together and teach him to stay out of gfay.  There is no question what his intent is, he's there to kill you.  That's faction in its truest form.  So while I might have spent 2 or 3 hours everday griefing FoB and the OT, I also spent a lot of time in Gfay, MM, and PoI protecting our sides' lower levels.  Like I said, most griefing is done to bring out the higher levels on each side.  Protecting your team's arse, and doing it well is extremely rewarding.  <br />
<br />
If you're a good and you're running through Gfay with your guild tag up, everybody in the zone knows that you represent the best of what the good team has to offer.  An evil's in the zone, expect a flood of tells with information on that creep.  You're a hero and if that's not addicting, I don't know what is.  On a zek, you can be Mr. Nasty or you can be that person that's always there to protect the backs of everybody around you.  Yeah, EQ is a roleplaying game, but on a zek, how you play and what type of character you create is much more pronounced in my mind.  Controlling the lives and deaths of so many people really brings out what your character is about.<br />
<br />
If you just want to check out what pvp is like, I strongly suggest you join Rallos.  You'll get a better feel for what a more balanced version of player combat is like.  Just don't lose your gear, remember to bag it all before you're ganked.  Get a group of your friends together and make a band of gnome magicians.  Once you hit level 8, go to gfay and run amuck.  Just because it's not lvl 65 pvp, it's still a riot.  If you've never experienced the end game and want to, don't join Sullon.  And don't join Sullon if you're not willing to put in your time for the first 50 levels.  In fact, I wouldn't recommend sullon until you know for sure that you love pvp.  Because while you may love it, you're about to hate it with just as much intensity.</div></div><hr />

Was camping stormfeather for the haste mask.  Had been at it for over a week now, and was at the end of a 19 hour stretch that night.  If you know much about the quest, you know that this part of it is probably the most frustrating of all.  Well he was going to spawn any minute and I was ready for him.  <br />
<br />
There was this level 30ish gnome magician who had been pestering me now for the past 5 hours.  Really had to give this kid credit.  I've got well over 100 aa invested in this ranger and at the time, being a hunter was the equivalent of being a monster in the pvp arena, especially against casters.  But he's level 30 something and he knows why I'm there and he wants to hunt cougars.  Well, being a ranger, I'm a nature nut, so I swore to protect all the cougars.  I just couldn't have anybody killing my pals.<br />
<br />
My bird is about to spawn and I could tell this kid was about ready to mount another attack on me.  I had stopped killing him with my stonewood an hour or so back and resorted to just kicking him to death to amuse myself.  This must have been the 9th time he's done this.  Well he sent his pet up after me and drilled me with a nuke.  Nothing big, just annoying.  But he ran away this time, came back a minute later and did it again, and then again a minute after that.  Now I don't mind you sacrificing yourself on my sword, but you don't taunt me like that.  <br />
<br />
I chased his gnome arse down half way across the zone the next time he did it, and I killed him.  But before I wallopped him, he says to me, &quot;my friend tells me that stormfeather just popped, thanks for the 'second part of an Iceclad map' jackass.&quot;  I still remember that.<br />
<br />
For the next half hour, I kept that kid ensnared and unconscious.  Not dead, no, he had already shown me death didn't mean too much too him.  After that he was on my friends list, and everytime I saw him up, I had my friends in his guild tell me where he was so I could repeat the process.  He quit the character after two weeks of daily torture.<br />
<br />
Never get between a vengeful ranger and his quarry.  You may get your level 30 buddy his quest piece, but you'll pay a price.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, it is true that there are some on blue servers who enjoy making other people's experience unpleasant by means of training, mob dispelling or whatever else they have at their disposal. However, it's been a long time since a malicious player actually caused problems for me or anybody else in my guild, and we are mostly casual, so we are not protected by PoP flags. As a matter of fact, when a previously retired (and deservedly infamous) FD trainer returned to the game in the last year, he soon quit again, in part because he was disgusted with everybody being so nauseatingly nice.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, reading this thread and similar ones that I have seen on various discussion boards over the last 5+ years leaves me with a distinct impression that an excess of niceness is not the biggest problem facing PvP servers :)</div></div><hr />

From their posts the Sullon Zeckers seem to play really player *against* player, which makes sense in the team based system. Lots of us on Rallos pvp people we don't like, usually because they have attacked us, or are in a guild that does so, and play otherwise pve, helping players who haven't tried to kill us. Unfortunately the low level pvp is really skewed towards twinked mellees these days, and the mentality I just described was more natural to eq before instanced zones.<br />

Rather they make the evil team super strong, have GM's playing on evil team and consistantly give more love to evil team.  Whether it be nerfing the one class that was powerful on newt and good (rangers), or overpowering Sk's, Necro's with their abilities.  75% deathtouch, no ill effects.  Or Lifeburn and nearly unresistable lifetaps.  I quit playing 6 months ago and nothing really has changed.  If you want to play a pvp game, play lineage2.  EQ is balanced pvp up until 50.  Post 50 its pretty much not worth it.</div></div><hr />

I kinda get the impression that, &quot;if you can make it on Sullon, you can make it anywhere.&quot;  I mean, I don't intend to stop playing my 53 shaman on Sol Ro, I'd just like to have another server to go to, and one with a different sort of flavor.  I just don't know about being a shaman though.  Like I said before, I guess I would choose a Shaman cause that's what I know, and then there's the defense aspect with gate, sow, and healing.  I bet it'll be a pain in the ass though.  There's a lot of good info in this thread.  I won't be able to play much this weekend, but I'm going to try to try to make a guy on one of these PVP servers this weekend.  Still going to do some research till then on which server to start on, and what kind of a toon to create.<br />

And for the people suggesting I might want to try a different game for PVP.  I guess I appreciate the thought, but my PC is for EQ, porn, checking sports scores, and porn.

tz and vz are pretty much the same softcoded servers with insanely easy exploits to get around true pvp,<br />
Sullon is pvp, if the person doesnt con ally they are there to fight. no teams arent balanced, and as ninth said (at least until recently) its been pretty ****ing obvious that the gms were getting sucked off on a regular basis by the evil team. changes are coming that may or may not fix team balance but they will make some difference.</div></div><hr />

If you have ever complained or thought classes were not balanced on a bvluebie server DONT PVP.<br />
Class balance is even worse in PVP.<br />
<br />
The cross teaming aspect will on occasion ruin your DAY. nothing worse then having a fight where you cannot attack the cleric cause they are the same race you are while they CH the enemy tank beating you like a rag doll.<br />
<br />
Also nothing worse they having some immature moron get his kicks ruining your evening.<br />
<br />
I LOVE PVP but unfortunately the code in this game was bluebie minded with PVP as an after thought so the exploits are plentiful.<br />
<br />
My heart has never beat so hard in bluebie fights like is has for PVP.<br />
Its been years since I stopped playing on Tallon and I still have the screenshots from those memorable kills.<br />
<br />
Not to mention ended up guilded with some of my rivals from tallon on other games like DAOC. The friends we made will last.<br />
<br />
It will be really good times and some really suck ass times. whiners have louder voices. Getting killed by other players by getting trained will no longer be a Dammit man why didnt you yell train its a dammit how will I get my body back without the arse doing it agaion.<br />
<br />
Both types of players will be there the really nice players and the aholes. the difference is the aholes have more ability to harash you directly. and the nicer people have a closer bond due to power in numbers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Valkargen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Sullon is what you make of it.<br />
<br />
Players like virtually any other server and run the full spectrum of personality types, however the ruleset allows players to visibly hamper and harm another player with more options and so the cases of griefing and stupidity that exist on ALL servers is simply more visible.<br />
<br />
I do disagree with Ninth on some of what he said.  The teams are horribly unbalanced, which is one of the reasons I left, however the ranger nerf wasn't prompted by SZ, there are 4 pvp servers, and the changes that went forward were part of the dev team.  Gm's may indeed tip balance in game, and bring outright bias to the teams, but affecting class balance in PvP and game coding isn't in their bag of tricks.<br />
<br />
The same options for philanthropy that Glor listed also still exist on the reds, on SZ a hard coded team server, nothing stops you from protecting and helping gear your newbies...the choice to do so is up to you.<br />
<br />
Gunny the best thing I can suggest is just make a toon and log on.  If you don't like that rule set, then simply create a different character on another red server.  It wont cost you anything and you might get a feel for the server.<br />
<br />
I left SZ due to class imbalances that I encoutered while seeking combat.  I had never used burn in PvP, and refused to do so as I considered it a gimp skill, however the perception of my class and how it changed in PvP with the release of SoL made it more difficult to find good fights, which previously I had no problems finding.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>FreyrSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I play on SZ, on the fairly underpowered good team.  SZ PvP isn't for everyone, you have to be ready to be griefed, trained, ganked, burned, faction burned, and every other possible way of killing you.  In terms of Shaman PvP, we tend to not do very well against people with good resists.  More or less you'd have to pick your fights against crap geared evens, hope spear of torment will gank someone in group pvp, or grief greeny (something everyone does and has had done to them).  <br />
<br />
In terms of rules:<br />
-20% exp bonus on SZ $$<br />
-Debuffs take off an extra 50% vs. saves (minorly helpful)<br />
-You can't be killed under 6 in most newbies zones BUT if you leave the newbie zones and are under 6 you can and will be killed<br />
-PvP deaths to even cons (or green cons) will cost you exp/coin, if you die to an even past level 20 you drop an Insignia (called a coin) of your respective deity<br />
-Falling/Drowning deaths don't take exp<br />
<br />
The server is pretty fun (at least in my opinion), but you have to not get bothered by being repeatedly and irrationally killed, otherwise you won't last a week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Bozer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">People seem to think that just because we fight eachother, we have no friends on our server.<br />
<br />
We have to depend and cherish out friends even more, because without them, life on the Zeks would be truly hard and meaningless.<br />
<br />
We fight hard but we stick together harder. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  Playing on a red server is like playing EQ on the hard difficulty level.  Rallos is tougher than the rest in a sense, because of the item loot.  You never know when your groupmates will get greedy and try taking you out if you appear to have good gear.<br />
<br />
  But, in my own experience, smart players make friends on rallos and stick with them.  I have a few PK partners that have worked with me for 4 years; and tho I never met them in real life, we completely have each others back.  We share all our PvP loots and actually share a good amount of gear and time together.<br />
  <br />
  I cant describe how much fun EQ is when you are outnumbered by enemies and facing certain demise, and your buddy shows up in the nick of time and turns the tide of the battle.<br />
<br />
  My advice:  If starting on the Zeks, make friends and dont screw them.  If someone screws you, remember their name and pay them back with interest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>keinalta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Since the thread asked about PvP thought i would throw in my 2 cents.<br />
<br />
 I beta tested Shadowbane (lemme tell you, if you think EQ is buggy lol) for three months then played a bit on release till things got borring.  But man pvp can be fun. ( I warn you the game is crap however DONT PLAY lol)<br />
<br />
  Shadowbane is a pure PvP game, you can attack anyone any lvl. You cant loot gear but you can loot gold and xp is lost by PvP (pluss you lose gold cause you items all decay).  The PvP is guild based, because it takes a guild to build a city to spawn in and generate gear and allow you to train spells.  Cities can burnt to the ground by another guild and it takes weeks to build and tons of grinding to finance a city.<br />
<br />
  That was the beauty of the game acountability.  You attack me, i will have my revenge, hell ill burn your city to the ground and burn down every city you build =).  <br />
<br />
  As you have ALOT to lose you are very carefull who you make mad, so random ganking by guilded players was pretty rare.  The political aspect of the game was wonderfull, huge wars and alliances arose.  Pure ganking guilds had to earn the right to gank anyone they wanted.<br />
<br />
  When the servers went live our guild was about 150 strong and played in beta.  We decimated every city that was built on our server and maintained the lowest population of all the servers for about a month or so.<br />
<br />
  The guild leader got greedy and started taxing all items in the city 500% and started Ebaying the gold farmed by the guild.  Anyone who spoke out against it was disbanded from the guild.<br />
<br />
  Once we saw this happening we decided to stage a cu *spelling* and ralied the entire rest of the server and over about a month ganked the guild over and over till the player base droped enough for the last blow to be dealt and we freed the server from the guilds tyrany.<br />
<br />
  2 friends of mine and I started our own guild of 50 or so, and played for a while, lots of good fights and memories but eventually the shear crappiness of the code burnt us out.<br />
<br />
   Some times you died till all your gear poofed, and sometimes you camped a cities ToL (where people zoned into game and respawned at death) for 8 hours straight.  There were no zones in the game, and fights were pretty quick.  Timing and position was everything, plus the game was designed around pvp so the classes were fairly balanced.<br />
<br />
<br />
  I will never forget my time played in Shadowbane, the concept was pure gold, unfortunately the game played like some 13 year old whiped it up in his basement one weekend.<br />
<br />
 I wont play PvP in EQ but im waiting for some more pvp goodness.<br />
<br />
  Just thought i would add some PvP expiriences from outside EQ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Actually something needs to be said about playing on sullon zek on the evil team or Team EZ vs playing on newt and good.  Playing on evil is like playing on a bluebie server yet getting 20% extra exp and low population.  Playing on newt/good is actually probably the hardest challenge you can have on EQ with good being extra hard because there are no top level good clans that aren't allied/lead by team ez/evil.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>CasmussSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">That's not really how it is Ninth. If you're in Hate, maybe it is. If you're not, you have to deal with team warphax and team bardtrain on a regular basis with no assistance from anyone. Also I can barely put a group together these days, as Hate doesn't xp where I do and many players in the smaller guilds are terribly unskilled. I played on team good for awhile and actually found it easier to level as a good team solo class than I did on team evil. Evils may pass through and gank you, but they generally leave pretty quickly afterwards. All of the evil greifers have pretty much left the server Goods/newts will camp your corpse till you log. Non-Hate evil is just as difficult as being a good/newt is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I can give you two examples on the negative sides and the positve sides of pvp, wich i both experienced today on my warrior.<br />
<br />
First we were going to get my warrior tipt flagged, but we ran into some enemy guild members at the Barindu Quinimi zone line. Most up us were human team (PVP teams) and most of them were human too. We were numerically superior but had few non humans to attack the humans so it took very long. There were quite a heavy zone dancing and we were facing one of the better paladins on the server (he posts on these boards under an alt).<br />
<br />
So all in all it took some time before we controled the zone (not sure if they left or if we killed them). Due to resists and bad variety of team and class we ended up with a stale PVP that lasted far too long. :(<br />
<br />
Afterwards i got Tipt :D<br />
<br />
Then when we were done i was going to a LDON camp and buy some purified crystals to my arrow summoning. I run into a shaman who i have known some time. We PVPed, and he won ( i could probablyhave lived by zoning or gating via magus but i was tired :p ). We talked in tells during my corpserun and he sowed me when i had looted. Thats one of the more acceptabel PVP deaths to have :)<br />
<br />
Oh and im still very happy with Tipt :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I really enjoyed the mass zone line battles at the higher levels when I was on SZ, but I think that if you want to experience a more balanced level of pvp with some serious consequences attached, level up a toon on RZ.  When I first started on RZ, I started with nothing, but knew a bunch of people from E'ci who had joined way back.  So, I leveled a shaman up to about 55, farmed a ton of cash for resist gear, a haste item, and a decent blunt weapon, and then I deleveled him down to level 9 and releveled him up to 34.<br />
<br />
At the time, joined a small crew consisting of a necro, an sk, a druid, and me.  The SK and the Necro were both old friends and had at one time been level 60.  We had all known each other on E'ci a long long time back before I joined Rallos and all of us had some tight no drop gear.  To give you an idea of how tight, when we deleveled down to 9, the sk had 1200 hp, 90+ svm, 36% haste, 20 regen/tick, and a see invisible item on his body.  We were all basically geared that well.  <br />
<br />
Spent a few months with my crew ganking every person we could find.  I think there was only one instance when we found ourselves up against somebody who we couldn't kill once we reached level 34.  A really nasty ogre who had managed to gear himself up even more than us before he deleveled.  We had just slaughtered a group in Dalnir and were finishing up work on another group of low 30's over at the giant camp in Warslicks Woods when this big ugly ogre popped into the middle of our crew.  The fight lasted over 20 minutes and considering that it was a 4 on 1, he was probably the most skilled shadowknight pvp'er I have ever seen.  Wish I could remember his name, but he was quite amazing.<br />
<br />
If you can find a crew or bring one with you when you go over, I'd definitely recommend it.  There's nothing like it when you pvp, especially if you all have decent gear and pvp skills.  Back when the Lake of Ill Omen was a high population zone you couldn't find a better zone to pvp in.  No zone lines to mess around with, plenty of open space, at least 5 different camps you could hit, tons of hiding spots and hills.<br />
<br />
Anyways, to have fun on a pvp server, you don't need to advance to the end game.  The best times I ever had on RZ was when I was below level 34 fighting with a crew of people I trusted.  Just go out and have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>TjSz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I am a total lurker and don't even play EQ anymore, but Howler's post has inspired me to reply because his play history is a great illustration of many of the things that are wrong with EQ Pvp and RZ in particular. <br />
<br />
Howler:<br />
<br />
&quot;if you want to experience a more balanced level of pvp with some serious consequences attached, level up a toon on RZ&quot;. <br />
<br />
He talks about &quot;balanced pvp&quot; but then goes on to brag about de-leveling twinked out characters so that he could easily PK other characters and take their gear. In EQ pvp you can stack all the advantages in your corner if you are willing to play enough. You don't have to be skilled or bold or even intelligent. Then to top it off on RZ you can take other people's hard earned gear while wearing all no-drop yourself and have the termacity to come to the Shaman's Crucible and brag about. <br />
<br />
Howler's post strikes me as particularly pathetic. Being part of an overpowered gank squad where the odds are greatly stacked in your favor might be fun for you, if you enjoy beating up little kids or torturing animals, but it is probably unpleasant for people on the recieving end. <br />
<br />
If 1/2 of your opponents in an online shooter or strategy game had 5* the resources or hit points than you by virtue of their ability to push buttons repetivively for a long series of time before the game started it would take a lot of the fun out of those games. To top it off imagine if by killing you they could make you push buttons repeatedly if you didn't want to lose some of your character's effectiveness. That is what item loot on RZ essentially acomplished. It might be different now that you can use augments to make your gear no drop.  <br />
<br />
That said I enjoyed pvp a lot. And it is hard to imagine playing on a blue server. But the fights that stand out in my mind and were most the enjoyable are ones where the odds were not ridiculously stacked in my favor from the moment I logged into the server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Gratz on your leet deleveling skillz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Woah, settle down their chief.  Wasn't bragging.  Was trying to share some of my experiences.  Obviously it doesn't take much skill to pvp when you have gear most lvl 60 players at the time drooled over.  <br />
<br />
But you know what, it was fun as hell.  And that's the point I was trying to drive home.  I've already stated what pvp was about for me.  It's about the enjoyment of killing other people and making their lives miserable.  Was it fair to the people we killed that my friends and I put in the time to gear ourselves up so we could gank them?  Obviously not.  But then, pvp isn't about fairness, honor, or equality.  I've never contended that it has been.  It's about kicking the other person when they're down, ruining their night, and laughing with your friends when they begin sending death threats your way.<br />
<br />
It's not a direct comparison, but it's the reason why we twink our characters.  When you've done it half a dozen times the hard way, it's fun to take one character and outfit him with the best of what is out there so you can destroy everything that comes in your way.  Only this time, you're not killing mobs, you're killing people, which makes it all the more fun!  And not to nitpick, but our gear wasn't no drop.  LDoN wasn't around then, and we always hated never being able to loot the people we killed.  Hell, most of our kills came from jackasses running up to us and inspecting us.  You know how it works, /shout 'Erny is wearing a fungi, get him!'  Sure, one on one pvp against us wasn't fair, but you try it when you're fighting an entire zone of greedy people who want your stuff.  <br />
<br />
But that's why it's fun, and that's the point I try to get across to every person I tell about the pvp servers.  I've been the greedy bugger trying to gang up on the twinked out characters, but I've also been the person doing the slaughtering.  If you can't enjoy both, you're not grasping why playing on a zek is so much fun.  The constant threat of death, whether it be on an even playing field or a very skewed one, is the thing that gets your pulse going.  <br />
<br />
Sure, if you're going to roll over and die because the odds aren't even or in your favor, then playing on a zek server probably isn't for you.  But if everytime when you engage a mob, you have doubts in the back of your mind about whether that cleric you just picked up is going to heal you, or if he joined just so he can nuke you once you're down, then you know you're playing the game on an entirely new level.  That's pvp, and it may not be pretty and it may not be fair, but it gets your blood pumping and no other computer game has been able to do that for me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">You always hear about the stereotyped 12year old rude pvp gankers.<br />
<br />
You seldom hear about the hour long battles between 100 people over a zone that has you screaming YES GODDAMNIT! Battles that leave you drenched in sweat and heart racing like a amphetamine pumped hamster. Hands cold and spasming on the keys, not a word coming out spelled right. Group chat filled with similarly misspelled crys and battleshouts. Pure sheer joy.<br />
<br />
You seldom hear about the comraderie that only fighting others can weld. Sticking to each other having each others backs. Landing a heal just as your best friend goes unconcious and saving him and turning the fight. <br />
<br />
Hiding behind an orcish tent, ducking and sneaking up on the enemy group who are still unwary of your presence, trigger finger on the malos button, your ranger friend with bow string pulled back quivering to the max. Spell and discipline effects really come alive in those situations. Everything is so tight I probably can't explain it. The zekkers have all been there tho.<br />
<br />
Not all situations are bad run ins. Life on the zeks was always very much built on rep for me, and for many others. I never intentionally trained or griefed anyone, I played it as clean as I could, cause clean fights were more enjoyable. The enemy knew I played hard but fair, and almost always responded in kind. Fights based on tactics, strategy, gut and teamwork. From the small scale duos to the insanely large fights guild vs guild. Win or loose it was always a blast, especially before PoP where it wasn't over til the fat ogrelady sings. No running no hiding. <br />
<br />
Chases from Lavastorm down to deep into guk, back to South Ro dunesurfing with two mad cackling necros BoDing and splurting you, then in the last instant your two best buds porting in, snaring the necro pets, some sharp but friendly /ooc between enemies and the chase turns. <br />
<br />
Now we are chasing the unsowed necros, who are now having to resort to a mad shadowstep routine to dodge our tracking druid. Dots landing (yes back in the day they did), frost nukes crackling and singing the hot Ro desert air, dogdog equipped with gnoll hidelariat and serrated bone dirk giving chase on the panicking enemy. Total. Unrivalled. Blast.<br />
<br />
Dunno if that gives a clue how it feels, if not I simply cannot explain the good pvp moments well enough. As stupid as it sounds, I will remember some of those moments when I'm 70 years old. And I will grin. <br />
<br />
Yes I might be an illusioned idealist grumpy ol' shaman who loves to sit by the fire and tell those young snappers of days gone by, but by the Tribunal I tell ya, if you don't give pvp a chance you just might miss the ride of your life. Between the bad gloomy moments of trains, smacktalk and trains you will find the pure gems of thrill, friendship, bitter but sweet archetype style animosity spanning what feels like years. There you got something to sit and talk about over the campfire.<br />
<br />
The rude 12 year old pales in comparison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">This is one of the reasons i used to consider Asta as my shaman teacher, both in PVE and PVP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Gunny</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Well, I started a Barb Shaman on Sul.  It was weird.  After that tutorial with getting that dude out of the jail cell, I went to the mines, and into the frying the pan.  Right when I zoned there was some Dark Elf Necro, or something, laying into me right away.  I died a few times before I was able to find the person to teleport me back to my homeland.  All I could think about was getting revenge on that guy, even though I forgot his name.  So that was my intial experience.  I got Halas, went to EP, did a /who check.  Everybody was anonymous.  Is that how it is, or is it because I was a certain level of something?  There weren't that many people either, which is nice, I supose.  I did have some guy bugging to join a guild.  I didn't join, as I just wanted to get a feel of the PvP.  But the guy was kind enough to give me a couple of pieces of armor.  So I'm hunting in EP, and some Elf or something showed up, I couldn't tell what he was cause everybody was anonymous, but he conned red to my 2nd level Shaman.  We chatted for a bit, and he was saying that there was nobody here to kill, then asked if I wanted to duel.  So, I figured, fine.  So we start dueling, and I'm getting my ass kick, then he drops me to 0, then he started boxing me while I was unconscious.  Eventually I got down to -20 hp's and then I died and ported back.  After that, I got to level 3, went back to the tutorial to see if the Dark Elf was still there.  He wasn't, so I finished the tutorial and logged.  But before that happened, I had a moral delima.  There was cat dude off in a corner, AFK.  Up comes a lizard dude, and he starts going to town on the cat that is AFK.  I kinda wish I would've stepped in, but I think I was I was just dumbfounded by the whole experience and I logged, as I RL called.  So my first taste of the PVP server was.....different.  I didn't let that Dark Elf piss me off, or that other dude that boxed me while I was laying there uncounsious.  I'll be back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>phatteydump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Dont let those experiences get you down.  There are gonna be a ton of em hehe.  Anytime you have a bad one just let it roll off your back.  Water under the bridge.  The elf you dueld was prolly a few lvls higher then you, and most likely a twink if he was looking for pvp in a noob area.  Twinks tend to hunt there cause they know they can make a kill rather then go somewhere where there is people the same lvl as them.  As for the afk killing, that should be a lesson for you, dont ever go afk somewhere where you will be found.  If you have to afk, either go to a safe zone, or find a dark corner in a city in a building in the upstairs...you get my drift hehe.  Dont get upset about not helping either, most likely at lvl 2 or 3 there is almost nothing you could have done to save the kitty, the lizard wanted blood and he was gonna get it.  Good hunting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">But you know what, it was fun as hell.  And that's the point I was trying to drive home.  I've already stated what pvp was about for me.  It's about the enjoyment of killing other people and making their lives miserable.  Was it fair to the people we killed that my friends and I put in the time to gear ourselves up so we could gank them?  Obviously not.  But then, pvp isn't about fairness, honor, or equality.  I've never contended that it has been.  It's about kicking the other person when they're down, ruining their night, and laughing with your friends when they begin sending death threats your way.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Silentking</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">I never post on boards but this topic peaked my interest.<br />
<br />
After reading the previous posts on PVP I decided to dive right in after the latest patch. I started a Halfling Warrior on Sullen Zek. Why a halfling? Well in addition to the 20% exp bonus halfling gets there is also a 20% server bonus. So 40% extra exp per kill sounded quite right to me. I log into the the tutorial and although I didn't need it I wanted to get a feel for the server.<br />
<br />
Well right away I'm rooted by a yellow earth pet who is powered by this twinked magician. I figure no problem I've tried the tutorial out before I'll move over and get my free heal/buff from Rytan until he backs off.<br />
<br />
He backs off and goes harasses someone else. I start conning people and find out that most are evil with a few allies at my disposal. So I invite all the allies that I encounter into my group, the more of us, the better we can fend these twinked players. WRONG, no one wants to group, everyone is twinked to high heaven, fungi's, blade of carnage, haste, you name it they got it. I randomly encountered players who were true server newbies like myself.<br />
<br />
So I start leveling and before I can kneel down to loot my spidersilk, I'm rooted. Where did he come from? Okay I suck it up and die. No big deal. Back to leveling in the newbie area and bam again rooted, die again. After the 4th and 5th death it got old fast. So I decide to tank his pet this time. I figure I'm going to use reverse psychology, I'll hunt his pet instead of him hunting me. Well after more deaths I get his pet to around 12% and he starts running for cover because he knows that once his pet is gone I'm coming for him.<br />
<br />
Well a GM pops into the tutorial and states that PVP is not allowed and people will get kicked for not following the rules. I comply and start to head out to the leveling when a twinked necro logs on and sends his pet at me. So I stand there with pet beating on me infront of the GM and the GM does nothing to the guy. The pet is called off and the necro is talking smack to the GM, asking for a mana burn and what not. The GM zips out of sight and the Kobaner is at it again. By this time I was well versed in dealing with pets, no root, the necro is mine. I start beating on the necro who probably had about 1k hps or so because his hitpoint bar barely moved. He's laughing at me and all of a sudden, bam my screen freezes and I'm kicked to the server select.<br />
<br />
I'm like ***?!?! I log back on and the GM and necro are gone. I level up to around level 4 and guess who's back? The magician, I encounter a few more harassing deaths and leave. <br />
<br />
I'm in my newbie leveling area with some gear, and no one in the zone to group with. I start chatting with the locals in PoK and they direct me to other deserted zones. So I manage to get a group with some locals in Misty Thicket, we take on an orc camp and this seems alot like PVE. This time I make my mistake as a warrior and pull 3 with both druid and enchanter low on mana. We all die, no big deal, no exp lost and I'm bound in the same zone.<br />
<br />
A high level ranger (had to be around 30's) zips by and looks as if he's gonna help us out at this camp. Within a matter of seconds sparks fly, this skeleton illusioned bard just annillates the ranger in a mater of 3 or 4 hits. In fear I face my death like a halfling and get slaughtered. After my rez effects wear off in Shadowrest (which is a zone I never knew existed) I head back to MT. Then again, BAM! I'm snared, I turn around I see another ranger, a warrior, and a 3rd character I didn't get a full look at because of all the damage spam I was reading, and I go down again swiftly. I return to Misty again heading straight into Riverrale.<br />
<br />
I see another high level ranger and beast lord sitting. Then in a matter of seconds sparks fly again, the bard has returned this time as a half elf. I quickly press hide hoppiing it will stick, and watch the battle. I target the beast lord he's down to 46%, I target the bard he's down to 98%. The ranger seems to be unaware that his quild mate is getting beat like a red-headed step child. The beastlord goes down and the ranger snaps out of it and engages the bard. More sparks fly near the MT zone (I couldn't move because I was still hidden and still scared) then bam the bard zips past me, takes a few looks and zones. My guess was that he was trying to track me and couldn't because hide actually worked.<br />
<br />
The fallen receive thier rezzes and return to the their leveling, my group disbands because we had no safe place to go. All in all, it was time well spent playing EQ. Leveling to 53 with my shaman on Veeshan never equated to the 8 levels I received tonight on Sullen Zek.<br />
<br />
On a side note 65 bards are damn near unstoppable. Too many options at their disposal and in PVP you need options. As a warrior my only option was to die. I don't know if I will continue to play on Sullen Zek being that I'm pretty burnt out on EQ, but if the rumors are true and a new PVP server goes up, I would probably play my remaining days of EQ on a new PVP server just for the competiton.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">How were you pvp'ing before level 6?  Did I miss something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Silentking</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">On Sulllen Zek it seems that the tutorial is not considered a PVP immunity zone. I don't know if you've ever played the tutorial, but its pretty cool and well thought out. You start in a zone by yourself to get familiar with the EQ interface, then you are ported to tutorialb and you learn about tradeskills, quests, and etc. It's a cool place to get a full set up of newbie loot and to level up to 5 real fast since the zone is real small and the spawn timers on mobs are insanely fast.<br />
<br />
I didn't expect to get PVP in the tutorial until I got rooted as soon as I zoned in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">tutorial is indeed pvp on SZ, I highly recomend just skipping it. for your exping I suggest you find an out of the way zone without a pok book nearby. Misty, Gfay, nektulos and OT are all pvp hotspots, high lvls just pop in and gank newbies til other high lvls show up.<br />
<br />
you could hunt some place out of the way for days and never see another player.<br />
<br />
oh yeah for your first pvp toon I highly, HIGHLY recomend a gate class. at least til you get a feel for the server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">You aren't newt anymore Diabalein?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Koridar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">I can give you two examples on the negative sides and the positve sides of pvp, wich i both experienced today on my warrior.<br />
<br />
First we were going to get my warrior tipt flagged, but we ran into some enemy guild members at the Barindu Quinimi zone line. Most up us were human team (PVP teams) and most of them were human too. We were numerically superior but had few non humans to attack the humans so it took very long. There were quite a heavy zone dancing and we were facing one of the better paladins on the server (he posts on these boards under an alt).<br />
<br />
So all in all it took some time before we controled the zone (not sure if they left or if we killed them). Due to resists and bad variety of team and class we ended up with a stale PVP that lasted far too long. :(<br />
<br />
Afterwards i got Tipt :D<br />
<br />
Then when we were done i was going to a LDON camp and buy some purified crystals to my arrow summoning. I run into a shaman who i have known some time. We PVPed, and he won ( i could probablyhave lived by zoning or gating via magus but i was tired :p ). We talked in tells during my corpserun and he sowed me when i had looted. Thats one of the more acceptabel PVP deaths to have :)<br />
<br />
Oh and im still very happy with Tipt :D<br />
<br />
Is every other Shaman on the server Tipt Flagged but me??  I want my Cleave Bracer and I want it NOW!!!<br />
<br />
 Oh and Rangers need nerfed straight to Hell. It's as bad as when Luclin went Live and they got Tshot. 2k Damage in one shot while I'm running is unacceptable. 80% is just too high.  That Plus -20% to AC is just bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>NharviSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">Welcome to Sullon Zek, the land with no laws.<br />
<br />
I started out on Veeshan a couple of months after Zullon Zek opened, made a chanter and got to lvl 8 and was death bored. Went over to Sullon Zek and have been here ever since.<br />
<br />
No, it's nothing for the weak people, or for roleplayers, becouse you will get hate tells, smacktalk, trained, bindcamped, corpse camped, stalked, ganked and so on. Only rule there really is on Sullon is that same team training is illegal (which they added a couple of years back). Play nice does not apply to SZ.<br />
<br />
It's all vs all, evil team fight against eachother, even tho you can't pvp within the team. Only a few guilds have survived over the years, and most of the ones still alive are the old pre-Luclin guilds.<br />
<br />
Sullon Zek appeals to a lot of tards. I would say about 85% of the server I wouldn't talk to even if I got payed. The rest are ok, and there are only a few people that are really cool, but for them I would drop anything if they needed help.<br />
<br />
I could never stand playing on a blue server, I mean really, whats the point? Kill a mob to get better gear so you can kill a better dragon to get better gear etc etc. At least thats how I see it.<br />
<br />
You always keep gate memmed, you can't really just have XP spells memmed in zones that are open for PvP, you need to be ready for PvP most of the time.<br />
<br />
The day I leave Sullon Zek, my EQ days are over<br />
<br />
sorry for spelling etc, but I'm kinda tired atm  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">After reading about Sullon in this thread im getting more sure that Vallon/Tallon is the best combination, atleast for me.<br />
<br />
We have a much PVP, but there are also guilds a few guilds who have killed Quarm and are working towards Tacvi now.<br />
<br />
Though i must admit there are fewer and fewer low end guilds left now since the server does not support casual players in the same way as a blue server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Kriyn Nutzforcatnip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Started a wood elf bard not long ago and chose Sol Ro as my deity.  Not realizing that he was neutral I never considered, &quot;so and so is goodly demeanor&quot; to be a warning.  Well I found out that most of Gfay, where I started, was goody so now I'm having fun trying to do newb armor quests and just surviving in general.  I don't feel like re-rolling as a goody, kind of like the survival thing :)  I would have thought that most goody would hate evil alligned more, but from what I've seen they really don't like neut, even if I'm just there for xp :)</div></div><hr />
