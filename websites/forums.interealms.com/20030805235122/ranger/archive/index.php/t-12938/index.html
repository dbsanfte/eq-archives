<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vigilantia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just came back to Xegony today after being away since January or so.  The fizzle rates for spells are unbelievable I am fizzling at a rate that is about 1 in 4 approximately.  <br />
In gods name, why would they even have fizzles...does it help realism?  no   does it take hella mana from us rangers? yes  Another thing to bitch at?  yes  Why would they even have fizzles when you have cast the particular spell 10, 000 times?  Not only that  they give you so few slots to put a couple spells in only to have you  fizzle them......IT MAKES NO SENSE....Pissed off?  yep<br />
I did this post  real late at nite and I am not worrying about capitalization.<br />
NIte   tell me what you think<br />
