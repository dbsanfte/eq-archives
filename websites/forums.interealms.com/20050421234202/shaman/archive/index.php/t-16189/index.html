<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, I don't have Pox of Bertox yet as it is never for sale on inny.  I group a good bit, but have some odd hours occassionally that I will solo.  My main hunting ground has been nadox and it's been pretty good, but now it's a little stale and I need a break from it.  The Sanctus Seru Gaurds are good cash and OK xp, but I perfer a dungeon setting.  THe gobs in Veksar are nice but often camped and the rest of the zone is too resistant to poi and dis spells.  I don't want to hunt in PoP solo.  It's too much like DL to me and puts me to sleep.  I got smeared all over the walls in GE the other night, but I think it was due to a bug, but there are a lot of DBs there and I'll go back after next patch probably.  The Deep seemed OK with a group the other night but the mobs are stacked close and repop quite fast so not sure if it's viable for solo work, but I'm sure I'll try anyway.<br />
<br />
Suggestions?  I'm not looking for killer xp.  Just steady xp, loot and not mind-numbing like DL/PoP.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

I enjoy solo'ing in Sebilis. It's not easy, but you are probably high enough at 59 to single pull most of the early stuff, simplifying things a great deal. <br />
<br />
Chardok is also good, as long as the stuff near the entrance is still dark blue, and I think most of it is at 59. If you can get into the tunnel, it's probably mostly two pulls at most, which you should be able to handle, also. <br />
<br />
VL is another quality spot. It's virtually empty now, and the mobs are quite easy. Surprisingly, the spiders are not poison resistant, so they're easy kills. Now that I think of it, I think VL is the best solo dungeon for a 59 shaman. I was doing well solo'ing there until I start root-rot'ing in PoN.</div></div><hr />
