<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I found a site with a limited walkthrough of the earrings, it was fantastic information on the first 3, but the writer hadn't gotten further yet and the guide stops there, only giving stats on the later earrings.    Wondering if anyone knows where to find a walkthrough that shows all the quests, or could outline them here even.</div></div><hr />

You may also look into the quest pages at Allakhazam's.  Some of it isn't as detailed, but has some good player's comments on the quests.</div></div><hr />
