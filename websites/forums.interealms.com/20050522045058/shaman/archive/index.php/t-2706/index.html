<br />
Umm...why? I have been a Troll Shaman for 53 levels and have never needed to use any these. Why do you need these?<br />
<br />
Being able to bind in Tim Deep, the OT hammer, the Luclin Nexus, the problem of not being able to bank is almost a non-issue. <br />
<br />
Truthfully I have never, ever felt any need to get into the Wood elf town...<br />
<br />
<br />
My response to another post:<br />
<br />
******<br />
Most people see faction this way...as in Trolls have &quot;BAD&quot; faction. <br />
<br />
I actually see it reversed, as in Trolls have &quot;good&quot; faction. I can bank in 6 cities (Grobb, Oggok, Neriak, Bazaar, Overthere, Thurgardin), and I am not really hindered on what I can and cannot kill...I just kill what I want. <br />
<br />
As a Troll, I can kill almost anything I want, and don't really have to worry about factions at all. I have never tried to &quot;fix&quot; any faction or &quot;work&quot; on any except Velious of course. <br />
<br />
To me, the &quot;bad&quot; faction of Trolls means that I have many many more choices of hunting areas. I kill the mobs you can't because you're worried about losing faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah what Thual said..<br />
<br />
Faction in the Wood elf city? *blank stare*<br />
<br />
Bakkal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mordrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If I can't go to the same towns as good races how can I kill the same things as them?  Arn't there alot of creatures out there that you kill and get bad faction with bad races?  Or is faction negligible when finding a group?  What I mean is, are most of the creatures in the world ones that I can kill without killing faction with towns?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That's the beauty of being evil, you can kill pretty much anything you want and not worry about faction. Here are some pointers though....don't kill  Crushbone Orcs, because you'll ruin Dark Elf warrior faction in Neriak. And some don't kill in Karnor's Castle either as their faction at the Overthere outpost gets ruined. But honestly with Luclin and Velious who cares about faction ? Be evil and love it ! It's fun to smash those puny Toll Booth guards in WC, or dwarves in BB. Who gives a crap about Wood Elves ? A good wood elf is one simmering on a low flame. The only towns you should even worry about is Grobb, Ogguk, Neriak, Overthere Outpost, and Shadow Haven is indifferent to everyone so no worry there and you can bank in Thurgadin too.  Smash whatever you want...that's the luxury us evils have !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grunx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes being evil is great fun. Killing Slate every time I pass thru EC is one of my favourite hobbies. Same with the druids at WC rings, and watching all the goodie races in a panic in The Overthere because they are being handed various parts of the anatomy by the goons ;)<br />
<br />
And I admit that never doing xp grind in Karnor's is a god send.<br />
<br />
My north freeport faction (warmly last I checked) was something I didn't really go after, it has just happened over a period of time. I started doing faction work in Qeynos to make getting to Erud's Crossing a bit easier for Test of Patience. But got bored after 30 minutes of faction killing greenies and just used invis ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hunting in Blackburrow will let you get into qeynos.<br />
Hunting in MM will let you get into Kelethin and I THINK Felwithe.<br />
Hunting in Freeport will let you get into Freeport.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hunting the Gobbos in Warslike will let you into FV.<br />
<br />
There is or was one Shaman on here who took delight (As an Ogre) in killing &quot; a55lings&quot; (halflings).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>clonestyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've a question regarding faction and deity selection as a troll shaman.  Will troll shamans be able to bind, etc. as stated previously in OT and places if they're worshipping Cazic?  or Inny?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Your deity does not affect where you can bind in any way.<br />
<br />
Deity affects:<br />
<br />
 - certain spells you can cast, eg imbue amber (CT) or sapphire (Inny)<br />
<br />
 - equipment you can use<br />
<br />
 - faction with certain groups, eg CT worshippers can get into Paineel more easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ahh maybe I misunderstood your question - if you were asking &quot;is it safe to bind in OT&quot; then the answer is yes, it doesn't matter which god you worship, all trolls are OK in the outpost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Mordrek, right away you got a problem. You're THINKING LIKE A PINKIE! You don't need Freeport or their stoopid boat. You don't need the stoopid tree house city and the little santa helpers that swing like monkeys on it. You don't need Highpass or the weakling pinkies that couldn't keep their dogs from breeding with their daughters so that they can keep getting pissed on by their offspring. YOU ARE A TROLL! You lurk in the night, bash the heads of the weak and drink ale out of their misshapen skulls. Except the stumpies. Their heads are rocks. Can't drink out of rocks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mordrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">KILLIES PINKIES SOUNDS GUD!!</div></div><hr />
