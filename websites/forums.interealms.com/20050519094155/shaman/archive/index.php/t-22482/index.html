it isn't just train to xxxx zone now, it is 'train thru entire zone from xxxx zone to yyyy zone', lol.</div></div><hr />

Not an option for the folks that might get exp in Gunthak, Dulak, and points between.  <br />

I hadnt forseen something like that, but I cant say that Im suprised.</div></div><hr />

Some people have a limited time to play.  The last thing I want to do when I play is to kill some more worthless mobs.  Train away!</div></div><hr />

   Uh huh. Do you howl when someone trains you because they have limited time ruining your limited time? <br />
<br />
   I see so many people in places like dulak who dont even attempt to invis even before this pet change. Was playing some alts on the beach in the harbor and i see people calling trains before they even get out of the water. And no they werent non invis classes. <br />
<br />
   Amazing now people will train to save 400 mana and a few buffs on a pet and the hell with others. Oh well to each thier own.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As soon as they put a PoK stone in that zone, it was now a perma train area.  I know because I was leveling in that area at the time, and it was so nice while it lasted =)  Then they put the stone up and I see &quot;train&quot; every 30 seconds and bodies everywhere. <br />
<br />
I guess pets don't help but it was already pretty bad before, at least on my server.</div></div><hr />

Hell, the vendor in the lighthouse sells invis potions, even if you are a class that can't cast invis just buy one of the d*** potions.</div></div><hr />

And what do we learn out of this: People are lazy, and if you know that trains can and will happen: Don't kill near the zoneline.<br />

So long<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">This has pretty much wrecked 90% of Gunthak, Nirtox.  You can be nowhere near a zone line and still have company every 3 - 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
Heck, my BL was on the beach, far away from the tunnel.  I still had morons dragging things across me, and I wasn't remotely on the path from the tunnel to the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Wazbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I am nowhere near the zoneline, I am in the tunnels that connect the beach area to the Fort, Nadox, and Harbor area.  It is one of the few places I could hunt since the beach had LBlue mobs, and the Fort mobs were harder to pull.<br />
<br />
Half the time the people wouldn't call train or not call it until they passed me and left me to deal with any type of mob that was the same as the one I was currently fighting (flowers, drogmor, mushroom).<br />
<br />
It just ticks me off that people have gotten so lazy that they wont invis to prevent training or even call their trains that they have made.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>kittyshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">i was playing my necro last night in nadox.  he is bound in gunthak just outside the lava entrance to nadox.  my normal habbit is to fight for a while in nadox, gate, then use levant (necro self only succor type spell) to the boat by the lighthouse, then go sell / get buffs in pok, then gate back.<br />
my pets cost a peridot to cast (12pp).  i was thinking that this new pet zoneing was cool.  i gated, levanted, hit pok stone, walked around with my pet in pok.  got buffed, sold stuff, gated back to gunthak.  walked into nadox.  killed the 3 elementals at the zone in for aa exp.  ran thru the lava.  killed the roamer elemental that you pick up in the lava.  stuck pet in safe spot with guard.  ran thru to luggald room (with many luggalds in tow, but nobody was there to get trained).  feigned death.  waited a couple mins, then brought my pet to me.  was all set now to fight the undead....  pull a mob..  oh no, 3 mobs are coming..  click on feign death spell.  fizzle, fizzle, fizzle, smack smack... feign death works..  laugh as my pet engages the 3 mobs and quickly dies.<br />
i thought it was funny that i dragged my pet all over norrath and beyond, only to lose him on the first pull when i finally got back to my fighting spot.  i might as well have just invised and ran thru the zone...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>jador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I love zoning pets,too.    With Virtue/Fos buffed true spirit alpha pet + quiesence,  I soloed Kromzek captain(disease slow) easily for Tailsman of Belovence quest for wis 15 range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Vizxor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Sad thing with the trains to the beach in Gunthak is most of the ones doing it don't realise that even with 200 swimming and sow you won't make if far once you hit the water without lev. Mobs swim faster than you can ever hope to. Seen it quite a few times last night. I would actually target the person in the front and watch their health quickly drop when the train caught them. If you are bored, might add a comical relief for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">To me its clear that Gunthak (particularily the tunnels) is evidence that having low level mobs aggro on people is just stupid-beyond-belief-design. Even before this pet-zone patch it was very annoying to run through that tunnel with normal shaman invis since it could fade anytime/anywhere. Normally if it happend to me I would stop and kill what aggroed on me and then continue but it would feel like wasted time (= zero fun, zero challenge, just plain old annoyance).<br />
<br />
If they dont want people passing an area with invis then put some see invis mobs there. And if they want people attacked or not attacked by mobs give them a suitable faction. And if they dont want people running from aggro mobs make them summon. Dont mix random duration invis with aggro on everything mobs. Its not a challenge and its not fun. Its just boring and annoying. As with many other things City of Heroes has a much more elegant and modern approach to this. In CoH mobs that are significantly lower than you dont aggro on you - period. Mobs that are not quite that low will aggro a little if you run by but if you dont hurt them they wont follow you very long. If you do hurt them they will follow you longer but its still possible to outrun them. This is a much much better system but ofcourse that would be way to difficult for the poor EQ-programmers to implement.</div></div><hr />

Wouldn't rooting them, re-invising and moving on work?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">From memory they're pretty resistant to root and break it quickly. And you'd still end up with a train following you, albeit at a distance, considering how long the run is.<br />
<br />
The amusing thing this is that the stupid LoY tunnel is echoed by quite a lot of the GoD &quot;will your invis hold?&quot; tunnels.</div></div><hr />

Thanks, never noticed it myself, will keep it in mind.<br />
<br />

<br />
Well, that is true, but you can usually zone into Dulak long before the train gets to the village. I suppose it could be a problem if somebody is camping in the tunnel right before the village...</div></div><hr />
