<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>xector</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hi, ive recently started my sheild of bane warding quest. i've collected all the drop items i need(8skulls, brain, sun) except for the charcoal. then, i ran into a snag. being an iksar shaman im kos in Katta. the vah shir quest giver is indiff, but her barby friend in the same room is very kos and red to me at 55. <br />
<br />
i guess my question is has anyone evil done this quest and found a way around it? i know that the barb isnt on the normal guard faction, they all con threateningly and he is rdy to attack.  if i knew his faction(broote malicus) i could try and raise it. or better yet if i knew he could be charmed and tucked away by an enchanter. if im anywhere in that room, he will aggro and the vah shir chick will assist  :( . if anyone has any ideas or has dealt with this let me know. id really like the sheild, but id hate to have to have a friend go and collect the items and MQ it when ive come so far already. thanks :) <br />

MQ'ing the first part (8 skellies) is the best way to go.  After that you are done with katta.</div></div><hr />

Is there something you did to get those darn skells to pop? I have camped a combined 6hrs here and have 3 to show for my effort. It is funny. I got my amulet on the first kill and the brain on my second. For the life of me, I can't get a skell to pop. I kill each and every PH. Is there something else I need to do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>xector</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">nope, i didnt do anything special. just sat there for a lil under 6hrs, killed everything that spawned out there. somtimes i was lucky and had a few skellies pop within a single hour. other than that just being patient, and not leaving the spawn till i had what i needed.</div></div><hr />
