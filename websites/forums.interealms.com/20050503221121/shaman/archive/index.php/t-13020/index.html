<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>RedHat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is there a certain level that must be reached before it is possible to complete the shaman epic? I know that you need to be at least 50 to get the rogue epic, but was unsure if this is the standard across the board. <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I started mine at about 30ish.  Sat under Eruds crossing for that bit..<br />
<br />
Then I got my shield of Falsehood at about 35 or so.<br />
<br />
Black Dire didnt falltill in my late 40's, and then I did all the steps up to Kirn in one day when I was 51.<br />
<br />
Thats as far as Ive gotten so far.  I probably should get a few mage friends down to the Hole with some clerics, but Ive been to busy trying to get levels for Thor and an alt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Shaman epic used to be obtainable at any level, but people are reporting lately the final turn-in won't work before level 46. The other turn-ins will work at any level, to get the shield and SoW boots.<br />
