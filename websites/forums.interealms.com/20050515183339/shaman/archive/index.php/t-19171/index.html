<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For some reason, my magelo isn't putting any stats on my intricate wooden figurine, or the adventure stone that I have in it. Anyone able to tell me how to get the stats on it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ah.. nm, I found it.. under update character</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zacknaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">How do you know what percent to put in there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I had to fool around with it, started at 100% and saw the stats, then adjusted it down to where it fit more precisely.<br />
<br />
I know my stats are off, but they're pretty close.. I have em set at 90% and 16% for the figurine and stone respectively</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Koridar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you run Magelo Update it will show your Current Charm Value</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dirkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">In terms of PoP flags, for each complete flag you have, add 10% to your figurine. For the adv stone, it's different, you just have to play around with it a bit until you find the right stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>krindaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Myself, I use Shimmering Emerald Crystal, because I get more stats off of it than I would the figurine (for now). Unfortunately, Magelo has the stats on my charm in the NEGATIVES /blink. Very very odd. And I Magelo Update</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">For the adventure stone, every 10 wins at a camp equals 2%. Dont count excess scattered wins because they wont improve your stone, so they dont improve your percentage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">For me the stone % seems to match the hps/mana on the stone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yes, Taraddar, the percentage will match the hp/mana, but only for a level 65 character. The adventure stone has a recommended level of 65, so those below that level dont see all the bonuses. They need to use 2% per 'block' of 10 wins. <br />
<br />
The Magelo page to update it might also be confusing some people. The red text says a 'value between 0 and 200', but the value you enter is actually a percentage between 0 and 100 - as noted by the % sign by the entry field. Ignore the part about 0 and 200 and just enter a percentage. Each adventure stone improvement is 2%, and each flag improvement to the charm is 10%.</div></div><hr />
