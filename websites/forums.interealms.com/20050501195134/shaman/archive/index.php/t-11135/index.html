<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">greetings all, this is my first post at the Crucible but i've read a lot of your posts and found the information here invaluable.<br />
<br />
preface: i know this is a long post. i'm not looking for a step-by-step guide to EQ, by any means - just any advice, information or comments you folks have to give, so feel free to post as much or as little as you like.<br />
<br />
i quit the old text-based MUD I've played for ages about three months ago, when i bought a shiny new puter.  made the transition to EQ and haven't looked back since.  my first character was a gnome rogue on the Lanys server, leveled him up to the low 40's and hit the dreaded DL rut.  i hankered for a class that could solo as well as group - hence the shaman.  so i created my current main, teiresias, a regrettably longwinded and vowelly name i scrounged from the Odyssey.  i've leveled the shaman to 52, soloing almost exclusively with the exceptions of brief stays in PC and HHK.  the class is teriffically versatile, great fun, low equipment dependency.  i went on my first raid, naggy, a couple weeks ago and had fun despite landing only 1 aggressive spell, a cold-based nuke, the entire raid (i was level 46).  i don't much like the experience rut, so i want to get through the levels as fast as possible and move on to more of this fun questing/raiding stuff.<br />
<br />
anyway, on to my questions:<br />
<br />
--&gt; EPIC --&gt; i've finished all parts of the epic that i could solo, and managed to loot ghiosk's books while hanging around in CoM.  so how does an unguilded level 52 shaman who's solo'd 95% of his career rally the support to trounce Black Dire, let alone Rak'Ashiir?<br />
<br />
--&gt; GEAR --&gt; i'm totally untwinked - no fungi, no horse, no JBB.  i haven't made a magelo profile yet, so here's a quick list of my equipment as it stands:<br />
<br />
head: metal linked crown<br />
face: executioner's veil<br />
ear 1: silver hammer earring<br />
ear 2: forest loop<br />
neck: large smoothmetal torque<br />
shoulders: chokidai hide spaulders<br />
back: acrylia studded cloak<br />
arms: jaundiced bone vambraces<br />
wrist 1: chains of the accused<br />
wrist 2: worked dragonhorn bracer<br />
hands: shissar scaled gauntlets<br />
finger 1: velium fire wedding ring<br />
finger 2: velium jasper ring (will upgrade to shadel bandit)<br />
chest: polished tin mail shirt<br />
waist: chitinous belt<br />
legs: brown chitin leggings<br />
feet: shimmering terrorhide boots<br />
primary: spine chill<br />
secondary: sarnak battle shield<br />
range: gantru charm<br />
ammo: -<br />
<br />
i've also got around 7k in the bank, perhaps another 1k in items i've been to lazy to trade.<br />
<br />
so - advice on upgrades? ..or should i save my platinum up for one of those big-ticket items that would really make my toon noticeably better - ie a horse or a JBB or eventually a fungi? my concern with the JBB is that by the time i have enough money to buy one, i'll probably be high enough level that it's impact will be pretty minimal.  regarding the fungi - i hear it drops off a mushroom king in old Sebilis ... is he campable, if so is he always camped, and if he's not always camped could i find a pick-up group and have a chance at looting a tunic?  (also - around what level could i get into groups and have a shot at looting a JBB?)<br />
<br />
i really miss the extended affliction, affliction efficiency, improved range and affliction haste items i had pre-level 44.  the only quest i've been able to find for the III tier of any of these effects is the coldain military wristguard.  can anyone supply a link to a detailed description of this quest?  also, does anyone have ideas about other focus items i could possibly get my hands on? ..i've seen in-game links to the amulet of insight and the circlet of the falinkan ... are either of these items attainable at my level?<br />
<br />
another thing is resist gear.  i think i'll buy a crown of the froglok kings, seems like money well spent.  beyond that, can anyone suggest some cheap resist items that won't detract horribly from my gear in raids?<br />
<br />
last thing is WR bags. i have a rallic pack and a couple hand-made backpacks.  what is a bag of the tinkerers, and where does it drop/how is it made?  how about the evil eye bag?  the bag of nil space?  any info appreciated.<br />
<br />
--&gt; EXPLORING --&gt; i've already mentioned i don't like leveling much, soloing gets dull and i've only been in a couple really good groups (ones that pull in decent experience but - more importantly - aren't filled with whiners or buffoons).  so my inclination has been to get through the levels as quick as i can.  the thing is, i don't want to miss out on cool lower-level zones, mini-raids, and fun quests.  so does anyone have ideas about fun, off-beat places to check out (i went to CoM after reading about it here, and it's among my favorites of the zones i've seen so far), or fun quests to do, in the low to mid-50's?<br />
<br />
--&gt; GUILD --&gt; once upon a time on the MUD i used to play, i had a clan full of good, active players who grew to become good friends, and i miss them.  it's one of the ways i think that MUD was superior to EQ ... it was so much smaller and more personal.  considering i play at kind of odd hours, and also considering that i've solo'd about 90% of my time up to level 52, i haven't made too many friends on EQ.  and now i'm facing a few tough mobs before i can complete my epic, and i'm regretting not making more friends as i levelled.  i don't want to whore myself trying to buddy up with high level guild members; in fact i'm sure that would only turn them off to me.  i also don't want to seem like an epic-jumper ... but on the other hand, i sure would like some help with my epic.  this extends to others too, though - like i said above i really like the raid atmosphere, even on the disorganized, wiped Vox raid i went on last week, so i'm sure helping with other peoples' epic mobs would be fun as well.  i want to start doing more of this, but as yet i can really only get into open raids, which tend to be pretty haphazard.  anyway, if any of you have suggestions on how to raid more, make some cool friends, and join a guild ... i'm all ears.<br />
<br />
--&gt; LOOT --&gt; yeah, i made most of my money in rathe mountains.  i also farmed some owlbear pelts and made a few rallic packs.  it was and is mind-numbingly dull.  rathe also seems to have been nerfed lately.  i hear MQ's can be quite fruitful.  i also hear CC's a great place for loot, but overcamped.  i haven't explored it yet.  i'm sure this question appears elsewhere on these boards, but i'll ask again - what are some good places for a low 50's shaman to make decent loot and still have fun?<br />
<br />
--&gt; EXPERIENCE --&gt;  i've looked at a lot of the suggestions for where to hunt and when, but haven't seen too much information about the Planes of Power.  so: when do PoP groups start yielding better exp/hour than soloing?  what level can a respectably geared, untwinked shaman start getting PoP groups?  where can i find a decent map of the first tier planes?  ...and of course, what general advice would you give a first-time planer?<br />
<br />
<br />
that's all i've got for now.  thanks in advance for any comments or advice you might have.<br />

<br />
For an untwinked first character, your gear looks fine to me. I would gradually start converting most of your gear to +Hit Point gear (rather than +Wis gear), but I don't see anything glaringly obvious that you need. Working on Velious armor is probably the next logical gear step for you. Kael Drakkal giant killing for Thurgadin quest armor seems like your best bet.<br />
<br />
At 52 you can camp the Sebillis crypt in a good group for a JBB (and a Heiro Cloak), if you can find or build a group to do it. The Mushroom King in Sebillis is more of a level 60 camp in my opinion, and the Fungi is quite rare now. It is rarely camped these days because it is a hard camp with low exp and only a very rare reward.<br />
<br />
i really miss the extended affliction, affliction efficiency, improved range and affliction haste items i had pre-level 44. the only quest i've been able to find for the III tier of any of these effects is the coldain military wristguard. can anyone supply a link to a detailed description of this quest? also, does anyone have ideas about other focus items i could possibly get my hands on? ..i've seen in-game links to the amulet of insight and the circlet of the falinkan ... are either of these items attainable at my level?  <br />
<br />
Affliction Focus effects were recently made much less useful for Shaman. They now only work on DoTs, rather than debuffs and DoTs. I would try to get an Obulus Death Shroud for Mana Preservation 3 (Old Sebillis again - random drop off random frogs).<br />
<br />
another thing is resist gear. i think i'll buy a crown of the froglok kings, seems like money well spent. beyond that, can anyone suggest some cheap resist items that won't detract horribly from my gear in raids? <br />
<br />
I would not spend cash on resist gear unless you want to do Vox and Naggy a lot. If you want a froggy crown, take few people to Lower Guk and camp the Froglok king's room. Exp should still be decent at 52. Don't buy things that drop commonly in places that are good grouping spots for you.<br />
<br />
last thing is WR bags. i have a rallic pack and a couple hand-made backpacks. what is a bag of the tinkerers, and where does it drop/how is it made? how about the evil eye bag? the bag of nil space? any info appreciated.  <br />
<br />
You can solo the evil eye in Lower Guk for an EE bag if you want one. Box of Nil Space drops in the same camp in Seb as JBB. Bag of Tinkerer's cost 5250pp. As a Shaman, WR bags are not very important to you, though. You have the best strength buffs in the game, and Barbarians have good starting strength. Tailor made 10 slot backpacks should be fine.<br />
<br />
--&gt; EXPLORING --&gt; --&gt; GUILD --&gt; --&gt; LOOT --&gt; --&gt; EXPERIENCE --&gt; and Epic  <br />
<br />
Basically, you need to network. In EQ, just like in life, you gotta have freinds. It is time to quit soloing and farming Rathe Mountains, and learn how to be a great grouping shaman. Join pickup groups in Karnor's Castle and Sebillis. Die a lot. CR a lot. Learn how to not die a lot and CR alot. Learn how to get trained and kill the train, rather than running to the zone line. Learn how to get a group of people to work together, rather than playing like 6 soloers stuffed in a group. Also, I hear that mid to low 50s people actually group some for good exp in the Tier 1 planes.<br />
<br />
Talk to people. Ask them about their guild. Find some people you like hanging out with. Build your own group by inviting people to join you. Try to find some regular grouping/hunting partners and set up regularly scheduled grouping time with them on a weekly basis. Find a guild of people interested in the same things that you are interested in doing, and join them. Recognize that if you want people to help you with things like your epic, you should help them on things they want and need first. Ultimately, Everquest is a game about grouping. There are better designed games for single player play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rakji</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You started EQ 3 months ago from scratch, played a character to 40, played another character to 52, aquired all the plat to buy all the gear you have, quested, raided and heading to the high end game already?<br />
<br />
Man, this game has got way too easy!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rewts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">OS is your friend !!  some of the best cash drops in the game plus some really nice items (JBB Hiero) plus chance at rare spells (Malo, Torpor).  Get your key and live there.  Once you cant take Frogloks anymore, kill some more.  Then head to the PoP for awesome xp but hardly any loot.<br />
<br />
To go too much beyond that you are going to need some friends.  Both to get your epic and to get armor upgrades beyond dropable stuff.  Like Skyshrine armor.  Regarding the epic, you can still faction past all but the last step, but will need  a substantial raid force to get the Tear from Fear.  Although any guilds that do CT may have an extra tear to MQ for you.<br />
<br />
Overall, you are much farther ahead than I was at 52.  I understand how the grind can get you down, but it really is worth it to get 60 at least.  Group Focus, Malo, Torpor and you will forget all the pain of getting there.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I wouldn't worry about your gear, it's much better than what most of us had at that lvl. <br />
<br />
I'd start saving money for the big ticket items (Fungi, JBB, malo, torpor), maybe for a horse although I personally dislike them too much to bother. <br />
<br />
Best advice to give you is what a few others have said, start making friends! You can solo to 65 if you want but you've passed the point where you could actually solo mobs that drop equipment upgrades. Easiest thing to do would probably be to hit some of the grouping spots for your lvl and start meeting people. I wouldn't even bother with full groups, find a melee (or necro/mage) that's LFG and go duo somewhere. I always found it easier to meet people when the groups where relatively small. <br />
<br />
You might also want to figure out what you want to do at the high end. If you want to join an uber raiding guild, screw equipment upgrades and torpor /malo, just start hunting in PoP and worry about getting to 65. If you want to enjoy some of the 50s lvl dungeons, try to find a more casual guild around your lvl that raids occasionally. Most of the coolest raiding/dungeon zones are for lvl 50-60 and you'd certainly miss those if you went straight for the high end. It all depends on what you're looking for. <br />
<br />
My two grind spots for low 50s where OOT and the BW giant fort. BW is probably a better chance to meet people but the giants are sometimes camped which slows down exp. You can probably average about 500p there in a 4 hour camp while still getting exp. OOT is about the same if you hunt seafuries but there you can camp Gornit if he's open for really nice cash. Only other decent money and exp spot I can think of for your lvl is Ice Giants in Everfrost but I never felt like fighting the idiots there for the spawns. <br />
<br />
Black Dire in MM isn't too difficult at your lvl, you do need a melee partner though, trying to solo him at 52 would be a crapshoot. You're gambling that your pet lasts long enough for you to stick mal-x, at which point you can rot him. I don't think I'd try him solo before 55. The shaman epic mobs really aren't that difficult. I'm pretty sure that my favorite tank and I (65sk, 61 shm) could duo all parts of the shaman epic except for Fear (we would need a rogue to get us into CoM though). <br />
<br />
Sebilis is still the best money dungeon but you'd have to see how easy it is to get pickup groups there on your server. Don't think you can solo even Seb zone-in at 52. Velks might also decent, not as a solo spot for your lvl but should be easy to find a melee to partner with. The entrance to the Hole might also be a good solo spot for ya. Dunno if it's starting to turn light blue at that lvl. <br />
<br />
Best of luck to ya and happy hunting!</div></div><hr />
