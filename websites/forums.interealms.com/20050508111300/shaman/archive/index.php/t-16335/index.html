<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brelkeryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We were the second party to successfully complete an adventure on Drinal, and below is a recap of our adventure as well as a walkthrough of what you need to do to get &quot;pre-flagged&quot;:<br />
<br />
1. Visit your hometown, you'll receive a message.<br />
2. Find the NPC listed and talk to them continue the conversation tree and make note of any names they list.<br />
3. Find a nearby wayfarer's camp and talk to the leader of the camp.  They will ask you three questions.  Answer them based on the results of the conversation in point #2.<br />
<br />
Now you should be pre-flagged and ready for LDoN.  Find a group of similarly flagged folks and meet up at a camp of your choice, we chose Everfrost.  Our group consisted of the following:<br />
<br />
1. Monk - 65<br />
2. Monk - 65<br />
3. Bard - 65<br />
4. Beastlord - 65<br />
5. Ranger - 65<br />
6. Shaman - 65<br />
<br />
See anything weird here?  That's right.  No Cleric.  We tried starting an adventure with a lvl 56 cleric and the rest of us as 65 but we were unable to initiate an adventure.<br />
<br />
Once you have a group within a few levels of each other, like above, find the Adventure Recruiter and talk to them, choose a difficulty level (we chose Medium) and click Start Adventure.  The adventure we were assigned was &quot;Rescue the Sage.&quot;  We had 30 mins to find the dungeon and enter it, then 90 mins to complete the dungeon.<br />
<br />
Your compass gets an indicator to show you where the dungeon is.  Before leaving the camp, I highly recommend you soulbind in camp or at the dungeon entrance, more on that in a bit.<br />
<br />
So the group we had entered the dungeon, assuming a lvl 65 dungeon, and we ran into a bunch of bears, spiders, golems, and such.  The mobs we encountered hit for 300 or so max, think Plane of Valor.  The bosses hit a bit harder, but most of the trash mobs seemed fully slowable.  That's right... fully slowable.  There were a few resists here and there, but Malos seemed to take care of them.<br />
<br />
As we adventured around we grew a bit cocky and started moving forward without waiting for the monk to pull.  This turned out to be a big mistake, on one pull we got five mobs, I managed to slow them all, but myself, the Ranger, and the Beastlord died before the rest of the gorup killed them.  So this is where the long CR comes in.  We ran back into the dungeon, and having no cleric, had no way of doing rezzes.  We each looted all but one item from our bodies and kept moving forward after rebuffs.<br />
<br />
Throughout our journey inside we came across a number of objects that looked like corpses and one ice covered chest.  My advice to you is to IGNORE these items until after you complete your objectives, again more on that in a bit.  :)<br />
<br />
We proceeded to encounter a named mob, and then shortly after it died, we received a message that &quot;You hear a cry for help off to your left.&quot;  The Ranger checked track and found the Sage was now listed.  We followed his advice and the messages and eventually after dispatching many more trash mobs encountered another named.  Dispatching him and yet more trash mobs yielded the Sage we were sent to find.<br />
<br />
The first person to hail the Sage gets him as an escort, and then we had to lead him back to the exit.  In total the adventure took us 70 mins.  Afterwards we had 30 mins to explore the dungeon.  Now we decided to go back and mess around with boxes.  The first one did nothing, the second one spawned three skeletons that hit at least as hard as the rest of the trash mobs in the place.  Note: don't mess with objects until the dungeon is finished, the items will STILL be there.  A few more traps had AE and dispel effects.<br />
<br />
We received a total of 52 points each for completing the adventure on Normal, and had a great time.  Checking the adventure vendor showed that I had access up to lvl 24 Shaman spells as well as a Remove Lesser Curse spell.  Not sure how much you need for Remove Greater Curse or the Bane line as I didn't see our spells on the Miragul vendor, again keep in mind that you only see a bit above your highest point total, so I could see up to 60.<br />
<br />
Ok folks, hopefully this is helpful to you all, enjoy, and save me some fish!<br />
<br />

Was it medium or normal?<br />
<br />
Also, did you just wait till the timer ran out and spit your corpses out to get a rez?<br />
<br />

edit: What kind of drops did you get in your adventure?<br />
<br />
Normal difficulty level.<br />
<br />
We had to wait til the timer ran out and 30 mins past that to get a rez as there were no clerics inside the dungeon.  This caused the corpses to pop outside the dungeon entrance.<br />
<br />
We got a pretty nice wisdom caster mask, as well as 20/21 pal/shd hammer.<br />
<br />

<br />
  We ran into 2 and the first did nothing, but gave some odd emote on killing it.   Second one spawned 3 small creatures and again gave an odd emote.<br />
<br />
<br />
  nect one we found was full health, and when we attacked it we got a long text message to leave it alone as it was confused and would take simple orders....  it said to say &quot;Follow me&quot;  so we did :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  I said it, and it told me to bugger off, I had a pet.   So we had the MA say it and BOOM!  enchie style free pet.  Added DPS :)   It wasn't commandable and attacked only when he was attacked, but it rocked to have :)   Looks sweet too.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
   It may have naturally been full life and pet ready, but I think that the 2 we killed prepped it for use as a pet.  Just use your pet to kill the 1 percent life ones while the group is out of aggro range, then you can split or root pull the spawns, if any.</div></div><hr />

Cabi west. The NPC is near the LoIO zone in the vendor tents. They did add one nice feature, as you enter your hometown the emote tells you the NPC you are looking for is [compass point] from a well known building/guild/etc. In our case it says east of the Necro guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gaesekki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My first adventure was along a similar line.  However, being the fool I am I cannot remember the name of it specifically.  The zone in was in Oasis and I did not start the adventure nor ask the difficulty.<br />
<br />
It was also a resucue type mission and we were able to complete it with plenty of time to spare. (monk, rogue, necro, beastlord, mage, and me).<br />
<br />
Nothing of note dropped.  We did all of the chests and trees in this zone that we came accross and had a few pets and a few surprises.  The only augmentation that dropped was a +5 FR that nobody really wanted.  51 points were acquired.<br />
<br />
We were actually quite surprised to finish the adventure since we were only there to take a look after clearing VT ( = numbness).  <br />
<br />
Was a boatload of fun and I look forward to doing more.  Wish I knew which one bane was in though...hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">We did a 4-man adventure from the camp in Everfrost. We had my 52 warrior, a 51 wizard, 51 cleric, and 55 bard. We did normal level and were given the task to collect 22 transformed golem skins. The mobs didnt hit for much more than 100 or so, and we killed one cool looking named and it dropped the only item we got; a ring that was AC 6, 15 sta, 30 hps, 30 mana. We didnt succeed in the 90 mins however, we had 19 or 20 of the skins when the timer ran out. There were a lot of shaman goblins that kept slowing my warrior and the cleric was slow to cure me so I think we lost time there. After we failed, it said we had 30 more minutes to complete the mission for a lesser reward - which we did. My warrior got 3 points, as did the wizard and cleric, but the bard got 4 points for some reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">We did Miragul's twice tonight.  Once was an extermination of 57 mobs mission, the other was a rescue the freaking gnome mission. (Both on normal difficulty)<br />
<br />
We had a bard, beastlord, two rogues, an sk, and myself.  It was extremely easy, almost a joke.  During the adventure we got two chain BP's (60hp, 30ish mana, 47 ac, some wis and sta) and a little bag that uses a 4gold component to cast a stack of 25 range, +10 agi arrows (YAY).  We also got a varietey of +6 augment stones.  We got a +6 sta and a +6 int one, but the rest were either resists or useless stats.<br />
<br />
We went to Miraguls after that and did another extermination mission.  This was also very easy, but at one point someone screwed up and pulled 5 mobs.  The beastlord died, and thats the only casualty we had tonight.  We got a 20/28 primary only 1hb that procs a 312pt cold dd, and an 8int 8wis 10sta, 45/45 all/all mask.  No augment stones dropped in this dungeon.<br />
<br />
So, basically, a shaman can handle healing just fine in any of the normal missions (unless some dungeons are a lot harder than others).  We didn't try any of the hard missions, but two of my party were in the beta, and they said mobs hit for 900's in hard mode.  That's a bit past shaman healing capability, so you're probably going to want to bring along a cleric or a damn good druid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hail,<br />
<br />
I tried the rescue mission that starts in N. Ro w/a full group of 65's.<br />
Warrior, Paladin, Wizard, Mage, Cleric, myself.  All but the wizard and myself were in a Top 5 guild on my server flagged for elemental planes.  I have 170 aa's &amp; about 3300 hp unbuffed &amp; a full PoP spellbook.<br />
<br />
The rest of the group had already successfully completed a normal dungeon crawl, so they wanted to try the hardest difficulty, so we did.<br />
Despite my strong objections (based on reading from a beta tester), we tried a rescue type mission.<br />
<br />
Almost all the mobs mitigate slow at this difficulty level, though most slows are &quot;mostly effective&quot; from what I recall.  Trash mobs can hit for up to 900, &amp; they hit FAST if your slow is resisted.  Average hit was 400-500 iirc.  Shaman mobs of course gate, heal their buddies, and cast Pox, Bane, Blast of Venom and other nasties from our own spellbook arsenal.<br />
<br />
We suffered several deaths along the way, and a near complete wipe once.  Wizard evac was critical to getting out of bad overpull situations.  Lack of repops made this a very safe way to recover, and I wish we had done it more often instead of gutting it out a few times.<br />
<br />
Our 90 minute timer ran out 2 mobs short of reaching our rescuer.  Another critical point, EQtoolbox MAPS ARE NOT COMPLETE or ACCURATE YET, but they are still valuable tools.  I was the only one in the group to have a Toolbox map, and the location marked w/ the rescue target was incorrect.  Lucky for us, a Mage eye found the rescue target for us, and we were fortunate that it didn't involve us backtracking at all, so we wasted no time because of the map error.  It did feel a little weird to see the arrow for my location 'off the map', heheh.  I'm sure the mapping folks will get this sorted out sooner or later.<br />
<br />
After getting to the rescue target (just a few minutes past the 90 min timer), she would not return with us because the exit path was according to her not cleared enough.  We cleared for another 20 minutes (minus the warrior who left at that point, grrrrr) &amp; we still hadn't killed enough.<br />
<br />
I would echo what the original poster said though.  BIND near the dungeon, and charge back w/o a rez to save time.   The time we lost for medding after a cleric death (and one or two of my own) was wasted time.<br />
<br />
My assessment is that with a better crew (or just a bit more experience)we could have easily reached the rescue target within 90 minutes, but I don't know if clearing the requisite # of mobs was within our capabilities within the time constraint.  <br />
<br />
I have yet to try a Normal difficulty dungeon.  I'll be doing that today.<br />
<br />
I would recommend NOT attempting the highest difficulty RESCUE type missions  unless you have an EXTREMELY POWERFUL GROUP that are at least flagged for Elemental Planes &amp; have an average aa of 150 or better.  That's my assessment anyway, short-sighted that it is based on limited experience. YMMV<br />
<br />
Even though we failed, I had a good time, though I'll be picking better calibre group partners (I figured based on their tags they'd be skilled dungeon crawlers --- wrong!).<br />
<br />
Good luck,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My initial experiences of LDoN.<br />
<br />
I logged in last night and joined a bunch of guildies for an adventure. Monk, Rogue, Cleric, Druid, Wizard and Shaman (myself). All level 65, all very well equipped with the exception of myself and possibly the cleric (who was a bot, but probably better equipped than me).<br />
<br />
We went to Butcherblock and found the camp there, and took an adventure to Mistmoore catacombs (The Asylum of Invoked Stone, mmca). It was a straightforward challenge, kill 55 of the undead children of Mistmoore. The challenge told us that a new entrance to Mistmoore had been unearthed in Lesser Faydark, when we zoned into Lesser Faydark, a marker appeared on our compasses to tell us where to head, so it was very easy to find, and we took a little of the extra time to buff up.<br />
<br />
We had no map or plan, the rogue was scouting, the monk pulling. The mobs themselves were all blue and hit for around 300, they weren't too hard. Most slowed easily, some resisted first try. None mitigated slow. Some were immune to root, others not. Most didn't last the duration of a dot, the few times I dotted.<br />
<br />
We typically pulled 2, sometimes 1, sometimes 3. They weren't hard to cope with, even with 3 and no enchanter. It was a bit haphazard, but at times, I was off-tanking, at times we rooted, at times we just had 3 mobs in camp.<br />
<br />
I did lose the pet when it decided to tank and I was busy trying to slow.... I admit though, I am not very good with pets, I tend to /assist, then fire and forget and pay more attention to what I'm doing than what the pet's doing. Sometimes dogdog decides to change target, and when that one gets rooted, he can go down quickly.<br />
<br />
We came across a few traps on the way, which the rogue was able to sense and disarm. The first one we found, before we remembered to check for them, was an ae poison dot trap. The monk got dispelled a few times, but I'm unsure whether that was from mobs or from traps.<br />
<br />
Loot: generally we got some pp from each mob, and a few cash loots - ruby crowns, mithril amulet type thing. Some which I hadn't heard of before which looked like cash loot. A few misc spell research components, Mist of Povar was the only one I remember. We also got a number of cloth items, 5 I think, which suggests unfinished or broken itemisation.<br />
<br />
At any rate, we had 90 minutes to kill 55 mobs and we succeeded easily. I think we had around 40 minutes to go. There was a fanfaire when we got the 55th mob. We stayed in the dungeon after to explore, and that's when we came across a mini-boss (we think).<br />
<br />
I can't remember his name, but it was slightly different to the other mobs, but not an obviously &quot;named&quot; mob. It was still blue, but hit harder (up to 600 I believe) and had more HP. And it dropped this:<br />
<br />
Crypt Robber's Chestplate<br />
MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM<br />
AC: 47, STR: +10, WIS: +10, HP: +60, MANA: +40<br />
RNG ROG SHM<br />
Recommended level: 60<br />
<br />
The stats are from memory, and I think I've missed one, possibly sv fire+10. But overall, it was very similar to but wasn't better than my Tae Ew Chain Tunic, so we rolled for it. The druid won. I did try it on though, and it was a shocking pink colour. Ewww, a good argument for dyeing for whoever wears it.<br />
<br />
Right towards the end of our extra 30 minutes, we came across a chest. I don't think any of us thought to /inspect it, but the rogue tried to sense traps and got nothing. Then he tried to pick it, and I think it went off. Almost exactly at that time though, we were spat out of the dungeon, and went back to Lesser Faydark. When we got out, the rogue was drunk, which I think he found annoying, but we found amusing.<br />
<br />
The drunk traps seem to be a new idea - probably added specifically because they cannot be removed by Radiant Cure, only by time.<br />
<br />
We received 51 adventure points for succeeding. I got around 3 yellows of AA in that time too, at 100%, so experience wasn't great, but wasn't bad.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall impressions: We were an above average but unbalanced group and did the challenge easily. I'm sure an average balanced group or even unbalanced one could do fine with an equivalent challenge. An enchanter or bard would be a helpful addition, but is by no means essential. Similarly, if healing power is good, I don't believe a slower would be essential either.<br />
<br />
I've heard a few people suggest that LDoN will only encourage the &quot;cookie cutter&quot; groups, but this one experience seems to suggest otherwise. Though some of us were fairly uber, so who knows. Also, it was only one type of challenge, and quite possibly the easiest type, but having the variety to chose from may help non-ideal groups too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kianor, that is the most apt and amusing description of what happens when you timer runs out that I have heard yet.<br />
<br />
Made me smile, thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I went with a group to The Root Garden (Guk).  Group was me, cleric, another shaman, pally, monk, and ranger.  All level 42-48.  We were on an assassinate mission.  We pulled it off with 3 minutes left.  The other shaman was our only death, but the cleric rezzed and we kept going.  We found an +AGI augment and a lot of vendor trash.<br />
<br />
We found one chest (named a pile of bones) that cursed us.  The curse made all of our spells casting times double and lowered our ATK (so wait till objective is met before opening).  We also found a few froglok corpses just laying on the ground with 2% hps left.  Once killed they either healed us or gave us 50% mana back.<br />
<br />
I did notice the dungeon had a couple of quirks.  Where we found the target to kill, there was a frog that spawned after his death.  The frog could not be attacked and hailing did nothing.  After a few minutes he despawned.  It seemed like that is what should have been there if we were on a rescue mission.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I had a similar experience to Frekkels' last night.  We did the hard MM rescue mission...all the members of my 6 person group were members of the servers top 5 guilds (cleric, warrior, wizard, enchanter, shaman, mage).<br />
<br />
The mobs hit HARD and only mitigated slow.  Even with an enchanter, multiple pulls were extremely difficult since the mobs would just paste the enchanter.  It took cleric heals and my little heals to keep the warrior up.  <br />
<br />
The mobs were semi-magic resistant (bounced a few slows/roots after malo) but no problems landing cold nukes or poison dots.  The mobs appeared to be surprisingly light in the hitpoints department and hit from 500 to 900.<br />
<br />
One of the best parts: these bitten NPCs laying on the ground would get up and follow you around like enchanter pets!  The warrior had a pet for awhile, it was very cool.<br />
<br />
We failed the mission big time, we still hadn't found the target by the 90 minute mark and all of us had died several times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I also went on the Guk mission among others last night and we ran across a few 'cursed' mobs that had like 1% health left and were laying on the ground.  So just for kicks I cast Remove Curse on it and he poofed and gave us some mana.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I did mistmoore normal level, slaughter quest - kill 50 guys in 90mins.<br />
<br />
My group was a 65 bard, 63 bard, 65 cleric, 65 wizard, 65 enchanter and 65 shaman.<br />
<br />
The cleric mostly tanked, I healed her a dozen or so times with quies and used tnargs twice.  Replen + the regen on bard songs kept her healed up most of the time.  :)<br />
<br />
The 65 bard, cleric, wizard and I have solid, but pre-elemental/ssra/vt gear and over 100aa's.  The chanter has below average gear and less than 50aa, she did not use charm and rarely mezzed, the bards pretty much just handled it.  With lull there wasn't much in the way of multiples anyways.  All of us 65s had all of our spells.  The 63 bard had bad like early velious equipment, no AA and such.<br />
<br />
We completed the mission successfully with 30 mins to go.<br />
<br />
I agree with Gloriana that the bitten NPCs were a very fun little surprise.  <br />
<br />
If you are having trouble completing a mission, try the slaughter and collection ones first, imo.  Then you dont have to worry about routes.  Save chests and boxes and such for AFTER you complete your mission.<br />
<br />
ohh and I found Blood of Nadox to be very helpful for curing the stupid traps.  Which the bards could detect and disarm... and then they would still go off.</div></div><hr />

Hello I am one of the mappers and I run a site that EQtoolbox got its LDoN maps from http://ragedemon.netfirms.com/ldon/<br />
<br />
For future reference, for the benefit of myself and other mappers, please report all errors you find in the maps to the mapper or the person who runs the map site (Ramsus has my email and AOL IM, and the info can be found on my site).<br />
<br />
Please include in your &quot;bug report&quot;:<br />
zone filename (guka, gukb, takc, rujd, etc) and/or the zone name (Sepulcher of the Damned, etc)<br />
difficulty level<br />
type of mission/name of boss or hostage<br />
what was wrong with the map<br />
do you have a solution for the problem (IE, tell me the loc of the room, or give me directions as to where it is, northeast boss room, etc)<br />

<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong Rage.  I wasn't complaining.  I LOVE the Toolbox maps.  They have do require some updating, and that was the main point of my mentioning it, so that others don't treat the initial maps (which are understandably still unfinished after only a short beta trial) as gospel.  The reason I say that is because I generally DO treat the toolbox maps as virtually perfect.  If I could draw worth a squat or had any ability, I'd be submitting stuff when I found a mistake (which was never before this time).  I'm a bear who still gets lost in Halas w/o a map, so I don't make a very good cartographer.<br />
<br />
I didn't log the zone name, but it was the dungeon in North Ro that was entered in the hole in the sand towards the far end of the zone (SW corner I think?).  One of the Rujarkian (sp?) hill quests to rescue a target.<br />
<br />
The only part of the map that I noticed was incorrect was towards the top, where the map shows you only have one option for direction choices, when actually you could go left (not shown) or right (shown).<br />
Shortly beyond this straight passage is a room w/ the rescue target.  Other portions of the dungeon may be missing as well, but I didn't notice those as we headed pretty much straight for the rescue target.<br />
<br />
I thoroughly read the warnings on your site, and made sure my party knew that the rescue target position shown on the map may not be accurate.  I had no problem with that whatsoever. :cool: <br />
<br />
I look forward to more map updates, and next time I'll take down the information you listed to help improve the quality of the maps, which I personally consider very good.<br />
<br />
Please don't take my word of warning as a complaint, as I understand the tremendous amount of effort the mappers are putting forward.  Your site is invaluable!<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />
