<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How many of you went and solo'd Yeldema as soon as you could?  I did it at 58.  It was alot of fun just to say I did it  :cool: .  I was thinking about going again, now that I've been 65 for a while, just to see how much easier it would be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">/shrung never bothered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye, Ive never bothered to solo Yeld.  I did Lodi by accident when I was PLing an alt in the zone and the big turtle stepped on him.  That was a pretty long and boring fight, and if other &quot;big&quot; kills are like that then I just dont see the attraction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've only killed one WW dragon, and that was because I was bored waiting for a COH past sontalak and got too close to the roamer path down the middle of ToV canyon.  Crial, I think.<br />
<br />
Never have killed Yeldema.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I never got the big game hunting thing either. Taking all night to kill one mob just to say you did it doesn't really float my boat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Mostly people like it for the challenge.  Yeldema was, at one point, somewhat challenging of a fight (level 60, no aa abilities existed, we had like 2k hp tops).  <br />
<br />
Gathering 50+ people all night to kill a raid mob doesn't float my boat, but it seems to excite a good number of others =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It doesn't take &quot;all night&quot; to kill a WW dragon.  I think I do yeldema in like 3 minutes.  The hard ones in the canyon are like 10 minutes tops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I remember doing Yeldema :)  Later it was the canyon dragons, then in Luclin the things guarding rumblecrush.  That was the longest and most boring fight ever though :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It doesn't take &quot;all night&quot; to kill a WW dragon.  I think I do yeldema in like 3 minutes.  The hard ones in the canyon are like 10 minutes tops.<br />
<br />
<br />
I know it doesn't to kill one of them, but some of the stuff people solo now like zelthnic or whatever the horse is. Thats like a 2 hour fight right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">First did Yeldema at 56, and it took less than hour to get there and get out. Thats like, the time it takes for some guilds to buff their raid force. Yes I know its slow, but it still happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Soloing 3/4 of your emp key is a good challenge :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I know a shaman that solo'd Telkenor... a bit harder than any of the WW nest or scar dragons I imagine</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I tried to solo yeldema once, but I got an add, said &quot;screw this, this is just annoying&quot; and gated out.  Quitters never win! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Israi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I do not think you can solo telk.. that is the wtov dragon correct?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I know a shaman that solo'd Telkenor... a bit harder than any of the WW nest or scar dragons I imagine<br />
<br />
He quads for 400-500, and has an AE of 500ish.   Also has a boat load of hp.  Oh, and he's damn near impossible to slow.   I seriously doubt he was solo'd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Ha, Telk, no thats not possible. Since it needs 2+ clerics with velious gear to keep a tank up I not only doubt, but dismiss while laughing, that it didnt happen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Never did due to faction.  My rite of passage was to get Malo then Topor at  60 (before level 65 existed) Heck I was happy when I got bane of nife at level 59!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">there was a thread of some lvl 51 shaman soloing him useing dogdog, epic and i think thats it, was an iksar so no jbb.</div></div><hr />
