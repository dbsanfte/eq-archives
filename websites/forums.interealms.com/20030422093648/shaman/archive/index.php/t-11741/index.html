<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm finally happy with my equipment.  Just want a confirmation that I haven't missed anything.<br />
<br />
I have 2kpp in the bank and am saving for a horse (or a lizard,  haven't decided yet).  Earring of the Solstice after the horse.<br />
<br />
I plan to keep the Fine Antique Ring untill 49 when the focus loses a lot of it's usefulness at which time I'll replace it with another Velium Fire Wedding Ring.<br />
<br />
Anybody have any suggestions on where I should go after the horsie or spot anything where I could upgrade easily?<br />
<br />
Magelo is in signature.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time and consideration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Your gear is nice. You are still growing into some of your gear, but you should be able to ride that gear without any major upgrades into your 50's.  When you get Regrowth you can swap the Ikky BP for something that has more AC (and hopefully some nice stats to go with it)<br />
<br />
The horse is a great purchase if you do most of your exping outside. And with the large humber of outside zones and the relative scarcity of really good dungeon zones, who doesnt nowadays?  You will only wanna use it for standing regen though; dont rely on the horse for speed...with sow you are about twice as fast as the horse.  Lizard works the same, but is a little more expensive.  The lizards head does not obscure as much of the screen, but as a shaman you have shrink, which can elimate that problem entirely.  <br />
<br />
The Antique Ring is only up to level 44 by the way.  You will still use sub-44 spells after 44, but thats when I would replace the ring with the Velium fire.<br />
<br />
Have you thought about a JBB?  Expensive, I know, but like the horse, its one of those items that completly changes how you play the game.  You will FLY though the mid to late 40's with one.  FYI, a GREAT place to make money at your level is n the new LOY zones.  You should be able to make good exp there and the money is the best Ive seen in a really long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hail,<br />
<br />
Your gear looks great for your level.  I wish I had been as fortunate when I was your age. :)<br />
<br />
I didn't see any glaring weak spots that need improvement.<br />
A few spots will need upgrading in the not too distant future, but overall you are set for quite some time overall.  Keep on saving that pp!<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Your gear is fine for your level and will last you easily into 50.<br />
<br />
Some upgrades to work towards are the Solstice earring, a Shadel Bandit ring, an Enshrouded Veil/Veil of the Executioner, Iksar Hide Cape, and a new BP post-50.<br />
<br />
Just keep your eye out for items that balance your gear and contribute to your mana/hp pool and resists.  Most gear now has considerable AC on it anyhoo, so I would not worry with that aspect as much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sarnak Battle Shield<br />
Various spears/harpoons that can go in range/primary would be better than the driveshaft.<br />
Obulous Death Shroud depending on your server's economy.<br />
Other than those, you're doing great.<br />
Another option for a shield for you is the Troll Cultural made ones.  Check out www.eqtraders.com for stats.  You would have to go with the base model one and not one of the ones for Inno/Bert/Cazic/Rallos since you are a cat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">LOL<br />
<br />
That was fast.  I just updated my magelo with the driveshaft not 10 minutes ago.  If you'll look on the rallic pack you will see I have an SBS and several other weapons.  Which I use as the situation arises.<br />
<br />
The ODS is nice but still sells for over 8kpp on my server.  Well down on my shopping list.  Behind the horse, Solstice earring and JBB (if I ever get that far).<br />
<br />
Thanks for your opinions,  you pretty much confirmed what I suspected.  Any real upgrade is going to cost more than I'm likely to have free for a long while.<br />
<br />
The driveshaft was a bargain and I like the more reliable damage over the proc on the Blight, Hammer of the Scourge I have been using but I will probably resell it for twice (or more) the 350pp I paid for it and pocket the difference.<br />
<br />
Still looking for a better spear than the howling harpoon I have but everything that's better costs far more.  I really need something that has a better ratio and lower delay.  Haven't seen anything that interests me other than the REIF but that's 5kpp minimum.</div></div><hr />
