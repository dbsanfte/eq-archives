<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Man, the more I play, the more I love the guys behind this game. Just a few examples of how things COULD be. As EQ players, we are just so used to crappy service, we forget what we are missing out on.<br />
<br />
During primetime on a weeknight, 3 friends and I are doing a mission where we have to capture all these Asian gang leaders in an drug warehouse, and one of them is stuck in a wall and we cant hit him (the ancestral spirits phase in and out, and occasionally get stuck). We petition, and move on, expecting to finish the rest of the map and wait before CS comes to help out. About 5 minutes later, a GM drone appears before us, waits for us to finish our battle, teleports us to the stuck mob, and asks us to tell him when we are ready to fight it. When we are, he asks us where we want him to teleport it to, and lines it up for us, then cheers us on during the fight to observe and help if it got stuck again. Again... let me say this was during PRIME TIME.<br />
<br />
Another time, I submitted a bug report before logging. I check my email later that night, and have gotten an email from their team on the issue asking for a clarification. It wasnt a critical bug, wasnt an exp exploit, didnt break the game, etc. I reply, and the next day get another thanking me for my input. <br />
<br />
As an example of how bad EQ service is, our guild was intentionally trained multiple times by this particular druid on one of our firts rallos kills. We win, but barely, and he ninjas the earring off the corpse. Wasnt in the raid, admitted it in /ooc. Posted on various message boards that the gms wont do anything. It took us MONTHS to even get a gm to reply to the dozens of petitions, logs etc we submitted, and even then the turd wasnt banned and nothing came of it.</div></div><hr />

That's stereotyping all Asians as Yakuza-wannabes.  And as Ron &quot;Tater Salad&quot; White (comedian) would say:<br />
<br />
&quot;That's wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
Seriously, glad to hear that you did get help.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah... i play lineage2 from the same company and i love their CS/GM service, takes around 10 minutes to get stuff done.  We had a huge duping problem on L2 around two weeks ago(the company wasn't ready for what people would try with a game).  Anyways, they did a wholesale ban within 24 hours of finding out, 5% of the games players were banned around 3k in total... It was just very profession how they did it and were very open about what they could and could not do.</div></div><hr />

Heh. Not really. They ARE an asian gang, but hardly Yakuza wannabees. More like a combination of ghosts, ninjas, tatood hitmen, sorcerers and demons. And there are definately Asians in the game who arent in the gangs. Its not like they run around with buck teeth taking pictures of everything speaking in &quot;Engrish&quot;, which would be an offensive stereotype.  So I guess if a gang of evil asian sorcerers is a stereotype of evil asian sorcerers... Oddly enough, the zombie gang demands brains, the troll gangs are really common under bridges and dumb, the nazi esque gang kidnaps people to make them watch brainwashing propaganda films, etc.<br />
<br />
Pretty much all the villain groups have schticks. After all, comic book villain goods work best with unified themes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Garais</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Even a game with a less than stellar reputation as Anarchy online has better CS than EQ.<br />
<br />
A few weeks ago i decided to take a break from EQ and play a little Anarchy Online. One of the first nights i was playing i saw a call in the general chat that a guided tour was about to take place. It was one of the advisors in AO that did a guided tour of the area called shadowlands.  On the tour the advisor explained how things works in shadowlands and also told a lot about the history the area. The tour probably lasted about an hour and was very informative and interesting.<br />
<br />
The times i had to petition in AO my petitions was answered withing 20 minutes. Never took them any longer than that. I have now left AO again since the gameplay is not my cup of tea, but the CS was very good at least.<br />
<br />
So if a game like AO can have good CS , how come EQ can't? <br />

<br />
My first experience:<br />
When I first started EQ I got stuck in a rock in BlackBurrow, I petitioned, then I died.<br />
Within 10 minutes I was ressed and moved to a safe spot in zone.<br />
<br />
My second experience:<br />
While doing my epic, I hand in the ring to that mob in CoM (2-3 years ago now I forget her name). The server crashes, I get back on 30 mins later, the zone is reset...obviouslly and there was no rollback. I have no ring anymore.<br />
I petitioned and sent an email to CS, 2 days later I get an email asking me to confirm I have the ring in my inventory. Sure enough I do.<br />
<br />
My third experience:<br />
During stomach event entire raid falls to thier death (except safefallers) due to collision muck ups. We petition, a GM arrives, resses us all, and escorts us through the entire event.<br />
<br />
My fourth experience:<br />
Fighting RZtW I run into the pit and somehow, no idea how, I get ported to the Hole zone in in Paineel, immediatley I fall into the zone line, immediatley followed by falling to my death in the Hole.<br />
I petition, and get a response advising that the GM can not help. (not that I really needed help) I then discover the next day after posting a questino here that this is normal behaviour when your raid is all fuxored up.<br />
<br />
My fifth experience:<br />
Just like the frist poster, we dropped RZtW, someone ninja'ed the earring  and I had won it. I petition, most of the raid does in fact.<br />
Next day I log on, check my inventory, there it is. Oh and the GM spent around 10 mins informing others from my guild who had ninja'ed it, and answering varius questions.<br />
<br />
Wonder what I am doing differently?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>beriah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I donno.<br />
<br />
The quickest I seem to get a reply is days now, not hours.<br />
<br />
It used to be that you would wait a few hours at worst but get an answer the same day.  Not true anymore.<br />
<br />
And if your really stuck in some way, like I was for almost a week recently.. then that can really suck bad.<br />
<br />
/who all GM  ;  /who all GUIDE  lately?</div></div><hr />

well most of those are raid events, so ... i would guess multiple people sent petitions, wich would result in you getting what you needed faster.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As I recall some time around Luclin era, they changed from a dedicated CS team on each server during peak hours mon - fri to having a server GM covering 2 servers. Vazaelle used to have Jaydrox and 2 other GMs, along with several guides, we not only got good CS, but there were also a fair amount of GM events.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">/who all GM ; /who all GUIDE lately?<br />
<br />
Actually, i had a petition for one reason or another, got a guilde to respond within about an hour, but said they would escalate it to a GM because they couldn't do anything.  Natrually i did a /who all GM, but none were online, so i asked about it, and the guide said that GM/guides have the ability to go 'invisible' so they don't show up in /who all xxx types of searches to prevent people sending the direct tells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The shortest response time I've ever gotten in EQ is 6 hours. The longest was 18 days.<br />
<br />
That's a real response, not &quot;Hi, this is Guide Powerless, what can I tell you I can't help you with today?&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yeah shifting things onto guides who couldn't do anything was a very rude joke.  Poor guides, too.  Often they couldn't really even confess that they couldn't do anything; they just had to prove it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I've always had good responses with GMs, just not always prompt ones.  My GM response times have ranged from 20 mins (back when I was a wee bairn in Blackburrow... damn tree) to a month (recently), which consisted of me logging in with an alt (since Shandy poofed during a server crash) and waiting on line several hours a day, then repetitioning and waiting the next day, etc.  Email got nothing beyond the &quot;reinstall drivers&quot; reply, each and every time I iterated the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Nijel_Blakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">my Experence with GM has been ok but for 1 time. We were in VT a while ago and we wiped and I got a rez and as I was zoneing the server Crashed. It came up about 15-20 min later I looted my gear and as I hit done on my body the zone crashed again. This time I come back within a few min but this time I am missing about 1/2 my gear and I dont have a body. I talk to a gm 4 days later ( being I play about 8-12 hours a day) and they said they will let the lead GM now. a few more days later another GM sends me a tell to see if I still need my gear I say yes. Even more days pass and the GM finally gives me my stuff back. <br />
