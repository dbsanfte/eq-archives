<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Azareal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just thinking (and am probably completely wrong) but it seems that the majority of the rangers here are having problems getting groups these days. It got me thinking, my impression was that the more dmg you do to a mob equals to more aggro from the mob. Without a doubt, rangers can deal out a whole lot of dmg (which is our curse and blessing).<br />
<br />
So what would happen if a group was made out of just rangers ? Theoretically, wouldn't the mob have to keep switching its focus on one ranger after another as they constantly switch places on the aggro list ? This switching would be very fast wouldn't it since the dmg each ranger does would be relatively high and fast ? Plus if any one particular ranger finds that he/she can't handle the aggro anymore, he/she could eiher jolt or move back for a few seconds.<br />
<br />
Taking into acount the switching thing plus the high dmg and speed factor, the mob should be dead before it could do anyone any serious dmg.<br />
<br />
What say you ? Think the above is sound ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Taamar Bladesworn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've done ranger-only groups and they end up with everyone being low health.... it can be done, but its quicker to bribe a single cleric to join you.</div></div><hr />

Anyone got a cleric alt around ? hehehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Malevant Faeshadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Problem is, unless you coordinate it, agro doesn't generally pong in an all ranger group.  Some folks, be it for gear, play style, or some other reason, just generate more damage and/or agro than others.  If you coordinated, I suppose it would work, but I'd just as soon solo rather than pull slowly in an all ranger group, if xp was the goal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>DvaranSM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">best group so far rangerwise was a bard a shammy and 4 rangers<br />
<br />
slowed mobs with bard haste and all dual weilding some serious whoop up turns into some good fun and still pretty fast pulls</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Daesun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Best group is duoing an AM3 ranger with a chanter with all the charm AAs and Command of Druzzil.  Tash mob, snare mob, charm and haste mob.  FARM ENTIRE ZONE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wanerile Shadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">One of the most effective groups I have been in was 3 Rangers 1 Cleric, 1 Chanter and one Bard. Hunting in KC.<br />
<br />
All I have to say is wow. I have never seen combat last so short per mob, it was really incredible. to top it off the cleric never ran out of mana. :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Maian62</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">All the same - sometimes sharing aggro (and hence damage) is essential - like when the last healer in your group goes LD in the middle of  a fight.<br />
<br />
This happened to us last night in the KC basement.  If I hadn't taken aggro from the warrior - and started sharing the damage around at least one of us would have died.  As it was we all survived until the healer got back on...<br />
<br />
It can also be necessary when you have no complete heals on tap - and the druid or shammy cannot keep up with the mob's rate of damage.  The thing is not to let anyone get below about 2 bubbles - or you risk getting to the point where they  cannot lose aggro ...<br />
<br />
The risk of course is if you start to get adds or respawns towards the end of a hard fight when everyone is low , and vulnerable.<br />
<br />
The all -ranger group CAN work ok -  IF you all have some sort of mana buff  (at least clarity, or better still,  KEI), which gives you all enough mana to heal yourselves up between fights.  Hence all rangers plus either a chanter, bard or beastlord works ok too.  We had a group like this with one warrior, a bard, and  the rest rangers in KC.  We'd let the warrior tank and the Bard would mana regen us during the fight, after the fight we would all chain cast heal on the warrior - crude but effective.<br />
<br />
Otherwise - since DoTs now stack - I suspect an all ranger group without mana regen is better off either bait kiting or root/DoT/plinking, if not the whole way, at least until the first root breaks to soften the target up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>axis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I recently was in a group  in HHK and that was comprised of 5 rangers and one cleric. Let me say this Rangers rock!!! We cleaned house. The cleric said that he was bored, he basicaly only healed when we where in combat. We didn't have a main tank, we all took turns.Not once did i drop below half health.<br />
  This was one of the best groups I have ever been in and would love to do it more often.<br />
    RANGERS ROCK  !!!     : )</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Milendarci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Best group I was ever in - 5 rangers and one bard.  Mobs died so quick our healing was more than adequate.  Agro controled with Jolt.  Bard kept us juiced with extra haste, mana, and regen.  Highly recommend this group!:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kundow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I was in a nice quick  group in Velks, 2 Iksar Monks, myself, and a Cleric.  Cleric got bored, and monks complemented me on my damage...which I've always thought was kinda low....:confused:</div></div><hr />
