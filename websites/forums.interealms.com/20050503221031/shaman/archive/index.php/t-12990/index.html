<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jyphant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just got flagged for this today and was wondering if any other shaman have any information on where is best place to solo in here? I know the castle from what I heard, but Do you levi and invis over castle and is it entirely safe?. I got killed by general trying to go invis over castle. Dont know if invis dropped or he sees invis? And on other side where is a safe spot if you can describe it from castle? <br />
<br />
I did solo some at zone in and seem to get like 6 to 7 % aa solo root rotting. Root rootting at zone in is really easy. Is it just as easy past castle? Thanks in advance with any information you can give me. Also anything good drop. Like spectrals or other spell turn ins? Thanks again.<br />
<br />
Also put this thread here maybe get more reponse.  Thanks any info is appreciatted</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">are yo ugoing up on the left side of the castle ?  <br />
<br />
<br />
you can get past general very easiely   when you run up the wall find the steps and walk down to the lower portion of the wall    :D<br />
<br />
i solo alota things there just make shure you dont get a un rootable mob :)  <br />
<br />
btw for 3 people in a ks group one night doing a quick omni kill  the rangers got 15% aa xp hahaha</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>jyphant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was wondering more on the 18 % aa solo.  Safe spots and how to get there the best.  Thanks for any info</div></div><hr />

Those mobs are near the second castle (before Fennin trigger area).<br />
Magama guys on bridge after first castle are also 18% AA.<br />
<br />
To kill those mobs, anywhere in field of gibs is good if you can get a safe spot to pull too. Right side of second castle, Right hill after bridge are usually ok spot with enough room to run in circle screaming waiting root to be castable again ) <br />
<br />
I heard that a good spot to solo is in the area between Fennin trigger spot and second castle but I never really managed to go through the second castle alive... <br />
It's possible to go through the second castle without aggroing anything tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yellow mobs are not worth the pain to solo really. Yes 18% aas per kill, but just get unlucky on root, stun, fizzle or whatever and you re dead. Better chain kill the lvl 65 guards in the first castle. 5min each mob, easy kill, easy single pull, study exp and 11% aas per kill around. This camp is even more easier than BoT stormriders and more exp... (in solo that is)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yeah those magma guys suck major ass if they catch up to you and thier not slowed  they are somewhat rough in groups as well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Team up with a necro inside second castle, at the courtyard (Fennin trigger spot i guess). I call it the picnic table spot. :)<br />
<br />
Without pushing it too hard I can score about an AA every 45mins. Necro has Bane of Thule. Using necro to agro kite and our pets beating from behind. Im sitting in the middle tossing on bane/ancientbane/ultor and just spamming canna like a madman. With darkness this is easier than pie and totally safe. Gets a bit mindnumbing tho.<br />
<br />
As for soloing, I agree its better to kill the even con stuff. While its nice to see the huge jump from downing the redcon doomguards or the yellowcon magmas, its not worth it due to their resists and hp. One unlucky rootbreak/resist coupled with a stun and you're dead vs red/yellowcons (triples for 1100ish). If the two phoenix birdies up past first castle are dead,you have lots of excellent space to move about right there before the magma bridge. Two evencon spawns just at the foot of the stairs, and you can pull from inside the castle as well. Using levitate and the terrain elevation coupled with the fact that these mobs arent too fast runners, you should have no trouble root/rotting them.</div></div><hr />

aren't worthwhile.  :p<br />
<br />
<br />
If solo I'd stick to the zone in area, easy and quick xp and if you get a mob that isn't rootable/snareable just zone out and find a different one.</div></div><hr />
