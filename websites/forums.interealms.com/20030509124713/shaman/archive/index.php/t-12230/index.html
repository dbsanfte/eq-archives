<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Horde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I decided to log in my good old 65 Shammy and have another run at EQ due to my lighter schedule these days, but for some reason it crashes on me.<br />
<br />
I'm on my college campus' T1 server and they recently firewalled Kazaa and other media gathering programs of its type to reduce the traffic on the server, and I'm worried that this also is going to block any MMORPG's.  I've tried to run DAoC *ducks* and it too is not connecting to the server.<br />
<br />
Concerning EQ, I can get to the character selection screen, but when I try to load up my shammy it goes thriough the motions like it's loading the zone / character and then goes black and takes me back to the character selection screen.<br />
<br />
If anyone has ever experienced this problem and remedied it somehow, I'd love to hear what you did exactly.<br />
<br />
Thanks much.<br />

Basically, it looks like you have to open up all udp ports above 1023, which might not be something your college would be keen on doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Check your UI's..every patch has a few changes that you might need to lay into your 'custom' UI...this causes the kind of crashing you're talking about.</div></div><hr />

I agree with Csin, this sounds like a UI problem.  Some of the newer UI windows may not be listed in your custom UI .xml files.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>slimb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Depending on the version of Windows and video card it may also be a driver conflict.  But UI problem is the first thing that comes to mind.  In the Everquest folder there should be a UIErrors.txt file (or similar not at my EQ pc right now).  If there is one, open it up and see if anything is in it.  If there is, it will pretty much spell out your problem for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree also.  The same thing kept happening to me the day I got a cable modem and installed a firewall.  It just happened that the same morning it was patch day.  I spent so much time on the phone with the cable company and installing different fire walls, I wanted to scream, only to figure it out later that it was just old UI files.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Horde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The UIErrors file says UIErrorLog created at Wed Apr 02 13:12:48 2003, so I guess that's it.  I emptied the ufiles folder and copy + pasted the files from default folder into ufiles to try to restore the UI settings and I still had the same problem.<br />
<br />
No clue how to fix this either (I always hated trying to get UI's to work)<br />
<br />
Thanks for pointing me in the right direction!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">the error log is created every time you login, no matter what..  open the file and see whats broken instead of just reading the file date.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Porgy Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You can always delete your  UI_playername_##  file to fix all UI problems, this will set you back to the default UI and allow you to log in.  You can then rearrange window, or install a new UI and see if that will fix your problem.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Horde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The date is all it says.  Well crap it's probably because of the firewall if it isn't the UI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Horde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I don't have any UI_playername## files, I haven't logged in any characters since I reinstalled EQ a couple days ago.  It's never actually loaded a character since it's been back on my computer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shakasa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I vote its a T1 Admin issue with closed ports.  I am a Dir of IT for a co and I know I block all but 3 ports on all my routers.  Not going to say wich ones mind ya but no way would I allow for the ports to be open that EQ wants...makes it too easy to hack into them.<br />
