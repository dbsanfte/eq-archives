<br />
Well that and Halflings are creepy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Taamar Bladesworn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">And then they decided to give the halflings better starting stats.... thus opening the race/class combo to min/maxers who give us all a bad name. So... if you can split pull, gain agro, lose agro, root park, fear kite, hold an agro kite without ever getting hit, heal, buff, solo, and group thats fine... otherwise you're nothing but an *******.

Every class that could be a druid could also be a ranger, except for halflings, which is one particular reason I have always wondered why halflings couldn't be rangers too.  EQ is based on EQ lore, and not the lore of any other fantasy world, so there never has really been any good reason not to include halfling in the list of ranger playable races.<br />
<br />
Endless quiver and archery mastery went outside the view of the traditional EQ ranger as well,  and I don't see nearly as many people complaining about that.  :p</div></div><hr />

That had me chuckling... I've had halfling druids training me, but hardly saving my &quot;sorry ass.&quot; But clerics, I like, they treat others with more respect (compared to the druids). <br />
<br />
Haily, that sure was a harsh generalization. When did I last bs a halfling ranger simply because he was short and hairy? Never. Show some pride in your race, refrain from &quot;whining&quot; (which is what I consider it) and move on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mule muffins, it's based on the same psuedo-Tolkein 95% of the rest of the RPGs in the world are based on, and Halfing Rangers make as much sense in that mileu as High Elf Beastlords.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Amise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">EQ is based on EQ lore.  What EQ lore is based on is a lot of different elements from the fantasy genre, which encompasses a great deal more than one author, albeit a highly influential one.    There's no reason why the new lore should not be different from what it is based on, in fact I'd be disappointed if it was exactly the same.   <br />
<br />
Just because halfling rangers &quot;make no sense&quot; in a &quot;pseudo-Tolkien&quot; world, and EQ lore is based on some elements of that world, is not, to my mind, a reason to exclude them from EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hopwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">EQ Lore never made any mention of Halfling Rangers, are we to believe that after three years an army of Halflings trained themselves in the arts of Rangerhood without anyone noticing?</div></div><hr />

Sorry, just seems to be the type of player who pick the real shorties (halflings and gnomes).

So no, I'm NOT going to stop thinking less of them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I don't see very many Halfling Rangers on Lanys either. I may just hang out in the zones they don't, which could be because I go to less crowded zones usually.<br />
<br />
My problems with Halfling Rangers are as follows: Number One: They were added late and in order to make them more enticing they got better starting stats. It's not the fact that the stats might not be justified in being better, but that it is kind of coincidental that they were added late and then get the best stats.<br />
<br />
Number Two: I don't meet a lot of Halflings, but I used to hunt in Runnyeye a lot because it wasn't crowded, and I dreaded going to sell and Bank. Whenever I did I would get five or six tells from random halflings &quot;Do you have any spare armor or weapons?&quot; Because they saw me come out of Runnyeye.<br />
<br />
Number Three: I have met four halfling Rangers, and one of them was nice. The other three were jerks who would randomly say things like, &quot;How can the wood elf out damage me? That's not fair!&quot; Just because they had the best starting stats. Right now, my strength is 195 self buffed. They didn't like that either. &quot;That's not fair! My starting strength was higher than yours!&quot; (By the way I am still in some Ry'Gorr, mainly BP&gt; I don't have the best gear for a level 49 other than weapons. /love Flamesong and Lamentation combo) They seemed to whine the most about every little thing.<br />
<br />
Number four: Since they were added late, and they got the best stats, the people who want to &quot;Be the best&quot; seem to want to pick them over anything else. I chose a wood elf because I'm a fan of the elven race in general in every RP I have played from Dungeons and Dragons, to the World of Darkness (Changelings were close enough), to Shadowrun (Yes, I have a Cyberwared Elf in Shadowrun). My choice had nothing to do with &quot;EQ Lore&quot; or whatnot. I simply asked a friend &quot;What is the hardest class to play?&quot; He replied &quot;Ranger&quot; and thus, Siriath was born. Thank you Brizzo of the Mithril Web. <br />
<br />
Lastly, Number Five: Most Halfling rangers are not the person't first character, and yoiu can tell the ones who aren't. Or, you can tell the ones who are and they were PLed by a friend a lot easier than other races of Rangers. Most Halfling Rangers do not make it past level 20. They quit long before that screaming &quot;This is too hard!&quot; If the kinds of players to pick Halfling rangers are the kind who will quit it because it is too hard, then they should be wiped from Norrath.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Fomin Rabidboy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I've been playing off and on for about 2 years. My first account expired and everything was lost. When I started playing again last summer I found that my favorite class and favorite race could be one character. My first character ever was a ranger, I loved playing him but never liked any of the race choices( sorry to offend anyone, but I'm not an elf player).  I've always liked playing halflings, but I never liked any of the classes as well as my ranger or my monk. I haven't seen too many others like myself at my level on Bristlebane. there are many at the lower levels, but I've only seen myself and maybe 2 or 3 others lvl50+. <br />
<br />
I like my character alot. If someone doesn't like him, oh well, it's usually based on bias and they don't know. So who cares, it's not my problem it's thiers!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I don't mind the one good halfling ranger I know. It's the rest of them that will break you of liking the race.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Halfling rangers and Barbarian and Iksar beastlords are just *wrong*.  Halfling rangers were the final, great change that gave EQ a complete disconnect from actual roleplaying.  They weren't added with an expansion and large storyline, nor were rangers a new class coming into the game that would fit well with the race; they were just added randomly.<br />
<br />
The only race/class combo I find remotely amusing are gnome necros/SKs, because they're supposed to be horrid and evil...and two feet tall.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Corenia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">halfling druid and clerics save our sorry asses? it seems that the ten year olds seem to pick the gnomes / halflings / dwarves. most druids are asses anyway (on fennin ro anyway), and EQ Lore shows the short ones as being mean and greedy. So of course people who roleplay aren't going to like you - and accept you into rangerdom? you don't know half of us - so don't make a post degrading &quot;us&quot;. make a rant about people that do that, but just because others do doesn't mean &quot;we&quot; do. think about what you post next time you post it, *******.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the basic problem is they gave the best starting stats to a race with an innate exp bonus.  That's where most of the hate comes from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Maian62</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Met a Dark Elf SK in the Karanas one time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Twilite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">As for myself, I have never played a halfling. I do, however, play a 57 Woodelf Ranger, whom I love =P <br />
<br />
What bothers me about this thread is that the people who play halflings are constantly harrassed about their race - they deserve a break. Indeed, halflings have better starting stats than the other races, but what about the Tunare Rangers and the Helm of the Tracker? Was that not unbalancing for the Karana rangers? <br />
<br />
There is always going to be  imbalance in a game, it is hard to keep everything perfect. Perhaps I am biased for my RL fiancee plays a halfling ranger. I'll tell you his story....<br />
<br />
He started playing EQ a little after it first went live. He decided on a woodelf Ranger and enjoyed playing him until someone hacked his account and deleted everything. My fiancee was a little upset, and after a couple of weeks off of EQ, decided to start another ranger. This was also the time that Verant introduced halfling rangers, and my fiancee liked how haflings looked, so he chose one. His ranger is now level 60 and constantly harrassed, with people calling him a twink and so forth. <br />
<br />
What I want to know is why practice a form of racism in game? Some of the threads on haflings and things I have heard in game are so malicious, one would think they were in the real world and being accosted by the KKK! <br />
<br />
Also, I understand how halflings are not very &quot;ranger like,&quot; but they were introduced and EQ does not have any obligation to adhere to the rules of other roleplaying games. EQ is its own game, though it seems that initially it used a lot of ideas from past games. <br />
<br />
I love playing a woodelf, and I will admit that I do not particularly think halflings are hotties =P But understand that there are people who play halflings and enjoy them, and that is what the game was designed for. Also, I have no clue why someone mentioned that kids play all the short races....that is not the case as far as I have seen! I find that kids tend to play warriors of any kind, especially trolls and ogres, but that is just me :p</div></div><hr />
