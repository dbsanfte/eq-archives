I do not know what you are speaking of.  Maybe you should try a mage board.<br />
*looks around*<br />
Did they buy it?  What do you mean we're still broadcasting?  Oh S---</div></div><hr />

&quot;Project Alpha&quot; refers to a buffed pet with a pair of weaps (usually proccing weaps like the summoned ones, velium, or gnoll hide lariats).<br />

*FLASH* <br />
You've just come back from an enjoyable holiday, you love each other, you have great kids, you didn't read this thread.</div></div><hr />

I laugh every time I see that question because I can already guess the replies.<br />

Keep up the good work, we'll beat that nerf bat yet.<br />

<br />
Yes they do, but it doesnt really seem noticable till 44, or even 49. I have seen my 49 pet quad attack for 51 with weapons equiped (I go with piercing/blunt, seems best for me). I often check the bazaar for summoned stuff, or cheap proccers - if your going to be doing an 8 hour grinding session, its worth the 10-50 plat in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

Lol, this word has to be the most misused/misspelled word in the history of internet gaming. Along with any word that normally ends with e that you want to change into a present tense verb i.e. :gating, coming, zoning and the ever popular dying (dieing).</div></div><hr />

	 (1) Don't use no double negatives.<br />
	 (2) Make each pronoun agree with their antecedents.<br />
	 (3) Join clauses good, like a conjunction should.<br />
	 (4) About them sentence fragments.<br />
	 (5) When dangling, watch your participles.<br />
	 (6) Verbs has got to agree with their subjects.<br />
	 (7) Just between you and i, case is important.<br />
	 (8) Don't write run-on sentences when they are hard to read.<br />
	 (9) Don't use commas, which aren't necessary.<br />
	(10) Try to not ever split infinitives.<br />
	(11) It is important to use your apostrophe's correctly.<br />
	(12) Proofread your writing to see if you any words out.<br />
	(13) Correct speling is essential.<br />
	(14) A preposition is something you never end a sentence with.<br />
	(15) While a transcendant vocabulary is laudable, one must be eternally<br />
	     careful so that the calculated objective of communication does not<br />
	     become ensconsed in obscurity.  In other words, eschew obfuscation.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>GMan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Here's something odd I noticed about our pets the other day...<br />
<br />
I gave him a snowball from eastern wastes.<br />
<br />
Now at first I was thinking that this was a regular weapon so when I gave him a second snowball I was expecting him to start dual wielding but he wasn't.<br />
<br />
I finally looked at the stats on the snowball..it's RANGE only...but here's the kicker...the pet does NOT lose the range item ;)<br />
<br />
Yes, that's right, your pet can have 2 weapons and a range item as far as my limited testing can tell.<br />
<br />
Nifty isn't it?  How long until it gets nerfed?</div></div><hr />
