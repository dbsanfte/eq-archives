<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>EeyonRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I thought it might be a nice change of pace from all the talk about class balance, what shamans need, and all that sorta jibba jabba to utilize the shaman collective for a little project.<br />
<br />
I have no problems with the current state of the shaman class, but one area I would like to improve on is damage, because its always useful and always stackable. By improving damage I mean working to streamline it and be as efficient as possible, not sending emails to Sony asking for 1500 point ice nukes.<br />
<br />
You can break down shaman damage into 4 different categories: Spell damage, damage through pets, damage through players, and increased mana/decreased mana use. You could add damage shields as a 5th i suppose, but as a shaman its not likely to ever be all that relevent.<br />
<br />
Basically what I'm wanting to do is brainstorm for practical ways of increasing the damage in any and all of those aspects beyond the obvious. This can be done with various items and spells, but can also be done simply by play. For instance, everyone knows that pets do more damage from behind mobs, etc.<br />
<br />
I'm sure that between everyone that posts here that there will be some really useful ideas with a little bit of effort. I'll even crown a thread winner who will be rewarded with A MAGICAL TEXT HIGH FIVE.<br />
<br />
Like I said though, let's try and avoid the obvious, but also stay within the realm of reality here. Also, ideas aren't neccessarily the only thing of use here. Even just previously ungathered raw data can be turned into something practical.</div></div><hr />

If there were anyone creative over at Sony, it wouldn't be hard to see that Shamans should be able to use Alchemy to create affordable no drop (and therefore, self only) potions that would enhance our damage inflicting spells (and perhaps other spells/abilities).  The Awareness line is a nice start to the concept, but 5% mana preservation isn't enough to make most people want to bother.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, Sony would do something to this concept that makes noone want to bother with it.  Either through too high of skill level, too high of cost, too low duration, too many rare components.  Something cheap, on vendors, and the effect lasting 3+ hours like the Awareness line = key.<br />
<br />
As for the effects, that's easy.  Take the Awareness line, and add to it.  Affliction Mastery.  20% Mana Preservation, add 20% critical chance per tick, add 20% dmg per tick, increase duration 20%, decrease aggro 200/tick.  Cost: 10pp.  Supplement the needed ability to do this by questing a spell that would summon a certain component, or imbue a component.  Wow, sounds like everQUEST again doesn't it?<br />
<br />
There.  Shamans would want to use dots and Alchemy.<br />

Contradiction?<br />
<br />
Anyway, staying within &quot;the realm of reality&quot;, group FA isn't an unreasonable request.  Neither is ditching the str element on focus and just making it pure attk, equal to what the str would have given anyway.<br />
<br />
Other than that, I don't know what to say.  If we aren't supposed to ask for a new nuke, then we'll just have to keep chaining rains (with FOM3) I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">we get the throwing skill, but i don't know a single shaman that uses it.<br />
<br />
castersrealm doesn't even list it for us<br />

<br />
i guess i will start looking at that to stack more DPS.  perhaps try and throw while the canni 4 is refreshing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tragik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Jilariz has a good idea with a change to alchemy.  Unfortunately, pleas for -common sense- changes to alchemy seem to have gone largely unheard.  I'm not sure why the devs are so afraid of making it a viable, profitable and/or truly useful tradeskill, but in it's current state it's strictly situational (for me at least) and rarely used.<br />
<br />
Other than that I've always wondered why the ice nukes have such a horrendous casting time and would have loved to see a skill for us similiar to Spirit of the Wood or Paragon.<br />

Possibly an aa that takes 3khp from us and gives mana back to the whole group.  hmm, a mgbuffable twitch.../drool</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">well i can say for sure what we dont need <br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4901&amp;source=Test<br />
(yes i know contructive but the bit below is)<br />
<br />
the problem is not total damage , but the time we take to do that damage, we need speedier spell that do the same damage<br />
<br />
3045 damage in 126 secs is for the vast majority of fights way too slow. might be more useful if was a dd for 3045 with a 126 recast (basically keeps same dps, but looks way cooler and we can do most the damage, whereas as a dot it wont unless a very long fight)<br />
<br />
but i would perfer<br />
<br />
dd, 1.4k 3 sec cast 30 sec recast for 460 mana. likely change all poison nukes to this type (which is more closer to bane dps), can even add lore that close working with beast allowed us this new spell (there beast only nukes work this way)<br />
<br />
or instead of dd do a rain spell 1000*3 , really wouldnt like a long recast time though, though maybe 20 to 30 sec?<br />
druid would be abale to cast atleast 3 of there 1.5k i this time(30) for total 4.5k, compare to our 3k.<br />
if that too good for some then 40 sec recast would be 6k to 3k.<br />
<br />
but i think the quick 1.4 dd is best.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">well, since we are shaman, witch doctors, tribalists, why not ...<br />
when a certain number of shaman in a grp or raid are present they can do a &quot;spirit chant&quot; or &quot;spirit dance&quot; to call for acient powers, say like melee strike through in the form of &quot;spirit of panther&quot; and have it go to the bard buff slots.<br />
that would make multiply shaman so useful. and give them something VERY useful.<br />
i've got more idea's but some just don't fit into eq, they are more like DnD things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i got the neg rep and i thought i was on subject.<br />
<br />
instead of the macro canni dance was gonna try macro canni and throw, especially in LDoN where the mobs are close and the little extra mana from the dance might be made up by adding the melee skill.</div></div><hr />

how exactly am i trolling?<br />
<br />
i made a thread called &quot;lets do something contructive&quot; in which the first thing i did is stated that i'm tired of reading about what shamans should have, clarified what i was talking about, gave an example of what i was talking about, gave an example of what i wasn't talking about, and STILL it starts out on the downward slope towards people talking about how sweet it would be if they only had interzonal bicycle kick death attacks.<br />
<br />
i guess i'll just have to try this again.<br />
<br />
one example of a shaman doing something to improve their damage is switching in a huge weapon such as the 78 damage beast from UP if they happen to be soloing with a bracer, because the delay of the weapon becomes irrelevent and the weapon instantly activates at the end of the spell.<br />
<br />
one example of a shaman talking crazy jibba jabba would be me demanding a special half-pipe zone which only shamans could zone into, where they could gain special attacks such as &quot;ninja throat cut storm&quot; and &quot;magma baby assault&quot; by performing various aerial stunts. <br />
<br />
the difference is subtle, but its there if you look closely!</div></div><hr />

Your kidding right? Everyone of your replys was made just to belittle someone. You are the essense of a troll, no if or buts about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Translation: Hey guys, I'm talking about things you can do that you should already have learned to do a long time ago in shaman 101.  But obviously since all you all do is whine about the shaman being left in the dust, none of you know how to play your class and you all suck.</div></div><hr />

Shaman are obsolete.<br />

We tried doing something constructive, want to know where it got us?<br />
