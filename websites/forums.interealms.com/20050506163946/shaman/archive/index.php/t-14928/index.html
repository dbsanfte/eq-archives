<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>rjhiii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been playing EQ for a couple of months now.  I got bored with my ranger and started a shaman.  Recently I was grouped with some people that headed to the ogres in west karana.  Obviously it turned out poorly for us and the one person in the group that could of done the cr left.  <br />
<br />
My question is, what it the best way to drag out my corpse?  I tried with my lvl 20 ranger and the ogres were not very happy with me.  Should I start a ogre and drag the corpse out with him?  Any suggestions are welcome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sow up and make a run for it.  You might die twice, but at least both of your corpses will be away from the Ogres.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>rjhiii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">So how do you drag a corpse?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">target the corpse and type /corpse<br />
<br />
or make a hotkey that says<br />
<br />
/tar Rjhiii<br />
/corpse</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zilansis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">make a hotkey and put the following lines in it<br />
/corpse<br />
/corpse<br />
/corpse<br />
/corpse<br />
/corpse<br />
<br />
get sow up and any hp/regen buffs you have<br />
run near your corpse and start spaming your corpse hotkey <br />
dont stop running til you zone.  corpse should be dragging behind you<br />
zone back and loot your corpse<br />
<br />
<br />
if that doesnt work, and your under 35 can find a level 25+ sk or 12+ necro to summon your corpse.  the coffin are less then 2pp and can be found in various city zones</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My corpse drag hotkey is this:<br />
/corpse<br />
/loc<br />
/corpse<br />
<br />
So, if I die in the process and need help, I can give someone a /loc (location coordinates).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">) If a 40+ player comes into the zone, tell him &quot;my corpse is stuck at the ogre camp, do you have time to help me drag it out?&quot;<br />
<br />
) Make a level 1 Ogre -- they might be non-KoS. Log in the shaman and /consent the name of your new Ogre. Log in your Ogre and move to the Ogre camp and target the corpse and drag it away.<br />
<br />
) Run really fast through the Ogre camp, spamming your /corpse hotkey. If it's your own corpse, you don't even have to target it first.<br />
<br />
) Cast a spell on the central Ogre, and train them away from the camp. Double back with them all trailing you, grab your corpse and run away like mad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">yeah buff yourself up good, make sure you have sow.<br />
<br />
make a hotkey that says <br />
/corpse<br />
/loc<br />
<br />
You can buy an invis potion, called cloudy potion from a potion vendor(there is one in the plane of knowledge, in a building near the stone to the plane of tranquility), for about 12 pp.  Get a couple of them and you can sneak in invis and drag your corpse out using that hotkey.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Those ogres don't mess around. Was running through the area a month ago with my 57 druid and got agroed by them, they have a decent agro range so if Your gonna drag your own your best bet is to get them all trained away before running through the camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">invis?  Running in there isn't a good option at low levels.  The ogres HT and you'll insta-die.  <br />
there's always the possibility of having a high level character get it for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">What server are you on? I have lvl 20 + toons on 3 servers so if you happen to be on one of them ill help you out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tulurean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">skip the long run..call a necro and meet at zone line..put ogres on your hit list to take out later</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">aye what server you on?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you're on ayonae ro then I'll help you get the bodies, and I'll even help you kill them! and from what I remember, the ogres at 9000, 12000? lol yeah I hated them when I was level 14 :) they are indifferent to everyone and on their own faction, so another level 10 or so that can get their w/o lions eating em, can drag the bodies I'm pretty sure..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>rjhiii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Thanks for all of the advice.  I finally got my corpse back, it just took some effort:)  I think I died four times, but each time I got my corpse a little further away.  And you better believe when I am a high enough level those ogres and I are going to rumble.<br />
<br />
Also, I already love this board!  I can't believe all the offers of help.  Thanks guys.<br />
<br />
Oh yea, and since I don't have a sig yet, I am on Prexus and as of this morning am lvl 12.  Geez that makes me feel like a newbie :)</div></div><hr />

I'm not the only one with a &quot;Revenge is a bitch&quot; list?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ranger should be able to Camo and run in to drag them out.  I do not recall the ogres seeing invis.  Don't forget that to be able to drag someone else's corpse you have to have them /consent you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Lor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I've had a revenge list since those freakin Soloists in EF used to demolish me. <br />
<br />
Glad you got your corpse back... you actually just reminded me of anotehr batch of mobs that I haven't returned the favor to. =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">lol yeah I hated them when I was level 14  they are indifferent to everyone and on their own faction, so another level 10 or so that can get their w/o lions eating em, can drag the bodies I'm pretty sure..<br />
<br />
The ogre guards around the outside are indifferent, but the 2 others by the middle stone are kos. Soon as the 2 middle ones aggro on you, all the guards help them. That's how I died to them when I was real young. I only conned the outside ones and saw the indifferent so ran up to talk to them. heh. :eek:</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Kizdean Gix was the first name added to my revenge list. That was a year and a half ago. I still kill him every time I pass through WC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jendain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I'm not the only one with a &quot;Revenge is a bitch&quot; list?<br />
<br />
at one time, i considered buying a larger harddrive that could hold the list :p<br />
<br />
best options IMO are<br />
<br />
- find a necro lvl 12+. if they're nice, they will only want the money for the coffin (around 2 pp for the lowbie version as stated).<br />
- find a higher level person passing through (not as likely with PoP books all over the world).<br />
<br />
you'd be amazed at times how high levels like to help when they can. we're not all the evil ubers we're made out to be ;)</div></div><hr />
