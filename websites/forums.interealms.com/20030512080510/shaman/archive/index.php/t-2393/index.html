<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tildaor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I did the test of wisdom last night and, not thinking about it, I did the turn in to the spirit in West Karana (for the shield) while I had wolf form on.  Will this affect my faction with True Spirit in any way?  Specifically, if I did all of the other steps up to this point, will I be able to the black dire part or will he not con warmly to me now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Spraggon-Test</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think as long as you have done each step you should have gotten all the faction hits you need.  I haven't heard of faction hits being adjusted by your 'race' when you get them.<br />
<br />
Of course, maybe they changed how factions work just for shaman. ;)<br />
<br />
EDIT:  This is my opinion on it, I don't know for certain.  Just wanted to make sure you understand that. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>guice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wolf Form doesn't effect your faction what so ever. The TrueSpirit faction is only based on your class and actions. Race and Diety aren't put into consideration, thus why you can raise/lower faction, no matter your race or religion.<br />

PS: I did a few parts in Wolfy cause it was the only way I was save from guards, etc. :)</div></div><hr />
