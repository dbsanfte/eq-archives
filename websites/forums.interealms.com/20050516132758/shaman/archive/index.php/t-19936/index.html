A LOT of TS combines are FUBARED right now. To include Xegony and 8th Shawl. <br />
<br />
To paraphrase Zorlac - &quot;I'm not sure how Sony' crack team of coding monkeys fixing the 1017 problems resulted in breakages in unrelated code - but they found a way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Folks - when you can't combine the pieces to your Epic - there's a problem in the gubbins. (For you Warhammer 40k fans)<br />
<br />
It's like taking your car to the repair shop to fix your muffler and coming home you find your brake lights don't work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well we tried doing a pick up raid on agnarr today and the whole thing got fubared because on the second level portals couldn't be blasted.  Made for a pretty disheartening ending to a raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rehunh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">lol surely you did not think that breakign things as a result of fixing other unrelated things was a thing of the past??? I remember when it seemed like anytime they tried fixing something it would break the boats all over the world.</div></div><hr />

You'll be happy to know that Agnarr's portals are still the same. Just be ready for fast dps and some serious cc on 2nd level.</div></div><hr />

Can you explain what you mean Lor, as I have been on 2 Agnarr attempts where this &quot;bug&quot; has made the portals immune to any nukes.</div></div><hr />
