<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ArminiusXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I dont quite understand the slot details, but I know it has to do with stacking. They seemed to have switched the slots that the dex component on infusion. Hopefully that is what was causing it not to stack with focus. Most likely though it was stacking issues with a bst spell....never hurts to hope</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hopefully they adress the more important aspects of infusion and fix the stacking with enchanter haste spells.  Really could care less if it stacked with focus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As I read it on Lucy, Infusion of Spirit has changed such that it will now stack with the Speed of Vallon / Visions of Grandeur line (on Test).  It will not stack with Focus due to Strength and Dexterity.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Arisai/Miser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">doesnt stack with yaulp either,  on live at least</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">currently infusion stacks with single srt and dex i though.  that is why bl pass on fucus but want the individual buffs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Haven't seen a BST pass up a focus yet. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">BL's getting picky with buffs.  Thats the last thing they need.  I wont be doing single buffs of str and dex over focus anytime soon.  I dont care how much more of an edge that gives them.  As it is BL's have agro issues, why promote it.  I like to cast Torpor on them when they start getting away with themselves. <br />
