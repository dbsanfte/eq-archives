<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So..who's got this nice +20 WIS shield yet and tell us about your trials and frustrations for the the quest? I am at 8 skulls myself and getting closer to moving on the Burning Priest in SD.<br />
<br />
<br />
I gotta say, though I am working on hp/ac mostly these days...+20 WIS beats the heck outta my Testament... Thought I get a lil kick seein it sparkle when I cast my old spells:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Anything would beat the heck out of your Testament.  <br />
<br />
A Charred Guardian Shield would be better and it sells for around 300 plat.  Not to mention a Clay Guardian Shield which sells for around 200.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Didn't start quest till I happened to have the priest drop.  Just went by there every now and again till I caught him.<br />
<br />
  Did the skulls in one sitting, about 22 hours.<br />
<br />
  Got the charcoal through a /OOC while hunting them myself.<br />
<br />
  Got the brain on first kill, stayed for Sseru faction, got 2 more dropped in short time.<br />
<br />
  Kills were simple, and SWEET exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So sticking with the ac/hp path...lose the 10 WIS for the boost of 10-25 AC? Guess I should...just hate getting rid of my Testament, but it is a youngster's item..right now got that and Spirit Tome in primary, swapping out with some spear that procs stun when meleeing, which is very very seldom. My melee skills are soooo bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, even if you just swapped out for a CGS, you'd lose ONE wisdom and gain TEN AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Holdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The quest wasn't so bad except for the Burning Priest.  I camped him off and on for a least a week and a half(est 35hrs) before I got him to spawn.  I am sure people got him to spawn while I wasn't there, but still takes forever.  The camp is a good exp spot but it is pretty damn camped anymore.  I have heard people having horror stories with trying to get the charcoal to drop in ME, but I got one in like 5 mins..heh  Anyway it is a nice shield, though I sold mine for a Bone Braced Buckler and a JBB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My experiences:<br />
<br />
Started off doing the 8 skulls camp.  It was not that bad, though I spread it over about 2 weeks.  75% of the time when I showed up (from another zone or when logging back in) the camp near Katta was open.  Seems like I average 1 skull every 45 minutes to an hour.<br />
<br />
The thought leech brain was not that hard to obtain.  I went with a paladin friend and killed in the thought leech caves for about an hour.  I got the brain after about 5 minutes but the exp was nice so we stayed.  I think I saw a few others drop afterwards so these are very common.<br />
<br />
Black flame charcoal was horrendous.  I camped at the AR zone killing toilers and Xi Thall Centiens for hours and hours and hours.  I realize I should have gone and killed toilers at the lake but Maiden's Eye kills my weak computer so I found this spot was the safest given the amount of lag I got out in the open.  I've only seen the charcoal drop once and I killed lots of those little aliens.<br />
<br />
The burning priest I have never camped.  It was always camped and a guildmate has the amulet for MQ for me.  Problem is that he has been online once in the last 4 weeks so I haven't been able to do the MQ yet.  I have done every turn in fight up until the last one which requires the amulet.<br />
<br />
For the 8 skull turn in we had 55 shaman (me), 59 shaman, 59 cleric, 60 enchanter, 58 warrior, and 58 wizard.  It was easy and actually fun.  We did it twice and both times it was pretty flawless.  Killed the courier on the red carpet out in the main hallway of the big castle or whatever it is.<br />
<br />
Same group did the turn in fight in Grimling Forest also and it was easy as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Boraman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I got the charcol while xping on toilers in ME and it prompted me to start the quest.   The &quot;brain&quot; took maybe 20minutes.  Burning priest I got on the second spawn after I got the camp, although it took me a week before I found it uncamped.  <br />
<br />
I'm doing the skulls now and I have 1 skull after about 5 hours.  <br />
<br />
Anyone think the 8 skull turnin part can be done with a 60 shaman, 60 ranger and 50 monk?   My idea was to have the monk kill the courier then fd, when the skellies spawn the ranger harmonies them and single pulls each in turn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Had a pair of wizzies along when I did the skelle kills, and an enchanter to mezz stuff, a warrior, cleric, me (sham) and a monk (ended up as 1 group + 1 wizzie who was passing through and bored).<br />
<br />
  One of the wizzies AEd at one point and aggro'd the guards, had a nice fun run to the zone by herself.   But all the skelle's dropped like flies.  We did it a second time later on that night (called away for a raid after first), only one group this time, still went very easy.   Ench ran around mezzing, I ran around slowing, dog beat on mobs, cleric healed ench like mad, and everyone else pretty much killed a random mob solo.<br />
<br />
<br />
  I was only 52 or 53 at the time, and got at least 2 blue off the 8 kills if I recal properly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>darkforest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I got my charcoal in less than an hour brain in 15 minutes and amulet off first priest kill, however 30 or so hours of on and off camping for the skulls was kind of rough but well worth the investment. <br />
Darkforest <br />
55 shaman<br />
e-marr</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Agendon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I had tons of luck with this Quest i guess.<br />
<br />
I decided to start it when i helped someone kill the BP and won the roll on the amu.<br />
<br />
After 6 h i had all the skulls.<br />
<br />
15min for the Brain.<br />
<br />
Charcoal Mqed a friend with me.<br />
<br />
So i got all the stuff i needed in one day and did the kills the next day.<br />
<br />
The 8 Skeletons were easy...2 AEs and they were gone (Had a 60 Mage with me)! What was much harder are those 4 Mobs after the first turn in...we didnt except em to be so hard but it wasnt a problem with 60Cleric/Mage/Chanter 55Shammy/me) and a 52 Ranger!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Finished the quest earlier this week.<br />
<br />
Took myself (56 shaman), a 60 warrior, 48 monk, and low 50s necro to Grimling for the last fight.  The necro had the amulet for me to MQ.<br />
<br />
I didn't read up too much on the shaman NPC that spawned but asked a few people for advice.  Basically they said it wasn't that difficult of a fight and that I should be able to land spells on him easily.<br />
<br />
Well when he spawned I tried to hit him with the MR debuff and he resisted it 2 times.  I gave up and then hit him with slow first try.<br />
<br />
I healed the warrior twice when he got to about 70% health, and the monk was slowed at one point.  Other than that it was very straightforward.<br />
<br />
I sold the shield for 20k and a CC Shield because I'd rather have a Bone Braced Buckler whenever I can find one for sale.</div></div><hr />
