<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dabus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a 55 Shammy on the FV server. I am tryign to get a piece for my epic off the Spectral Courier. Go thim once but he didn't drop what I needed. <br />
<br />
He is 20 levels lower than me and I do get the message that he is trivial. Does this mean that he will not drop the 'no drop' epic piece at all?<br />
<br />
I have already spent hours doing this bloody bit, just to get the mob to spawn.. I could be here a lot longer if I can't figure this out!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't think trivial loot code is applied for our Epic. I got this drop near your level, but I wasn't on FV. Might be different</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kongwu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The part does indeed TLC on FV, the simple way around this is just to form a raid with another player ( other player doesnt even have to be in the same zone as you so you can form the raid before even going to CoM, with a friend, a bazaar mule... well you get the picture... )<br />
<br />
As long as you stay raided ( remember to have loot rights btw  ;)  ) nothing at all will TLC, even if you would kill a lvl 1 mob</div></div><hr />

I can't believe that this is true!  But if you are getting the message he is trivial, then well he is on the TLC.  If you feel this is a bug you should report it.  If not then you will have to do the 2 person raid thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I had thought that all epic pieces on FV were excluded from the TLC code in the same way they are excluded from the NODROP code?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Nope.  I know for a fact that some of the beginning steps of the Paladin epic are a PITA due to the TLC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From what I remember of FV, epic quest drops are either tagged as magic/lore or no-drop.  Some epics parts like the Pally and Monk are mostly magic and are effected by the TLC code, others like the Druid's epic parts are tagged no-drop [not effected by TLC]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thumbalina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I am not sure about FV server but the Courier doesnt always drop the piece.  I was doing that part of my epic at lvl 62 and I had to kill 3 couriers before the Student's log actually dropped.  The first 2 just dropped junk.....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Epic pieces are not affected by trivial loot code.  I did mine at level 60 on FV and had no problems.  If you get the message that he is trivial, he's probably dropping something else that is magic and not epic related.<br />
<br />
Also, for anything else, you can form a raid with at least one other person, and anything becomes lootable.  If it weren't for this feature, FV would have been a lot less attractive to me.<br />
<br />
Only big bummer on the server IMO is the fact that the market is screwed thanks to the sellability of nearly everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Balthag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">None of the shaman epic pieces trivial on FV. Thank god.<br />
Some of the other class epic drops never had the exclusions added, but the shaman class is fine.</div></div><hr />
