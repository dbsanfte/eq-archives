<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gothmog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">One of the recent changes on the Test Server has been greatly increasing the exp received by a post-50 player who kills an even con or higher mob, the rationale being that the greater risk should net a greater reward.<br />
<br />
I think that if anyone can make this into a viable exping tactic, it's the shaman.   Personally, it's also the type of fight I prefer.  I'd love to be able to engage in a long, difficult fight that leaves me at 0% mana and 20 health to gain half a blue bubble instead of having to mow down half a dozen blue mobs.<br />
<br />
So, I'm starting a list of white-con or above mobs that shaman have a crack at, along with some minor details.  I don't have much so far, so I'd appreciate any contributions.<br />
<br />
<br />
60th:<br />
Emperor Chottal - Level 60 NPC in Sebilis crypts.  Hits for high 100s, casts often.  Fairly standard fight, slow, burn him down with epic, jbb, and DoTs, while keeping up health with Torpor.  Keep resists up so his spells just bounce off.<br />
<br />
Stomples - Rabbit in PoM.  32k hp, can triple for 350, need more details.<br />
<br />
A Vigilium Cohortis, A Lictor of the Heart(plus various other SSeru mobs) - Duel wielding warrior and paladin respectively.  Need more info on these.<br />
<br />
There are some other mobs I know that are soloable at 60, although I'm not sure of the level.  Are any of the soloable Umbral Plains named, Cliff Golems, etc.  For that matter, anyone know of any decent camps where a well equipped shaman(epic, jbb, horse, full spellbook) can take on an even con or above mob?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>hartmut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">for killer exp go solo in cazicthule   1/2 blur to 2/3  AA exp blue per kill , depending on mobs level ...<br />
i need approx 3 hours in CT for one AA point when soloing   ;)  and some nice loot dropping too. <br />
<br />
killing level 60 mobs makes not that much sense, since most of them have +32k hitpoints , which makes most fights just very long , but not a great exp camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think you'd be better off looking at what even con's a 60 melee and you could duo, if considering this as a viable alternative to 'blue' xp. (Duo G-wurms in Skyfire may be viable etc)<br />
<br />
Also, most 60+ mobs have LONG spawn times, ok well emp is ~26mins, and even then you may get PH etc, so finding a supply of 'even' xp mobs will be a task.<br />
<br />
It would have to be a BIG xp bonus to make it viable over chain processing low-end dark blue mobs...<br />
<br />
Also for the sub 60 brigade: do you see a well equipped shaman with Toys soloing a Jugg for example? Didnt think so, although some of the melee bosses in chardok are doable at high 50's if you get em solo (AG, Capt di'zok, BK area etc). <br />
<br />
I think a lot of 'big game' soloing is tied to Torpor/Malo though to make this viable...feel free to prove me wrong ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Stomples is a level 60 rabbit, kos to all, triggered after you kill Sniffles, a level 1 rabbit who dies in one jbb shot.<br />
<br />
He doubles for 350, and I'd place his hp at around 15-20k.<br />
<br />
I soloed him btw, but not something I'd wanna repeat again, certainly not a good source of exp unless he gives you one full AA.<br />
That and he's on a like 1 day timer.<br />

<br />
Oh, I had kei and aego too, cheated a little heh.<br />
<br />
Theres also another easy level 60 mob, dont remember his name, but it's a human monk in DSP.  Don't know a single detail, except that I saw another oracle wack him down as I was making my way to ME.<br />
<br />
Ancient wurm in SF also doable I think, but ya need a tracker, and he takes about a day to respawn too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tienen Crazywolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Grogbat, a shaman has solod a jugg before ;) I think it was Tugg if I'm not mistaken, was ages ago though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You can solo Shiknar warriors in fungus grove easily, provided you have torpor. They are level 60, less than 32000 hp I believe, more like 20 k or so. They hit for max about 183, and are pretty easy to slow with malo in.<br />
<br />
They have very low agro range, so can pull them from the other shiknar warriors without agro, unless Warlord_Tk`kik`tthik is up. Can pull single then too if you watch when the  Warlord starts casting. Be sure to root them before they run though.<br />
<br />
These are the easiest level 60 mobs I know of, but sucks to loose the faction if you like to hunt in the back part of Fungus Grove.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Grogbat, a shaman has solod a jugg before  <br />
<br />
He said pre-60.  Juggs aren't hard to kill, but good luck doing it without Torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I know a zone where a 51 shaman could solo reds.  Maiden's Eye is the zone and the reason is that almost nothing summons.  So assuming the shaman could land Malosi on the mob thus dropping its resists down, stick Turgurs to ensure the mob aint gonna kill him if it catches him, and then just root and rot till the mob dies.  Would still be a pretty long fight I bet at that level, but certainly possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gothmog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It seems to me that increasing the amount of exp even+ mobs give is a step towards sharing exp between multiple groups in a raid.  If that happens, I expect the exp boost to those mobs to be fairly significant.  Even if it isn't more efficient that killing lots of blues, as long as it's somewhat competitive I'll be happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Slight derailment:<br />
<br />
Will this change the way your exp group hunts?<br />
<br />
I know that even with a full 6 person group, most people tend to pull nothing but blues.  blue after blue after blue...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">hmm, I'm thinking the reason white+ cons will give more exp is because they are also planning on implementing raid exp (where everyone one a raid gets exp from a kill).<br />
<br />
Maybe?<br />
<br />
On topic though, a lot of the level 60 mobs in Seru courtyard area are very easy for being level 60. Me and a 60 war duo'd a few of them with no problem. I think it'd still be a tough solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Landragoran, it's crazy hard to solo in ME at 53 (As in have to run 5 out of 6 times). Without Fungi, Epic, JBB, and KEI, I don't see a 51 soloing there and it would be risky even then. Heck you have to consider that mana regen is lower also because at 51 you don't even have regrow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">personally i dont even bother soloing in ME. i notice that most of the mobs have high HP for the lvl they are, and they hit pritty hard too.  then again i am a 60 shaman without  a horse, epic, fungi, or torpor.  i know in the mid 50s you can get a more than the average resists in ME even with malisini in.  then again, some of the loot in ME is fantastic for players in non uber guilds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Toilers arent that bad ya know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm not sure about at 51 or 53 but at 54 I soloed in ME fairly easily and got great experience.  I killed mostly gorango followers, gatherers and lookouts which were blue to me at 54.  But I also killed quite a few goranga hunters which were yellow and red to me.  They were at least 7 or 8 minute fights but if I can do it any shaman can.  I have pretty horrid gear for 54.  No fungi, epic or jbb, 180 wisdom, 2000 hps, 900 ac self buffed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">See? Thanks Barliman you proved my point.  If this change goes live the best place for a low to mid 50's shaman to hunt is in ME.  <br />
Wish I could find an even con that wouldn't rip me a new one or just take forever and a day to kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">7 min fight for a white i doubt it's profitable ,specially if he's low mana after the fight</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">ME for a level 53 or so wouldn't work well, as the adds come like nobody's business.  And Seb Emperor?  I'd like to see a Shammy solo him, as you need a rogue to get you into and out of the room in the first place and when he gets low HP's he gates back to his spawn point and summons you to your death by his guards.  A regular group can't kill him unless they have a stunner, a solo shammy would only solo him as a great way to suicide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Heh, my friend Coner (60 Shaman) has soloed the emporer, and Ive duo'd/trio'd him a few times with non stun classes, just fight him outside his room (push him into torch by the door in blood room) he won't gate as is too near to his spawn point.<br />
<br />
I'm going to try it next time I have a crypt group, just camp in blood room fully buffed, fm/fh with ITU up and pet/gate memmed ;)</div></div><hr />
