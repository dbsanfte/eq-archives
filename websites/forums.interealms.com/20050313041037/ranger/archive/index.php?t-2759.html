<br />
<br />
Just as a starter though, here are what I consider the basic necessities to work for if you are just starting out:<br />
<br />
Jewlrey:<br />
- 2 Blue Diamond Electrum Earrings<br />
- 2 Velium Blue Diamond Bracelets<br />
- 2 Velium Diamond Rings<br />
<br />
If you are L55+ and have Tunare as your diety: Helm of the Tracker<br />
Otherwise: Crown of the Froglok Kings<br />
<br />
Miscellaneous:<br />
- Shrouded Medalion (drops in ME) or DTC (Skyshrine quest)<br />
- Runed Bone Fork<br />
<br />
Also, if you don't have your epics already - start working on them. Each sword will give you +5 to all. (That's +10 everything when you get both.)<br />
<br />
<br />
When your resistances get higher and you get higher in level, swap the Runed Bone Fork for a bow that either gives +HP or a resistance increase thus giving you archery options as well. (Wind Saber for example is +10SVC)</div></div><hr />
