<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sharookan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">At 49 i took the Stormwave camp. just when you step on the boat make a pet and pull with slow and JBB em to death. 1 to 2 % per kill, pretty nice loot *BDs, other gems, and meat for illusionn potions* Also the captain of the stormwave drops a nice charm with 5wis/int some mana and HP and spell haste 2.<br />
<br />
Right now im 52 and still get fast exp there, with new dots i kill pretty fast and can pull the lighthouse operators as well now. i went from 51 to 52 in 7 hours there, and had like 5 BDs and some other cash gems<br />
<br />
at 53 i suggest heading to the Hungry shark Inn or take the next Boat, Dirulia.<br />
<br />
Im pretty sure you can get to 60 in Dulak as the Luggalds in the hidden caves are DB to my 63 Necro and give 1 % exp in 2 or 3 kills. Its not UBA exp but a nice solo spot with a chance on good loot. Soulstripper, various Charms, Haste Earring and a damn nice 1hp regen ring with WIS / INT / STA / mana / HP on it. Definatley worth beeing there<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Velkorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dulak Harbor has been my home for several levels now.  After about level 56 or so, if you can't get the Dandolak boat or higher, you really need to head to the luggald caves.  At 58, the initial part of the cave system and first cave are light blue.  I am currently hunting in the crypt (right at the bridge and follow the stairs down and into the pool room).  Solo, I can usually handle the six spawns in the room, the roamer and one mob from the outer room.  Loot is minimal (luggald flesh, weapons and an occasional gem) and exp is so-so (doing 100% AA atm).  Everything is dark blue at 58, but has a lot of HP. The main advantage of this place is that there is no competition.  I can go here, exp for a few hours and leave and never worry about it being camped.  There are typically only 10-20 people in the whole zone on my server.  Nice quiet spot.  The next cave in is also dark blue to me, but mobs have about 50% more HP than the ones in the crypt, so I am assuming they are significantly higher in level.  I assume that the final cave is probably dark blue to a 65, but never tested it myself.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye, dulak's is the place to be.  I can take most of the stormwave spawn at 50 including the two dock spawns.  Stormwave is tough to get most of the time though.  Other spots in dulak include the corner near the first dock where most shaman camp to get the flask for the stoicism spell.  Also, near Oceancrasher, there are two ladders that hang down from above.  Camp between them and kill the gnome behind you first.  Then the oceancrasher in the middle, then the two near the dock entrance.  Then just random stuff until respawn.  Be sure to keep the gnome clear because that's the way fleeing mobs path.</div></div><hr />
