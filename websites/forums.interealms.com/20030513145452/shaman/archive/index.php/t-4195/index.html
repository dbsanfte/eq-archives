<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mitrian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all!<br />
<br />
Share your best dueling stories!<br />
<br />
I've been looking for some class-specific dueling methods for shaman.  I've seen some information on these boards for dueling necros, but I'm curious about what you have found to be successful against other classes as well.  My toughest competitors have been Bards (#1), Epic Magicians (#2) and Paladins (#3).  Strangely enough, I've never dueled a fellow shaman.<br />
<br />
 - Bards are usually more resistant, and can both kite and melee better than I.<br />
 - Epic Mages have... epic pets who are now more resistant.<br />
 - And Paladins... just piss me off!  Melee classes shouldn't be allowed to Stun and CH!<br />
<br />
And any other class-specific tactics you've used successfully.  For that matter, any general dueling suggestions are welcome!<br />
<br />
Thanks all!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Pronigious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm an anti-pk on Rallos Zek... So I hope I can shed some light on this for you.<br />
<br />
You were asking specifically about Bards, Epic mages, and Pallys<br />
<br />
Ok, Pallys are a LOT easier than SKs, but also are dueled in a similar manner... and I duel a LOT of SKs so I'll start there:<br />
<br />
If you know your level difference, it makes it easier, if you're higher level then a few checks will let you tailor the duel your way.  Its also of note that a prep duel, and an on the fly duel, are two very different things.. because you're on a bluebie I'll assume this will be a prep duel.<br />
<br />
OK you need your test spell.  (you're sixty so ...I assume you don't have Malo, Malo should mean instant win...) I use slow for this, cause if it sticks game over.  Some people go PR and DR against a Shaman, they make me happy.  Try our test spell twice (blinding luminance is another great test spell) if it doesn't stick, they have higher MR, and you need to Debuff it or Kite.  Many times kiting isn't a possibility, and I avoid it at all costs.  If slow sticks, you can go to the tank plan.<br />
<br />
prep: vs a Pally keep your MR at or above 120, that should neutralize *most* roots and stuns (on you and your pet)<br />
<br />
Tank Plan:<br />
Circle of Death and Blind.  Blind your opponent, then start going around him in a circle, keep pet on him, but stay still as possible only move when he moves to hit you, keep blind on him (blind has a short casting time) Stack DoTs but don't nuke right away, keeping him blind should make it VERY hard to use LoH effectivly, if he doesn't use it, great, if he does, only after that start nuking, and nuking hard.  If slow sticks, but blind doesn't, don't panic, try and back yourself into a corner (this is drastically reduce his ability to interrupt your casting) and Stick it out with DoT stacking.  IF you're sixty, just use torpor, and let your pet wail away, if you're not, use your best heal (and quickest, Chloroblast is better than Sup Heal in most cases) when you get around 50%, the idea is to make him think you have a million hps and you're not gonna die anytime soon that usually makes the dueler make mistakes.  DONT run around.  That's the fastest way for you to die.  Shamans have great melee skills... but running around is asking him to joust you... and in the tank plan, that's just a bad idea.  Other spells you want up: Incapacitate/Cripple (in the right circumstances this is a snare) highest level malaise you have.  4 DoTs should be about right with this set up. Whatever 4 are your best.  For the most part... Nullify Magic (or better) is gonna be a waste of a slot.  At best, it will remove some HP buffs... this tacktic works for pretty much any Pally vs shaman fight 39+  You want a high damage weapon, and high AC HP in this fight as well.  Delay is secondary to Damage (harder hits will interrupt his casting moreso that faster hits)<br />
<br />
If you can't land slow... you're gonna have to &quot;kite&quot;<br />
<br />
Kite plan:<br />
Shamans can't kite.  We don't have snare (unless you're an inny shaman.. but if you can't land slow you're prolly not gonna land a cling) So in this plan, the idea is high DPS.  Blinding luminance usually is resisted less than slow (or if you have the 25% disease slow use it, though I don't think you can tank with it very well)  so try and keep it on him, but don't expect too.  Malaise if you can, and Nullify magic is necessary (HP buffs need to be gone before LoH happens) Keep moving, he's gonna try and strip your buffs... so SoW Boots are a definate boon.  if you can stick incapacitate/cripple, that should slow him down a bit.  the idea is to move unpredictably, and strafe a lot.  (hold down ctrl while walking) If hes using a High delay weapon, time his attacks, and learn to walk behind him after he swings then back up immideatly while hes turning to look for you.  DONT get caught in a corner for this fight, your HP will be precious cause you'll mostly be nuking.  Try to hold off on it as much as possible though, cause DoTs will be key, and he will hit you... a lot.  The more time he spends on your pet the better... and keeping a fang amulet of calling on you(insta cast pet) Or keeping your pet spell on your bar (good luck on getting off, but I've done it a few times, high delay and a few misses does wonders) Another marvel of pvp items is Ivandyrs hoop... something about an 1600 point life swing that can REALLY change the course of a fight (-800 point from him, +800 points to you if you drop all six charges at once - they are insta cast)  I won't go into potions here either, a shaman stocked with potions of the right kinds should never loose a duel IMO.  This battle is gonna be a finnese battle on your part, at avoiding being hit (and I don't mean being missed or dodged)  Force him to joust you, but be better at it.  Keep a quick weapon for this... and try and kite him by sticking close, if you can be out of sight and wacking him really fast, its gonna make him freak out.<br />
<br />
In all cases pvping from 3rd person is better.  You have SUCH a big advantage if you can do this.  I can't... unfortunatly ;-)  and also in all cases poison DDs are better than your cold.  Even with high reists they are resisted less often then their cold counterparts.<br />
<br />
Now keep in mind, I'm speaking about this from a luxury stand point, I've lost one duel when prep time was allowed... and the person who killed me died 20 sec after me to DoT damamge cause he couldn't bind wound fast enough.  If you're on PvP its a whole different ball game, and often times you can't afford to have spells like blind and cripple on your bar, and you'll have to make do without.  And sometimes, you just have to run :-)<br />
<br />
in my pvp gear (all no drop) I have ~800ac and 170wis ~50sv all unbuffed... which goes to around 875ac 175wis and 90sv all with the buffs I get up.  I also have healing focus from med blanket, and extended range from supple scale armband, both of which are a tremendous help.  I'm also only level 48, no epic, no planar.  Which may add a different perspective.<br />

-btw For duels... in primary, I recommend a Paw till you're 80mana, then switching to either a shaded staff (5svall except -5sv fire, 10/22 1HB) or a mortificator staff (7/21 proc:stun)  for quick weapons, they are both cheap and have very nice points to them... with dex at around 180, and haste item (I use belt of the grimling skullcracker solo camp at 46) and haste spell... you can do a nice job of keeping someone stunned if there MR is below 75.  Shaded staff is nice for resists, and the ratio is nice as well.  For a high damage weapon... heh... if you're doing kiting, I sometimes reccomend going with a Poison Wind Sensor and high PR gear, great dmg dly, and the proc can be devastating; Full suit of gnome skin and some PR jewlery (your stuff can't get stolen so you might know better) would be some good... can't use a pet though.  Or else, I'm using a hammer of rage (30/46 proc yaulp) and there is a 2HB from UP that would be REALLY nice (78/94 with stats)<br />
<br />
I'll cover Mage and Bard later ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Pronigious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've dueled a lot of mages too.  I think the bigest difference you'd find with dueling one is merely the sheer power of the pet.  One of the first things you learn when you start to PvP is ignore pets.  Killing a pet nets you nothing except wasted mana, its far better to eliminate the caster as quickly as possible.<br />
<br />
Prep: OK, obviously you want resists, But honestly they won't help you a whole lot.  A pet is pretty much a waste, but if you have a lot of prep time summon it, if you're lucky it will stun the mage and interrupt a few spells before it gets eaten my damage shields or the mages pet.  If I have to prep in a few minutes cause a pk is coming, or I'm hunting on... I don't bother.  Second:  If you have good preptime: Cast the following spells on you before you buff: inner fire, insidious decay, sicken.  Then buff as normal.  Cure sicken and insidious decay, and remove inner fire.  You will need to be free to use null on yourself.  Malo will kill you, any version of that stick will kill you.  MR 120+ should stop the resistable versions.  FR as high as you can get it would be nice too.<br />
<br />
This battle is about dealing a small amount of damage, usually subtract 30% of your unbuffed HP, that's how much you have to take care of.  That's not a whole lot... living to deal it is the tricky part.<br />
<br />
Nully first, about 2 times.  Then Blind.  If it sticks, you've almost won.  Try to root pet, it won't work unless you're REALLY lucky, but the extra few secs could make a difference, if it didn't stick, malo/ect the mage, then root the pet.  Keep blind on him if you can.  OK, heres where I'll tailor this for a bluebie Pvp, for the most part, in a duel like this you're not gonna be using see invis stuff, neither will the opponent.  So keep invis up, or have invis potions.  This will remove you from target, and coupled with blind should mean no DDs on you.  Mage DDs (the good ones) are semi-unreliable anyway (unless you're in an arena... ) terrain can let you avoid most of them.  IF the pet is still, drop DoTs, 2 or 3 should be enough... then just invis, and blind, invis and blind.  DoTs work around and Damage shield spells they might have (it ignores it)  and null should remove the shielding series.  Mage DDs have a 7sec casting time.  remember this, and time spells accordingly.  figure out early if they are using DDs or LoSs.  DDs you should be able to keep ahead of with heals, LoSs its luck of the draw.  Don't sick your pet on theirs, and if they didn't use their air pet, lucky you.  after your DoTs stick, survive for two mins and you win.  Remember pet uses the better of the two resists when it checks for them.  Mages pets aren't known for high magic resist (although it should be noted, you won't Ice DD the water pet, you won't disease the Earth pet, and you won't poison DD the air pet... just not gonna happen and if you're using burst of flame on the fire pet... just don't do that LOL), though mages can get them pretty high, so in order to root park the pet, you'll have to (unless the mage has a really low MR) Malo, and Nullify the mages MR down to around 40.  Root should stick then if you are close in level.<br />
<br />
Slowing the pet:  this is a topic of much debate.  My typical set up vs a mage is gonna be, Heal, Can, Null, invis, Root, Malaise, poison dot, disease dot.  This isn't gonna let me have a slot for slow.  I prefer root because its cheaper, a faster cast, and it solves the problem, I dont' get interrupted if I'm not getting hit.  (suposedly its possible to even position yourself so the mages LOS spells bounce of the pet, I have yet to see this)  You *could* alternatly substitue slow for root, and just tank the pet.  I don't advise this... but that's your call.  It is possible to change spells durring a fight, especially with the new ui is this more and more a possibility.  If you plan on doing this know your spell book, getting caught while you're on the ground can be bad news.<br />
<br />
Gear:  Resist Gear.  FR, and MR, get them HIGH MR around 120 min, and FR as high as possible.  then go for HP to survive the nukes, then go for AC.  A large mana pool in any duel is a boon; as medding is usually not a luxury you can afford.  In this Duel, dual wielding star ruby encrusted stiens (if you don't have better) would not be ill advised.  But, a high damage 2HB could turn the tide if something goes ugly.<br />

Next: and most difficult, The Bard</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Assuming lvl60 with decent gear:<br />
<br />
Epic mage: <br />
Blinding luminance on his pet, keep it blinded all the time. Annuling it once or twice can sometimes be a good idea to get rid of haste/speed buffs and possible mr buffs from other players.<br />
<br />
With pet out of the way, deal with the mage like you would a wizard. Difference is that the mage cant run away (shadowstep) and his nukes arent unresistable.<br />
<br />
Mage is usually the easiest class to kill as a shaman.<br />
<br />
Paladin:<br />
Difficult, if not even impossible to kill. His heals are better than yours, he can cure your dots using spells or potions. You wont interupt his casting either. With LoH you really have to kill him twice. If you manage to kill a paladin he was either ebay material or had the lousiest resists in history.<br />
<br />
Bard:<br />
Most unbalanced pvp class. Twisting Ervajs comp, dd song and selos you are dealing with an opponent who runs twice as fast as you, can melee decently, makes your casting difficult because of the dd song pushback and drains 350mana every 3 ticks. If you are still alive after 2minutes you are running and totally oom.<br />
<br />
The only times i have ever killed a bard in pvp was against those with inferior resists, where i could land root/blind after sticking both tashproc and malo on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I hate pvp'ing against bards. They are the hardest class to fight imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sevenkilts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I wouldn't be too sure about the Shadow Knights Mitrian. I duelled Alarik of my guild lately as well as Soulz from Avatars of Honour. Alarik went nice. I kept him blind and nuked him to death with cold based. But Soulz was OUCH since I didnt have blind up. I had of course Malo on both first. But I couldnt get a single dot on them.  So my new policy is, Malo, Blind and then go Rabid and beat them senseless. That seems to work best ;-)<br />
<br />
P.S.: Both are of course lvl 60 where Soulz gear is about at Thurgadin armor level while Alarik is in NTOV gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Very nice info. <br />
<br />
What about necros?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Necro is one of those classes that has the potential to totally suck or be extremely lethal. It all depends on the person playing it.<br />
<br />
I posted a rather lengthy pvp guide (from a lvl55 shaman vs lvl54 necro perspective) some time ago, but I cant find it now.<br />
<br />
In summary, pvp vs a necro will usually NOT involve any pets since both parties are going to be very dependant on annul magic.  All disps poof pets because of Verants sloppy coding.<br />
<br />
Necro is going to rely on almost unresistable dots (which you can dispell) and lifetaps. He has hp gain from vexing and taps, as well as resist cold/disease, dmf and invuln as his defensive strengths.<br />
<br />
As a shaman you can use poison, disease and melee as your offense. Usually you wont have enough spell slots to attack using both. Defensively you can disp most of his dots and heal/torpor yourself. <br />
<br />
In a nutshell its a game of bufflist control. Whoever looses it will run oom and die. This is where the smart necro will totally steamroll 99% of all shaman, but the ill-played necro will most likely be a cakewalk to kill.<br />
<br />
The smart necro will use stat drains like siphon strength and shadow vortex to mess up your bufflist, and then stack dots deep that you cant reach with your disps without clicking away all your buffs. Sprinkle in lifetaps and you are doomed.<br />
<br />
As a shaman you need to know what his spells are, their cast time and their particle graphics. You usually have to be casting annul magic on yourself even before the necros spells have landed. If you start afterward it may be too late. You also have to maintain a fanatically strict control over your bufflist. Keep slots free for incoming dots, but do NOT allow his stat drains to land in the top slots. You want these as far back as possible. To accomplish this you will need at the very least two instacast items. I suggest at least four.<br />
<br />
If i were to go up against a well played necro in pvp, both without pets, i would engage him in melee first of all. When he starts to cast i would check my bufflist and the particle effects of his spell (im still meleeing and slamming him). Is it a dot or stat drain? If dot then let it land at top of bufflist. If stat drain then at end of bufflist. If unsure, assume it is a stat drain for 1.5 seconds, after which you KNOW it is a dot. Clear buffslots accordingly.<br />
<br />
I strongly suggest using the new UI, as it allows you to click away buffs while you are casting.<br />
<br />
Anyway, dispell if he dotted you. If it was stat drains then continue meleeing him. Toss in a malo or ID if you feel lucky. When you get some time left over from the disps, try a bane or pox. The smart necro will have stacked shielding above dmf, which means malo will not overwrite dmf and make him safe from poison attacks. Which is why i almost never use poison dots on such a necro. You can see if your malo overwrote dmf when the necro drops to the ground. <br />
<br />
If you have a j-mans tash stick, try to proc that and then malo him, followed by blind (and root and cripple). Then epic and lay into him with your hasted melee. Have a haste item. <br />
<br />
Most likely the necro will dispell malo 4 seconds after you landed it on him. Which is why melee damage, supported by disease attacks, is almost the only way to kill a necro. If the necro uses a shaman damage shield potion you are in for a very rough fight.<br />
<br />
The fight is going to proceed with you laying into him with melee/dispells, and him trying to stack as many dots as he possibly can, while at the same time tapping and messing with your bufflist to minimize your chances of dispelling his dots.<br />
<br />
Assuming both parties are equally skilled, the necro has a clear advantage. The shaman only needs to make one mistake and he is dead. The necro can always recoup using lifetaps/vexing and invuln.<br />
<br />
For anyone interested in this type of fight, i suggest you duel your necro buddies over and over and over again. Every time you will be amazed by how many different strategies and counterstrategies there are, and every time you will become much more skilled.<br />
<br />
Have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks for the info Asta,  couple more questions / clarifications:<br />
<br />
If I cast annul magic against an opponent, my pet will poof even if it's not attacking?  what if my pet is engaged vs his pet?  Or do you mean that MY pet will poof if I cast dispell magic on MYSELF?  I'm a bit confused on this point.<br />
<br />
Assuming he has a couple of open slots at the top of the buff list, <br />
if I chain dispell then my spells that I've already landed on him would be the first to be removed?  So If I want to remove DMF I gotta chain dispell before I cast any debuffs like malo, cripple, etc?<br />
<br />
Should I even bother to remove DMF?  or just Malo and hope that it drops DMF?<br />
<br />
I only have 1 instacast item (black fur boots) so any suggestions on another way to help control my bufflist?<br />
<br />
Do we have any ways to bury spells in his bufflist?  ie cast a few low level spells and then stack on the DoTs?  Maybe disease based and just pile on the counters? I dunno.<br />
<br />
This will be a friendly duel with a friend, so even if I lose I expect to learn a lot.  But I really don't want to lose - he's been getting quite cocky in /gu, saying he could beat anybody in the guild (except trueshot rangers).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If I cast annul magic against an opponent, my pet will poof even if it's not attacking?  what if my pet is engaged vs his pet?  Or do you mean that MY pet will poof if I cast dispell magic on MYSELF?  I'm a bit confused on this point.<br />
<br />
If you dispell someone whom your pet is agrod on, your pet will poof. Way back in time your pet would turn rogue, as annul is coded as a 'beneficial' spell and your pet would see you as helping out his target, and thus turn on you. So Verant introduced the patchwork sloppy 'poof' coding instead to prevent xp deaths from rogue pets. I am not sure on the pet vs pet issue. If I have a pet up and need to dispell I quickly back off the pet right before annul lands. Anulling yourself will never poof your pet.<br />
<br />
<br />
Assuming he has a couple of open slots at the top of the buff list, if I chain dispell then my spells that I've already landed on him would be the first to be removed?  So If I want to remove DMF I gotta chain dispell before I cast any debuffs like malo, cripple, etc?<br />
<br />
Whenever you cast a spell on him, assuming it isnt resisted, the spell will check whether it overwrites one of his current buffs. If it doesnt then it will land in the top-most slot available in his bufflist. Thats all there is to it. <br />
<br />
If you need to dispell him or not depends how he has stacked his buffs and if he has instacast items. Assuming he has two of them and knows how to use them, it is a total waste to even try dispelling him. Every dispell you cast will only eat his two instacasts.<br />
<br />
If he doesnt have instacast items, then yes by all means annul as many times as you can. <br />
<br />
Dont debuff him or epic him if you are going to dispell. Unless he has his bufflist filled at the top, in which case epicing him would be a good thing, since it would land at the end of his bufflist. If that happens you shouldnt annul him, let him do that himself.<br />
<br />
As you can see it gets a bit confusing. There are a couple of tricks to get to know how he has his bufflist stacked, but that would make this into a pvp book. <br />
<br />
<br />
Should I even bother to remove DMF?  or just Malo and hope that it drops DMF?<br />
<br />
Malo is nice since it overwrite the following spells: any type of fire resist buff, any spell in the shielding line and dmf.  If your target has more than once of such buffs, malo will overwrite the topmost of them. So it all depends how the necro has stacked his buffs. If you are lucky dmf will be above shielding. Most non-pvp active necros stack dmf above shielding because they think mr/hp is more important than levitate. <br />
<br />
Even if youre not going to use disease dots i would open up with insidious decay instead of malo. This will fill up any potential slots he has cleared at the top. This usually confuses people as they cant remove ID with normal annul. ID is also fast casting so you wont loose much time. <br />
<br />
THEN malo and epic him and lay into him with hasted melee/slams. If he drops down you know you got rid of dmf, and his poison resist will most likely be close to zero. Most necros dont carry much pr gear, confident that their dmf will save them ;). Bane him.<br />
<br />
If he dispells malo/epic you know that he will have had multiple open slots at the top of his bufflist. Then you answer with annuls. If he doesnt have instacasts just keep annuling, i'd say as many times as five or six.<br />
<br />
Remember that his spell Vexing mordinia gives him a healing buff icon, which you want to dispell.<br />
<br />
I only have 1 instacast item (black fur boots) so any suggestions on another way to help control my bufflist?<br />
<br />
Cheapest is the tinkered spyglass. Goes for about 250pp in the bazaar. Then i suggest the coldain ring.<br />
<br />
Do we have any ways to bury spells in his bufflist?  ie cast a few low level spells and then stack on the DoTs?  Maybe disease based and just pile on the counters? I dunno.<br />
<br />
Yup you got it. Insid decay, followed by as many disease dots as you want. The dmg on them isnt so important, what is paramount is that you totally confuse him and mess with his bufflist. I usually use ID and sicken, and if needed toss in an affliction. These are short in cast time but still last 2mins. The added advantage of this is that when you pox/plague him he has to remove all those other low lvl dots before being able to remove the big ones. Reapply ID and low lvl dots if he drinks potions... this way he will never get rid of plague/pox.<br />
<br />
This will be a friendly duel with a friend, so even if I lose I expect to learn a lot.  But I really don't want to lose - he's been getting quite cocky in /gu, saying he could beat anybody in the guild (except trueshot rangers). <br />
<br />
Necros are nasty, no doubt. Just stay cool and play it defensive, countering every move he makes. Watch the spell effects, watch your bufflist and annul like a madman. If he has a pet blind/root it. Sooner or later he will HAVE to dispell which means his pet poofs (as long as you keep it agro on you). <br />
<br />
Canna<br />
Annul<br />
ID<br />
pox/plague<br />
malo<br />
bane<br />
root<br />
blind<br />
<br />
are the spells i would have memmed. Buff up with everything, and keep top slot with sow, and then two empty ones. Unless he duels ALOT chances are very slim he is going to use stat drains to mess with your buff list.</div></div><hr />
