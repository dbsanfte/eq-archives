<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I finally got Yoppa's the night before the patch and was getting heals for a minimum of 2100+ (with healing AAs and focus) and up to about 2500.  Nice crits too of 4 to 5k.<br />
<br />
After the patch I was getting heals in the 1000 to 1300 range.  Not sure if all the heals were in that range but the ones I noticed were.  Anyone else noticing changes in Yoppa's or Tnarg's?  <br />
<br />
I did /bug it.</div></div><hr />

Is it possible you used an old &quot;spell set&quot; feature and memmed Tnarg's instead of Yoppas? I only ask because I used a spell set feature and memmed Can IV instead of the new OoW can and it took me several minutes longer than it should have to realize something was different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That would be my guess gloriana. I know I always end up updating saved sets for what seems like weeks after getting a new version of standard spells as I slowly use some of my less used saved sets. I didn't notice any changes with yoppa's since the patch but I wasn't particularly looking for them either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yoppa's was healing its normal amount for me last night.  I did have Malo memmed instead of Malos though...  Spellset error on my part. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Spellsets can be evil sometimes.  I actually had the issue in which I had Tnag's up instead of DM for the longest time.  One night I saw I was healing rather low, and I looked at the spell gem, Tnag's.  Boy, did I feel stupid spamming the night away saying, &quot;Casting Daulda's Mending on %T&quot; :P<br />
<br />
Leader AA, Spell Awareness is da bomb!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It was Yoppa's.  My first thought was I had the wrong spell so checked it.  It also wasn't a full heal that would have reduced the amount healed.  The ones I was trying to heal were still way low on HPs.  <br />
<br />
I've been sitting recasting Yoppa's today.  All the heals except 1 were in the correct range.  I had one heal for 1800 which is below what it should be for my AAs (I should get a min of ~2100).  Looks like it might be an RNG chance to heal for less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've had dot ticks that are less than the listed amount. (i.e. 310 / tick on Saryn when it's supposed to be 320.) I have both BA4 item and have Muse on me when I bot my bard. I've found that to be pretty strange as well. We should never have spells hit for the less than the listed amount.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I may be simplifying it too much, but there isn't a possibility that your heal was only healing the tank to full (or yourself), and you were seeing those numbers being reported back to yourself?  I could see that easily happening if someone else was helping heal but not announcing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It definitely was not a question of filling up HPs on someone.  They were low and died soon thereafter.  Since I also died soon after I was able to spend some time looking at my heal messages.  Out of the last 4 heals I did I got 3 in the 1000 to 1300 heal range.  I noticed during the fight because the HPs on the peeps hardly moved and Yoppa's usually shows some improvement.  Even Tnarg's would normally show greater healing than what I was seeing.  BTW, I was trying to keep rangers, chanters, etc alive during the cleric epic 1.5 fight in LFay.<br />
<br />
Yoppa's should never be less than 1750 unless fewer are needed for a complete heal.  My understanding is with my healing AAs Yoppa's should never be less than ~2100 and will often do more even without crits.<br />
<br />
While standing in PoT today healing myself over and over again I got 1 heal of ~1800.  Above the 1750 stated amount but supposedly below what I should get.  All the rest of the heals were in the range I would expect.<br />
<br />
This is why I think it is an RNG thing.  I think the chance of getting a lower heal is fairly small and it's easy to miss 1 bad heal in a fight.  I got &quot;lucky&quot; and hit 3 close together and it caught my attention.<br />
<br />
The other possibility is that my focus effect (Marr's Gift) and some AAs may be able to have a negative value.  So Yoppa's would be 2100 + or - focus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hmmm, have you tried repeating this bug without your focus item equipped?  I know that Paladin's epic effect is supposed to boost healing effectiveness...I wonder if one of the NPC's on that raid may have had an AE that decreased healing effectiveness?  Or...even worse, some focus effects are possibly screwed up :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">To follow up, I went to PoT and cast Yoppa's 100 times and got no unusual amounts.  Sigh.<br />
<br />
For you number people it broke down like this:<br />
<br />
I have HA3, HG3, AHA3, and AHG3 as well as Marr's Gift on elemental arms.  HPs were 5650 and dex was 278 during the test.  I would cast a heal when I was down to 700 to 1100 HPs to leave plenty of room for heals.<br />
<br />
Min reg heal:  2124<br />
Max regular heal:  2516<br />
Min crit heal:  4284<br />
Max crit heal:  5033<br />
<br />
Heal range (number in range)<br />
<br />
2124 - 2199  (20)<br />
2200 - 2299  (18)<br />
2300 - 2399 (27)<br />
2400 - 2499 (18)<br />
2500 - 2516 (1)<br />
crit heals  (16)<br />
<br />
Total    100<br />
<br />
Note:  For the crit heal amounts I'm using the amounts in the crit message even though the actual heal capped out at a bit less on a couple of the crits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Aren't there some curses/Dots that reduce the efficiency of heals? I think I remember something like that from GoD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not to throw this topic off course, but I was the main healer in a KT group the other day, and after a 4 hour run, killing around 100 mobs, I'm guessing I only got around 5 crit heals the entire time.  Now, I was having to throw Daluda's at least 3 times per fight, maybe as many as 5 times.  So that's at least 300 casts, maybe as high as 500...with only 5 crits all day.<br />
<br />
Having said all that, I never once healed for less than my full amount.<br />
<br />
It was isolated to that one day, though....since then, I've been critting normally (about 1 in 3 or 1 in 4).  I think there *is* something wrong with our healing, but it's like that sound your car makes that only happens when you're driving, and you can't repeat it for the mechanic....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">There are some spells that reduce healing efficiency and that might be involved in the LFay cleric event but I don't think so.  I did get a 1800 heal in PoTranq the next day when testing which is lower than it should be and definitiely did not have any spells on me that would do that.<br />
<br />
I've always thought my RNG was broken anyway.  When you /ran 789 and come up with a 0 you're supposed to win right?  Yeah, couldn't convince my group of that either but they laughed at me a lot.  =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'm wondering if there's a glich with the spell shielding deal. Might be working to reduce incoming damage and heals?<br />
<br />
I know kinda off the wall idea, but only outstanding thing I could think of.<br />
