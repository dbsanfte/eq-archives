<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I wanted to make an ogre shaman and use my 57 shaman to PL him. Will I still be able to cast lesser buffs on him and heal him with the new system?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Don't see why not.  Buffs below 50 should land as usual.  This is just a change, AFAIK, to group spells.  A wonderful bug fix :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yar, np buffin your alts with lvl 49 buffs and chloroblast still works on the newbies thats been uba shammy buffed P)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thats what I thought... thanks guys</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tobeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was wondering how this would affect spells like stoicism and torpor.  Does anyone on test have any idea on this one?  I guess technically, they are buffs, but of course they are also heals.  Just was wondering because I was planning on powerleveling my mage to duo with me in a month or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You've never been able to torpor someone under the level range (about 47), so no change.  And stoicism is under level 50, so it is not affected by the change either.<br />
<br />
Of course that's never applied to pets, so if you're PL'ing a mage, just keep the pet taking damage and healed and you can use whatever spells you want to heal it.  Even out of group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Torpor and Stoicism only work on people grouped with you, so they're not ideal for PLing. Still possible, but not ideal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">For a true lowbie, use these:<br />
<br />
   Harness of Spirit<br />
   Chloroplast<br />
   Alacrity<br />
   Spirit of Wolf<br />
<br />
Nothing else.  Those four will get him through to the 30's without much trouble, even without gear, and will give him a huge advantage even after that point.<br />
<br />
STA and AGI aren't worth buffing at that level.  You could consider giving Guardian but typically Chloro completely outheals most mobs below level 20 anyway, so what's the point in AC?</div></div><hr />
