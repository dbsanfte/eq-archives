<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chasim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Let me apologize in advance for this post... I know this kind isn't my favorite on my main char class board, but anyway, here goes...<br />
<br />
I have a level 24 shaman which I stopped playing a while back (enjoyed him, just not enough time).  I now have some RL friends with mid-20's characters and would like to play my shaman again.<br />
<br />
Just wondering if anyone has some good equipment tips (he's nekkid atm, 'cept for his snare necklace).  I've looked in the bazaar and see some nice AC, hp/stam, wis/mana items but I'm just wondering what are my &quot;best bets&quot; with around 12k to spend?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">ikky bp! (if you can wear it...I think its all shaman race usable but I'm not sure)<br />
<br />
You don't list race, but say snare necklace.  I think that means troll.<br />
<br />
Spider fur belt is pretty cheap and I think its all/all.<br />
<br />
There are several good and cheap 1hp weapons with wisdom available (all the different choices should be under 400p each,  probably under 300p each).   Buy one for range slot and one for primary hand.  <br />
<br />
Pick up a good 2hb weapon.  If you are a troll, you can't use a barb spiritist...so there's another choice of &quot;blight hammer of scourge&quot; or something like it.  I think it starts proc'ing at 30 or 35.<br />
<br />
I bought a artic wyvern mask for 15p the other day.<br />
<br />
Totemic helm is going for around 500p on my server (BB).<br />
<br />
Fill in remaining pieces with anything cheap :-)  You can get a pretty good AC for your level pretty cheaply.   Totemic, some Jaundiced Bone, and Rygor are all pretty cheap and decent for your level.   There's armor that drops in Karnor's that usually rots as its nodrop if you want to risk running over to there naked and trying to run to where its rotting.  I'd recommend prime time on a Friday night as most of the mobs should be cleared out of the way.  I'm assumign trolls can wear that armor but I'm not positive.  I think its called Jarsath scale or something.  People usually shout it out as JarJar or Jartrash if I recall correctly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If so, why don't you ask your own Guildleader??? Hey bro, you've found a great resource for info, but this post should go in the equipment section, np, it'll be moved soon. I'll look thru some of my old stuff and see if I have anything for you. <br />
<br />
see ya in game..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chasim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sorry, it should be in the other forum, maybe it can be moved.<br />
<br />
Nope, not on the Nameless server, on the Seventh Hammer.<br />
