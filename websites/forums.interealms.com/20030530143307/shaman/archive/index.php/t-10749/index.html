<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There are two more panels to fill out on the LoY site.   Anything can happen and we know that Basher Clan Trolls were looking to Broken Skull area for the taken item.  <br />
<br />
What if the new zone is really going to become the starter city for Trolls?   That would make alot of sense from a story line standpoint.   Trolls made Grobb out of a taken over Frog outpost ... Trolls lose item to Broken Skull Trolls (and mystery things) ... Troll lose city/outpost back to Frogs ... Troll take over Broken Skull as home city.  <br />
<br />
<br />
This does Two (2) things:<br />
<br />
1.    Cleans up story line around Guk plus getting starting Frogs closer to other zones<br />
2.    Gets Trolls out of Neriak and back into a REAL starter city instead of being second class citzens in some foreign quarters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>moosha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am honestly a little more annoyed then I like to let on about the Froglok invasion of Grobb.   I have good memories of Grobb and it is where I spent my early days as a shaman.  Grobb was one of the reasons that I choose a troll.  The fact that they choose to just slap trolls into some spare space in Neriak and hand over *MY* starting city to the Frogloks is a bit of a slap in the face.  Verant Interactive can collectively kiss my trollish ass.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Crash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think Fasc is on to something Moosh.  I dont think verant will let trolls start in neriaks woods.  That is just wrong.  Lots of trolls on xegony felt just like you Moosh and were killing froglok guards this morning in retaliation LOL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Someone has issues with seperatng RL from the game...:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Glek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Here is my question to this all......What about us trolls that have done some things in our time that made us KoS to neriak?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Oggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think Broken Skull Rock will become the new home of the trolls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Smert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Glek, <br />
There is a new NPC straight out from Neriak gate. He's a troll who sounds like he's the laison and from the text I think he offers faction quests for those who need some help. <br />
<br />
Dammit I want my city back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Glek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think if they want to do this new storyline thing they should perhaps give us trolls to fight for our city.....Sort of a big event and maybe different servers will still have grobb there home(the servers that beats the event of course) That would be my idea of turning this into a good thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I don't care if they move us around a bit and would even like to end up in Kunark, but SOE needs to keep the forge, alchemy vendors, trainers, and quests intact.  As of this morning everything was completely broken or non-existant.<br />
<br />
Hopefully, Neriak is just a short part of a dynamic intro to the new expansion.  It will get old if I have to kill a few guards everytime just to check up on the newbies. =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dretch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm more curious where the new rock column ( for lack of a better description) in Frog town will zone us.  <br />
<br />
In the old Corpse room, that used to be empty except for 2 Troll guards, and some dis-membered bodies, there is now a large rock.  4 Frogs stand around it apparently guarding it, and standing nearby are another 4 frogs.(all baking merchants).  Targeting the &quot;rock&quot; gives the &quot;you cant reach that from here&quot; msg.  Guess its going to be another JP type zone in, but to where?<br />
<br />
As far as Neriak goes, the Innoruuk symbol quest giver is gone, as it the DFbelt quest giver.  Although there is a new mask quest to replace the now defunct Froglok skin mask that had delighted so many baby Trolls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i think its safe to say that neriak is a temp starting city</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Hibbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">One of my main problems with the taking over of Grobb(well, besides the fact a bunch of wussie frogs sent trolls fleeing in terror), is the horrible cludge job they did in dressing up the town.  That rock column isn't necessarily a zone, I think it is just to cover up some bones.  The dwarf corpses are covered up with a sign.  Banners cover up some blood stains on walls, etc.  Very disappointing, I really hope this is just temporary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I feel for all the newbie frogs on pvp servers... the trolls will be lookin for ya.</div></div><hr />

what do you want them to do , turn it into qeynos ?  Its a troll city that has just freshly been taken over. As you said its not much more then a bunch of rocks.  I honestly cant think of a reason for it to change at all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Karnn Sathir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It's not even a real Froglok city, it's an outpost. As some npc's note in Gukta: the place still stinks of Trolls...<br />
Now I hope there's someway I could get non-kos with em, Cold Bloods should unite :D. <br />
Maybe some Troll slaughter will help, I'm kos with the entire old world as is anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">LoY is an expansion that you have to buy.  To play a Froglok you have to buy the expansion.  So if they moved a existing race - trolls - to a new zone, they'd have to give a new zone for free.<br />
<br />
That wouldn't make sense - they could have put the Frogs in Grobb2 - and kept all the new zones for the expansion.<br />
<br />
There wasn't a geographic need to kick us out of Grobb.  It was a dead-end.<br />
<br />
I don't think they will be moving us out of Neriak.  Grobb2 is already downloaded and could be activated now if were a replacement zone considered as part of the 'old' world.  That would save the effort of putting the new troll area into Neriak.<br />
<br />
Frankly none of what's been done makes any sense to me.  I'd expected new zones to be added by tacking on new zone entrances using the river exits in Feerott and the obvious zone exit in the Oasis of Marr.</div></div><hr />
