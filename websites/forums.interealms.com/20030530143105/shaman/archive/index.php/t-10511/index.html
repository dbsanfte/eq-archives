<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night I joined a pickup group in PoN, and the cleric let our tank die because, and I quote, &quot;I had to finish my petition before I could heal him&quot;.<br />
<br />
Today I was in another pickup group and a druid casts a Snare on the pull while he's still being pulled. He was dead in a couple seconds.<br />
<br />
So what do you guys do in a terrible group? I usually try and stay with them as long as I can, try to fix their mistakes so we can become efficient, but sometimes that's really really hard knowing you could have a 99% greater chance of survival and an exp rate twice as fast in another group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Meecham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If its really that bad I cut and run as soon as possible.  I usually dont make excuses about it, or at least dont try too hard to hide the reason.  Something like &quot;Sorry guys, &quot;something came up&quot;, gotta run, good luck.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not very polite, but at this late stage in the game I dont have the patience or the inclination to try to teach people how to play their class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hail,<br />
<br />
I try to tactfully mention how to correct the misbehavior that is causing the problems.  (Druid snaring for example).<br />
<br />
In extreme cases, I give them my 30 minutes notice.  I have a &quot;thing&quot; to take care of, and would like to leave as soon as possible.  I can usually stick it out with any group for 30 minutes.<br />
<br />
In very extreme cases, I'd tell them, &quot;I don't feel soandso is safe to group with&quot;, and explain that's why I'm leaving.  That gives the rest of the group the opportunity to boot the idiot and replace him.  As a shaman, this can work to fix the problem sometimes, as usually we're a key ingredient to making the group a success.<br />
<br />
Guild business is usually an acceptable excuse to leave a group, but I don't use that one unless it is true, because it happens alot to me when rare mobs spawn and we are racing for them.  Your morals may vary, and you could invoke that to get out of a bad situation if you wanted. <br />
<br />
In any case, limiting your groupmates with those you know or are from respectable guilds may reduce the frequency of your bad experiences.  If they get you repeatedly killed due to their stupidity, a respectable guild will usually bail your dead group out w/ a CR &amp; rez.<br />
<br />
I never group with someone unguilded unless I already know them or am really in dire need of their services.  If I can't find a group of people I trust to group with, I'll just solo or duo somewhere. :)<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

No need to lie, if people suck, tell them so and leave. If people in your guild suck at doing things, tell them so also because its a game and just because you play the class doesn't mean you know everyting about it... I bet someone who has played the game for 3 years and doesn't ever have a monk knows more about playing a monk than that lvl 60 who dinged last week.</div></div><hr />

The group can't MAKE you stay. If you feel something's wrong, tell them a white lie and leave. It's better than overworking yourself or eating a death or two.</div></div><hr />

Chanter) Well a Shm in my guild said that Shm slow for 85% and Chanters for 75%<br />

There's a reason why enchanters are able to fill in as slowers in xp groups.  (Getting pounded on because of the difference in aggro between Tash and Malo is the reason they don't want to.)</div></div><hr />

I'm seeing this bull**** more and more. I can't stand powerlevelling newbs who are being deceitful about their levels. Was grouped with a level 59 in PoV the other day (I came into the group after it was formed.) I told the group to get rid of the sponge or find a new Shaman. They replaced the sponge (who was working on AA by the way).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Was the level 59 not pulling his weight in the group? If he was I dont see why you had any reason for your elitist attitude. If I had been in a group and we invited a new player to join us and the first thing that person did was start bitching about one of the other members of the group I know who gets noted in my black book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Assuming I felt I could stay alive, I'd stay grouped and enjoy the variety and excitement that a truly bad group can offer.<br />
<br />
I'd only suggest what I considered to be better tactics if the people in the group seemed receptive.<br />
<br />
I'd be more inclined to leave a group because one or more of its members were guilty of misconduct.  Perhaps I'm more laid back about this because I'm aware of the truly awful blunders I have myself made from time to time.<br />
<br />
This weekend I did go so far as to point out that group exp bonuses are dependent on number of group members, not the number of mobs pulled.  But it was a fun group, no one died.</div></div><hr />

this is no longer true, they removed level based exp percentages a while ago.</div></div><hr />

I am hopeing it was just a coincidence that it happened 3 times in the last week. Or perhaps the idiots from LOIO,OT,DL, have moved to PON.<br />
<br />
I usually just say I have to help a guildy with an epic mob that is up and run away as fast as I can.<br />
However if there are some good peeps and just 1 idiot I will try to find a replacement for a few minutes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I usually try and stick it out, chances are if Im in a pickup group, that means I couldnt find a guild group and I formed it myself, so its either do nothing for no xp, or do a little something in a bad group for a little xp.<br />
<br />
The problem I mostly run into is main tanks/pullers that cant/dont get agro fast.  I have guild rangers, shadow knights and paladins I reguarly group with that I can slow their mobs on incoming and I never get agro.  I have never run into a non guildie tank that can/will do the same thing and it irritates me.  I accept the fact that warriors will have a more difficult time so early in the fight.<br />
<br />
I had a cleric leave almost right away the other day though, right after the enchanter died.  I usually inform the group, just in case they havent been to PoI before that Archaic Models cannot be slowed or mezed, but neglected to this one time.  Early on, the enchanter tried to mez one, not realizing that couldnt be done, he got pasted quickly.  We ended up getting another Archaic and the fight was a good, tough one.  Cleric said 'I dont trust this group' and headed out after the rez.  Pissed me off that it really wasnt a bad group, just an uninformed player who made a mistake and a little unluck with the adds.<br />
<br />
Its definitely amazing the differences in guild and pickup groups.</div></div><hr />

But I dont feel like babysitting people who cant do their jobs at least on an average level.</div></div><hr />

&quot;I have to take off in about 10 minutes, Ill try and hang on until you can find a replacement, but after 10 I may have to leave suddenly&quot;<br />
<br />
Now the tricky part of a reaallly bad group is staying alive for those 10 minutes, hehe.</div></div><hr />

I would agree that helping people learn to play thier class better is ideal; unfortunatly most people take that as an insult and get very upset.<br />

I asked him if he was taunting and his response to me was, &quot;Dude, I know how to play my class thanks very much&quot;<br />
<br />
A few more pulls go by and after I would slow the mob, I would have aggro for most of the fight. I finally asked him what weapon he was using etcc... Well, as it turns out the weapon in his primary hand was proccing JOLT. JOLT btw for those that don't know causes the one procing it to decrease aggro :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Akhasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I just wanted to say to Frekkels that refusing to group with an unguilded person might not be a great idea.  Sure, there are some idiots that are unguilded..but don't you think there are guilds that will take them?  <br />
<br />
At the moment, I'm unguilded.  Partially, its because i'm applying to a guild and wish to prove to them that they are my one and only choice until I'm accepted, and partially its because I like to have the opportunity to raid with other guilds (and i do so very often).  <br />
<br />
Nothing personal, just saying that being guildless does not mean a person is not a good player.  I may not be the best shaman out there, but I have a pretty high &quot;return-group&quot; rate of people I've grouped with before who invite me again.<br />
<br />
In response to the thread, I'm with the faction of people who say &quot;sorry, something came up, I have to go&quot;...it happens alot in the planes it seems; I've gotten to where I refuse an invite when I zone in, because usually its people starting a group.  I might join them, but I at least want a /tell first before I join a group of 4 druids and a ranger in PoV (dead serious).  <br />

<br />
I have goten to the point that I will not group in tier 1 and kind of elitist in PoV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Bendarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">People who say a group sucks are usually the people I blame for a bad group and go on my &quot;Dont group with ever again&quot; list.<br />
<br />
I also dont like elitist attitudes.  While levels are important they do not make a bad player good.<br />
<br />
That being said I have used the LD option once and I have told them I am leaving in 30 to get a rep for the most part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">If a group I join is bad, I try to improve it... if it doesnt improve quickly, I leave.  In the old days I would put up with it, because exp with a bad group was better than solo exp -now its not, and I can get another group :)<br />
<br />
As for low level people... I dont invite anyone under 60 to join my groups, unless they are a personal friend.  I wont ask someone to leave -unless they drop the ball, but I definately wont ask them to come join at lower levels..  I have some low 50s friends that I group with frequently.  We put them in the group, and they know that their job is to not get killed, and to soak up the exp.  They contribute, but we could do the same mobs 99% as fast without them.  They are there because they are firends and fun to hang out with.  In a pickup group I want people who will maximize the groups potential.  <br />
<br />
Maybe its elitist, but its how I feel.</div></div><hr />

     If it's just ignorance, like if the MT is also pulling, etc, I'll offer to do whatever isn't being done to speed things up.  It can be a fun change from the slow-dot-nuke-cann5-repeat cycle I get into in hardcore groups.<br />
<br />
     If it's stupidity, though, like the healer is nuking/dotting and also complaining about being OOM, or a melee insists on add-tanking instead of letting me do it, it's &quot;GTG, sorry for the short notice&quot;.  Voluntarily wasting your time to avoid hurting the feelings of idiots is, well, idiotic, IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Some of you have asked: <br />
<br />
how is a low level a sponge? exp is split and given in *larger* amounts to higher levels, so unless he was slowing down your killing process it would be better for the group.<br />
<br />
<br />
First of all this doesn't happen.<br />
<br />
Second of all he's a fuxxoring sponge because (speaking in general about level 59 toons): <br />
<br />
1) His mana pool is smaller<br />
2) He is more frequently resisted<br />
3) His DPS as a result of the above two constraints is lower.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, he's got fewer HP, meaning he'll get low health aggro sooner if the cleric/shaman/druid in the group doesn't use a fast, expensive heal on him. That's mana that could have been spent on another nuke. Again he's cost us DPS.<br />
<br />
I won't group with these lowbies. They slow groups down tremendously and are selfish to think that a bunch of level 65s is going to powerlevel them on AA.<br />
<br />
A level 59 is INCAPABLE of playing the xp game I expect him to play. He lacks the spells, the hitpoints, and the DPS. He's a sponge. Period.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Dread</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">As far as I am concerned, the best thing about a shaman is that we can do soo many things.  We might not be the best at any of them, but we really are a jack of all trades.  That being said, A skilled player can really make a shaman shine.  Shaman can do any group function other than tank.<br />
<br />
Pulling, crowd control, slowing, healing, hasteing/buffing.  I can do any of these, and generally, I do 3-4 of them for my group.  Believe it or not, I am often asked to pull for groups, cause I can have a mob malod, slowed, and rooted waiting as the current mob gets between 5-10% health.<br />
<br />
Shaman are the glue that holds groups together, even the bad ones.  I have been in many groups where I am the only glue holding it together, and I know the group is done as soon as I leave.  I may complain about other classes getting better upgrades than us ( because they are ), but we are a solid class with many abilities.  That is probably why it is soo hard for them to balance us properly.<br />
<br />
Dread<br />
&quot;SOE should get rid of mitigation.  Make the mobs MR slow immune.  That is what grummus is for!  And give us an AA that adds 1% to our slow % trainable once per level after 60&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Joredor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">This names names and maybe isnt the best idea, but here is what I put on my guild's board recently about a group I had in Innovation<br />
<br />
Chapter One: First the cleric goes AFK - [55 Templar] Anaine (High Elf)<br />
[Wed Jan 22 12:08:02 2003] Anaine tells the group, 'Ill zone and go to grocery store.. Ill be back in 20 mins or so.. So Dont get rid of me hehe'<br />
[Wed Jan 22 13:17:07 2003] Anaine tells the group, 'hehe, sorry it took me so long.. I had a flat tire when I went out to my car'<br />
So the cleric was away for an hour and 10 minutes, Anaine was sitting in Tranq the entire time. During that time I was healing and slowing.<br />
<br />
Chapter Two: The knowledgable Paladin - [53 Cavalier] Shedid (Half Elf)<br />
Shedid tells the group, 'iam uesing Ceremonial Iksar Chestplate'<br />
Shedid tells the group, 'my reg is fast'<br />
Yep all 5 points of it. Really fast.<br />
<br />
Why is there is no spell checking in EQ?<br />
Shedid tells the group, 'hest plz'<br />
Shedid tells the group, 'and any p buf plz'<br />
Shedid tells the group, 'buff *'<br />
Shedid tells the group, 'haest me plz'<br />
This is after being told that the Bard song gives more haste than my spells can.<br />
<br />
Chapter Three: The Final Straw<br />
Serj (Druid) joined the group and asked if anyone wanted Protection of the Cabbage.<br />
Shedid tells the group, 'give me shammy to it's good for hte rag'<br />
Shedid tells the group, 'mana reag'<br />
I assume she meant to cast Cabbage on me. Maybe, not real sure.  <br />
<br />
Shedid tells the group, 'the shammy slow and he cler heal and the dru dot them k guyz this is will be faster'<br />
Really wow I never know what to do in groups, 61 levels and now its all made clear to me.<br />
<br />
Shedid tells the group, 'k dru u know what to do ?'<br />
Serj tells the group, 'nope never played a druid before'<br />
Shedid tells the group, 'did u buy it ?'<br />
Serj tells the group, 'its a joke buddy calm down'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I dunno ive had some people bolt from a group cuz it was shakey at first. Couple minor tweaks and was 5 to 6 non stop hrs no death exp grind that person bolted from. <br />
   I dont see the point of telling a white lie to leave either. If anyone says they need to leave so be it i never ask a question why. Its a pick up group no contract signed,  leave when ya want too. <br />
   I do try and stick around and see if i can help the minor flaws. Like nukers nuking to early and getting aggro or people attack the mob to far out/not letting it to to a safer spot depending on wanderers etc. Anyway i just try to adjust some thinking on smaller things and teach litle things but i'm not going to teach someone to play their class. Also wont try and push the info on them. <br />
  Last is being unguilded like a scarely letter and i dont know it? I solo/two box friends group so dont have as much time to do pickup groups and my 60 palidan and 61 shaman are both unguilded atm by my own choice. I have penty of guild invites just dont want to do that atm. Is there that strong of a stigma on unguilded people? I understand what i can mean now not asking for an explanation just asking if most people look at unguilded that way.</div></div><hr />

Chanter no joke was amazing we had at one time 7 mobs in camp all but one mezzed and we got them down to about 3 before we had to zone. Monks dps was nothing to rave about but It was sufficent. After that experience I judge peeps more on how they play than there lvl. I'd rather have one awsome lvl 59 than one peice of crap lvl 65.</div></div><hr />

Some of you have asked: <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
First of all this doesn't happen.<br />
<br />
Second of all he's a fuxxoring sponge because (speaking in general about level 59 toons): <br />
<br />
1) His mana pool is smaller<br />
2) He is more frequently resisted<br />
3) His DPS as a result of the above two constraints is lower.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, he's got fewer HP, meaning he'll get low health aggro sooner if the cleric/shaman/druid in the group doesn't use a fast, expensive heal on him. That's mana that could have been spent on another nuke. Again he's cost us DPS.<br />
<br />
I won't group with these lowbies. They slow groups down tremendously and are selfish to think that a bunch of level 65s is going to powerlevel them on AA.<br />
<br />
A level 59 is INCAPABLE of playing the xp game I expect him to play. He lacks the spells, the hitpoints, and the DPS. He's a sponge. Period. <br />
<br />
I agree with  you. Only level 65 players should get xp groups.</div></div><hr />

Ouch :)<br />
<br />
If your level 59 is doing his job, then let him get some exp and keep playing.  Unless he's of a level so low that theres no way he can land a spell without atleast 1 or 2 resists, or he wont be able to land hits on the mob, then who cares.  <br />
<br />
Lower levels can do the job better then alot of high levels i know.  Saying a 59 can't be in your group is like telling a CH druid she cant be the healer in a place like PON.  I know druids whom i would trust to keep me alive far more willingly then 90% of clerics.  I know lower levels whom i would trust more then people with 10 levels on em.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if 1 person sucks (usually guildgroup with random pickups where i get to be the ass..), hey xxxx... im really sorry but you arent up for this place, and we dont want to waste time on a night full of CRs... your replacement should be here in about 1 minute.<br />
<br />
and i agree on the sponge thing... big difference between a 100aa lvl65 and a lvl58, would need like 3 of those to make up for the 65.</div></div><hr />

A really nice reply.  I wonder why Soupy has developed this hatred of non-65 chars.  I remember the dispute between him and BlargX on the pros and cons of levelling to 65.  Um... could Soupy have realised there is a significant downside to being 65?</div></div><hr />

&quot;That n00b was only level 59 in the lowest possible, and easiest to get into tier 2 plane in the game&quot;</div></div><hr />

I just don't NEED to group with sub 65s, so I don't. They don't bring as much to the group (in terms of spells, resists, dps, safety). It's rather simple, when I'm looking for a replacement for someone in my group, I take the highest level. So do many others.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A level 59 enchanter simply CAN'T mez a single exp mob in PoV. <br />
A level 59 wizard/mage is resisted too frequently.<br />
A level 59 warrior's HP and damage mitigation just suck and he becomes a mana sponge.<br />
<br />
And so on, and so on.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that only level 65 players should get groups. I'm just saying that I won't group with anyone sub 64 by choice. There are plenty of high-level toons LFG at most times of the day for my group to choose from. We'll take the person who will bring the most to the group. Let the lowbies group with their own cohort and THEN brag about how fast the AA is coming in.</div></div><hr />
