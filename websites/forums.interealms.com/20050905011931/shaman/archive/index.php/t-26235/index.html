&quot;All of us at Blizzard are extremely gratified and amazed at the international demand for World of Warcraft,&quot; said Mike Morhaime, president of Blizzard Entertainment. &quot;From region to region, we've seen a phenomenal level of enthusiasm for World of Warcraft, and we're absolutely thrilled people are enjoying the game so much.&quot;<br />
