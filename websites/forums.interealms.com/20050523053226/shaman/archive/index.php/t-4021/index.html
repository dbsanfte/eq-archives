<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rascalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heya Folks,<br />
I am on Vazaelle, which many may know is the newest blue server other than KB.  The server is almost 2 years old and currently there are only two top tier one guilds.  I am having a problem trying to get torpor and malo.  My guild may be able to do it but not sure as to when we would be able.  My question is do you think a fungi is worth trading for both spells.  I have not seen the spell sold by any one person and now would prolly have to approach a guild.  None of the guilds I have approached have it.  What makes things worse is it seems there are not enough guilds killing the mobs to actually get the spells circulating and to many shaman are hitting 60 all at once.  The auctions for these spells are insane.  Should I wait and be patient or actually get crazy and sell my fungi?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Err I find it hard to believe that they sell for 10k but i'll take your word on it.  Malo runs for 75k on Brell and Torpor is running 50K+.<br />
<br />
At level 60 with Torpor I haven't worn my Fungi in ages.  I think maybe a few raids where we have a VERY long fight and I wanted the extra regen to combat the DoT (Vulak, Creator, Etc).<br />
<br />
Torpor and Malo are worth far more than a Fungi at level 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">On Emarr, a copy of torpor just went for 80K.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When it came time for me to get Torpor, I offered my fungi in trade for it and go no response. Fortunately, I got my copy. However, there's still a shaman in the top guild on my server, one of its most active (and I do believe he posts here) who can't find a copy. I've seen people offering Fungi and Flowing Slime Boots for a copy.<br />
<br />
As for the trade in question; if you are sixty, you shouldn't even have to ask us what to do. If you aren't, well, it's up to you. Just know that as you edge in on that magic number of sixty, if you don't have Torpor and Malo in the bank already, you're going to start feeling some serious pressure.<br />
<br />
On another note, aren't Antonious Bayle, Firiona Vie and Zeb all newer than Vazelle?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>joebooracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">To the above post..if ya dont believe me..go to the spell section..then bazaar and spells...on the rathe torpor is 10k in bazaar and malo 8-10k..you may get the odd person trying to get 100k for emm..you buy it..well need i say more...seem torpor from 8k all the way up to 100k...just ppl trying to rip ya off before bazaar...cant do that anymore..if ya paid 100k for malo/tor ya got ripped</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I didn't pay for Malo, Torpor, Bane, Pox, Avatar, Tigir's, or most any other spell.  Most I paid was 1k for DSlow the first week of luclin cause I was dead in bazaar and wanted it for the upcoming pull on Vyemm.<br />
<br />
Still doesn't change the fact that Malo and Torpor are so rarely sold on Brell that they go for well over 10k.  When people repeatedly offer 80k for Malo or Torpor and get 0 takers... obviously there aren't any out there.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Your FT isn't worth Malo or Torpor, but if you could get both in a deal, it'd certainly be worth it!  Torpor CAN be used in place of the FT (and not all the time) and Malo is vital for guild raids of any zone harder than EC  :)<br />
<br />
I paid 30K for Torpor and 24K for Malo (due to having connections) and consider myself lucky at those prices.  FT's go for about 70K on 7th these days, which seems like a fair trade.  However, the two spells will make you a well-rounded high-end Shammy.</div></div><hr />

Thats if you can ever find a seller.<br />

<br />
If you DO have a fungi though, dump it in a second for torpor.  I sold my fungi, a couple small replacable pieces, the rest of my cash (about 15k at the time...nothting I wanted to buy) and a few guildies were generous and helped with the rest.  Its well worth it, especially to just get it off your chest of not having the spell.<br />
<br />
I should have never taken so much time off from eq and gotten 60 in kunark when all my regular buddies were hehe.</div></div><hr />

Have only seen Torpor in Bazaar twice and the asking price was a far cry from 10k.. just add 110k to that and that was the asking price.  The guy selling it was on crack though for everyone ive talked to says torpor/malo are around 40k.  Have never seen Malo for sale.  Rascalen you dont need an uber guild to get the two spells.. All you need is a lot of patience, a bit of luck, a seb key and a small grp with a rogue.. Head to Crypt and kill Emp.. I did this in attempt to get torpor 3 weeks ago.  On first Emp spawn he dropped Malo. Just be patient :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
As of now, I wish I hadn't spent that much on Malo... I've seen 5 copies of Malo drop from Sontalak/Kunark Dragons since... 3 that went to guild vaults and were never seen again (the guild broke up, and the spell vault person probably made a boatload of cash...) However, I only saw one copy of Torpor drop since then... and that was from Sontalak. That quickly went to our Torporless Shaman.<br />

Malo: Seen it once for 80k<br />
Torpor: Once for 70k once for 60k<br />
Voice of the berserker: 10-20k<br />
Pox of Bertoloxxus: Once for 20k<br />
Primal Essence: 30k<br />
Khura's focusing: 10k<br />
Bane of Nife: 5-10k<br />
<br />
Fungi: 50-55k - won't even get me malo OR torpor alone.<br />
<br />
Malo, Torpor, Voice, and Pox all have one thing in common.  I have only seen them for sale by level 60 wizards.  An interesting coincidence for certain.  <br />

<br />
Well, yes, it's pretty ridiculous that spells cost that much...your point?  Who decides 30K? Who decides 10K?  Who decides 80K? The spells are rare, people with 100K are going to blow it all if they ever see torpor on the market.<br />
<br />
Tigir's and Bane had their drop rate increased, although they still basically only drop from one place, OS juggs/reets.  Malo and torpor still have absymal drop rates where they have always dropped...Kunark boss mobs (outdoor dragons, VP dragons, King/Queen Chardok, Emperor, Jumpy, protector) and Sontalek (I suppose Klandicar could drop them, but he's never dropped a decent spell for us yet).<br />
<br />
If you're in a guild that can kill the above (or is still killing the above and haven't moved on) Torpor and Malo probably don't look terribly rare.  If you aren't...start saving.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Malo and torpor are both 35kpp on fennin, hardly a young server.<br />
<br />
I traded my fungi for torpor and never looked back. Frankly, now that MB'ers prowl the server en masse, killing Kunark dragons the second they pop, it's harder than ever to get 59-50 Kunark spells.<br />
<br />
On the good note, I took out a loan for 11kpp from my guildboss and got VoB. Pox and everlasting breath and I think I have a full spellbook minus ancients and primal avatar.<br />
<br />
One last thought too. <br />
<br />
Many people have over time on this board suggested malo is more of a raid spell. To that I say phooey. <br />
<br />
Malo is JUST as amazing as torpor. You wanna solo in SG or dragons in WW, you need malo. Grouping in CT or the castle in VL? Malo is ideal because it's non aggro, unlike tash, and you can debuff as the mob's still inc practically. This means a far quicker slow, which is HUGE when that brown lizzy is pounding on your tank. On raids it's value is self evident. Anyway, Malo - despite it's high mana costs - is great even for daily use. <br />
<br />
If you can trade a fungi for malo and torpor, consider yourself lucky. <br />
<br />
I'm just personally glad Malo dropped off the prince before I saw the error of my ways and befriended his glorious empire (now gimme my ring dammit~).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">price checks across servers are basically worthless, i dont think torpor is much above 10k on prexus.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i would make a fungi tunic -&gt; torpor trader straight up.  getting malo in addition to torpor is like getting a free rare spell.<br />
<br />
seeing the prices from some of the servers for torpor / malo makes me want to try and farm a few copies of each for cash flow =x.</div></div><hr />

not if you buy them - wizards don't need torpor the last time I checked :) RoA (fennin guild) also do VP a truckload, they've helped make torpor a lot less rare. heck i've seen at least four copies of torpor in the /bazaar on fennin since the thing came out, all from 25-40k, not too bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Well, I gave up on trying to do any sort of trade for malo/torpor, so I sold my fungi outright (80k) so I'd have the cash...  that same evening, malo was in the bazaar for 40k, which struck me as a bit high, but I bought it anyway.  <br />
<br />
The next day, I closed on Torpor with someone I had been haggling with for a couple days, also for 40k, which struck me as a bit low. ;)<br />
<br />
With the little money I had in the bank, I picked up a PSC to hold me over until I can get a velious bp.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Orakul, what are you talking about?<br />
<br />
You: &quot;RoA (fennin guild) also do VP a truckload, they've helped make torpor a lot less rare.&quot;<br />
<br />
RoA stopped doing VP hardcore months ago, and they hardly single-handedly made torpor more common. They spend more time in ntov and on the moon. Really, they are not power gamers anyway, and spend as much time exping as raiding, a balance they aim for. Genuinely nice guys /wave Lido et al. <br />
<br />
You: &quot;not if you buy them - wizards don't need torpor the last time I checked.&quot;<br />
<br />
Really!?! OMG, I thought the copy of torpor I scribed said shm-wiz. Wow am I red. <br />
<br />
My point, obviously, was that Kunark 59-60 spells are tough to get though any means but are game makers for the 60 shaman, so this person should make the trade. My point was not that you can't buy the spells, although they run 30-35kpp. The bazaar has helped here. <br />
<br />
Kunark 59-60 spells are still hard to find because:<br />
<br />
A) The good spells are rarish drops off a small pool of mobs. We've killed dragons and gotten no spells. <br />
<br />
B) Tried and true sources like easily killed Kunark dragons and Guardian Wurms are obliterated by Ragefire campers and manaburers. There must be 20 guilds on Fennin who can kill Gore/Sev/Tal beyond Team Manaburn.<br />
<br />
C) Other sources are closed due to faciton, like Chardok, becuase people are doing the ring/cords quest. <br />
<br />
D) VP is not a good option because few current VP capable guilds want to do VP. The loot is generally not worth the effort. My guild has never done VP, but we've opted to skip it and work on ntov instead. The guilds that once did VP have moved on as well.<br />
<br />
E) Everyone's level 60. Their twinks are level 60. With EQW you can plevel yourself, although you won't do it in a way where you get the spells you need. Thus, there are many shaman who have taken the path of least resistance who now need those spells. Big demand; tiny supply. Get it?<br />
<br />
All that said, the spells are plenty available, so no one read my post as a whine for torpor to drop off Crush.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">If you're not in a guild that can get you these spells, get in one that kills Kunark dragons regularly.  I'm so freakin serious here.  Join whichever guild you find out is killing Kunark dragons.  It matters not if you like them in general or if you have any friends in that guild.  Guilds can be like shoes, different ones are required for different activities.  Any emotional bull**** you attach to them is precisely that.  <br />
<br />
Join a guild that kills the targets that drop the spells you need.  If you can't manage that, best just quit the game now cause there's no hope for you.</div></div><hr />

The difference in price has to deal with how many people on your server have the ability to get these spells.
