<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zearex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all,<br />
<br />
My main is a level 65 Ranger, and I've been getting pretty excited playing my first real alt, a Troll Shaman.  He's currently 27 (no I'm not powerleveling him), and I'm having a blast with him.  I'm planning on leveling him to 52 to do some Naggy/Vox kills, and then maybe further.<br />
<br />
My question is:  He is somewhat twinked, but what focus effects are most important for a shaman? I was thinking of the available focus effects:<br />
<br />
Extended Enhancement/Extended Blessing (what's the difference)?<br />
Improved Damage<br />
Burning Affliction<br />
Mana Preservation<br />
Improved Healing<br />
Spell Haste<br />
Affliction Haste<br />
<br />
Which of these are most important to Shaman?  Have I missed any?<br />
<br />
Any and all advice would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Extended Enhancement/Extended Blessing (what's the difference)? <br />
<br />
Extended blessing affects Torpor/Q, Extended Enhancement does not (limited to buffs with a duration greater than 48 seconds).<br />
<br />
My favorite focus effects:<br />
<br />
Spell haste (generic or detrimental + beneficial)<br />
Mana preservation (or the more specialized versions: affliction - dots, mithaniel - beneficial etc)<br />
Improved Healing (works on tnargs, not our &quot;CH&quot; or heals over time)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, as a shaman Extended Enhancement just owns.  When you're expected to keep buffs up and running for long periods, the % extra extension turns into mana that you would otherwise be wasting on a recast.  Not to mention it will make haste last longer, which at the lower levels is a pita to keep up.<br />
<br />
Improved Damage really doesn't help too much in the lower levels unless your soloing.  I really didn't get to start whipping out my damage spells in groups till 44 (when I got stoicism and could canni more), and you really don't scale that up dramatically untill 58 when you get canni IV and can start turning back mana pretty well.  Before then it's kinda hard to have the mana to waste casting damage spells, so improved damage is a lower priority.<br />
<br />
Not very familiar with burning affliction... apparently it increases the damage your dots do... seems like it would be good for solo, but not very useful for a grouping shaman, as we rarely get to stack several dots on a target in groups.<br />
<br />
Mana Preservation is on par with extended enhancement at lower levels, if not better.  It basically reduces the mana cost for your spells, so you really can't go wrong there.<br />
<br />
Improved Healing obviously is considerably more useful for a grouping shaman than a solo shaman, But at the lower levels I never saw enough of a difference to give it a high priority.<br />
<br />
Spell Haste... Spells casting faster is obviously very helpful, but if your planning on outdoor hunting like ot and DL, then it's not that important for your lower levels.  Sure, landing slow a half second sooner helps, but after that there is plenty of time between actions for shaman, (outdoors at the lower levels) so the haste isn't gamechanging.  However, if your doing LDoN's it's pretty damn good (just behind mana pres and extended enhancement).  When you get adds you need to cast incredibly fast as there is TONS of things to be doing (especially when your main healer), so the spell haste is a noticeable help.<br />
<br />
Affliction Haste is not that useful imho.  Since your not casting all that many affliction spells, having a whole other focus effect just to have a select few spells casting faster seems silly to me.  If you can gnab a spell haste focus item, then don't worry about the few % extra haste on damage spells... at least not pre 52 where your not chain casting rain spells or whatnot.<br />
<br />
EDIT: fixed some apparent tidbits of misinformation...  sorry bout the mistakes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You will get many varied answers, because many people play their shamans in different ways and belong to different types of guild philosophies. Here's my advice;<br />
<br />
Mana preservation and Extended Enchancement would probably be your two most important foci. Shaman spells are expensive to cast, and the amount of buffs you need to cast and recast in the early levels when they dont last that long, can make you a grumpy s.o.b. These two foci will serve you quite well even once you attain the longer duration, multi-purpose buffs later on (assuming you have level III or IV focus).<br />
<br />
Improved Healing, in my opinion, is near the top of the list because shamans are healers. You'll get plenty of argument on this, I'm sure.<br />
<br />
Spell Haste and Improved Range are good for any caster, if you can find it. I dont browse the item databases online much these days, but it sure seems like there are very few level IV of these foci.<br />
<br />
After that it would depend on what you do, really. Do you solo a lot with dots? Do you only group or raid with your guild? Are you typically the main healer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Keyline Wintermystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ranking them in order of this shaman's view...<br />
<br />
Spell Haste - Fast casting spells, both benefitial and detrimental<br />
Spell Haste - Same as above<br />
Spell Haste - Same<br />
Extended Enhancement/Extended Blessing (what's the difference)? - Not sure what extended blessing is, maybe the same thing?  But extended enhancement is needed for buffing, making buffs last longer<br />
Burning Affliction - More damage per tick on dots, getting more overall damage per dot cast using this.  Not a big item unless you are planning to solo alot (search the boards in regard to dots and shaman feelings about them)<br />
Mana Preservation - Saving mana per spell, this is nice at any level, but not needed do to canni, specially at lower levels.<br />
Affliction Haste - casting dots faster, hmm...was nice when we had slow and roots on this, but not needed anymore due to detrimental haste<br />
Improved Healing - added healing power, again not a biggie at lower level due to lack of equipment and who is being main slower (at least from me at that time, later in game, IH4 has been nice as a patch healer)<br />
Improved Damage - DD damage, we don't nuke, at least i didnt' at that lvl, later on in game you tend to nuke more and dot less, least in my opinion<br />
<br />
Also, at the lvl you are now, having focus effects is nice, but not a necessity(sp).  My first one was around lvl 50 before I even thought about focus effects.  But after reading gear posts, has been something I am concentrating on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd rank them, in order from most needed to least...<br />
<br />
1: Mana preservation<br />
2: spell haste<br />
3: burning affliction<br />
4: extended enhancement<br />
5: improved healing<br />
6: improved damage<br />
<br />
<br />
I rate em this way just from the way I play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">1. Spell haste - faster cast = less chance for mob to interrupt root/slow<br />
2. Mana pres - yeah, we have canni.  whoopidy ****, we also have ridiculously mana-expensive spells<br />
3. imp heal/extended blessing - bigger heals = good<br />
4. extended enhancement (if you don't have blessing) - less buffing saves you mana and hassle<br />
5. affliction efficiency - extra 20% dot savings OVER mana pres.  since our dots are hideously mana-costing, this is good.<br />
6. burning aff/imp dd - Meh.  BA = super agro, imp dd = eyecandy, since our nukes that are affected suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">[QUOTE='rookz']  Plus it will extend stoicism, torpor, and Q wich will greatly improve your mana effeciency.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Not very familiar with burning affliction, but if that is the dot extension focus, then it's useful if you solo, not if you group.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
(re imp healing) but it still increases stoicism for you (when you hit 44) so it's not shabby...  <br />
<br />
QUOTE]<br />
<br />
first off EA does NOTHING to Stoi/torpor/Q at all<br />
<br />
Burning affliction makes your dots do 10% more damage (yes its random 1-20% but parses out at 10% time and time again)<br />
<br />
Imp healing does NOTHING to stoi/torpor/Q <br />
<br />
holy crap dont spout nonsense on a board where people come for advice please. next thing you will be telling him that a higher agi will make him run faster.<br />
<br />
<br />
Spell haste/manapres are the 2 most valuable focus effects in game, they affect virtually every spell you cast. every thing else is just foo foo fun stuff. <br />
Blackend alloy medalion is manapres2 and is cheap and easy with decent stats for a mana pres item.<br />
for shaman Affiction efficency/Burning affliction are very nice when you solo,<br />
Imp healing for groups,<br />
 and if you must extended enhancement isnt terrible if you dont mind swaping out gear for your ea item every time you buff. ( I could be wrong but I have never seen a ea item for shaman that wasnt 10x worse than easily available gear for the same slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Improved Healing obviously is considerably more useful for a grouping shaman than a solo shaman, but it still increases stoicism for you  <br />
<br />
Honestly, I don't think the IH focus has any effect on buffs, which is how Stoicism, Torpor, and Quiessence are technically categorized. It only works in instant, non-'complete', non-'%' heals, like greater healing and Tnarg's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It's cool, there's a lot of confusion around Extended Enhancement/Extended Blessing and the AA SCRM.<br />
<br />
Extended Enhancement - most of us get our first taste of this with a ceramic shield of valor, player made via pottery. Extended enhancement extends buffs (spell must have  buff icon) by 15%. It is limited to spells which have a duration of 48 seconds or longer (therefore, doesn't work with our heals over time: stocisim, Torpor, Q).<br />
<br />
Extended Blessing (sparking ruby of fortune) - Type 7 LDON focus (meaning goes on most old gear). This focus item increases buff duration by 10% (not as good as extended enhancement) but affects spells with a duration of 24 seconds or longer...meaning works with our heals over time. Henora posted a nice log somewhere that shows that it consistently adds ticks to Q.<br />
<br />
SCR/SCRM - AA ability (arch SCR - 2/4/6 class SCRM - 8), adds to buff duration and affects the duration of our heals over time.<br />
<br />
Now, where it gets fun...Extended Enhancement stacks with SCRM. I would guess that Extended Blessing would also stack with SCRM but I don't have an item to double check.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Now, where it gets fun...Extended Enhancement stacks with SCRM. I would guess that Extended Blessing would also stack with SCRM but I don't have an item to double check.<br />
<br />
To clarify a little, EE and EB stack with all levels of SCR, not just SCRM.  However, EE and EB do *not* stack with each other just as all other focus effects, ie: two effects that do the same thing, for example mana pres and affliction efficiency.<br />
<br />
EB stacking with SCR and SCRM has been shown a few times on this board.<br />
<br />
I still refer to this site fairly frequently for focus effect info, http://www.bjornstar.com/focusitems.html.  Now, as for my preference of focus effects:<br />
<br />
1) Spell Haste - When you get to 51, having a faster slow is really great.  When you get to 60+ with malo(s), having both a faster slow and malo(s) is even better.  In addition, our direct heals are pretty slow casting and are helped with spell haste.<br />
<br />
2) Mana Pres - We cast SO many spells that this helps very very much, especially since we use pretty much all of the spell types.<br />
<br />
Now, the rest are fairly subjective depending mostly on how you play.<br />
<br />
Solo:<br />
<br />
3) Affliction Effeciency - 25% mana savings on dots is HUGE<br />
4) Burning Affliction - If you stack 3-4 dots, this adds up very fast<br />
5) Affliction Haste - most useful versus summoning mobs really.  The time savings isn't much until you start getting interrupted during dot refreshes<br />
6) Extended Enhancement/Extended Blessing - Having self only buffs last longer is nice, especially for dogdog's haste and self regen, but not really a great help.<br />
7) Improved Damage, Improved Healing - Lowest on the list because you won't be doing much direct damage or healing while soloing.<br />
<br />
Group:<br />
<br />
3) Improved Damage - I nuke a lot during groups and having permanent ID adds a lot of damage, however it does not work on rains<br />
4) Extended Enhancement/Extended Blessing - It's really nice to have mana intensive buffs last longer, particularly haste and especially ferine avatar.<br />
5) Improved Healing - Meh...*NOTE* this might be a priority for you if you will be doing a lot of patch healing in groups.  I group 99.9% of the time with a cleric and she is annoyed enough that Q heals so well, so she gets to heal whenever possible :)<br />
6) Affliction Haste, Efficiency, Burning Affliction - I haven't dotted in groups for quite some time, however these might rank higher if you duo/trio.<br />
<br />
EDIT<br />
<br />
My magelo indicates how much I enjoy spell haste and mana pres.  I still wear a mana pres 3 and spell haste 3 item and will not upgrade either one until I have a level 4 effect to replace it.  I also ended up writing this post from the eyes of a 61+ with at least stoicism, I'm sorry that parts of it probably aren't accurate at lower levels.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Jesus man, sorry.  I was misinformed and I appoligise, but simply correcting me is enough to undo the damage.  You don't need to flame me for attempting to help others.  This is the whole reason why people lurk for eons without ever venturing a single post, in the fear of getting attacked for just trying to help.<br />
<br />
I'm sure i am not the only one that mistakenly believed this, and if I didn't stick my neck out and take the hit, then a few other people would continue to go on thinking it was the case (myself included).  So again, sorry, but chill the #@!$ out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Mana preservation and Spell haste are great.<br />
<br />
Affliction Efficiency is good if you can get it - our dots are expensive, and the little bit more you save over mana preservation (Er, 5% right) isn't bad.  But dont give up a great item for it, if you already have Spell Haste.<br />
<br />
I like Burning Affliction myself... 10% extra damage per tick on average isn't anything to sneer about, I would think.  If you solo, it's great.  If you're in a group where you actually bother to cast DoTs, it's good too.  Getting the most damage you can out of a spell that might not last it's full effect doesn't hurt.  <br />
<br />
Extended Enhancement is very nice.  Anything to keep me from having to refresh buffs even a little while.  But, like was mentioned,  most the items that have it dont seem to be so great.. <br />
<br />
I can't see myself getting Improved Damage until the very end, really.  If i nuke, it's more for a novelty and change of pace then anything.  If I want to do damage, I DoT... It always lasts at LEAST long enough to do more damage then the DD would.<br />
<br />
Improved healing i'll pick up when I can get Tnarg's.  For some reason, I ALWAYS seem to get the fulll melee groups and being the only healer.  <br />
<br />
My list, in short...<br />
<br />
1. Spell Haste<br />
2. Mana preservation<br />
3. Tie between Burning Affliction / Extended Enhancement.<br />
4. Improved Healing<br />
<br />
And so on..<br />

<br />
Otherwise, very good advice here. I have a BA4 aug, and I personally love it, but thats mostly because recently my play has been so erratic that soloing is my best option for solid XP. Bought LDoN legs too, recently, so I hope to stick Extended Range in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Does Mana Preservation and Affliction Efficeincy stack on our Dot's?<br />
<br />
No focus effects stack with each other, ever. The best focus effect will take precedence. In this case, if you had both a mana preservation and an affliction efficiency item, the affliction efficiency item would go off while casting dots.<br />
<br />
Focus items can stack with AA abilities, however :)<br />
<br />
I have a Soulsec focus (detrimental haste) and Quick Buff 3 for faster Quies. Would a regular spell haste focus make Quies even faster than Quick Buff 3?<br />
<br />
I don't think so, doesn't quickbuff 3 reduce Q casting by 50% to 3 seconds? That is the &quot;cap&quot; on quickbuff. Now, a spell haste item (or beneficial spell haste item) would make tnargs cast faster :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
for the melees<br />
Agi does not affect your chances to block/parry/riposte, it will not make you run faster, it will not save your ass once, keep it above 75 and you have no worries at all.<br />
for casters<br />
Cha has next to 0 effect in the game outside of buying/selling, it wont reduce agro, it wont make you unkos, it wont make your charms last longer.<br />
for shaman, <br />
cha will not do ANYTHING for you outside of buying/selling. period, end of story.<br />
dex/agi dont do anything for you at all, stop wasting the groups time keeping them up.<br />
if you dont need pr/dr/fr/cr/mr then STOP CASTING THEM. <br />
Cani, cani often, cani lots, cani more. when at low lvl you should just cani off your regen, 90% hp are normal for a shaman whos not fm even when they arent taking hits.<br />
<br />
I cant think of anything else retarded to bitch about, the sad truth is that people are still getting told this kind of crap and they never check to see if its true.<br />
<br />
yeah I am a grumpy old fart.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Well, which specific focus effects stack with a single type of spell in all of our spellbooks seems to be a little narrow of a topic to be assumed common knowladge by everyone.  I do agree though, misinformation sucks, and I'm the first to fix my posts when I find out I do it.  <br />
<br />
I was at work and didn't have time to double check which effects stacked with our HoT line, yet I still wanted to help the lad out, so I posted.  Probably should have waited till I got home, but I figured if I was slightly off, someone would correct me.<br />
<br />
Just a quick question... you said &quot;dex/agi dont do anything for you at all, stop wasting the groups time keeping them up.&quot;  I understand agility does such a small improvement to AC that it's generally considered worthless (though there have been some parses to show that it's possibly the largest single stat contributor to your Endurance pool, but I am not 1000% sure of their validity, and we are quickly straying from the point :p).  <br />
<br />
But I was still under the impression that Dex helped increase your proc rate.  In fact I was almost certain that there had been many parses done to reflect this, and to show that the proc rate increase was substantial enough to warrant a buff.  Just trying to make sure I don't pass this bit of info on again if it's not true... Is it proven a misnomer that dex increases proc rates and is therefor worthless?<br />
<br />
additionally, you said &quot;Cha has next to 0 effect in the game outside of buying/selling, it wont reduce agro, it wont make you unkos, it wont make your charms last longer.&quot;  I am not certain about the charm thing.. still hear it helps, but I don't know for certain, and I will certainly not tell anyone it works until I do know for certain.  But I thought Charisma was parsed and proven to reduce bard fizzle rates.  please let me know if this is wrong as I will stop wasting mana charisma buffing my bards.<br />
<br />
Also, to the list of mis-info that I would like to quash, a LDoN has averaged the group level, and set the dungeon long before you get there.  It DOES NOT MATTER what level person enters first, as the instancing has already been set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">the one thing that really drivves me nuts OTHER than the left over confusion from verants dumbass starting stats and info is players who spread bad info.<br />

<br />

<br />
It has been stated by EQ developers that Charisma is a secondary check for lull/pacify resists.  If your target resists the spell, a secondary check is made to see if the failure results in agro.  That secondary check is at least partially affected by Charisma.  This came straight from a developer's mouth and was posted extensively a while back.  So for enchanters and bards, charisma is at least the third-most important stat, and perhaps more important than stamina for characters who mez a lot.<br />
<br />
So yes, I would agree you are a grumpy, and misinformed, old fart.<br />

<br />
In addition, dex does significantly affect proc rates as well as offensive skill ups.  Agi does affect dodge rates and defensive skill ups as well as adding a marginally small increase in AC.<br />
<br />
Cha affects charm, lull/pacify, mez, and bard fizzle rates.  The myth is that it affects other spells, such as slow and root, which it does not.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Definitely do the Wristguard quest, as Wodon suggested.  It requires a small amount of help or some 2boxing, but it's stupid easy and can be completed in a few hours.  Beyond that, spell haste of some sort would be my first stop.  The only easily-accessible spell haste item I know of is a haste3 ring that drops in Veksar, but im sure there must be others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">At low levels I'd suggest mana pres and ext enh - you can get low cost items for both.  If you group a lot at low/mid levels it couldn't hurt to have an improved healing focus item, since our early heals are expensive and low powered.<br />
<br />
At 65 I'm seriously lacking for focus items, but I'm very fond of the beneficial spell haste from my wicked bone atlatl.  I get focus-like effects from some of my AA (SCRM + QB2) and I'm very fond of the extended durations and quicker casting.<br />
<br />
In general the focus that helps you the most will depend on your style and how much use you can get out of it.  Ext, haste, and BA work well for me.  It'd be nice to have all focus but chances are you won't...so try to get the ones you can get the most out of.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Extended Range is ok to have, but I would definately give it &quot;afterthought&quot; importance. I have a III item, and it really goes off very rarely.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">It has been stated by EQ developers that Charisma is a secondary check for lull/pacify resists.  If your target resists the spell, a secondary check is made to see if the failure results in agro.  That secondary check is at least partially affected by Charisma.  This came straight from a developer's mouth and was posted extensively a while back.  So for enchanters and bards, charisma is at least the third-most important stat, and perhaps more important than stamina for characters who mez a lot.<br />
<br />
So yes, I would agree you are a grumpy, and misinformed, old fart.<br />

secondary? more like 4th in line of things that get checked. I have seen the parses.<br />
<br />
&quot;In addition, dex does significantly affect proc rates as well as offensive skill ups. Agi does affect dodge rates and defensive skill ups as well as adding a marginally small increase in AC.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cha affects charm, lull/pacify, mez, and bard fizzle rates. The myth is that it affects other spells, such as slow and root, which it does not.&quot;<br />
<br />
um no agi does not now nor has it ever even once in the entire history of the game had even the slightest effect on dodge/parry/block/riposte. NEVER EVER EVER!!!!! show me a parse that proves all the other ones wrong, even one parse?<br />
Dex does affect procc rate, aprocamately 100 dex comes out to a 1% increase in procc rate, so between focus and Diaku we can indeed bump the procc rate from a pitiful 4% to a blistering 5% <br />
<br />
I have seen parses on cha, aside from pacify agro (where chanters with 200+ cha did get a lower agro rate slightly)  the verdict is out on cha doing jack or squat to mez...and bard fizzle? I wont even touch that, thats completely new to me.<br />
<br />
<br />
log and parse is your friend, really it is. if you just &quot;feel&quot; that this is having that effect and post that as fact you are only spreading confusion.<br />
<br />
my point on shaman who keep casting our crappy stat buffs like dex/agi on all party members is that its a total waste of mana and time, when is the last time the wizard was saved by 4 ac given from agi? or the group wiped because the shaman didnt procc? it just doesnt happen like that 99.999999999999999999999999999% of the time and on the off chance that it does save the day the exp loss you saved that one time is dwarfed by the exp lost due to wasted mana and time over your carreer.</div></div><hr />
