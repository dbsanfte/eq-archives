<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xhosa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, BG pops in Fear and we call to arms to help our Wizzie on his last epic piece. So off we go and pull the Enraged Golem and friends. <br />
<br />
So I start casting Tigir's at the golem's friends and I get 6 (thats SIX) slowed messages. I was the only slower on the raid too so it did not come from anyone elses slow.<br />
<br />
Can someone please confirm you can now slow more than 4 mobs in a single cast.<br />
<br />
I have a screen dump to prove it, just have not got the web-space to host the pic.<br />
<br />
Edit: 2 of the slowed mobs were pets, so may have something to do with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I didn't notice that yesterday in PoI, but will definitely be on the lookout for it. It would be nice to be able to hit more than four targets. Dangerous, but nice. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If tigirs was a true AE spell it would own so much</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I forget how the rules go, but pets are not included in the 4 mob thing. Used to do aoe groups in chardok and would notice the same thing on the pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>jador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Tigir's insert works more than 4 target now, I have been slowed 4 mob and see 2 resist messege(myself and ?) at POF raid,  total 6 hits by my Tigir's insert,<br />
 <br />
Maybe its not limited on 4 mobs, but limited on max 4 mob hit a player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't the only AE spells with unlimited targets also point blank type?<br />
<br />
I've personally used Tigirs quite a lot recently and haven't seen it hit more than 4 - I suspect the pets explanation is correct.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>KriFos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ive seen it HIT 5 mobs once, but one resisted, i have never gotten more than 4 &quot;Yawns&quot; messages from mobs in same cast. However, i dont think pets and yourself (if you stand too close:P) count in the 4 limit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sounds worth trying out though, next time I am factioning in Droga I'll pull 6 and see what happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fumeden Ex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i slowed up to 6 mobs using tigir's in akheva last night, its either bugged (god i hope not) or changed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vulash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">After reading this thread I promptly went to qeynos and attempted to pull a huge train and tigir.  Luckily someone else had about 30 mobs running them around for who knows what reason.  Anyway, I cast Tigir at these 30ish level 1 mobs and only 4 were slowed, no resists.  Odds are when you are getting the 5th resist it is you.  Other then that I don't know.  Maybe it is bugged :D<br />
<br />
What AAs does everyone have that is slowing more then 4?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Tried this in Blackburrow.  Slowed 4 gnolls (out of the dozen or so I had yapping at me) and myself.  /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">5 decaying skeletons in EF were nice enough to help me with this. All were in range 100 percent sure, only 4 yawned. Me resisted :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Naala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">One question.  Does casting Tigirs in a PoP zone usually get you killed?  I just dinged 58 recently and have no experience with this spell.  I'm just curious how your groupies are able to peel 4 mobs off of you beforte you die?  Any feedback appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yes, it can.  And sometimes I'm just far enough away that they don't notice me.  Or maybe it was the CHA buff that made them not hate it as much . . . <br />
<br />
/evil grin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Tigir's Insects has a 200 hate reduction on each target it hits, so if you don't get any resists, it should cause you less agro than a regular slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Mirabilis Dictu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I tried this on one of the Vulak ring waves (with all the little drakes) this week.<br />
<br />
The first time I got four resists, no slows *fume*<br />
The second time I got four slows, no resists.<br />
<br />
I had no pet up and was out of range of the spell effect.<br />
<br />
That says to me that as of February 21, 2003, Tigir's is working just like normal.<br />
