<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Synyr KerZhul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We are currently accepting applications for our guild on Kane Bayle. Sick of overcrowding and racing other guilds to mobs? We have the lowest server population of any normal server in EQ. There is little to no competition for mobs and we are the only guild currently doing Emp/VT. There is only one guild above us in the elemental planes but they are North American so pose no competition during our raid hours.<br />
<br />
We are a Euro guild making the final push towards the elemental planes and require a few more quality people to bolster our ranks, including a shaman. Please check us out at www.kane-bayle.com if your interested. We will make a solid effort to re-equip the right people after transfer.</div></div><hr />
