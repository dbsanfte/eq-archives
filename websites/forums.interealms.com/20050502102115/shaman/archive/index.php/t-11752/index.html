<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Raizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What would be the best possible character to partner with a shaman, non 2 boxed, all classes are open, and both the same level and pretty well twinked but not extravagant.  And why?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Necromancer.  Between the two of you you have just about every useful skill in the game.  The necro offers what we lack (most importantly damage, amazing pulling with harmshield, fd, and eventually instaclick invis).  We have some things that necros want (regen for lich, solid healing, some tanking).  Pre-pop you can slow and have the necro pet tank, slow and have the shaman tank, root dot, aggro kite, so many options.  In PoP you can root dot or aggro kite like champs, and once the necro gets the pop charm, you have the best xp-maker in the game at your side.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Id say Ranger or shadowknight.  <br />
<br />
Shadow Knight will tank better, Ranger will probably have higher damage output.  Ranger will need more healing than the SK.  Both are able to produce huge agro to keep the mobs attention while you do your thing.  (in my experience no other class can generate as much agro as a SK.  WEll...besides a high level wizard that doesnt know any better, but they usually dont live long enough to matter...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've always been a big fan of the Necro/ Shaman combo but lately I've come around to the Mage/ Shaman duo. The big diffrence is the mobs go down FAST so you can mow through a noticable amount more of 'em in the same amount of time. All the mage is missing really is crowd controll and healing, which we cover nicely, and with Regeneration and Mod rods mana replenishment on their part is covered as well. They bring to the table a respectable pet, damage shields, lots of pet toys, summoned focus items for every need, healthy nukes, and free food and water. Overall I'd have to say Shaman/ Mage is one of the best and most versatile duos in the game. Really Shaman/ almost anything is viable, but this duo really rocks well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nec<br />
<br />
<br />
They can pull anything, better than a monk most of the times due to the fact they can split with FD + HS + Root. <br />
<br />
They can charm which is very very useful, alot of mobs in alot of zones are undead and not only their lvl 65 charm is useful... just got to hunt in places where you can use it. <br />
<br />
Good dmg with pet and dots... and also when you die summon + rez you're good to do. EE's are so cheap now with all the people quitting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Shadowknight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">lvl1- 60 = Monk<br />
monk is great dps and tank, buff them and heal then monk become your best dps pet<br />
<br />
lvl60-65 = paladin<br />
PoP mob hit hard, you need a good tank which can taunt; I choose paladin over SK because they can stun; keep mob stuned untill slow land is huge life saver; they can self buff to aego's hp/ac so only need KEI; they can also rez when thing go bad<br />
<br />
Necro suck, kiting with dot/pet is fast killing but very limit hunting spot, root/dot will killing at same rate as melee partner tank/melee/dot; also you almost can't kill summon mob when duo with necro<br />
<br />
charm is goddly, they basical solo charm and you leech exp, and chanter can do lots better than necro if you want charm partner</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">SK.  You can handle a wider variety of stuff, slowable/rootable or not, you get FD splitting, and in a pinch, both of you can tank.  Being a shaman is all about having options.  This is also the case with being an SK.  The synergy between the two classes in a duoing situation is staggering.<br />
<br />
Regarding charm classes, they are currently way out of balance.  I expect (hope for) a nerf fairly soon.  For this reason I would stay away from making a new toon with the idea of being able to use the high level charms in the manner they are being used now.  If you already have a high-level charm toon, I would say you better use it while you got it, because it ain't gonna last forever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tristarss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">How many times a week does some one post this same exact question?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Atleast 10 times a week I would say this is asked....<br />
<br />
Should find the best post and just sticky the mf'er...<br />
<br />
Run Down of best classes to duo, in no particular order...<br />
<br />
Melee:<br />
Monk<br />
Shadow Knight<br />
Paladin<br />
Ranger<br />
<br />
Casters:<br />
Shaman<br />
Necro<br />
Mage<br />
Enchanter<br />
<br />
Whatever floats your boat man, versatile is a shamans middle name... can make any class good with them really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Top three would be <br />
1) SK<br />
2) Ranger<br />
3) Necro<br />
4) Monk<br />
<br />
However this is just the easy combos.  An even more potent combination (situational) can be made with a charming druid or enchanter, or a mage 55+ with modrod2 (self only now but that is fine).  <br />
<br />
Or a bard can be a great partner for swarm action.  <br />
<br />
Or a paladin can be good if you're going after big game.<br />
<br />
Or a warrior if you are expin in PoP and need a solid tank.<br />
<br />
Or a rogue if you have good AC and don't mind tanking the mobs yourself.<br />
<br />
There is only two classes that we don't &quot;stack&quot; with well and those are wizard and cleric.<br />
<br />
  We have almost nothing to enhance a wizard's abilities, and they have nothing to enhance our own.  We'd be better off soloing individually using our own methods than trying to group.<br />
<br />
Cleric . . just doesn't do any damage to speak of.  They aren't a strong enuf partner to make for efficient duo work.<br />
<br />
Ranger is my current favorite.  Recently me and a non uber 60 ranger have:<br />
1) Duoed down to and killed sebilis fungi king<br />
2) Duoed CT planks and nailed the red swirling mass.<br />
3) Duoed down the well of SG, killed some named seahorse, assorted sirens, etc.<br />
<br />
And I wanna find other things to try that are challenging but possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Knibble Megentlee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well I would have to say ranja,due to the fact my hubby plays  as well and we fight well together.We had learned many ways of fighting.I dont even need my pet now when him and i group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Is funny how much this question is asked. There is no right answer. Alot depends on what the other person playing wants to do. They play their toon right you will have alot of fun and do alot of cool stuff.</div></div><hr />

 :D <br />
<br />
I thought it was funny, anyway :)<br />
<br />
My best experience of duoing has been with a Necro, who charmed a Sun Revenant outside SSra Temple. On his own, he could do well, but with my help, we could circle the entire temple and kill it all, getting back just as it started repopping.<br />
<br />
Kinda breathless, but great fun. We felt a bit greedy when someone came up, started killing stuff, and then told us we were hogging what should be 4 camps... But that's the PnP and camping for you...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Necros beat chanters for soloing for xp with charm, though they have more limited zones.  I agree that making a combo based on charm is, uh, risky at this juncture =)<br />
<br />
The idea that any plate melee has a necro's DPS is just wrong.  The idea that a necro/shaman (higher DPS, no healing required) has the same kill rate as plate/shaman (much lower DPS, significant healing required) it nuts.<br />
<br />
Pre-PoP, solo shamans have two weaknesses:  can't pull tricky spots, need more DPS.<br />
PoP, solo shamans have three weaknesses: can't pull tricky spots, can't tank, need more DPS.<br />
<br />
Necro brings more than enough DPS and some of the best pulling in the game all the way through, and in PoP, you just don't need to tank because xp mobs don't generally summon.  The only time a necro isn't overwhelmingly the best solo class is that period when they deal with non-fearable summoners all the time, and that is the shaman's most powerful soloing period.  A tank in PoP is nice, but not at the cost of gimping your DPS and wasting mana on heals.    <br />
<br />
I have never seen a &quot;you have healed your target for X you have gained experience.&quot;   Have never seen a &quot;you tank evaded a swing you have gained experience&quot; either.  I only seen &quot;mob is dead, here's some experience.&quot;  DPS &gt; all.  <br />
<br />
Mage is an interesting choice, with chain summoning and COTH pulling.  I just don't see the overall utility or sustained DPS I get from a necro, but I have very very little experience duoing with mages.  I'll have to try it soon.</div></div><hr />
