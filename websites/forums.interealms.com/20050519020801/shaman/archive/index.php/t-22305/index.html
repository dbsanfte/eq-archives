My 63 Shaman has been boxing with my 51 Barb warrior, and so far its been pretty sweet..My tank can take the abuse and dishes out some decent damage as well..If my sk were any higher Id do that as well..Just currious to see what class, and or race you would pick to run amok with your shaman if it were only the two of you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>DarkAsh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Your best duo would be shaman/ranger or shaman/bard (Ranger preferred because I'm biased and all other melee classes suck :-D).  DPS, Tank, Snare(probably the 3rd most important thing in a duo behind heal and slow), back-up heal, and lets you get into those mean summoning fights.  People can say what they want about rangers dying a lot but I've tanked Laef Windfall with only a 6.5k buffed ranger.  Now you could use war, sk, rogue, monk, bl, etc.  but they arent as versatile as a bard or ranger.  And dont come with all the little bonuses that add up.  And relying on procs in a fight isnt always your best bet.  Had a group in sol ro the other night and all we had was war, ranger, and a cleric :-p.  War with a ToD, me with a swarmy, and we rocked for about 40 min.  Never died but the beat down sustained while praying for a proc isnt pretty :-)</div></div><hr />

But honestly, I do not think there is a &quot;bad&quot; combo here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then When he started not playing as much and my guild really needed an enchanter I upgraded and moved enchanter off main account to a second box. Got Shaman and enchanter down for lots and lots of levels. <br />
<br />
When Guild got a few chanters and Lost a few tanks. I got a SK up and running On the second account and the sky is the limit now. Shaman is up to almost 400 AA And Shadowknight just Crested 7K Buffed Hps and 98 AA<br />
<br />
The Shadowknight Shaman Combo is more straightforward And lots of fun. But the Enchanter With charm  And VP To deal when Charm breaks is just sickeningly effective. Or Torpor Charm pet when About to invis break And recharm easy as pie.<br />
<br />
<br />
I still play Shadowknight more. Enchanter is just too powerful and too much spiky risk It eaither works incredibly well. Or you die lots and lots.<br />
<br />
The SK is steady smooth sailing. With an occasional fun as hell fight. <br />

<br />
I'm I'm doing harder stuff, I like to duo with a pally.  Great aggro, stuns, rez, pacify pulling, and as a troll shaman, I can snare with my necklace. People tend to like SK's over pally's, but I'm not sure why.  The pally has far better buffs and heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm I'm doing harder stuff, I like to duo with a pally.

The pally has far better buffs and heals.<br />
<br />
Well, my main dual box setup is Shaman/Monk, but I think I know why most shamans prefer SKs to pallies as partners.<br />
<br />
Admittedly, paladins have a few advantages compared to SKs. For starters, you always have a rez if you die in an out of the way place. Rez-on-demand is not to be underestimated, but personally I prefer a standalone level 49 rezbot Cleric. Another pally advantage is decent (and stackable) HP buffing and decent healing. So far, so good.<br />
<br />
On to the &quot;wash&quot; category. Agro-wise, Paladins may be a bit better, but both can keep agro with low level mana efficient spells. Stuns are nice against casters and especially gaters, but higher level mobs are often unstunnable, so it's not quite as big a deal at 65. Finally, Paladins can root park, but Shamans can do it already, so there is little extra functionality there.<br />
<br />
Now, what does a SK bring to the table that a pally doesn't?<br />
<br />
First, FD and all that comes with it - pulling, ability to lose agro on demand, easier travel (especially with their invis and IVU spells), etc. After playing my Monk for 3.5 years, the many uses of FD are hard to live without, although, of course, SKs' FD is not as good as Monks'. When that mob gates on you in the middle of Droga and the Shaman hits Gate in a hurry, would you prefer to have a SK who could quickly FD or a Paladin who could rez himself after the fact?<br />
<br />
Second, Snare. Sure, my Inny-worshipping Troll Shaman has his Snare necklace, but the effect lasts just over half a minute and has to be carefully timed and monitored. Certainly not something that I want to do as a Shaman when there are so many other things that I could be doing. On the other hand, a SK can &quot;snare and forget&quot; - plus it helps him with agro. Oh yes, and not all Shamans have even ghetto Snare :)<br />
<br />
Third, Summon corpse. If I were to die at the Royals in Chardok, it would do me no good to be able to rez myself if I could't get to the corpse. SC on demand makes life much more worry-free when it comes to dungeon crawling.<br />
<br />
Fourth, DPS. A Bazaar equipped SK can do respectable damage with melee, spells and pet. A Bazaar equipped Paladin will lag far behind.<br />
<br />
Finally, pet pulling may get nerfed at some point, but for now it is a great thing, especialy when you can cast Shrew on the pet.<br />
<br />
And as an added bonus, most SKs can easily get that nice Overthere Gate hammer. Admittedly, Paladins can get one too (Malo + Tash + Puppet Strings), but it's a pain. Besides, getting that proc to work at the last moment and appearing at the OT docks with 3% HP and OOM only to be killed by a greenie skelly there is simply embarrassing :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>AtommWarbird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I think the answer to your question is whether or not you're 2-boxing (2 accounts, 1 person) or If you're going to duoing with a friend.<br />
<br />
When doing with a friend I have found it's a toss up between a druid and a beastlord.  Druids are great because you get Mana Regen, travel (ports, etc..), and good kiting skills.  Beastlords are good because you get lesser mana regen, a tank (of sorts) and fantastic DPS. <br />
<br />
If you're 2boxing, I think it depends on whether or not you want to &quot;bot&quot; the Shaman or the other class.  When botting the Shaman I think an Enchanter is one of the best classes.  Pacify, Mana Regen, Charm, Haste, etc.... just can't be beat.  If you're planning on botting the Shaman I think that a Shadow Knight is an excellent choice.  Snare, FD pulling, Life/mana taps, etc...<br />
<br />
Personally I 4box a Shaman, Pally, Enchanter and Magician.  Mages are great to bot and with the recent changes their pets are awesome once you get a Diamond Prism of Companionship.</div></div><hr />

My choices are Ranger bard and cleric.  All lvl 62   I am a lvl 65 shm 525 aa and all pop spells.  No flags.<br />

Unless i chose the cleric the shaman would have to because a bot because of only one computer.<br />

If you all had this choice what would you pick?   Help me please.  Thank you<br />

<br />
duo'd in tactics with a 65 wiz the other night. quad kiting with snare and his aoe nukes with me dotting. easy.<br />
<br />
enchanter with dire charm...crowd control, mana regen, big nasty pet that you can buff the snot out of (vallon's, focus, our ac buff, diaku, replenishment, and ferine avatar) to make it a death machine. not much you can't kill with the right dc pet. best friend in rl has 65 enc, we do this all the time.<br />
<br />
sk...one of my other best friends has a 60 sk (can't wait for him to hit 65 WOOHOOO...sorry...got carried away...). have to agree that SK may be the single best duo with shammy in terms of constant high performance. in certain zones and situations other classes may be better partner for us, but sks are a class we can pretty much always do well with.<br />
<br />
warrior. pretty straight forward, obvious.<br />
<br />
wizard. duo'd with one last night in Tactics. met him, talked for a minute or two...next thing i know we're quad kiting diakus with snare, aoe nukes, and dots. big mess, lots of laughs. <br />
<br />
necro...can kite, can get dc pet and go nuts, whatever--easy partner. <br />
<br />
beastlord. absolutely awesome. only trick is pulling in some zones, but awesome partner. 65 bst friend and i are going to take a crack at &quot;an evolved burrower&quot; for kicks in next couple days.<br />
<br />
those are just my favorites. have duo'd BoT a few times with an elemental/time geared monk before w/o problems also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>CollectraBB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">My favorite duo is kinda old school, buts its Shaman/monk.

I two-box my shaman/sk combo quite often, and agree with everything that Scalia said on Paladins versus SKs with a few caveats.  SK DPS is greater than a Paladin's, but it is also really no greater than Warrior DPS (except at bazaar level where SK &gt; War DPS), so I'm not sure if I'd call it respectable.  And as for Paladin buffs, while they will certainly max your HP higher (and much better healing for when it hits the fan), those extra HP are of limited use wth Shaman healing.  What will help though, is the fact that the SK will have about 100 more AC on average over the Paladin.   The SK can add about FT9 on average to the shaman mana regen rate through ZB, and can lich for KEI-like mana regen for himself, which means that both classes have some nice methods for increasing mana regen and going KEI-less is less painfull.  And while a rez is nice, EXP loss is no big deal, just go 10%/90%AA until you max your EXP again.  And, of course, GY zones means it much easier to buy a rez or two if you really want (while negating summon corpse too, so this is arguably a wash).  The above mostly pertains to level 65 in retrospect.<br />
<br />
Snare and FD were the primary reasons for pairing a SK with my shaman.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Seremont</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Funny, there are similar threads on the bard board, and shammy's always mentioned, though bards can do most of what shammys can, so it's not universally chosen to duo. Having a 65 bard and being a mod for the bard boards, I made a shammy initially to test the theory of a two-box duo. Must say my cleric duo is easier, but I find my shammy much more versitile and fun.  Only problem with two boxing with a bard is all the twisting.  Mostly need a two-box that can be hotkey'd to do just about everything. Shammies are good for that, and even at lower levels, our pets can do serious damage though not take it very well. Shammie heals at lower levels are not very good to keep a fairly squishy bard alive, but at higher levels that wouldn't be a problem.  I was hoping a monk combo would be nice, as I know a disgruntled monk, but it seems that's not going to work after reading here.  <br />
<br />
I must say something I haven't seen much so far. I've been duoing with a necro for the last 5 or so levels, and OMG it's cool. No downtime and constant slaughter.  We get Seremont a level a night + if we're working our magic in Nardox.  Fun fun fun! So that's my choice. My necro's nekid and 36, or I'd two box, hehe.<br />

<br />
It's still workable, just not as good as it was 2 years ago. I dual box a mostly Bazaar Shaman/Monk combo and there are certain advantages that I miss when I don't have a Monk around, especially their superior FD, Stonestance and the irresistable lull. But they certainly lack in the HP, agro and defense departments compared to the plate classes. It's not even that Monks take more damage over time than the knights, it's that the damage that they take is so spikey that you have to heal them more on non-trivial  content. Of course, anything can be overcome by pouring tons of HP on it, but it's not an option that I have.<br />
<br />
Oh well, I am working on a SK right now, we'll see how he will turn out...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>perceus_eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Shaman/Necro.  Necro solo is better than most combos mentioned, let alone adding malos/Q/bane/BoS/BoU/dog dog to the equation.  Boxing necro and shaman at tables I can keep about 18 spawns clear...PoWater boxing is even better, because necro fire-based dots are insanely good...i guess not as good against summoning mobs, but if you can heal a tank in a duo against a mob, a necro can taptank with Q kept up just as well and still do better dps. 2 necros and a shaman can manage the summoning 1 group type named in fire with ease (decent elemental gear for the kiter, but nothing too crazy for a fire flagged character).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I mainly duo a shaman/monk.  I love it.  But a little-used duo that I also use is shaman/wizard... anyplace the shaman can tank and keep himself healed is a viable location to duo a shaman/wizard.  Pull with Malos, slow, cripple and DoT... then make sure you got Q on yourself and then let 'er rip with the wizard.  Surprisingly effective, at least in out-door zones.</div></div><hr />
