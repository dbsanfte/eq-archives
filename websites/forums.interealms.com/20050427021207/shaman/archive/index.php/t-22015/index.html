<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">me and my friend r making new chars (well he is) and is a necro.. and we r going to group til 65 (we r irl friends).. well..  do yall know any good places to duo at 10-20..? thanx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kellenial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd consider trying Kurn's Tower. Decent experience there, necros have spells that can affect undead, and get him a lot of bone chips to boot. After that, Unrest as well for similar reasons, although the experience is less there. Shamans can layer on nicely in most zones of this level, so better to play up to the necromancer's strong points, IMO.<br />
<br />
Paludal is the typical &quot;push thru&quot; zone, but if you want skill increases while you learn and level, perhaps it's best to look elsewhere. On the other hand, if you're willing to take the time afterwards to skill up, you might choose this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">kurn's tower sounds good.. i prob wont be going to pc since ive been going there with every char i have but me and him r mostly looking to duo and if we r up to it getting a group.. what place is nice to goto after kurn's tower xp is bad for duoing? thanx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kellenial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Unrest or Mistmoore</div></div><hr />
