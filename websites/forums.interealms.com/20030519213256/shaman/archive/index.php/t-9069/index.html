<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beranor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm wondering if these guys can be single pulled and at what level.  Would be nice to solo the crypt for some drops at some points.  Especially for a JBB.  <br />
<br />
Another question.  Is there any way to sneak into the room where JBB drops and sit there and kill the guy over and over, just him?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">ICG's don't see invis :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Beranor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">will they heal the named through the wall? and which guy drops JBB?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Beranor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">found out that arch duke iatol drops JBB.  <br />
<br />
one last question, if I was to fight down to crypt, invis on stairs, walk up into a room and then kill a PH or whoever.  would i then be able to single an ICG from there, or fight it on its spawn and not agro the other one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>celebel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ok, this is my hunting ground, so I know it well:<br />

1) if you can arrive to crypt solo, you are already quite good, because after pyramid door (you need to picklock it with a rogue), there is a room with 3 undead frogs + greenie pets + 1 or 2 roamers...that s the difficult spot to cross.<br />
<br />
2) once you get at crypt there is one frog roamer, PH of the crypt guardian...you can fight it in stairs or pull it to tunnel. There are also 2 frogs in the small room with the skeletal NPC for monk quest (that one is indiff), but normally those do not aggro if you don t go too close.<br />
<br />
3) ICG: one on each side of the 4R room: once you enter the room they aggro you...I don't think it is possible tu rush left or right without aggroing one...never really tried...but I don't think it s worth taking the risk...if they dont see invis, it is probably possible to fight them on their spot or in corner without aggroing the other one.<br />
<br />
they do CH, so you should make them cast a lot to use their mana, they don t have so much...<br />
<br />
usually we do it with a chanter: start with ToT, put Torment of argli, cast ToT at the end, and let mob cast some times during fight =&gt; it will be oom at the end and won t CH...if it tries, just mezz/bash him to interrupt casting.<br />
<br />
one they are cleared, with 2 people you can clear the 4 rooms and med enough to get enough mana before ICG repop.<br />
<br />
If your mana pool is not high enough, chanter can cast bedlam on you and you canni yourself...that s 200 mana from him for 193 mana for you or something like that, nearly full mana transfer...interesting....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have yet to single pull them at 62. <br />
<br />
Also I have noticed that I will get adds pulling light blues (in seb for example). The level for single pulls is not the same level for blue con mobs once you hit 61. If that makes any sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ahh you are all so priveleged, i logged in just to reply to this thread.<br />
<br />
Well, the other noght after some 4r killing, i decided to try sitting in the Dukes room before he spawned. He spawned, and i got no aggro (woohoo!) I chose then to log in the corner of his room, and then try to kill him as i logged on. Well, discovering that you need to be shrunk to not draw aggro, i was immediately engaged as i logged in. After a minor hiccup while fighting the PH (i.e. ISP disconnected) i managed to kill a skeletal duke, and i sat and medded then camped out for 20 minutes (25 minute respawn). I camped in, summoned pet, buffed, medded etc and waited. Pop! Arch Duke Iatol (you beauty). Ok, i wasnt shrunk and was immediately engaged. Whack, ~861 point Harm Touch. With Potc on, i was ok. I slowed, healed myself and set about meleeing/applying dots etc. Finally killed him, and since he was holding it, i knew he had the Ykesha weapon. <br />
<br />
So basically a few points:<br />
1) At 56, the HT is quite nasty to log into if he was up when you first log in<br />
2) IGC's dont CH, add, or 'guard' at all. You are left alone all the time in the room.<br />
3) I had no aego, but had KEI. I was about 2600hp i think, and i ended most of the fights with 50% HP and 40% mana.<br />
<br />
So i assume if you camped IVU in the dukes room, you would be very nicely prepared to kill. Also, if IGC's dont see invis... then you walk across (shrunk of course, as well as invis) into all 4 room and can kill all the PH's and named if they are up... then start cycle again as it would take approx 25 mins.<br />
<br />
Youve given me a fantastic idea! I will make some more IVU potions and give this a whirl!!! Hope my info helps you.</div></div><hr />
