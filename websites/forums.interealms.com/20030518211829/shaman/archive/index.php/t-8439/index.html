<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mukguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can anyone please give me some upgrade advice please.<br />
<br />
Some of my non major slots I am unsure about.<br />
Please see my sig for the magelo profile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">face=crystal spider eyes (cheap upgrade)<br />
rings= get 2 6ac/65hp jewcrafted rings and replace the wis.<br />
legs=kromriff military leggs quest<br />
shield=sarnak battle shield<br />
boots=ditch the druid/caster boots even for your black fur boots, or better still, IF you can manage it, the boots out of CT (slime covered or rubicite, whatever)<br />
<br />
Overall, you'll lose a lot of wis and mana, but you'll gain HP and AC.  With the fungi, your mana pool should be fine with cann.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fumeden Ex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Id go with coldain skin gloves or shissar scaled gauntlets also.  and if you can get a group in ME or just hang out when someone is killing vampyres, they drop a pair of boots that are no drop ac12 +4 to all stats pretty often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd say you are pretty well set, you have items I can only dream of :) Start working on your epic, the shield of falsehood is easily soloable and is a nice upgrade to the CGS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In Addition to what's been posted:<br />
<br />
Range:  Goranga Idol<br />
Earring: Any of the Chardok drops ... like Earring of Twisted Leaves.    <br />
Feet:  JB boots first - they are cheap.   But better to pick up Hate boots ... plus any other Hate drops ...  for the turn in via PoK for exp at the very least.<br />
Bracer:   Any of the dragonhorn bracers - may be a bit pricey for you<br />
Face:   Enshrouded Veil  - pretty cheap <br />
<br />
<br />
But as a Troll myself ... I started working on natural resists ... mostly on Fire Resists.    With a starting fire resist of 5 as a Troll ... there is only so much you can do with the standard resist gear.   Things like SBS shield will help a bunch for you.   Lodi shield for your back is helpful as well (AC, HP, Mana, stat's, EB, and resists).     There are also things like the following which you can quest for or loot at your lvl.<br />
<br />
Range: Stone of Morid<br />
Hands: Ogre Butcher gloves or Saprophyte spore gloves<br />
Head:   Crown of the Froglok Kings<br />
Feet:  Tribal War Boots</div></div><hr />
