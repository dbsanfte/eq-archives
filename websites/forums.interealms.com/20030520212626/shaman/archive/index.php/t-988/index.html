<br />
I was wondering if anyone has done the Emerald Dragonscale Tunic Quest and if so, can you tell me what was needed to take out Wuoshi?<br />
<br />
I hear it is like Naggy, but I would like to know how many groups will be needed and at what levels, and what do I need to do to spawn him? <br />
<br />
I was told this chest piece is the best a Shaman can get unless without spending 15,000pp or more?<br />
<br />
Thank you all,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At level 54 you will spend most of the fight against Woushi stunned and unable to move or cast. You need people high enough level to resist enough of her spells to actualy fight. A couple real good groups of 60's or more. I have heard rumours of one group doing her...but that is exceptional if true. <br />
<br />
It's a nice BP but unless you have some strong friends just buy it. They were around 15k last time I looked...not sure what they go for now. <br />
<br />
How to spawn Woushi? Someone please correct me if I am wrong...but I dont think you can spawn her. You just need to wait till she pops and get her before someone else does. <br />
<br />
A fungi would be alot better btw...but alot more expensive now. You would need fewer people to actualy camp the fungi or do the FG caller quest than to kill Woushi.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Killing Woushi was a guild grouping for us on Innourrk server, we killed her with about 5 groups with a full spread from 50 to 60.  She proc's an AE 360 degree stun about every 3 seconds so if you take longer than that to cast your not getting anything off.  We didn't wait for any MT agro situation, we just zerg'd her and she went down with no casualties.  We can do it with less but I'm not sure what any minimum number of people is for any given level.<br />
<br />
The Emerald Dragonscale Tunic (BP) is (from memory)<br />
Ac22 Wis20 Cha10 Save disease10 and another save +10.<br />
<br />
It still runs 15k to 20k and can be bought.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I traded my EDT for a Shield of Bane Warding recently. Once I got a Fungi tunic, I never wore the EDT. I replaced the 20 WIS on the tunic with the Shield, and it looks damn cool to boot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">2 groups of 60's or near there can do it pretty easily, we did it with 2.5 one night.  The stuns are a bitch, keep your resists HIGH, and have a bard / necro / shaman for max resists.<br />
<br />
Can probably do it with 1 group, but it'd be a long fight, and if you were unlucky with bad stuns things would go downhill fast.</div></div><hr />
