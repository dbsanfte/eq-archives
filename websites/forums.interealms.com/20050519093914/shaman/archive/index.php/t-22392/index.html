<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Faern made a quote in another thread on here about how Shaman seem to think we need to do everything the hard way etc.<br />
And it made me think of this Monty Python sketch. <br />
<br />
<br />
Eric Idle: Very fussable, isn't it? Very fussable.<br />
<br />
All: Right, all right.<br />
<br />
Graham Chapman: Good glass of Chƒteau de Chasselas, ain't just that, sire?<br />
<br />
Terry Jones: Oh, you're right there, Obadiah.<br />
<br />
Graham Chapman: Right.<br />
<br />
Eric Idle: Who would have thought, thirty years ago, we'd all be sitting here drinking Chateau de Chaselet, eh?<br />
<br />
All: Aye, aye.<br />
<br />
Michael Palin: Them days we were glad to have the price of a cup of tea.<br />
<br />
Graham Chapman: Right! A cup of cold tea!<br />
<br />
Michael Palin: Right!<br />
<br />
Eric Idle: Without milk or sugar!<br />
<br />
Terry Jones: Or tea!<br />
<br />
Michael Palin: In a cracked cup and all.<br />
<br />
Eric Idle: Oh, we never used to have a cup! We used to have to drink out of a rolled-up newspaper!<br />
<br />
Graham Chapman: The best we could manage was to suck on a piece of damp cloth.<br />
<br />
Terry Jones: But you know, we were happy in those days, although we were poor.<br />
<br />
Michael Palin: Because we were poor!<br />
<br />
Terry Jones: Right!<br />
<br />
Michael Palin: My old dad used to say to me: &quot;Money doesn't bring you happiness, son!&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric Idle: He was right!<br />
<br />
Michael Palin: Right!<br />
<br />
Eric Idle: I was happier then and I had nothing! We used to live in this tiny old tumbled-down house with great big holes in <br />
<br />
the roof.<br />
<br />
Graham Chapman: House! You were lucky to live in a house! We used to live in one room, all twentysix of us, no furniture, <br />
<br />
half the floor was missing, we were all huddled together in one corner for fear of falling.<br />
<br />
Terry Jones: You were lucky to have a room! We used to have to live in the corridor!<br />
<br />
Michael Palin: Oh, we used to dream of living in a corridor! Would have been a palace to us! We used to live in an old <br />
<br />
watertank on a rubbish tip. We'd all woke up every morning by having a load of rotten fish dumped all over us! House, huh!<br />
<br />
Eric Idle: Well, when I say a house, it was just a hole in the ground, covered by a sheet of tarpaulin, but it was a house to us!<br />
<br />
Graham Chapman: We were evicted from our hole in the ground. We had to go and live in a lake!<br />
<br />
Terry Jones: You were lucky to have a lake! There were 150 of us living in a shoebox in the middle of the road!<br />
<br />
Michael Palin: A cardboard box?<br />
<br />
Terry Jones: Aye!<br />
<br />
Michael Palin: You were lucky! We lived for three months in a rolled-up newspaper in a septic tank! We used to have to go <br />
<br />
up every morning, at six o'clock and clean the newspaper, go to work down the mill, fourteen hours a day, week in, week out, <br />
<br />
for six pence a week, and when we got home, our dad would slash us to sleep with his belt!<br />
<br />
Graham Chapman: Luxury! We used to have to get up out of the lake at three o'clock in the morning, clean the lake, eat a <br />
<br />
handful of hot grubble, work twenty hours a day at mill, for two pence a month, come home, and dad would beat us around <br />
<br />
the head and neck with a broken bottle, if we were lucky!<br />
<br />
Terry Jones: Well, of course, we had it tough! We used to have to get up out of the shoebox in the middle of the night, and <br />
<br />
lick the road clean with our tongues! We had to eat half a handful of freezing cold grubble, work twenty-four hours a day at <br />
<br />
mill for four pence every six years, and when we got home, our dad would slice us in two with a breadknife!<br />
<br />
Eric Idle: Right! I had to get up in the morning, at ten o'clock at night, half an hour before I went to bed, eat a lump of cold <br />
<br />
poison, work twenty-nine hours a day down mill and pay millowner for permission to come to work, and when we got home, <br />
<br />
our dad would kill us and dance about on our graves, singing Hallelujah!<br />
<br />
Michael Palin: Aah. Are you trying to tell the young people of today that, and they won't believe you!<br />
<br />
All: No, no they won't!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">AHAHA, that's exactly what I thought of, too!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">that conversation could easily be replaced by a bunch of people from any class complaining about how badly they have it in relation to everyone else.<br />
<br />
never saw the sketch, but those guys could have collectively been called &quot;forumites&quot;.<br />
<br />
good laugh :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">LOL I think your transcription has some trouble with Britticisms, or at least British accents.<br />
<br />
In the first paragraph, it should be &quot;Passable&quot;, not &quot;Fussable&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;hot grubble&quot; should be &quot;hot gravel&quot;.<br />
<br />
Good sketch though.</div></div><hr />

Bah why should us Brits dumb everything down for our non English speaking Amreican cousins. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Seriously though just cut and pasted this from the original script wasnt till after i posted it i wondered if it would make any sense to Americans.<br />

<br />
While not really class-specific, the one big &quot;in my days&quot; experience that I always think of is travel.<br />
<br />
In my days, we didn't haaave the Plane of Knowledge, or Gate potions, or port stones.  No, we had to spend fifteen hours looking for druid so we could cyber them for a port  . . . and we liked it!</div></div><hr />
