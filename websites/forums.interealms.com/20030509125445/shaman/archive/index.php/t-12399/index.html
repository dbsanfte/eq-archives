<br />
<br />
<br />
And just THINK of the publicity, WHEN (and I feel it in my gut he will) do a Page 8 on the board!   We'll be FAAAAAMOUS!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">ok, i'll resist my impulse to send this to the grey to be FAIR (i guess).  doesn't mean others will play ball though ;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Soupuppy got banned? What did he get banned for?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fardadar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">souppypoopy may be a loudmouth and an ass but this time I agree with him. <br />
I went back and found the thread about the whole engagement ring thing I see his complaint.<br />
 I have no respect for anyone that uses what they have done for a community to exploit it in that way.<br />
<br />
I do wish sunmoon the best of luck on his marriage and thank him for all he has done for the community.  <br />
However the genie is out of the bottle and you can&#8217;t put it back now I think you made a bad  choice  sunmoon but it&#8217;s too late to take it back now. You have lost the respect may people had for you with this and that&#8217;s just a shame.<br />
<br />
That&#8217;s all I have to say you may proceed to flame away , neg rep ,ban me now but I stand by what I say for what it&#8217;s worth to you.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">*shrug*<br />
<br />
Soupy had the opportunity to profess his disatisfaction with the donation drive in the original thread.  He was a total dick to bring it up again in a thread which had nothing to do with the ring itself but only Sunmoon's happiness at proposing to his fiancee. <br />
<br />
I fully support the ban, life is too short to let negative *******s dump all over joyous occasions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fardadar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">hehe i think sun was right to ban him to. like i was saying soup is an ass but thats not my point. ah well :)<br />
(as a note to soup you are an ass, i still like you in game but you shoot your mouth off to mutch for your own good)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Soupy was being an ass for the last month+ and I think it is perfectly fine considering how hard he rode sunmoon... I mean what would you think would happen if you constantly tailgated a cop flashing your brights?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">However the genie is out of the bottle and you can’t put it back now I think you made a bad choice sunmoon but it’s too late to take it back now.

<br />
<br />
You what? What genie? What bottle? Maybe the bottle that you've been drinking out of...and the blue, pink, luminescent genies that are a result of your delusional posture. <br />
<br />
As far as I'm concerned there ain't anything wrong with sunmoon asking for donations, for *anything*. This guy has given thousands, yep literally, thousands of people the number one Everquest class board around...and then people whine when he asks (thats right 'ASKS' not begs) for a little bit back in return. Hell man, think about it. If it wasn't for the fact that he has to pay the upkeep for this board, he may very well have been able to fund the extra couple of stones on his ring himself. <br />
<br />
If I was Sunmoon, I'd whip all of your accounts into the Banned bin. Period. And then pull my pants down and procede to offload my (recently digested) Mcdonalds on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fardadar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">(edit not letting myself get drawn into a flame fest)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Mozeley you are entitled to your opinion on the mater as am I. I never implied that sun begged for anything and my post was a Statement  of my opinion not a whine. <br />
sun is a grown man he dosent need you to defend his Choices. <br />
thats the last i will coment on this.<br />
<br />
I didn't say you weren't entitled to your opinion, just that I don't agree with it.<br />
<br />
My comments were really just as a result of the combination of different posts from different people about this. Not just yours in particular. <br />
<br />
I come from an Italian family where respect for other people is the number one priority. When I see someone be disrespectful to other people it gets up my nose, and I will defend that person with every ounce of my being, whether the person in question can defend themselves or not.<br />
<br />
And.....I'll comment on this situation for as long as I have a comment to make. Not when I become upset because people disagree with me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I am not soupy.  I don't have a ****ing clue who soupy is.  Matter of fact, f_u_c_k soupy.  hey, I don't even know him and I'll act like I hate him just as much as the rest of you guys!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So HAH!!! How's that for you have no f'ing clue who this is!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
And you....well you are crazy. If you're not soupy then you're some weird guy who gets kicks out of being strange.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If soup would atleast admit it was not the right place for it and appoligize and be mature about it. I see no reason to keep him baned <br />
. We all make mistakes. Ill live either way though.<br />
<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
<br />
if petey is soup i change my vote btw :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fare enough I respect your opinion on this.<br />
<br />
 Now can we all agree that someone needs to ban this petey222<br />
 f**khead asap?  :D<br />
<br />
My comments were really just as a result of the combination of different posts from different people about this. Not just yours in particular.. as an explanation for why im bringing this up now(my first post) this is all new news to me so the whole thing was a bit of a shock to me ill get over it.<br />
<br />
 I didn't see all the posts buy Sir spam alot before I shot off my mouth on the folow up post hence the delete. I can see were you would be a bit peved after reading all that crap. :(</div></div><hr />

Please yes, ok, new plan to kick petey's ass.  Lets all login and group up.  Maybe in Halas.  Yes, HALAS!!! We will all get on the ferry.  From there, we will transfuse through the Verant servers, and our REAL characters will come to life.  We will then hunt petey until he is dead.  Our clan will kill him with no remorse!!!!<br />

QUOTE]<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm sure someone would've been able to notice the slight sarcasm in my statement.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
edit:  simply removig the profanity from the quote, nothing else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Ignoring Mr. Troll there...<br />
<br />
The forums are Sunmoon's ball, and he has the right to take it and go home, but it doesn't stop other people from thinking that he might be being petty.<br />
<br />
Soupy was obnoxious, and he obviously does not care for the diamond industry, but he didn't say jack **** worthy of a ban, unless those posts were edited for content.  The reason Sunmoon gave, 'I'm sick of you being a complete ass towards me on these boards and I don't have to put up with it.&quot; pretty much goes along with the ball analogy, heh.<br />
<br />
About the best I expect from this post is to be completely ignored, but hey, I just ate some pasta and I can't sleep quite yet.<br />
<br />
PS:  If you people think that troll is soupypoopy, well, you're less cynical than I am.  What immediately leaps to my mind is, 'Some twit trying to make soupypoopy look like an ass.' but I guess I've just seen 9 too many imitation trolls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">you guys still wanna unban him?  i just edited 20 posts filled with profanty. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Wudoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I don't believe in censorship...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">/rm wonders why his sarcastic thread is being taken seriously<br />
<br />
Look, only one cool guy named himself after his pet, and Soupuppy is no Indiana Jones!  I think that he thinks he's some kind of EQ Eminem wannabe.  I don't like the music or the attitude and have to admit that at least Eminem has TALENT.  We're well rid of Soupunky, even though he's going to keep popping up with other names (banning his IP may have a better effect......  MAY)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Fardadar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">/rm wonders why his sarcastic thread is being taken seriously<br />
<br />
<br />
But no one has actually asked for soup to be unbaned have they?  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">you guys still wanna unban him?  i just edited 20 posts filled with profanty. :p<br />
<br />
Nope, keep banned i says :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I don't believe in censorship...<br />
<br />
If someone came to your house ( this is sunmoons ) and dumped garbage on your lawn and then took a big crap on your porch then curse you out only to leave and come back later to do the same .....<br />
<br />
<br />
At what point does your rights out weigh his freedom to not be censored ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">this topic isn't debatable.  Sunmoon banned him.<br />
<br />
the end.</div></div><hr />
