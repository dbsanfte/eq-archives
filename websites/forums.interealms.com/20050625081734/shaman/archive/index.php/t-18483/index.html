<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just recently maxed alchemy, with GM trophy, and I'm cruising pretty good on money.  I'm still in the red in relation to how much I spent to get to this point, but every single combine I do is profit.  I have no inventory sitting on mules devaluing, failed combines don't cost me a cent in replenishment, and I don't have the aggravation of trying to sell potions on the blue moon when someone will wander into the bazaar and give random_undescribed_potion_01 a glug glug. <br />
<br />
At the risk of sounding like Don LePre (&quot;With just a tiny little ad...!&quot;) -- how do I do this?<br />
<br />
I keep no inventory on hand.  I don't pre-combine very pricey potions like gate, greater concentration, etc.  That's basically it.  I have a couple hotkeys set up on hotbank 8 that spam a /ooc and a message into the bazaar channel saying I'm a GM Alchemist with GM trophy offering my services.  I announce that I'm selling such and such potions, some pricey, some not-so-pricey, with very brief descriptions (FT2/3, SoW, DS, ITU, Invis, Gate, Port).<br />
<br />
When I get a nibble, I tell the customer they can either:<br />
<br />
1).  Buy the components themselves.  I give them the list of components and where they can find them.  I'll even go with them, or <br />
<br />
2).  Have them give me the money to buy exclusively the components, and no more.<br />
<br />
Once we get the components into my medicine bag, I invite the person into my group so they can watch failures or combines.  I charge a sliding-scale fee depending on the potion for successes.  Gate and FT potions are a certain amount, Invis is a certain amount, insta-heal is a certain amt., etc.  This way, I'm not stuck with a surplus inventory that I just can't offload.  I'm not stuck with supplies in my bag if a customer changes their mind mid-transaction, which would ultimately lead to having potions that I can't offload.<br />
<br />
edit:  Another thing I try to avoid is charging a fee greater than the component cost.  For example with decent charisma the FT3 components cost ~85pp for one dose.  I charge less than that.  Which is more than I charge for a SoW combine, but less than I charge for a gate combine.<br />
end edit<br />
<br />
Charging for only successful combines makes them feel (accurately) like they're not paying for sucky RNG rolls. <br />
<br />
So to sum up:<br />
<br />
1.  Have customer pay for components outright, either directly (buying themselves) or indirectly (fronting you the money to buy)<br />
<br />
2.  Charge per successful combine, and everyone walks away happy.<br />
<br />
P.S.  For the love of god don't tell them the name of the potion unless they ask.  You know someone is sitting in the bazaar with a 10 dose potion that costs atleast 850pp to make for 400pp cuz they're tired of selling it.    I know that if the customer is in the bazaar and they ask me the name of the potion, I probably lost the sale.  But at least I haven't lost plat. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps ease some of the pain.</div></div><hr />

So you're selling drastically below cost, unless it's something at the bottom of the trivial scale, like sow.  Each to their own, I suppose.  Maybe I'm misunderstanding what you're trying to say, but it sounds like you're providing a free service, and eating the failures out of your own bank.<br />
<br />
It's noble and all, but it's not striking me as advice in particular.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Maybe he means that he only charges for the potions he makes successfully, and since they have already payed for the ingredients, he's making a little money on only those he actually is successful in creating. So if he fails, he loses no money, but gains none since he failed. Therefore, the only loss of plat is the amount spent on the components, which he didn't pay fer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cateye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Doesn't sound like you make lots of money... no offense, but do you do combines for fun or for profit?<br />
<br />
I also rarely precombine since I hate to burry that much money...<br />
What I usually do is ooc that I make potions on demand. In the ooc I only list the better potions like Gate, Illus and Awareness. For low level potions like SoW I redirect people to either a low lvl shammy if one is oocing too or to the bazaar... I simply hate to waste my time for 30 or 40pp profit.<br />
<br />
All you need for this is around 4k in the bank which is not much imo.<br />
For bigger orders I demand money in advance (like those 20 10 shot awareness4 I made a while ago, I was simply not willing to make combines worth 40k off my own money, just imagine the orderer goes LD...).<br />
<br />
This way I made around 20k profit in 2 nights while I was chatting, cleaning the house and doing other stuff... just spamming PoK every 10 or 20min.<br />
<br />
Edit: I offer potions at a fixed price but high enough that I do not lose money on fails. So the customer knows what he pays, fails are nothing he has to worry about.</div></div><hr />

LaughingWoman how could you interpret this as me taking a loss?  Furthermore, do you think I'm that stupid that I would post an article on how to lose money in alchemy?  Common sense should dictate that you're missing something, not that I'm a complete idiot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Saldaora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't get this either...<br />
<br />
Was this your strategy to gain levels?  Or is this your strategy to make money?  Cause I don't see how you're making money either.<br />
<br />
If they buy the components and give them to you for combine, do you then charge them the mark-up?<br />
<br />
So little monk buys components for 10 sow potions, gives them to you, you make 9 and fail 1, and you then give him the potions for 5 pp per, so 45pp?<br />
<br />
So you make 45pp, they pay 45+component cost and get 9 potions?<br />
<br />
If so, then that makes sense :)<br />
<br />
If not, then I just don't get it :)</div></div><hr />
