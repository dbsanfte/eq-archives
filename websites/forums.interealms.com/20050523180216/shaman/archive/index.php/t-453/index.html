<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fulgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know.... this is a to often asked question but...<br />
<br />
I recently returned to the game (Although couldn't get my 55th shaman back and had to restart.)...<br />
<br />
<br />
The first few times I went through my current level.. I was in Cazic...<br />
<br />
I am moderately twinked.....<br />
<br />
Got alot of my stuff replaced by my guild...<br />
<br />
I am 28th level Barbarian Shaman... Barbie again.. I know... hehe<br />
<br />
Last night I was getting a blue per kill in Sol A ....<br />
<br />
I need to rejoin my guild at raiding level as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
So my question is... where do I solo... and Where is the best place a Druid can PL me...<br />
<br />
I sometimes feel bad about getting leveled but the guild promised to get me to raiding level as soon as possibe.<br />
<br />
The druid... does not have Luclin but does have Kunark and Vel.. so any suggestions.... Thanks in advance...<br />
