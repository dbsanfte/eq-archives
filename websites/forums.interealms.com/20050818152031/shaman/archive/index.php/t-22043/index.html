On page 2, Ashlanne mentions how the community relations team is trying to get the devs to define the roles of each class.  Will be very interesting to see what they have to say.</div></div><hr />

We have requested them for each class and I do think it will happen soon.   Now defining soon is a different story.   <br />

Sounds like you've already given up.  Why still play, if this is the case?<br />
<br />
I for one am very excited to see Brenlo having posted several times in the last few days over here.  I'm looking forward to getting some feedback, even if it does take some time.  You roll your beastlord, I'm going to hang with it, keep casting Q, and make use of the small amount of restored faith I have, and give em another month or so.  The summit really seems to have made an impact, even if it wasn't a huge one.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the reply Brenlo, and it would be really great if they reinstituted some form of &quot;The Vision&quot; (TM hehe).  People whined about it being restrictive back then, but now a lot of people I know miss it, as a general guideline for the classes' roles and how they mesh is very important and very helpful, and helps ensure that relative class group desirability does not fluctuate as much as it could otherwise, in my opinion.<br />
<br />
It's also something that could take awhile, since it deals with ALL classes... but I remain hopeful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>beriah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Lol Slim, do you work for Sony? :)<br />
<br />
I have no given up, but having spent 5 years playing, I might just be a bit frustrated.<br />
<br />
I agree its really super cool that Brenlo and the devs are reading our forums, and the HoT changes were def. needed.<br />
<br />
Sadly there have not been any shammy specific talk yet.. but I am still waiting :)</div></div><hr />

You just did, FYI. Here, have some pudding.<br />
<br />
I agree with Gart, and I also like what Slim said. I'm not quite so optimistic as Slim is, but I do greatly appreciate the new communication that's been taking place on these boards with the SOE folks. It's encouraging. To log Wednesday night and play with a 420 HP/tick Q was great, and to see all the player issues that were corrected and patched in was great, as well (BTW, puppy is wondering about his shrink, Brenlo. I'm running out of treats with which to pacify him ...). To think that this is only the beginning is exciting, but I do take it with a grain of salt. It's been long, too long in coming. You can't blame the devs, I expect, for working for people that won't let them do as they wish with the games design, but a LOT of folks have spoken with their wallets the last few months. Change is coming, but change has an incredibly frustrating way of being slow and difficult. Patience, grasshoppers.<br />

<br />
Actually having given this more thought.. it was not really a bad idea.. they just ran out of tasks to do.. which has been said before.<br />
<br />
The key problem is that BL as a hybrid is basically better than both of the classes its a hybrid of.<br />
<br />
That said, I dont wanna be a BL.. :) <br />
<br />
Every time I say BL are more powerfull / get more groups I am not really saying I want to be one.. I am just saying again and again we need fixing.. if we dont continue the communication and postings saying so, Sony will figure that upping our HoT was the end all fix and that we are all happy.</div></div><hr />

Why not just tell us it may take a while? Or even admit the devs are not quite sure themselves? Or maybe just tell us that you have no real influence on how soon you will get that description?<br />
<br />
No, we get fed some &quot;soon, but that does not mean soon, it could mean anything really&quot; line.<br />
<br />
I thought that being ignored was about the worst thing Brenlo could think of but this tops it. That is pseudo-language worthy of any politician.</div></div><hr />

We still have the same abilities, we just don't make the same difference it used to.  I can't bring myself to believe that &quot;slowing&quot; will not continue to be our class definition (Other than buffs, but my 2 year old can buff a group).  They have been stubborn about giving us worthwhile heals and DPS, so you would have to assume that we will still be a &quot;debuff&quot; class of some sort.<br />
<br />
Unresistable 75% slow.<br />
<br />
Yes, it is overpowering for Old World Content, but every class is these days.  SOE has already flagged the mobs they don't want slowed or fully slowed so we still can't be 100% effective at all times.  This gives us a larger gap for people to consider when they choose a slower for their group.  It still doesn't fix our raiding stackability problems, but I can't do everything for them :P<br />

Nicely done Brenlo!  You deftly sidesteped the issue, of lack of follow threw on the requests for info, your team has already sent in.  With that kind of skill you could run for congress.  <br />

I've said it before and I'll say it again, make us a secondary healer class or give us a defining class role to play in groups.  Slow is merely utility and shared with so many others that it should be compared to snare and levitate in its class-defining characteristics.  It's no longer a reason to bring a shaman on board, and thus should no longer be a reason for our other spells to suck.</div></div><hr />

And, frankly, Beastlords are perhaps the most balanced of the classes, IMO... They were designed for &quot;the current game&quot; back in luclin / PoP, and as a result are sleek and useful while still being nicely simple, while the other classes had been plodding along for a couple of years, getting covered in band-aids as the game grew past them</div></div><hr />

Brenlo<br />
You think it'll be &quot;soon&quot; but you don't know what &quot;soon&quot; is?  So... you don't know, but wanted to say it in more than 3 words.<br />
<br />
I'll share with you a story.  My first job in computer networking was for a small company, where I just walked in and gave them my unimpressive, entry-level resume (they weren't hiring).  Lo and behold, they called me in for an interview, and we worked our way to his assessing my technical skills.  About the 3rd question, I answered simply, &quot;I don't know&quot;.  The man said to me, &quot;That's funny, everyone else makes up this line of BS when they don't know the answer to that.  When can you start?&quot;<br />
<br />
I used it a lot when dealing with people who were looking at me as The Expert.  If I didn't know, I'd TELL THEM SO.  And then I'd tell them that I'd get an answer.  Most importantly, I got that answer WITHIN A DAY (or a progress resport - with *progress*).  This created trust and credibility.  Lots of it.  If I'd approached customer service the way SoE does, I would've sucked badly at that job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Oh bugger.<br />
Sure i read somewhere in the past couple of days a quote from someone at Sony saying something along the lines of &quot;There will be no class balancing in the near future as we're concentrating on the existing bugs etc&quot;.Perhaps i was hallucinating at the time.<br />
<br />
I really hate when Brenlo posts here and other boards not the fact that Brenlos posting which can only be a good thing as there means there is at least someone from Sony keeping an eye on the class boards but the fact that after they do post you get all the &quot;Sony Apologists&quot; TM posting saying &quot;woot way to go Brenlo etc EQ is really looking up these days etc&quot;.<br />
<br />
Dont like people who launch personal or venemous attacks on anyone from Sony who posts on here but i also hate people fawning all over anyone from Sony who posts on here.<br />

Brenlo<br />
---------------------<br />
<br />
At the cost of sounding like I am stating the obvious Brenlo, we (the players and paying customers) have requested (thru you) a definition of each class.  That definition should include data that is useful rather than an abstract description that will not help in meaningful class balance discussions.<br />
<br />
I have this huge premonition that after a month or so Sony will announce the &quot;new class descriptions&quot; and they will be so close to the 5-year old ones as to not be worth anything.  Those descriptions will not guide us whether or not druids or shaman will be thought of as capable of being a primary healer in higher content level experience groups - for example.<br />
<br />
Please tell me that you get it! and that you have requested class descriptions greater than a eye candy placebo, rather as a tool which would allow the developers and the paying customers to have a common basis to discuss class balance and the (possible) re-tuning of the classes.  <br />
<br />
Respectfully yours,<br />
