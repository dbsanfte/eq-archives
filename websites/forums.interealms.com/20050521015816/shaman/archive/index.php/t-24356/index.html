<br />
If you choose Shaman you would find that you have chosen a rare class/race combo, but I find it an excellent choice :).<br />
<br />
If you choose Bard you will find many Vah Shir bards also.<br />
<br />
Berserkers are just rare for all races (on our server).<br />
<br />
Vah Shir warriors are rather rare, Rogues slightly more common.<br />
<br />
IMHO Race doesn't make a massive difference(from a stats point of view) these days. It changes how  you look to  others in the game though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Because racial benefits still exist, take advantage of them.<br />
<br />
How?<br />
<br />
Well, if you were to roll up a warrior now, would you rather do a RZ worshipping Ogre or a Trib worshipping Barb?  I'd go with the Ogre every time for 2 reasons.  Ogres are immune to frontal stun and RZ has better crafted gear then Trib.<br />
<br />
For a Beastlord, I wouldnt do Vah Shir.  A- theres way to many of them already, and B - Iksar natural regen really comes in handy for as much soloing bsts do.<br />
<br />
If you were to roll up a ranger, i'd so roll something different until SoE addresses class issues.  If you insists, then do halfling for the XP bonus.<br />
<br />
Now if you wanted to play a Vah Shir, I'd say do a Bard.  As someone said, there is nothing like a singing cat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Vah Shir Shaman here too.  Love it myself but that's just me.<br />
<br />
The Vah Shir race isn't popular with the power-gaming crowd since none of their racial abilities are that great.  They are very handy skills to have but really don't give you any advantages in battle where most players want the edge.<br />
<br />
If you want to be the best there are other races with more useful skills.  Paticularly with shaman, Ogre unstunability and Troll or Iksar regen are hard to replace but you will pay a penalty in experience points for them.<br />
<br />
Whatever class you choose learning to play it well will serve you far better than any choice you make now.  A well played Vah Shir Shaman will be far more desireable to a group than a poorly played Ogre Shaman but a well played Ogre will have a slight advantage over a Vah Shir of equal talent.<br />
<br />
Pick a class and race that makes you interested in the game, not one that you think will make you powerful.  The choice you make should be one that will last you a while (some have been playing over 5 years) so make it something you choose for fun, not something that you hack away at in the false hope that you will be better than the next guy.</div></div><hr />

Except of course, they didn't start off on the moon, they were blasted into space by the erudites. Plenty of cats where they came from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I never said they started on the moon.  They're on the moon now!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Dunno about that useless racial abilities, cause I find my Vah Shir racial abilities have definite use and worth even at level 68.<br />
<br />
Sneak is probably the most overlooked and underappreciated racial skill there is.  It lets me buy anywhere, from anyone, and I have even used it at level 68 to slip past KoS mobs when I don't feel like a fight.  As long as you stay out of the mob's frontal vector, you're just fine.<br />
<br />
Safe Fall is more of a pleasant relief than an actual skill.  When I play my human paladin, I get irritated at taking falling damage when stepping over a rock.  At least when I'm playing Binter, I don't have that problem.<br />
<br />
And I've found that the Vah Shir racial ability to burn off DoTs in half the time has saved my butt more times than I can conveniently count.  Even in raids it's come in handy, cause shortens the duration of certain raid target AEs, but it shines most at lower level.  We pay for that ability with a doubled food consumption rate, but I can live with that.  ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Race doesn't make a difference?  What about safe fall?  :D <br />
<br />
My shaman is a Vah Shir.  I am happy with my choice, although it would have been nice to have had the barbarians bash to stop casting.<br />
<br />
Race does make a difference - to you.  To my surprise, I find that I just don't like playing evil races much, so my sk doesn't get played.<br />
<br />
If a shaman does not interest you, consider a bard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Are you saying that the higher metabolism of the Vah Shir somehow cause detrimental effects to wear off faster? <br />

I think he was referring to starting stats, not inherant racial abilities. <br />
<br />
Personally, if I was going to make a Shaman now, I would go Cat all the way. The racial benefits are HUGE, they hav no XP penalty, and the only downside is they eat more. Even with todays pricey stat food, this is hardly an issue. I dont think I eat more than 100 pp worth of Misty Thickets in a week.</div></div><hr />

Erudites sending Kerra to the moon is the Vah Shir lore.<br />
<br />
Also Vah Shir racial abilities, while not game breaking, are the most utiliy of any racial abilities.  Safe Fall and Sneak have advantages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Hmm, I have my shaman Vah Shir-love em, there is a quiet nobility to them in my humble opinion.<br />
     I also have my barb warrior, I would have chosen RZ, but hind site and all that...<br />
     I have a human necro...Mostly because I was tired of seeing all the DE necros.<br />
     Currently Im working up a halfling Cleric to Duo with my Iskar Monk.  The halfling has several clear advantages which make them easy to play.. They get sneak, hide, good night vision, are small and thus can maneauver easily in tight quarters, and level quickly..<br />
     All in all I think its how the race appeals to you and what you descide to do with them.  I cant stand the froglocks, or the trolls.. But thats just me.  Whichever class you chose, enjoy it and dont take it too serriously..God knows Ive spazed enough times.. Good luck and enjoy..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Frakass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I like Vah shir shaman alot more than barbarian or iksar. no night vision was a nightmare. I played an iksar in luclin/early pop and had fun but I much prefer Vas shir.<br />
They get sneak (but not hide) and that is priceless imo. not many races hate vah shir and it males the game easier so it is defently a good choice for a first character.</div></div><hr />

Explain?<br />
<br />
It's not DoTs we cast, it's DoTs that are cast on US.<br />
<br />
Vah Shir burn off poison DoT's in half the time as other races.  A DoT that's supposed to last for, say, 12 ticks only lasts for like 6.  That's why we have that double food consumption penalty.<br />
<br />
To be honest, I'm not sure if it affects disease DoT's, but I suspect that it does.  Someday I'll test it and see.<br />
<br />
If only it worked on those obnoxious curse DoTs that raid mobs love to throw....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">You got any logs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Nope, but having played both a kitty and a dark elf to 65, I can say that it's there.  That, or I've convinced myself that it is, hehehe.  I've never had a poison DoT last more than 30 seconds on Binter.  They're usually flashing after the second or third tick.  Back before I got RC, the DoT icon was usually flashing by the time I got cure loaded and ready to cast.<br />
<br />
It mentions the DoT duration in the class description of a Vah Shir on the character creation menu, but we all know how accurate those descriptions are, don't we?   :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Just speaking from personal experience, that's all.  Besides, it'll be really easy to test now, given that the duration of buffs/DoT icons is given on the buff window.<br />
<br />
Who knows, they may have taken that away from us...but I can attest that it WAS there.  ;)</div></div><hr />
