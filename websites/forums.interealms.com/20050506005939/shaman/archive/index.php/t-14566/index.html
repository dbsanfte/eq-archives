<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">One of two things is happening, Either I'm in a lot of raids where the leader hasn't got a clue how to form a raid, or the raid window is bugged. Last night I joined a raid with some guildies and spent the first 15 minutes just trying to get invited. Zone, log, disband, regroup, invite, disband ARGH! By the time we did finally get it organized, we were getting no XP (or even the message) on even red cons, so we had to reform all over again.<br />
<br />
So my question is this: how the frick do you do it so I can take control in these situations. I didn't want to open my big mouth without knowing exactly how to get it all done, as there's already too many people putting in their 2 plat. What's the order of actions? Define groups then the raid leader simply invites each group leader to raid? Seems the obvious but it's so buggy for me. Bad luck?<br />
<br />
A link to info would be great too if anyone has one.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The BEST way for the raid to form up is for a group of six to form.  Then, as other groups are fully formed of people not in the raid, raidleader invites the groupleader.<br />
<br />
You SHOULD be able to invite people into your group who disbanded from their group and not the raid.  However, this doesn't always work.  Bringing a full group into a raid at one time or adding people to that group who aren't in the raid yet are the best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tavokk Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It has seemed to me that /raid invites and such have been really acting up since the last patch or so. We've had troubles where we've had to reform a raid 2-3 times when people get bugged and it messes up the raid. I'm hoping SoE is investigating this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This happened to our guild after our server crashed yesterday (Sunday 22) afternoon. The raid window worked fine before, but after the server came back up the raid window was all buggy --  invitees weren't showing up in the group list and/or the raid window and we ended up not being able to use it the rest of the day.<br />
<br />
Not sure what's going on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">raids have been bugged.<br />
<br />
In the past, I formed raids by inviting the group leaders and then telling them each who to invite to their groups.<br />
<br />
Now the raid will break if you invite a single person who doesn't have a group already.  So make sure everyone you invite to the raid is grouped... and make sure that they are in a group that was formed in the zone you are forming the raid in, or you get that dumb &quot;a member of the group you are inviting is out of range&quot; message.<br />
<br />
It's been a mess since the patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Been very buggy for me as well. Don't blame the raid leader, feel bad for him for having to constantly ask folks to disband, reform groups, and wait for another invite to see if it works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for the help. It's a really annoying bug.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly.  I've always invited whoever I wanted to be group leaders, told em in raid chat who to invite, and it worked fine.  We had to do that because of the &quot;player out of range&quot; message, no matter how tightly packed we were.<br />
<br />
Now, I still get that message when trying to invite preformed groups, and we have people going into &quot;non grouped status&quot; per the raid window when the group leader invites them.<br />
<br />
I am really hoping someone is taking a look at this</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I can confirm this is a recent bug since the change.  A temporary fix is to have entire groups setup before invited.<br />
<br />
Also, has anyone noticed that channels have been randomly up and down.<br />
<br />
Also, Fennin Ro has taken a couple nosedives just last week alone.</div></div><hr />

you are out of date; or you havn't form any raid in past months; raid is buggy since the patch give out free flag/aa/charm<br />
<br />
now, you can only invite group with at lease 3 members, and lots more random bug happen after zoneing/raid leader die/unflag etc. this is not fun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">We had a group in the raid two nights ago with only 2 members. I know nothing about this, so I'm not arguing. Just thought I'd clarify.<br />
<br />
Maybe they formed after the leader was invited. *shrug*.<br />
<br />
On a side note, how the hell do you quickly target all the people you need to buff? There were only two shaman on the last raid, so we split duties. I ended up with buffing roster, and it was a real pain in the backside. I just kept the raid window open and selected each name from there. I was buffing about 14 people  (10 melees and a few others) so there was no way I could remember the names to /tar them. Is there an easier way to do this?<br />
<br />
I've changed colors for warriors/monks/enchanters etc to make it a little easier, but does a buffing shaman just watch the watch with the raid window open?<br />
<br />
I'm hoping someone will tell me there's an easy cycle hotkey I can set up...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">&gt;&gt; how the hell do you quickly target all the people you need to buff?<br />
we have one of best AA skill call *MGB*; other wise just split the duty, say shaman_1 buff group 1-4, shaman_2 buff group 5-9 etc, ignore those not in raid if they don't send tell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Youichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Another /raid bug we noticed, was that the puller got all the experience !<br />
<br />
If the puller was still in range when the mob died, all the raid got XP, but if the puller was out of range when the mob died, only the puller got XP !<br />
<br />
As you can imagine, this either slowed down the pulling imensely, or made people whinge mercilessly that they were getting no XP.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else seen this ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Not sure if our puller was taking the XP, (he's in our guild so I can ask him after the patch tonight) but we weren't getitng any XP until we reformed. We were simply getting faction and kill messages.</div></div><hr />

That's not a raid bug.  It does that in groups too, and has done so for about 2 years.  If the puller is out of range, nobody gets exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yeah, my guild had a raid on Saturday. I formed my group, invited another person as group leader, but he wasn't grouped yet. This hasn't been a problem in the past, but on Saturday, whenever he invited someone to his group, they'd end up both in groups in the raid, but different ones! He went to group 5, she went to group 6, that sort of thing.<br />
<br />
In the end, we got around it somewhat by only inviting group leaders with already formed groups, but even so, we were left with Groups 1, 6, 8, 9 filled and the rest empty, or something like that, which was a pain.<br />
<br />
As for buffing, I don't have MGB yet, but I do tend to use group buffs. The raid window helps for targetting purposes. For individual buffs, I either scroll through the raid window and target each person in turn, or ask for tells for buffs. The problem in my guild with asking for tells, is not everyone seems to always be aware of what buffs they should have. I am trying to educate them. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The puller-out-of-range bug was fixed a few months back. Unless they re-broke it, it should be that only the puller will miss the exp if he's out of range when the mob dies. This assumes you're just in a non-raid exp group however.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's exactly the problem Kianor. As soon as I send out &quot;Warriors please send me a tell for Alacrity&quot; my window scrolls like it's been feared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir, if you happen to have time it would help me - get melees first though!&quot;<br />
&quot;Not me, get my pet&quot;<br />
&quot;If it's better than haste I'll take it&quot; etc etc.<br />
<br />
Thing is sometimes I do have mana left over, so why not buff up the rangers and the pets? Sure, why not chuck a DEX at whoever wants it! Least I can do! The problem is actually finding the buggers.<br />
<br />
I guess the way I'm using the raid window to target must be the best way. Changing the colors of classes sure helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yup its broken again. And as the other shaman from Torv mentioned, this wasn't happing to us at all until our server crashed Sunday. <br />
<br />
This is really pissing me off. First week as raid leader and this isn't helping me get used to the position.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/target playername - This can be shortened to /tar pla if you're typing in a hurry.  I have a hotkey bank filled with all of the warriors in my guild.<br />
<br />
/rt - Targets the last person that sent you a tell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just do group focus/boar when I see a mostly full group formed in the raid window, then before we get started or as we get started I just say something in raid channel about sending me a tell.  I keep group boar and single focus up during the raid, group boar cuts down on the tells for sta since it hits everyone.  <br />
<br />
Worked so good in my last guild, I had them trained to know exactly what they needed, I didn't even have to do anything but be there heh.<br />
<br />
As to the raid bug, I've noticed people complaining about it, but since I never start one of them I haven't really noticed.</div></div><hr />
