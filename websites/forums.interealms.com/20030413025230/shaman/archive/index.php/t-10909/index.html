<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vangre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So some friends and I were doing the HS part of this crucible for our barbarian, shamman buddy.  I asked him how we could screw this up and he didn't think that it was possible - he assured me that it will be really easy for us:<br />
<br />
65 war<br />
64 cleric<br />
63 enc<br />
55 war<br />
54 rog<br />
61 shm<br />
<br />
Well, shammy boy went, in iksar form, and started the quest after we had cleared the room.  VS, rile and their four chronies popped and we went after them.  We slaughtered three of them and VS got mad, said something, and respawned the three we just killed.  At this point VS and Rile are gang raping our cleric and neither of them are targetable.  Cleric runs around in circles, using all his DAs, as we slaughter the four chronies, again.  Eventually the room starts repoping and poor cleric takes a few untimely HTs from the crowd and dies - aggro is transferred to the shaman.<br />
<br />
Now this is really out of hand, because shammy boy is doing laps around the room with VS and Rile.  Enchanter is chain rune'ing to keep MT alive.  Then the 55 war decides that multi tanking will help and gets himself waxed.  Eventually, VS and Rile become targetable and we kill them all off.  Rile Remains pop up and shammy boy goes to do the turn in, not realising that he lost iksar form in the process and gets aggro.  The rest is history - no dice for shammy boy.<br />
<br />
Our shaman friend was depressed, but this was the funniest damn quest screw up ever and he could have finished it in the end too.  Fortunate for him, we got to VS remains the next day and are ready for revenge.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd rather have the cudgel, it would mean more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eftah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Question:  This 14 21 hammer you are talking about... does it have an effect?  Cudgel has Carnage for an effect.<br />
<br />
Personaly, I will do the cudgel.  Took 1 week and I am working on 7th one already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>tangurena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">its evil i tell ya, evil. i spent about 40 hours on those skulls with an X, and that includes buying three of them. now if only i could get the drixie dust, killed about 60 of them so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">14/22 10sta 15wis 10int 50hp75mana 15SD 15SP prime and &gt;&gt;&gt;RANGED&lt;&lt;&lt; thats the main reason for the crudgel the effect is at best annoying to have to recast all the time. I use PE instead Much longer duration with +sta.<br />
<br />
Has for the CoD one why not go for the BoT mace 19/22 10sta 12wis 9int 8agi 65hp 50mana 12MR 12SP Prime only.. Clr Dru Shm Nec Wiz Mag Enc (Thundering mace) this is also dropable.<br />
<br />
Thats if you want mele but personly I think the crudgel is hard to beat in the ranged slot but that just my oppion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>fudji</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">oooh its not only you it have messed upi for on this final fight.<br />
For me and my friends i went realy bad after turning in the thing to get vs to spawn everything messed up they  just jumped us bouth vs and the riel and the skellis we have killed he respwned them to we could not target him eighter and they killed us all heheh</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your problem was you didnt wait for the dialog to finish, ie: sathir killing Rile. Thatll f00k it up right there, and they will stay untargettable. Always let Rile die to sathir first.</div></div><hr />
