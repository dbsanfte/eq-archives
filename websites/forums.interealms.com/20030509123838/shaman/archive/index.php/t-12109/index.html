<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kytra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Few weeks ago, a guild on Fennin was fighting Rumblecrush at zoneline. Well, they wiped at 0% and RC agroed on me. I let my pet tank for the few seconds it took to cast Velium Strike and in one lucky crit for 1988 damage, he died and I got solo xp. :p<br />

Not exactly a soloing, but I thought it was damn funny.</div></div><hr />

Well if you are killing a dragon (whether it be from 100% or 0) I would imagine you would keep the loot  :confused:<br />

<br />
He even left the pally book :\</div></div><hr />

Freakin hillarious.  Let me guess, they called you a KS'r.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I saw Doomshade down to about 5% when a guild started wiping.  Had the sk logged in, got shammy logged in.  Too bad they only got to 3% before they wiped.  Would have got pets up if they got her to 1%.  Zoning was the only option available ... darn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kytra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Actually, I sent a tell to the guild leader that he could loot when rezzed. He, and his whole guild, were very grateful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Doesn't sound grateful to me.  I would have offered you the pick of the loot.  They would have got nothing without your quick thinking and actions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If there wasnt another guild there to gank RC, they would have just rezzed and taken another shot I am sure.  It just saved them some time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kytra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">RC drops nothing I want, so it was kinda pointless to even ask for pick of loot.<br />
<br />
I spend a lot of time in UP soloing rares for cash, so I get a lot of opportunity to help out with RC and DS. Of course, lately, they've both been timed by one of the worst guilds on Fennin, so I don't help them at all. :p</div></div><hr />

RC Shield owns OOIV hardcore :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Very classy imho.  That kinda move gains you respect across a server, far more than a little bit of loot would have done.</div></div><hr />
