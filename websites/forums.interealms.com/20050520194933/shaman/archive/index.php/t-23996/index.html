However I have noticed a rapid decline in people wanting LDoN and today for the first time in 5 months I could not get a group together.  I would like to try some of the OoW zones but I seem to have this small problem.  I hate doing new things.  I fear doing new things.  Lost Dungeons of Norath went live around 9 September 2003.  I did my first Ldon adv around March of 2004 and started seriously playing ldon late April.  So it was about 5 months after initial release it took me to try 1 ldon.  Then around another 2 months to start playing serious.  I have not done GoD, except to go there to raise my alchemy skill, and only looked around in the OoW zones.  It took me a few months when they revamped Nurga and Droga to go there but once I did I hung on there for months on end not trying anything else until Ldon broke me of that.  Notice a pattern?  Once I get used to something I cling on for life.  I guess I have a choice of going back to Droga or trying OoW.  I guess its goodbye to Ldon until the upgrade patch, if ever?  I only have 1 PoP flag too, Grummus and I was kind of pushed into that.</div></div><hr />

Bah go out have fun in the new zones.Worse thats gonna happen is you'll die.<br />
LDoN will be back just its typical of when a new expansion comes out everyone and their mother rushes to play in it and only wants groups there.<br />

<br />
Like sitting in the same corner in *insert-favorite-zone-here* doesnt involve hours (if not days) of the same mindless trash clearing crap?<br />
<br />
Im not flaming you......as I totally agree with part of what you say (and you specifically mention that GoD is unique) as after doing 120 LDoNs myself, it is insanely repetitive...but what isnt repetitive in eq?  <br />
<br />
However, today i was recently reminded of why I love LDoN so much: Campstealers.  I was camped on the corner of the Lost Souls in Natimbi when this 2 boxing cleric (on Stromm) walks right into the middle and starts picking everything off.  Idiot.  Im not even the type of person that normally cares about this type of stuff either but after I asked this guy what he was doing he just said &quot;we are camping the souls&quot;.  I dont need to go into all the details about exactly what transpired and get off topic in this thread but this experience was exactly why the devs created instanced zones.<br />
<br />
Whats not to like about instanced zones and adventure points? 2 of the best ideas to ever be implemented imo.<br />
<br />
Then again, Im a casual, non guilded player who doesnt have the time to raid so obviously being able to log on for a few hours a week my options are limited.<br />
<br />
Long live LDoN.<br />

If the xp had been anywhere near elementals it would have made a great xp grinding spot.

2. It was for PvP rewards and went to the PvP servers, as intended; the push to all servers was a mistake.<br />

I wish Sony would create more LDoN type zones/ reward ap points for current instanced zones.  I have no idea how much $$$ it actually cost to create these types of zones but Im sure it isnt cheap.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">LDON isn't going to be one forever.  It's just pretty trashy now.  You can go do an LDON and in 45-60 minutes (including all the travel time and group forming) you get about 50 points, and about 1/2 an AA.  Once you don't really care about the gear upgrades from LDON, or if you really want xp, then LDON is kinda sucky.  Plus, if you grind xp in places like KT, or WoS, or PG, or Ruined City, you'll get named mobs dropping more loot upgrades than you'd ever get from LDON in 10x that time investment.  They need to pump up the xp you get from LDON at higher levels or it'll be pretty barren at the wayfarer camps IMO.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Setanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Lost Dungeons weren't all that bad. Just the formula got tired very quickly. It does need quite a bit of updating as the equipment, loot, xp, adventure points are all well below par. No way was it the worst expansion - GoD holds that title by a long mile. Don't think any other expansion came even remotely close to prompting quite so many people to quit (we didn't see a crisis Guild Summit after LDoN did we?) as GoD did. The positive thing for GoD now is that finally we are getting the levels we were supposed to have when it was released. Should be a lot less painful visiting GoD now.</div></div><hr />

Heh I remember a certain film Lost in Translation getting a fair few awards, and yet I found it totally crap. Awards don't mean anything, they just recognize and merit a minor part of whatever its awarded. For example, Lost in Translation one of the awards was for best picture. Well best picture doesn't automatically mean the film is good.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lost Dungeons weren't all that bad. Just the formula got tired very quickly&quot;<br />
<br />
Yep it was like this for me too. And a poll that was on this board as Ldon first came out reflects this comment, I think there were a fair few people that voted best expansion ever. But it got old very fast.<br />
<br />
Its good people still enjoy Ldon like you Peroxide, just for me it wasn't my cup of tea. Though I am quite surprised that hard ldon has lost popularity, I thought that it would gain popularity with the new level cap.</div></div><hr />

Regruas, Yxxta, or just stomping through castle 2 in fire with an actual tank instead of kiting em around. It actually requires you to pay attention or there's risk of dying. That's the difference.<br />
<br />
And in GoD, each mob has different abilities beyond &quot;warrior&quot; &quot;Caster&quot; &quot;whatever&quot;. There's mobs with reflect, or do a Stonestance when low on health so you burn em down with nukes... There's a lot more variance to the individual fights that actually adds some flavor to the group besides just watching health bars. They actually put some decent thought into the expansion, just the flagging process was horribly implemented, causing people to hate the expansion. I thought gates was decent, and I'm not even past Ikkinz raids yet. Granted, Ikkinz raid 3 is retardedly annoying, but it's a funny concept :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I &lt;3 LDoN.  Larium said it perfectly:<br />
it is insanely repetitive...but what isnt repetitive in eq?<br />
Repetition is what allows EQ to be EVERquest.  Unless you have a paid team of GMs coming up with new things for you to do daily (Legends) you are going to have to do the same thing over and over again until the next expansion gives you a new thing to do over and over again, because the devs only make so much content at a time.<br />
<br />
At least with LDoNs you A) get to move around instead of sitting on your ass (or horse/drogmor) in the same spot for two hours B) have a specific mission to achieve, C) still make progress (if you complete the mission) towards equiping your character, whether or not any loot drops that you can use and win the roll on D) don't have to deal with griefers, trains, camp stealers, etc. E) don't have to worry about getting on to play for two hours and then ending up having to stay on for another two to recover your corpse.<br />
<br />
Now could LDoNs use some improvement?  Certainly.  And not just better gear and and exp, either; I'd like to see a new mision type or two (or at least see rescue and assasinate made more viable), more variation in the monsters (maybe have rooms with a buch of upacifiable and unmezzable light blues or greens, or some white, yellow, or even low red cons), more variation in zones, more quests (I always thought it would be cool if you could &quot;rescue&quot; the fake pets for some reward), etc.  Basically anything to make it less of the same thing over and over again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">People said they wanted content for the casual player, the person who logged on with two hours to spare and didnt want to get dragged into a 16 hour raid, but still wanted to progress thier charector.<br />
<br />
LDON fills that niche admirably.<br />
<br />
GoD was guilds wanting higher end content that they could flag group by grou instead of having to do the pop flagging nightmare and the backflagging fiasco.<br />
<br />
GoD wasnt really that bad, it was what the guilds asked for, challenging content that the kiddy gamers couldnt gank.<br />
<br />
The big issue with GoD is that the gap between casual players and raiders is so enormous by the end of pop, that in order to make the content challenging for the 500AA raiding toon they made it brutally undoable for the 100AA toon with LDON armor.<br />
<br />
GoD is actually pretty ok if you have decent resists and gear.<br />
<br />
With OOW they tried to make it more scaled to the less high end raider, but my god WOS reminds me of lake of illomen on a bad day.<br />
<br />
Anyway good luck, and i like ldons, I dont get dragged into 6 hour grind sessions, i can log on, get it over and done with in an hour and a half and go. Its what I wanted.<br />

Now i wish the gear in it was upgraded 8)<br />

I dont do it for experience, because the experience there sucks ass.  Because the character Im taking through is a wizard, having to move every few kills is kind of annoying, and losing my horse for regen is really annoying, but its a means to an end.  Its incredibly easy, and far, far less annoying in a wizard than a shaman.<br />
<br />
LDoN still gets a thumbs up from me, even if I do only run 1 adventure every week or so, and spend the rest of my time in GoD/tactics/BoT</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">as I have become a very casual palyer I like LDoN alot. I could log on and do one or two adventures, see some progress on the AA bar, maybe get a cash/tribute drop and fine. <br />

Currently I do not even have time for that so I could not care less. But I sure hope that LDoN will get an upgrade and people come back to it when I have time to play more again.<br />

<br />
Everything is repetitive. Life. The universe everything.<br />
<br />
How many people do you know that do something completly new every day?<br />
<br />
How many people run the bleeding edge of experiances? <br />
<br />
Most people get into a pattern and stay there. Occasionally they swap over to another pattern for a while to get some variance and call it new. <br />
<br />
EQ just takes this to a Art form. <br />
<br />
There is exactly one thing that EQ caters itself too. Wasting time. And I love it for that. There are an almost endless way of finding something to do depending on what pattern you are currently following. Be it Aquisistion of loot. Or that next skill point. (read Charecter ingrained loot here) Or helping a friend do the same. It all boils down to the exact same thing though. Spending time for entertainment away from the problems of the real world. <br />
<br />
Walls of slaughter is no different than Killing that first bat in Queynos. It just takes longer and the pattern is larger to follow.<br />
<br />
This sideways look at life was brought to you By Rum and Cokes the night before.. Of what a pattern to follow... Anyone got an asprin?<br />

<br />
Half an AA for 4x the risk of someplace like tactics or bot for about 120 minutes work for a preelmental group by the time you put the group together, and do the mission. <br />
<br />
In two hours I could do 2 AA in CY in bot or tactics pit at essentially zero risk at all. The exp level should match the risk level and it doesn't even come close in ldon hard. Now that omens is out I have places to go with my unflagged friends other then tactics/bot which are even better exp, so theres basically no point at doing ldon at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OoW is new. People want to explore. That and the fact that they havent ferfed the drop rates yet, means that everyone and his dog is doing OoW flat out. Once things have stabilised, If the risk versus reward justifies it, they will stay in OoW, if not they will slowly trickle back to LDoNs</div></div><hr />

My enthusiasim started to wane when it took longer to put together a group than Temperence and c1 or 2 lasted..even with Virtue and C3, sometimes, an adventure is completed unbuffed because of the time to get invited or even put an adventure together. Now..I think its waneing is a good thing. at least for now. I hold LDON responsible for the rudeness and idiocy that is being experienced on an ever increasing basis. People leveled so fast from dungeon grinding, that a lot of peeps never learned patience or the courtesy that is needed for everyone to enjoy the game. 3 times in a 6 hr session, Named were stolen right out of battle with a good 25% hp off, by a higher level with better DPS. They come right in to camp and nuke said named during the battle and loot it. When confronted, their response is,&quot;too bad..lets see you do something about it.&quot; as mentioned.it is happening so often now game wide that the GM's are not even responding anymore. I see a lot of guild spam complaining about the same as well as OOCing in zone with complaints. I have been playing for many years and have never experienced this as often as it happens now..on a daily basis it seems.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Well peeps yup the grave is slammed shut on LDON.<br />
<br />
For those who tired of it (pre- Omens) you really probably did it with normal groups (chicken groups I called it).  Gee, do pet only groups,always be the puller, no need for tankage etc.  LDON rocks for the fun factor but is boring as all heck if you have NORMAL BORING group.  Train your group, be the crazy shammy puller.  Have some imagination!!<br />
<br />
But anyway, peeps lack of imagination is just the first factor in the death of LDON.  As we all know LDON merchants should be stocked with a line if items one grade higher at about 2000-2500 pts.

If I don't have alot of time to play, I can still jump on and stomp through a LDoN in bout an hour. I'm in, I'm done, I'm heading back to camp for the night. Most groups either I've just shown up and we've started pulling finally, or still waiting for someone else, or Ignorant_Idiot_75 just decided my and time are less valuable then his and trained half the zone across my group.<br />

Ya, it's repetative, but sitting on the hill in WoS for hours on end, isn't? Maybe it's the soap opera that draws other people and getting into the /ooc pixalated penis contests, personally I enjoy that garbage the least.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I really loved LDON, and still enjoy it when I can manage to pull together a decent group.  The  problem is that the rewards aren't good enough for many people to even want to do them.  The majority of the people that even bother with them now are casual gamers without GoD or OOW.  The exp in them isn't good enough to attract anyone to do anything other than the theme that their item/items come from.  Normally when I use the /lfg utility I see 1 or 2 people actually looking for an adventure with a specific theme listed in their comments, and anyone else that mentions LDON has the word NO in front of it.  <br />
<br />
As a very casual gamer, I hate to see this casual expansion pack slowly be phased out.  If I could find more people willing to do expeditions in OOW I wouldn't miss LDON so much, but everyone seems to want to stick to Grieg's End and Plane of Valor at my level, and I don't particularly care for either.  Plane of Valor I can deal with for the EXP, but I rarely can find a group there at the times I play :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, LDoN did at least have the capability to scale with levels/gear/aa, but Sony really dropped the ball on that one.  The 66+ adventures are seriously fubared and it would have been in the players best interest for Sony to have made LDoN work with the 66+ crowd.  Oh well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>frynque</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">i have to say, ldon should die, once you're about 60ish.  the xp is absolutely unbeatable from 20-40 (except for the moronic xp spree of paludal).  once you hit about 45, the xp starts to trail off, and zones like velks and sebilis start to offer better xp / hour and loot as well.<br />
<br />
the only reason to do ldon post 60, i feel is to get any spells you want/need, and any armor upgrades to tide you over until you can get some elemental flagging.  or if you want the upgraded stats on your charm.<br />
<br />
personally, i found ldon was a nice new realm of hunting for my alts, because i had badly tired (at the time) of the oasis-loio-fm circuit, hph-hk-solb circuit or the paludal-neth-echo circuit.  here was a varied and changing circuit with flavors (snowy death, undead crypts, scorching desert, etc).  granted the dungeons got old relatively fast because you ended up seeing the same cookie-cutter sections OVER and OVER again.  what would have been a better approach, i feel is if the instanced zones had actually constructed the dungeon at spawntime, thus maps would have been rendered useless.  you could tell they were constructed by hand out of about 8 different pieces (for each venue), rearranged slightly and given different decor (boxes, fires, etc.).  why not randomize it, thus there would be upwards of 100's of possibilities (ruling out the pathalogical constructions, since combinatorically, there would be well over billions of possible constructions) to challenge people at each venue (camp).<br />
<br />
but i have to aggree, as designed, ldon was fun, but it grew tiresome quickly.  personally, though, i have to vote for pop as the worst expansion ever.  the books completely nerfed the old world, and before they added lvl flagging for tier1/2, having people pay $30 for an expansion that was, in effect, unreachable for about 80% of the eq population (including the huge discrimination in the PoJ trials [it is virtually impossible to get a pickup group for the execution trial as a shaman because, for the most part, we're pointless on it.  i had to be carried through, in effect by my guild])  as least with kunark, velious, luclin and ykesha, you could reach about 80% of the content without some sort of flagging or special keys.  putting out new content that is geared primarily for raid guilds is just poor marketing.  why not split the expansions, putting out the general (fix bugs and introduce new features) expansions separately from the (new uber content for the power gamers) expansions.  but thats just my 2cp worth.<br />

As for ldon, they need to fix how the 66's take away points from the 65s....<br />

at 65, you should get 52 points, period... if someone is a higher level, you shouldt get less -- just give them more. or even cap it out...  don't ruin it for the folks who worked hard for those levels (speaking mainly about my rogue who duoed with my shaman through lots of ldons to FINALLY reach 65 and now STILL doesn't get &quot;full&quot; points)</div></div><hr />

Seems like the high end LDoN gear is almost an alternative flag.  you either need to be VT+ geared or LDON geard to competantly handle all content X and above (GoD trials, Elementals, Riftseekers, etc.)  Might effect melee and tanks a bit more than us, but it still exists.</div></div><hr />

I'd really like to do LDoNs to get some more augs.  However, most of my equipment is slowly being replaced with elemental gear, which far exceeds LDoN rewards.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Kabuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">I read a few posts saying that LDoN was the worst expansion ever.  I would disagree with that.  It's strictly a matter of perspective.  Personally I think PoP was the worst expansion ever.<br />
<br />
<br />
PoP created an enormous gap between top level.  Either you were in a raiding guild with a Time flag and had 10khp as a tank, or you were in a casual guild and had a BoT flagged tank with 5khp.  Followed by the comments like keep the trash or riff raff out.  PoP literally created class warfare in EQ on some levels.<br />
<br />
LDoN gave non raiding casual players the opportunity to upgrade themselves to close to EP and close the gap.  OoW has gone a step further in closing the gap.<br />
<br />
I've heard every arguement in regards to PoP, but all of them are empty at some level.  Not everyone has or is willing to dovte 16 hours a day to a video game, why should their playing experience be any less enjoyable?<br />
Not everyone is capable of raiding on a regular basis because of Real Life.  <br />
<br />
As to the arguement that EQ has always been a raiding game, that's simply not true.  In the original build there were only 2 raid level mobs and no locked zones.  Kunark added a few more raid level mobs and 2 locked zones, Velious a few more raid level mobs and 1 more locked zone.<br />
<br />
For some folks LDoN was the only way for folks to close the gap.  You could make an LDoN group at almost anytime.  You got 3 rewards.  Adventure Points, Experience and Potentially loot.  this was a windfall for casual players.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to engage in a class warfare debate.  I'd rather just leave it at, some of us prefer LDoN method of upgrading and some folks prefer raiding.  There is room in game for both.  I don't get angry with folks for wanting to hunt in locked zones, there's no reason they should be upset with me wanting comparable gear via a different method.</div></div><hr />

Agreed.  Interestingly the former proponents of Everquest = Raiding at SOE don't appear to have the guts to follow it through.  Now that the majority (who don't raid, or would prefer not to raid) have an alternative game - WoW - fast approaching we are seeing expansions like OoW which give the casual gamer the opportunity to get decent gear without the ridiculous timesink required by LDoN.  I think SOE should at least have had the courage to see if EverRaid could have competed with WoW.  If it couldn't - and personally I think thats a no-brainer - why did they ever go the EverRaid route in the first place?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Jeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">PoP created an enormous gap between top level.<br />
<br />
Not really true in my opinion. PoP opened up the playing fields for the raid guilds to do multiple encounters and not everyone and his grandma stuck trying to hack into one zone in Luclin.<br />
<br />
LDoN's opened up the tables gear wise for a normal casual player to get enjoyment out of the game as well as being able to compete on a front as regards equipment to pre-time players. TBH i hate LDoN no idea why i just found them really tedious and boring, and haven't really bothered with it at all. <br />
<br />
GoD is where the split really came, it created a huge rift in the game and separated the top guilds on servers from eachother. The gear upgrades from Qvic+ is huge, probably why they made it so hard to get their. The only good thing about GoD is that you don't need 72ppl now to win as with PoP you did, tho i would love to know how easy RZ and ELE gods are now with lvl70, cause i know guilds have done Fennin with 20ppl.</div></div><hr />

But that has 2 drawbacks to it. First is that EQ is supposed to be a social game. I know, it may only be rumor, but that's what I've heard :)<br />
<br />
Secondly, can you imagine the headache of attempting to create solo-able instances for all the classes? Cleric and Rogue, along with Druid and Wizard? The irritation of doing a solo LDoN as a paladin and having no drop loot for Int Casters on the boss mob?<br />
<br />
It's a good idea, and I'd be behind it, but I just honestly don't see it happening. There are still doors in Freeport that swing open the wrong way.<br />

Granted I have never been on one, but my understanding is that they are too hard for non-elemental level guilds.  If this is true it is one of the dumber things in all of EQ.  Elemental level guilds don't really need the extra content where first and second tier PoP guilds are often at a loss for finding appropriate level targets if they do not have Luclin keys.<br />

I know I have witnessed guilds log on everyday for two weeks and not be able to find a challenging target  up.  It would be very nice to have the fall-back option of going to a LDoN Raid when a guild logs in to find that the only Boss Mobs that are up are either well below their challenge level or a flagging raid Mob that they have already hit ( thus it would be rude to kill a mob that another guild may need just for the heck of it.)<br />

<br />
On the contrary, Elemental guilds are pretty limited in targets.  Yes, there are a lot of targets to hit in each zone, but it's the same scenery again and again.  How many times do you have to kill charm birds and other fire mini's before you can do it in your sleep?  Earth rings are horribly boring.<br />
<br />
At least Luclin has several zones with a few targets each.    If you are at that level, you are still doing tier1, 2, and maybe tier 3 PoP bosses also.<br />
<br />
Now, as for LDoN's limited choices of difficulty level - this has always baffled me.  Considering the zones are exactly the same regardless of difficulty, they could have implemented 10 different difficulty levels.  Ok, itemization would have taken a bit longer but wouldn't it have been worth it?<br />
<br />
From what I have read of LDoN raids, they are near GoD level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Opps sorry to be so bigotted, I just assumed that guilds with elemental raid flags had more options.  <br />
<br />
I wonder if the EQ Community could start a grassroots lobbying campaign to get a more varied level of difficulty for LDoN raids?  The purpose for such an option for guilds is not to necessarily &quot;advance&quot; the guild but to give the assembled members something to do when a guild logs on and finds that all non-instanced targets of appropriate level have been taken down already.  <br />
<br />
A variable difficulty LDoN raid system would provide a &quot;safety option&quot; so that all guilds could be assured that when they schedule a raid there will be at least &quot;something&quot; for the members to raid which will be an appropriate level and provide the guild with the opportunity to improve raiding skills.  The raid would only have to cough up a couple of items to make it worth it to most guilds as the practice should be more  important than the gear.<br />
<br />
Maybe a system could be put in place where raw &quot;Guild  Tribute&quot; points are the reward.</div></div><hr />

Yes, precisely. LDoN was a way for me to bridge the gap between being pre-VT and being able to handle GoD groups. And with GoD, and now OoW, my plans for PoP flagging aren't quite dead, but they are off of the back burner and sitting in the fridge in tupperware.<br />
<br />
My understanding of LDoN raids is this:<br />
<br />
1. LDoN raid rewards are too poor to be an incentive to players who are well-geared enough to be capable of winning; and <br />
<br />
2. LDoN raid difficulty is too great to be doable by those people who would benefit from the rewards.<br />
<br />
The player base has a keen perception of what RvR is worthwhile and what isn't.</div></div><hr />

Lately I have been thinking about coming back (City of Heroes got old VERY fast). A large portion  of my 1-65 lifetime was spent soloing or &quot;adventuring&quot; (yea, I'm one of those who would run around a zone all night just to 'check it out'). I have been around since BETA so I have seen it all (don't pounce on this--I mean I have seen all the changes that have come to pass--I'm no where near Time enabled or beyond).<br />
<br />
From what I've been reading it seems that even with OoW I won't be able to solo any instanced zones. Is it too much to ask for instanced soloable zones? Even though CoH was more like a FPS (first person shooter) to me, I did enjoy being able to log in, get a mission (independent of anyone) and attempt to complete it. Is there anywhere in OoW that I can (as a true casual/small guild player) find my niche? I do have raid experience but do not enjoy that aspect of the game. I find my most rewarding times are when I solo, duo or trio. Am I an EQ dinosaur and should I just move on?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">You can solo the instanced zones that come off of the first zone in OoW, Dranik's Scar.  The thing is A) you'll need to bribe two random people with buffs to get the instance (after you get it you can kick them from the group and go on your merry way) B) you won't be able to solo the nameds in these instanced zones without solid gear and AAs, since they summon and hit reasonably hard.<br />
<br />
There are also many places in OoW to solo, enough so that you don't need instances to be able to avoid other people.  One prime example of this are the Murkgliders in Noble's Causeway.  Now they won't give great exp (3 kills per % at 66 I think), and they only drop anything of interest once in a blue moon, but there is a metric assload of them in the zone, so you will have no trouble finding an area to do.</div></div><hr />

Loot is only good for tribute, experience sucks...why even bother.  Regular adventures are for people that get off seeing the win total move up.  Sad.<br />
<br />
LDoN hards on the other hand are quite fun and offer good rewards.  High quality loot and 102 pts.  I turn down all regulars but am quick to accept hard invites.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wish they would revamp the ldon stuff i enjoy and enjoyed doing them</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">Sitting at bout 300+adventures, 99 or so on the leaderboard, I had just bout had enough of them at the end myself, but the fact you only get @ 1% of post 65 lvl's per makes them so utterly not worthwhile to be laughable.<br />

Watch the next expansion be the new LDoN add on.</div></div><hr />

That would be cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Matey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">I want soloable, instanced content.  I don't care if it's as repetitive as LDoNs.  I just want something to do when I can't find a guild group.  I'm sick of random groups.  I'm sick of all the AFKing that slows everyone down.  I'm sick of constant Linkdead(hey, there's a problem with your connection that no one else is having, FIX IT).  I just want something to kill an hour before raids that I can start and leave whenever I want.  Moderate xp for whatever my level is, mobs shouldn't hit very hard but put in a lot of them.  The most fun I have in EQ is usually when I go somewhere that's all green nowadays and I can go just kill stuff.  If I pull too many, I may get into a bit of trouble but they're not triple hitting me for 250 death machines.  I had a ton of fun working on my epic 1.5 but it sucked that I didn't get very much xp for it(until the end for the 5 AA).</div></div><hr />
