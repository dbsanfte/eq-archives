<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Artes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A little history.  A couple weeks ago I had accidently deleted my 26th level iksar shaman while cleaning up some other unused characters.  While I did enjoy playing a lizard and still hope for a restoration, I began thinking if a different race might make wiser investment over the long haul.  My main is a 62nd monk and I hope to have a shaman partner to duo with in the planes.  As a monk, I do not tank very well and would figure the shaman to make a better tank once he is higher level and has torpor.  Would an ogre having frontal stun immunity make that huge of a difference to warrant a race change?  Can you more experienced shaman clear the fog regarding frontal stun immunity and it's importance?<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

If I'm ever in a situation where I have to get a heal off or die I dont have to worry about stun. You will be in that situation from time to time dont care what anyone says.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Soveraign</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Being able to channel through bashes is really nice, I have to admit.  I solo probably about 2/3 of the time right now tanking/casting and am very happy with choosing an Ogre as my race.  There might be a point where I will miss not having regen of troll/lizard but probably not until I someday give up my fungi.</div></div><hr />
