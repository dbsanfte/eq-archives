<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Call of the Ancient ward has no HP either.  It will get killed if a mob AEs near it.  My advice is to hold off on buying it until it gets fixed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">In the Sewers of Nihilia, there is a room at the end that is in like three feet of sewage.  There are some bugs you need to kill in the middle.  Well, no matter what you do, you cannot cast on these bugs because of the stupid in/out of water bug.  That was a fun 45 minutes!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">yeah jin, those are interesting, but you gotta have your tank in the water with the healer, and all the casters out of the water casting on it.<br />
<br />
Some suggestion though, once those 9 are dead, a named will spawn.  Agro kite if your friend.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Custom UI isn't working.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Custom UI isn't working.<br />
<br />
Not sure what you mean by not working.  There were a number of new windows added.  You may need to go back to where you got the UI to see if there will be an update.  Otherwise you need to start off with default UI and add in the UI files you want, one at a time.  If you try to change too many of the default ones at once, you won't know which file is incompatible.</div></div><hr />
