Sorry about it being in excel web extensions, work picked back up this week and I was lazy last week. :)  I'll put it up as an ASP page soon, but for now any comments are welcome. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Jaidin, I did a bit of poking around on the excel file.  It'd be a lot more user friendly if you put on some toggles/inputs instead of making the user put in percentages in a ton of different places.  For instance, 2 questions could populate everything for the healing percentage:<br />
<br />
what is your highest focus for heals:<br />
what level is it capped at:  <br />
<br />
Same for haste and mana pres.  Everything else falls out per a formula.  Right now, you have 40 input slots, not including mana pool/UMR.<br />
<br />
I think, if you put in formulas and single input boxes, your users would only have to input 11 items (excluding the mana pool/UMR section).<br />
<br />
What is your alteration specialization?:<br />
What level of spell casting mastery do you have (0-3)?<br />
<br />
Etc.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents. :)<br />

Thanks Chutoi.  I had thought about it at first and yes it would make it much easier, but I wanted each spell to be easily calculated with different numbers.  However that's still pretty easily done by just changing the source percentages.<br />
<br />
When I can update it I'll probably add that convenience in or perhaps make another sheet or two with the same layout so you could switch back and forth between two or three sets of percentages.<br />
<br />
Do you think that would be too cumbersome?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It depends on the people.  All things considered, not that many people use spreadsheets.  Any time I do any kind of modelling on spreadsheets, I make it as idiot simple as possible.  Input the fewest numbers in easily identifiable places (usually via a different fill color), and then let it run the calcs.  If you know you have a sophisticated audience, sometimes it's okay to leave it more unfinished.  However, even an experienced excel user is going to have trouble coming to a spreadsheet and checking things out.  The builder does most of the work.  Any review or user level should be relegated to a spot check of calculation results, not formulas.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents.  Maybe make an input page, and then a results page or something.  :)<br />

<br />
Aye, thanks again :)  I like the input/output idea which will be super easy to do once it's in ASP.  Last week, work was super slow and I was really bored, so now I just have to fit in the time. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">For anyone interested, here's an updated version that is more convenient and also has been ridden of Office 2003 plugins :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It looks very nice!  There are only a couple of things I have questions about.  At the bottom the Sustained HP/s duration numbers, are those the amount of time in seconds that you can sustain that hp/s rate?  I just wanted to figure out what they mean :)<br />
<br />
Oh, and in your Example at the bottom you have Haste of Mithaniel listed as a Improved Healing focus effect, but it's a Spell Haste focus effect :)<br />
<br />
Other than that,  looks great!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks!  Aye the sustained hp/s is the number of seconds that you could maintain that hp/s rate, chain casting, with a given mana pool and mana regen.  The real numbers would probably vary slightly due to lag but it should only be off by a few seconds maybe.<br />

Lies!  I have no idea what you are talking about! :):)  Fixed btw hehe, thanks for pointing it out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was originally set at 10% when the &quot;Focus Announcement&quot; was made by Sony.  I have been told a few times that it's actually 5% but I haven't seen any proof of that yet and I can't check since I don't have the 66+ spells :(  It may have been modified when they changed the spell descriptions on the effects to reflect their upped level limit.<br />
<br />
/wink /wink...anyone want to test some spells?  :)<br />
<br />
Thanks Finn! :)<br />
<br />
It's been updated with the DOM model instead of using straight JavaScript.  I'm too used to using IE, sorry Mozilla users hehe.  Tested and working fine with Mozilla 1.7.2 and FireFox 1.0PR.</div></div><hr />
