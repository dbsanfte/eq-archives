The AA was changed for the reasons Laeelin mentioned. There was a lot of concern from buff classes that most people wouldn't spend the 20 points to be able to buff someone else's pet. How many clerics do you think would think it was a good investment? From a bard specific point of view it seems as if it's more expensive then before (several players having to spend the AA instead of just the bard) but over all you're looking at a cheaper price for the player base as a whole. <br />
<br />
Additionally, this AA will not work on Charmed pets, but it will work on MGB'd spells. <br />
<br />
We're looking at making a replacement AA for the classes that have had this removed. In the case of bards we're most likely looking at some kind of melee oriented AA. <br />

<br />
Good change imo.  So basically we can spend the 20 AA and our pet will get hit by EVERY group buff and MGB buff.  We don't have to wait for the cleric/druid/enchanter to get the skill to buff our pet.   So if a pet class wants their pet to get buffed they spend the points, not the buffer class.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">20AA is crazy from a shaman point of view, but if you are a true pet class like mage or necro, I could see this being a &quot;must have&quot; AA.  Even then, 20 seems way high.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Aside from the silly 20 point cost, this still fails to address the real problem, that in a lot of cases, you buff in a different place than you summon your pet.  Most noticeably, LDoN.  The timer starts when you get in, so all buffing is done outside.  But you can't bring the pet through the zone, so you can't get him involved.  Lower the cost and add a 3rd level to suspend minion that lets you bring pets through zones, then it'd be useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">What this AA should do is give your pet all the buffs that you already have up on your character.  <br />
<br />
Our normal raid procedure is to buff outside the zone before we actually start the raid, unless we're inside and doing rebuffs.  Therefore having pets get hit by spells then is useless since pets don't zone over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">And a new AA announced. For an extra 50AAxp, you can attach onto your maxed out Suspend Minion, allowing you to zone with your pet aswell.<br />
<br />
The change makes sense, just the cost is in need of serious adjustment. Having this skill, and the MGB's go flying. Great! Now your pet has C5, Wrulan, PoS, SoE and regen. Excuse me Mr Shaman could you please recast Fo7, my pet missed it cause of other buffs...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I agree that this change is better.  It did not make sense that other non-pet classes would have to buy this aa to give the benefits. <br />
<br />
I am glad to hear this wont be working on charm pets.  (Charm pets need psalm of veeshan, bwahah)<br />
<br />
As Ciele posted, this AA is useless for a shaman in many situations.  My guild often buffs outside our raid zones as well, meaning my pet doesn't get the group buffs anyways.   I have heard rumors that there is a new suspended minion for other classes that would allow pets to cross zones, but not for shamans.  For the non-raider, or casual raider, think how useful this spell will be for regular group LDON.  Again, not useful at all, sadly.  The only group spell that is cast in my LDON adventures is a single refresh of blessing of replenishment.  Everything else is buffed outside.<br />
<br />
Giving dogdog all the buffs that I have, when he is summoned, is a good idea!  Would be super handy for summoning one and pocketing another, two fully buffed pets.  The only concern in this for me would be that I often click off Predator and SoV etc.  Would be easy enough to summon 2 pets and then pocket one though.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I think the massive point cost and limited usefulness of this AA makes it pretty undesirable atm.</div></div><hr />

I want to know if this affects buffs only, or if it's all group spells (in that stuff like wave of marr or blood of nadox would also work).<br />
<br />
Either way, it's good stuff, just make it like 5 points instead of 20 :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Shamus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">HAHHAHAHA gimme a break.  Like any shaman summons dogdog during a raid.  This is an even WORSE joke then before.  Hey developers, how about fixing the root of the problem to begin with?  It would be great if our pet could hit mobs during a raid but since they can't and when they do it's for like 1-5 points there's just no point in summoning a pet or even putting AA's into a pet call spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Twenty AA's has got to close to the amount of experience needed to level from 1 to 60.  That's just loopy.<br />
<br />
Hey Sony, how about FIVE???<br />
<br />
  Not sure about the rest of you BUT 20 AA are WAY easier to get then what is needed to get from Lvl 1 - Lvl 60...  Time wise at least.  I can get 2-3 AA a night playing maybe 3 hours max normally, 2 AA and a little bit in 2 hours.  SO unless you leveled 1 -60 in 20 Hours without any help at all from the outside other then normal grouping.  I am not sure how you could make a statement like that????</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Well, to be fair, he didn't say it was the same time-wise, he said exp-wise...  One reasonable exp mob you kill at lvl65 would probably get you more exp than levels 1-10 require.  Granted, it goes downhill fast after that, though. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I don't raid, I group, but I couldn't really use this AA...and I certainly wouldn't buy it for 20 points.<br />
<br />
For one, I don't buff my dog the same as I buff people.  My dog gets Focus/Diaku if I'm using cheese weapons, but if I have mage proc weapons, he gets max dex buffs (Mortal Deftness/Diaku/IoS/Talisman of Kragg).  And of course the necessary haste afterward.  ;)<br />
<br />
If I got this AA, to maximize dogdog's effectiveness I'd have to summon dogdog after I buff, but before other classes threw their group buffs...and that might make some people a tad annoyed.  ;)<br />
<br />
If this was 5 points, I might get it.  The ability for dogdog to get hit by RC and group heals would be nice, but no way will I spend 20 points on an AA that would require me to alter the way I go about pulling out the pet and inconvenience my group.<br />
<br />
Make it 5 points, or make it 10 points and fix it so a solo buff cast by me overwrites any group buff currently on the dog (so I can overwrite Fo7 for example), and it'll be worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">A step in the right direction.  I for sure wasn't going to even consider buying this AA just so my buffs could hit other people's pets.  <br />
<br />
But as it stands, 20AA's would only be worth spending if the dam dog would take over buffing for raids while I went AFK!</div></div><hr />

What Kamidari said.<br />
<br />
I meant the total count.  I had to google it, but I re-found this chart:<br />
<br />
http://www.geocities.com/sstair/EverQuest/<br />
<br />
Which is probably utterly out of date, but hey.  If I remember correctly, an AA point corresponds to the amount of XP needed to fill level 51.  The chart shows this as 25,175,325 for a barbarian shaman.  Multiply by 20 = 503,506,500 XP points.  That would take you from level 1 to about the middle of level 58.<br />
<br />
I think that still technically qualifies as loopy.<br />

Beastlord pets no longer zone with the owners....at its beginning, beastlord pets were a Hotkey summon, and it summoned a level 9 pet that did indeed zone with you; the beastlord had various Spirit of _____ spells that buffed the level of the pet. After around 6 months or 9 months, it got out in general knowledge that the pet buff spells were acting as complete heals for the pet, so a level 60 beastlord (this was just before PoP iirc, so no level 65) could summon a level 9 pet level buff it and send it in against whatever and for a farily low amount of mana (350-450 depending on the buff) CH it vs using various pet only heals they get......at lower levels it was quite broken, say mid 40s, so they nerfed it to where the Spirit line actually summons a pet of the appropriate level and has to be recast on zoning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Fenril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">1. Paying AA points to use something who should be fixed since day 1 of kunark (first group buffs implemented) : it's just plain wrong.<br />
<br />
Anyway SoE can argue over and over that is was never intended to buffs your pets &quot;freely&quot;. Well, just a matter of opinion ;).<br />
<br />
2. Paying AA points to be able to buff all pets around with, let's say a MGB Fo7 : It's just plain wrong too.<br />
<br />
The change they plan is a &quot;good&quot; change (except the fact that's still a bug fix... well :p).<br />
<br />
I don't see any Enchanters, Clerics, Druids working on this skill just for the pleasure to buff the pets.<br />
<br />
3. In LDoN, usually, the group buffing is done outside the dungeon and until pets can zone, this AA is... barely useless.<br />
<br />
4. In raid, I use pet very very rarely (mainly because I don't had /pet hold till last week), maybe I will use it now, but still... pet use in raid is an exception.<br />
<br />
5. So, now I have an AA who will be eventually useful for some non-LDoN groups or solo situation.<br />
<br />
My conclusion : honnestly, a not so bad AA (except the fact it's still a bug fix, but... you know the end :p), not something really tremendous and maybe valuable at times, but... in any way... NOT FOR A DAMN AMMOUNT OF 20AA.</div></div><hr />

I think this should be a freebie, why should we have to spend AA's on this... much less 20! My god, im still looking forward to getting canni 5, sorry sony we dont all play ALL DAY EVERY DAY. I'm sitting at lvl 63 and proud to be there, but 20 aa's to do what i think should be happening as is? All buffing my pet does is waste more time and irritate me, I wont go into fizzle rates, DoT resists, slow mitigations, crappy heals, or the fact that the dogdog needs weapons to use an inherant skill (dual wield).<br />
<br />
This should be a normally implemented ability for anyone, not an AA.<br />

I like that idea much better.  However, if they did that I'd think a buff slot increase (to say 20) would be in order.  Then would keep some atk/speed buffs on instead of clicking them off like usual.</div></div><hr />

Next expansion, for only 30AAs, you can buy this as an AA ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Kenneth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">I liked it the other way.  I may have purchased it the other way (for fewer points).  I'd rather save myself mana by having my buffs automatically land on everyone else's pets vs. they ask me for the buff and I have to do them individually.  Those without the AA are just going to ask for the buff anyway, and then I have a choice -- buff 'em, or tell 'em to frig off and go get the damn AA.  Either way, I don't like it.  And, as far as me doing the AA for my own doggy spirit, I could care less if he gets a virtue or an SoV or anything.  I'll buff that one critter in my way, with my buffs and he'll be just as moderately (to barely) effective as he always is.<br />

Just my thoughts.</div></div><hr />

I only have 51 AA right now I be damned if I waste 20 on that P.O S!</div></div><hr />
