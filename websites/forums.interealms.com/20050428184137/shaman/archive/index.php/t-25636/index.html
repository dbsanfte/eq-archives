<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I'm curious. I dont belong to any guilds and haven't had luck on rolls yet doing instances. No complaint there. <br />
<br />
I do buy what I dont get to drop or maybe quest from the AH. Plate of 50+ quality can be a little slow to come buy so i buy when i need when i can and kinda get the stats I want. <br />
<br />
The point of this thread. Do any of you feel you look as color blind as my poor dwarf? Id post a SS if I knew how. Green boots , Blue pants with a Purple and maybe orange design on it. Maroon Bp with like royal purple trim. A dark red helmet and gloves that are kind of a faded red. <br />
<br />
<br />
My cloak is like a whole different red than my helmt or gloves with some what appears to be fur and a light gold trim. My shoulder pads are a big bulky looking goldish yellow. I guess i could look worse some of the items could go together with each other but as a whole i'm an acid trip waiting to happen lol. <br />
<br />
So again dont get me wrong no complaint wrapped in here. If i wanted to wait i could buy pieces that were from the same set. Just kinda going with it now see what combo's come up. Kaieladascope(sp?) armor set hehe. <br />
<br />
Anyone else have this look going on?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Lol, yah sure do. My NE druid is wearing bright red boots which makes him look even fruitier then NE's normally do. <br />
<br />
Reminds of of the days in EQ before armor dyes. I miss my monochromatic black armor dye,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well one I don't worry about being guilded.  I'm also not too upset over my gear.  Trying to keep up with the Jones' was an EQ paradigm I'm not willing to repeat.<br />
<br />
Having said that, my main (54 Paladin) has an AC of 6001 which at his level mitigates 54.6% against an equal level opponent. Heck, for a while there I even matched with my all heavy Mithril armor.<br />
<br />
Not anymore. New pants from Un'Goro.  Sorta red, white and blue.<br />
<br />
Now my Hunter otoh is a fashion disaster. He's still making the transition from leather to mail and THAT is a pain.  He looks like he was standing next to a Crayola box explosion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">6001? You bastage. rogue is 59 with a whoppin 1497 ac, ha, 21.7% mitigation from 59 opponent.<br />
<br />
Hps? Asked you in other thread, but wanna cover my bets.<br />
<br />
Mill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I dunno, withough really making any effort to co-ordinate my shaman other than co-ordinating stats, I'd say my bull looks udderly badass (ouch on the pun, sorry).  Sure, some of the colours are a LITTLE off, but honestly, it's all good.  I choose my new shield (a quest award on elite) based solely on looks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kolmirg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you don't like the look of your helmet or cloak you can always go into interface options and set them to not display. I think the checkboxes are halfway down on the right hand side.<br />
<br />
Faern: Is that 6001 AC with a shield and auras/buffs? If not then my warrior is in serious need of an upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sounds like 6k ac with shield but if i'm wrong and thats 2h i'm shopping with Faern lol. My pally gets to about the same with aura and shield on. <br />
<br />
Thats pretty good numbers there Faern at 54 ive got a few lvls on ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bumluc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Mill....  1497?  That seems low.  I'm at 48 (forgot to update alla) but I'm at 1239.<br />
<br />

<br />
Did you forgo ac for sta or something?  I'm going pure agi, all else is secondary.  Last night in feralas i ploughed through 48 yeti before one set of poison wore off (&lt;30 min) .  I love my rogue.<br />
<br />
(edit)  On topic... I felt I was the red-headed step-child for a while, but as I leveled up, my stuff started to match better.  Most of my equipment is brown leather with large silver studs on it.  And with the tabbard, I actually look alright.  But!  I really like looking off.  So it sorta bums me out that it all matches.  It's a RL thing.  When I used to ski, I'd go to great lengths to ensure nothing I wore matched because of all the idiots there that had $900 matching outfits and could't snowplow (and yes, I have issues with authority, too.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">/sigh Never typed what i meant to begin with so the Ac stuff sidetracked. <br />
<br />
lol faern at the crayola box explosion. I got a new bp last night and it has a bright orange in the middle so even brighter today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It's actually 6007 and if the Shield procs it shoots to 6200 or so.<br />
<br />
So, yes it is with a shield.  I also picked some talents which give me a better protection aura and 10% AC bonus from items. I went with the latter as that will scale indefinitely, level regardless.<br />
<br />
I am pretty hard to take down. Yesterday three level 50 guards and other assorted PC's were beating on me (ignoring the Rogue who was happily BS'ing the lot of them /e boggle) and the only reason I died is as I was leaving I got shot in the back.<br />
<br />
My tradeoff is damage, but I partially mitigate that with Holy Shock (V2.0) which is a DD spell. Granted it's wimpy (410 Mana for 300 Damage), but I also picked talents upping my Mana regen. I went Holy Shock over consecration because in a group you can't AOE if the Mage is Sheeping and in PvP, intelligent players run out of the area.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Mill, HP's at 54 are 3532.  Sorta low considering my STA, but I live and that's all that matters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>jwilearl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I wish they had a better preview of what you're buying. I bought a pair of boots from the auction house and they are huge. They look like moon boots from back in the 80s.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">heh 1507 ac now, wow!  like 22% damage reduction, ha!<br />
<br />
3891 hps, still at 59. Was stupid and passed on level 37 blue shoudlers that would have given me 5 more stam, ha. I want 4000 at 60. Hell will retire rogue probably after, too many other easy classes to play. Been 59 for almost three weeks because no real point to 60, 60 skills blow.<br />
<br />
Mill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bazoom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">36 Gnome Rogue<br />
<br />
Trying to balance agi/sta on equipment, now having about 1100 ac, 1850 or so hp.<br />
