<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If you're playing a priest, I'm curious what you do solo.  I have this feeling I'm missing something...<br />
<br />
Currently I'm an 18 undead priest, and I was hunting on those islands in the lake around Ferniss (sp?) castle east of Silverpine.<br />
<br />
For even (same level):<br />
<br />
1.  Buff with PWF, Inner Fire, and the Undead Priest melee curse thing.<br />
2.  Pull with smite.<br />
3.  Mind blast as the mob comes.<br />
4.  SW:P<br />
4.  As he gets to me, swing once and hit him with melee, to weaken/curse him.<br />
5.  PW:S<br />
6.  Renew<br />
7.  Smite (shield is still up, might as well get the slow nuke off)<br />
8.  Mind blast as shield fades.<br />
9.  Melee/smite till dead.<br />
<br />
For mobs 2-3 above me, Basically the same plan, but I renew twice, and I PW:S before I pull, wait for it to get to 18 seconds, then pull.  I can get a second shield in right at the end.<br />
<br />
Talent wise:  I went 5 with Spirit Tap (I solo a lot), and I have 4 in the Stun resist one on Disc tree, trying now to get the reduced cooldown on PW:S.<br />
<br />
I feel like I'm missing something.  Doesn't seem smooth.  I've tried various line ups, this seems to be the best of the bunch I've experimented with.  Anyone have suggestions on a smoother pull?<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Also, if you're undead, do you use cannibalize much?  Cast time seems way too long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">heh Serepi, have you checked the wow priest forums? That is the one class I know nothing about, but I do know they are a pain in the ass in pvp with their fear thingie.<br />
<br />
Levels are coming good, good job.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have an undead mage.<br />
<br />
My partner is an undead warlock.  We don't have much in the way of healing potential. We have healthstones the warlock can summon (which have cooldown) and potions (which have cooldown) and cannibalize (which has cooldown).<br />
<br />
I find I used cannibalize quite a bit so far from level 1 to 11.   Now that we have a warlock voidwalker to tank for us, we might not use it as much.<br />
<br />
The &quot;cast&quot; time on it isn't really &quot;cast time&quot;  It's &quot;Channel&quot; time.  Yes, its kinda the same thing but kinda different.  It's insta cast, but doubles your hp regen while you channel it.  I always interrupt myself once I reach full health or close to it.   I assume there is a timer on how long you can channel it (like 15 seconds or 20 seconds or something ) but I haven't hit it yet.   So far, my hp is my limiting factor in this game just like in eq.  I've rarely run out of mana unless I'm standing near a spawn point/wander through point.    Of course, I acquired a wand as soon as I could and use it quite a lot for extra dps without mana use.  It's actually respectable damage so far and allows you to regen mana since it isn't considered to be &quot;casting&quot; :-)<br />
<br />
I have a dwarf priest.  I duo with a Paladin though on that character so my spell use will be different than yours :-)</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the response, good info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm playing a night elf priest~ currently highest on my server even-alliance side anyhow not sure about horde (level 30.5).  I'm not really sure what your strategy is, I hate acronyms... so I'll just spell mine out.<br />
<br />
I usually have shield going at all times when something is incoming (I almost always solo btw).  I pull with the DOT pain, which almost guarantees it to run full course (note: mine is max extended duration via talents).  I then melee as it arrives.  At this point I cast starshards since it is channeled and cannot be interrupted thanks to my shield.  You, being undead, will have to sub in mind blast here (NOT smite, smite just totally blows in every possible way, unless you have holy damage boost).<br />
<br />
I rely HEAVILY on melee damage as its mana-free and saves me any unecessary downtime.  In fact, I think this is where a lot of the priests that are having trouble are going wrong--you HAVE to melee as well as cast spells to be the most efficient killing machine possible.<br />
<br />
This is usually enough to bring the MOB down as long as it was my level or under.  After its dead, my spirit tap kicks in and by the time I find another MOB to kill, my mana is usually almost full or getting close anyway.<br />
<br />
I found that if I have to cast more than two additional spells to bring it down, I'm using too much mana and taking too much time to kill.  Therefore, I'm being inefficient, and I find something a little weaker to kill.  This doesn't necessarily mean that I am killing things under my level exclusively, but the lower levels are especially rough in terms of what you can take down efficiently and reliably.<br />
<br />
I must be doing something right as I've managed to stay ahead of all the priests and I'm gaining on some of the slower-leveling hunters/mages/warlocks.  <br />
<br />
Finally, priests are sort of a slow-building class it seems.  What you lack in power in the lower levels, you make up for in the upper levels.  My ONLY gripe about the class right now is mind soothe is TOTALLY worthless.  I thought it was going to be like pacify, but its pretty much just worthless in all but a limited number of circumstances.<br />
<br />
I want to put a disclaimer in here that in order for this to be most effective, you have to STAY AHEAD in terms of equipment.  That means a 4dps dagger isn't going to cut it very long, and 3ac cloth tatters aren't going to see you to level 30.<br />
<br />
*I forgot to add that my average length of a fight is around 30 seconds from pull to the MOB dying, and this is how its been for the last 20 of my 30 levels.  I rarely have to heal after fights nor during them unless I pull multiples.  I usually fight my level or up to 2 levels under, although at 30 I usually can take my level or 3 over without much difficulty.  Good luck!*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Playing a priest myself.  I do mostly grouping, so I haven't bothered w/ shadow spec at all, that would certainly help your solo ability.  Going Holy/Disc, soloing isn't terribly fast.  I can kill things, but if I get an add, or weren't pretty full to start, it can be rough.  Usually pull w/ smite, toss on sw: p, then hit mind blast.  After that, melee a bit, renew self, hit up sw: p again, and mind blast as it refreshes.  Fights normally last 20-30 seconds, less if it's a bit lower level mob, a little more if I pull something 2 levels higher.  Hit 33 last night, so things are moving along pretty well so far.<br />
<br />
The cannibalize spell looks interesting, but I'm not sure how much I'd use it.  On the other hand, desperate prayer absolutely kicks ass, and has saved mine and the groups life at least 5 times so far, generally in instances (deadmines once, blackfathom depths twice, stockades 3 times).<br />

What server you end up on sir?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Anzjoul ? or something..I never can remember my server name; just know its two words and starts with an A :)<br />
<br />
I heard most everyone from the nameless ended up on whisper wind though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah saw that.  Though oddly there's a guild named 'Nameless' on Blackhand.  I think that's one of the names the guild formed from the NT boards wanted originally.  I think a section of TFS folk have formed a horde guild on Blackhand too.  We're itching to kill a few =)</div></div><hr />
