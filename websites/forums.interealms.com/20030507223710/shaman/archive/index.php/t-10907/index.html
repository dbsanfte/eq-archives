I just bought primal essence in bazaar for 1k. I was sitting down to scribe it when I began to think of my meager horse fund. I started debating which is more useful PE or horse? I couldn't decide so here I am trolling for opinons. :)<br />
<br />
What would you do? I could probably sell PE for 6-10k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hail Dunwut,<br />

I'll buy the PE for 6kpp if you want to sell it.  I'll need to arrange a short term loan I think, but that can be arranged in an hour or so from the Clan.  Rather annoying not having it for me. :p  If you don't see me, ask Crom, Siilverain, or Giah about it, and they can make the purchase for me too.<br />
<br />
As to an honest answer for you, I'd keep the PE scroll if I were you, unless Anlah'Shok is regularly raiding Ssraeshza Temple 2nd Floor.<br />
<br />
The horse vendor will always be available to you.  I'm 61 and have been actively looking for PE since I was able to scribe it and STILL don't have a copy.  CBA only has one copy scribed. :(<br />
<br />
That said, a horse is EXTREMELY valuable to you as a shaman.  You are likely grinding in PoP.  All outdoor zones.  Consider having a pony as adding FT10 for you (that's not a definitive #, just used for mana-regen illustrative purposes) any time you are in an outdoor zone.  Add to that the avoidance of sit aggro for swapping out spells in combat and it can be a real life-saver.<br />
<br />
If you want to sell it for 6kpp, let me know.  Feel free to post either here or at http://pub92.ezboard.com/fclanbattleaxefrm24<br />
<br />
Once again, though it pains me to say so, If I were you I'd hold onto it. :cool: <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Horse all the way.<br />
<br />
PE is a nifty spell.. but wont make a difference in whether or not you win any fights.<br />
<br />
A horse will change the way you play EQ.  The reduced agro, and increased mana is just unreal.  As you have a JBB it will be even moreso for you -full medding mana recovery while you are clicking away mana free nukes.<br />
<br />
Sell it for the cost of a horse if you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have group PE on a hammer and the horse and am also an Ogre.  PE is nice in that it stacks with Focus but the horse will do you a lot more good.  The + to a few stats has very little impact in comparison to the horse and I often don't cast it when soloing because I can just break 1k ac if I cast the rage spell and that overwrites PE.<br />
<br />
That being said, if you can get cash easy then keep the spell and end up with both.  10kp is not that hard to farm and the spell is rare.  Horse &gt; PE but if all that stands between you and having both is a week of plat farming then I would farm.  I have yet to see the spell for sale.<br />
<br />
Come to think of it I would just scribe the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ezeekial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Horse &gt; PE but you may kick yourself if you can't find PE agian.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hail,<br />
<br />
Dunwut sold the PE scroll for 15kpp.  He wasn't expecting to sell it at that price.  Hope he enjoys his pony. :)<br />
<br />
My point wasn't that PE is so awesome or anything, just that it is very hard to come by.  A horse in contrast can be bought as soon as you get 8499pp or so today, tomorrow, or next month.  PE scrolls don't have that availability.  <br />
<br />
Cash isn't hard to come by either if you work at it.  Hell, my guild BUYS just about every priest class a horse out of vault funds.  (I bought my own.)<br />
<br />
While PE isn't the greatest buff, its stackability w/ the Focus line make it really nice.  An extra 60hp for us, but that's an extra 120hp to a warrior.  Will it get dumped on major raids, probably.  But it will get cast on most experience groups, making it valuable.<br />
<br />
Too bad PE and VoTB don't stack. :(<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">IMO PE is terribly overrated.  Melee's ask for it far too much.  The benefits to them are ultimately quite limited most of the time.  I'm not saying I never cast it, just that folks think it's better than it is.<br />
<br />
If you scored that much coin for it more power to you.<br />
<br />
Yes it is uncommon.  My guild is high end.  We have a larger than average number of raiding shaman and I think I'm the only one with the spell.  A few of our shaman do have the VP hammer though.  I guess there's a group PE clickable item out there somewhere as well.  Now that would be sweet =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I guess there's a group PE clickable item out there somewhere as well.  <br />
<br />
Primal Cudgel (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics18/Primal_Cudgel.jpg) might be what your looking for Nuttasaurus? Group only tho :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dunwut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yep sold the scroll and got a horse and I think I made the right decision. <br />
<br />
I weighed the pros and cons and decided to gamble that I would someday see the spell for sale again.  In fact about a month ago I saw it for 2k but I was too slow and another shaman beat me there. With more folks on our server hitting ssra the spell is showing up a  lot more often than in the past.<br />
<br />
I also am prognosticating that sooner or later Sony will either increase the mobs that drop this or just plain make it a vendor spell. Odds arent good but ya never know.<br />
<br />
I love the horse. Constant sit mana regen without sit aggro is great especially in the planes. I will see how it improves my soloing capability tonight.<br />
<br />
Thanks everyone for you input and sorry Frekkels that I wasn't able to get my bazaar mule down in time to sell to you. I honestly didn't think someone would pay 15k for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">That's the one Salorm, but where does it drop?  I've never seen a shaman with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have it :D <br />
drops from the worm in acrylia cavern..Restless burrower or whatever his name was..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nanuq Daktari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'd love to see PE prices like that on Bertox, seems we have some insane people trying to sell PE for 50k to 30k.  Whats sad is I am sure theres some shaman on our server that will pay that stupid price.  /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hail Dunwut,<br />
<br />
In fact about a month ago I saw it for 2k <br />
<br />
LOL.<br />
Guess what, that's the one copy CBA has scribed.<br />
Rinyn just beat you out for that 2kpp copy.<br />
<br />
IT WAS MISPRICED!!!  The Trader forgot a zero.  He was selling it for TWENTY KPP, not two!  Shaman spell price REVENGE!!! :p<br />
<br />
He asked for the spell back, and for the price difference.<br />
Rinyn laughed.  Later, when he told me, I laughed even louder. :)<br />
<br />
Enjoy your pony! :D<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>DarkPhase</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I destroyed my primal cudgel.<br />
<br />
The point that drove me crazy was I got passed around to PE groups...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I've camped the mystic a few times and in a typical 3 or 4 hour camp, at least 2 copies of PE have dropped every time. .. never seen more than one copy of Group Acumen drop though. <br />
<br />
Given that you can do the camp with a good group, I don't see how people would pay that much money for it. At 10k a copy, it's almost worth getting a group together and farming it. ;-)</div></div><hr />
