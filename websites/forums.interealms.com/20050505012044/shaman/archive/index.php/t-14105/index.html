<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Themis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I came back from a long vacation from EQ and hunted with my guild in Fear tonight.  One of the Shaman (Who shall remain nameless, right Tox?)  wanted to show me his new AA skill (Cann V), but failed to remember he had just been rezzed...and did the ol' Canni of death.  He of course laughed it off, but it was pretty amusing and reminded me of all the stories I've read here on the Crucible about other Shaman that met a similar fate.  Really put a smile on my face.<br />
<br />
Other good news was 2 Iksar Broodling's popped and another Shaman and myself were able to get a tear.   <br />
<br />
Anyways, thought you would all get a kick out of it and reminisce about when you first received Cann V.  :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I haven't killed myself with canni 5 yet, having had it for a few months now.<br />
<br />
Maybe I shouldn't post things like this :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hannduvdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you really want to have fun, after a rez or by just clicking all your buffs off, play with your gear removing however many things it takes to get your HP between 1915 and 1924.  Make sure you heal yourself to full.  I had to play around with my gear a bit and take off an earring, ring, and bracer, and as my gear gets better I have to take off more.  Anyways, once you get your HP between 1915 and 1924 (you might be able to go lower, but those are the numbers that have worked for me), tell one of your buddies that you just bought a new shaman AA Feign Death ability.  When they are looking at you, Can V.  That will put you into the purple and you'll fall down, then when your natural regen kicks in you'll stand back up.  Really confuses most people.  =)<br />
<br />
Try it in bearform too if you want to make a temporary bearrug for somebody.<br />
<br />
DON'T do this if mobs are around though or you'll die for real.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i haven't killed myself with canni V yet<br />
<br />
i came close a couple of times when i wanted to canni V and was wearing resist gear at the time unbuffed, ended up getting knocked unconcious .. but topor at the time fixed that right up :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">An enchanter friend of mine used to be able to purple herself with mod rods every time (back when you could click 3 times in a row). It used to freak people out. :) I shall have to remember that when I get canni V. :)</div></div><hr />

Might've gotten too obscure there....  Purple refers to &quot;The Purple Club,&quot; started by The Quon.  I'm sure all the guys in EQ will wannabe this guy's friend and every huney begging to toot his horn, as soon as he turns 14.<br />
<br />
You can find his rantings at www.thequon.net.  Personally, I like what he puts near the top of his guild applications:  &quot;I'll make a great contribution to your guild because I've been a great member of many other guilds.&quot;  And this guy thinks that's an asset to a guild?!?!?!<br />
<br />
Just when you think this guy can't be this blind stupid, remember all the other underage, underachiever, &quot;nobody's as k3wl as me&quot; d00dz you've met.  It's guys like this that give teenagers that ARE mature a bad name  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah, the purple club is when you get so low health you're unconcious but don't actually die. <br />
<br />
Hehe, sorry. I was assuming it was fairly common now - certainly, everyone seemed to understand when I joined the purple club last night when I got knocked unconcious just as the cleric healed (damn slow resists, grrr), even though some of them had never heard of the Quon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm sure there are people out there who don't even know what page 8 is  : )</div></div><hr />

Oh my god...please tell me this is supposed to be humor.  His webpage, I mean.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I check my hp everytime before I do canni v after killing myself twice.  Click inventory and look at number - NOT gonna do it again!!<br />
<br />
:)&gt;&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Load a customer UI, Grickk, then you won't need to do the inventory check every time.  My UI isn't that complex, but the box that has my info in it has all the bars, all my resists, wieght, stats, etc.  It comes in handy.</div></div><hr />

If he wasn't fairly serious about his opinions on himself and other classes, then it wouldn't be so funny, in a pethetic kinda way  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Oh, I used to laugh at the cannicide stories.  Till I got a quick rez last night. Loot, quick HP check, 2700, all clear, Loading....<br />
Remember, check max HP AND health. 2700 x 60% &lt;1924.</div></div><hr />

Heh, one of us has a warped sense of humor. I'd never even considered that someone could take that web site seriously. I've always thought it was a takeoff of Jay (and Silent Bob).</div></div><hr />

I would probably agree, except I've had indepentant verification from his shard that he walks his walk, just as he talks his talk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I think I've died twice with it. Both times were from the update hp bug where it'd show 2700 hps or whatever and kill you anyways. No big deal. I think it's fixed now?  Haven't had it happen in a few months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'll be getting Cann 5 this weekend, I'm 1.4 AA short right now.  Should add new levels to freaking out my wife, since she goes nuts now just from me canning to 1-2% hp.  I even made a hotkey:<br />
<br />
/g Cannibalizing a lot.  Avert your eyes from my HP bar if you're squeamish.<br />
<br />
After I hit that there's always a (beat, beat) &quot;Oh my god!  HONEY!&quot;<br />
<br />
because, you know, we're in the same room, why would she read what I type?</div></div><hr />
