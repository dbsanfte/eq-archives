<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When is it possible to solo the components for the quest to get the key to CoD? Talking about doing it at reasonable speed, not spending 20 minutes killing a mob, ready to gate when a root breaks.<br />
<br />
Is 61 good enough, and can they be tanked at this level with normal equipment (ie, no raid lvl equipment).<br />
<br />
All of this assuming that I can actually find the PHs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Serj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did this quest at 62.  I tanked the mob while the dog was biting it's back side.  I was self buffed and used torpor a lot.  BoN makes the fights go a lot faster and I had about 60-80 mana after each fight.  The only problem I had was the annoying spider that pathed through every once in awhile, but I kept it rooted and epic'd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kraaga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have the key, although all my quest pieces, but one were obtained by a swarm kiting bard friend of mine. At 61 you should be able to kill all of the larvae. They were all blue to me and had 30 min timers on the corpse. It will take quite a while I would imagine and they are fairly dangerous. I've only killed them in groups.<br />
<br />
In CoD itself, on Druzzil at least, it's BYoG and I cannot tank the puslings even when they are slowed. High damage double attacks still sneak through. Also they eat your pet alive and obviously disease DOTs are out. I've never landed one. <br />
<br />
Lately, I've been grouping with a necro and the bard from above and after slowing, the necro gets aggro by DOTing with everything he's got then runs in tight circles while Bard and I DOT. Sometimes we add a Beastlord for faster kills. We stay away from Greater Puslings and it usually goes well.</div></div><hr />
