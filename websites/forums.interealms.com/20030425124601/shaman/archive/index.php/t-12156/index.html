<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yes... yet another equipment check...<br />
<br />
I resently just got 23K and I was wondering what to spend it on. I was thinking trade skills ( damn you coldain prayer shawl! ) but my gear could always use an upgrade. I *think* my magelo is up to date, I cant check from where I am though =\. any input would help, thanks guys<br />
<br />
*edit* magelo is on the sig pic =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dyrk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You could buy Tae Ew bloods and have someone craft you a bp/legs/shield, or get a group to farm them.<br />
<br />
Get a group and hit the crewmen in Nadox for a coral ring.<br />
<br />
Camp the Nadox zoneline that leads to the Mines for a Bracelet of the Spiritcharmer.  You can do solo, easilly.  I did it solo at 53, and got a charm of the deceiver, too (adds 6sta 10cha 10dex when in bear form).<br />
<br />
Chitinous belt (cost me around 800p)<br />
<br />
Silver hammer earring (6k) or the glassy frog eye (5k) to replace forest loop.<br />
<br />
Hobgoblin surprise - 300p.  Use that as the turn in for the second part of the beginner's magic manual (for wisdom) or melee manual (for stamina) quests.  Easy quest, just a little time consuming unless you grab someone to track.<br />
<br />
Maybe replace your boots, but the AC on yours is decent.<br />
<br />
I don't know what else I'd do with the money.  Actually, I do.  I'd waste it on a twink... :D</div></div><hr />
