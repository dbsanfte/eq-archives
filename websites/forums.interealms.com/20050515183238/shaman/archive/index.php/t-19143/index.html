And in case they remove the thread...<br />
How many threads detailing the current woes of the Shaman class do we need? I am not sure Mr. Owl can answer this one.<br />
How about we keep it on the one nice long thread which for the most part has been well behaved and has been forwarded to the team to read? Sounds like a good plan to me. <br />
<br />
You can also submit your feedback using the /feedback command in-game (Yes it actually does get read) or by using the submit comment link on EQlive under the Dev corner. <br />

Thanks all.<br />

<br />
I was just coming to the board to ask a similar question. <br />
<br />
I stopped visiting Monkly-Business 6 months ago because 98% of the threads started tuning into whiney ass BS. Now The Crucible has turned into the same exact thing. Almost every thread is about why we suck. <br />
<br />
Why cant we make a new forum for all the complaint/suggestion threads?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Guys they may be reading what we post.  But also Human nature, sometimes its hard to admit your at fault.    Not saying SoE is doing this but I think they MAY be trying to look at us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Tat, to be fair it's not normally like that here--there may be 1 or 2 threads about it on the front page normally, but at the moment, everyone is just excited because for once we have an acknowledgement that the dev's have at least heard us.  Regardless of actual improvements, I consider that mission accomplished.  Honestly, it's the first time I've ever heard of acknowledgement of any kind from a developer about the shaman class since our epic was healing mobs.<br />
<br />
Give everyone a week or two to settle down, and we'll be back to business as usual.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tat2demon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I know this has only been the case recently, and hopefully the point is getting across to SOE. The thing that bothers me is a lot of the stuff being posted is the same stuff being hashed and rehashed over again.<br />
<br />
I really like The Crucible. Im just afraid its goin to turn into a Monkly-Business 2.0.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Now The Crucible has turned into the same exact thing. Almost every thread is about why we suck<br />
<br />
For once we aren't going to take upgrades that cost us twice the mana for 10-25% upgrades (or just plain worthless spells--single target str/dex in PoP).  I don't remember the last time I saw a spell that was a TRUE upgrade from what kunark spells we have (maybe canni4 if that was velious...).<br />
<br />
Once the expansion comes out things will calm down and go back to some sort of normalcy, but this also assumes they change our spells.  So far they are all worthless: new dot which is disease only good for soloing, new canni that gives a whopping 8 more mana with a higher fizzle rate and same cast time of canni4, a new slow that is magic resist check that is lesser than even a beastlord slow and has a long recast.  Not to mention that we get a new focus that saves 25% on the new worthless DoT.<br />
<br />
Even LDON spells were better than this crap, and I wasn't very impressed with those (except the magic based DoT was a nice addition even if i hated the recast time).<br />
<br />
I'm glad they are being inundated with feedback to have gotten to the point of making a public response.  It would be great to actually get a MEANINGFUL spell for once (maybe even something everyone NEEDS).  I was in a group the other day and the wizard that joined was willing to DONATE to the enchanter in the group for KEI, why don't we have a spell like that (I dont necessarily mean mana regen..just something people feel they NEED)?</div></div><hr />

When the expansion goes live, and when your in a group with a beastlord. When you see the text &quot;Your spell will not hold&quot; when casting your new slow spell. Then you'll understand what at least &quot;I'm whining&quot; about.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Seriously, at this point its a lesson in human nature to me. I just like watching the wheels turning over the same patch of ice and getting no where. Mind you im not trying to put down my fellow shaman, but its a intresting pattenr is all. Everyone wants something, but no one wants to comprimise and agree, we are tearing away in all different directions and the hardest part to swallow about it is its truly the fault of our class diversity.<br />
<br />
I mean on one end you got people like Giac who think everyone that doesnt agree with the things he wants are complete morons. Then you have the battle shaman who think the clerical shamans have it all wrong and vise versa. Then you have the shaman that just work their asses off and dont bother anymore with all of this and just make use of the tools they have and do a fine job with it.<br />
<br />
Group A gets mad at group B cause they are content enough to get by, while group C thinks that untill we get dual wield inately and that rabid bear is upgraded with 5 min recast time, that everyone is completely wrong and dragging the shaman down. Group D just wants everyone to S-T-F-U so they can play their shaman and not get so mad they have to make a alt which turns into a main to get away from the bitching and complaining.<br />
<br />
In the end we all play the same class and all go out and do it 1 slow at a time. <br />

You gotta admit, when you kick back and take survey of the land, its pretty intresting and really kinda funny.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I was a legislative aide for over seven years.  I can tell you from experience that it is impossible for a group in an democracy or republic to over lobby their leaders in regards to issues that are important to them.  While it may get on their nerves, flooding a legislative or leadership body with communications cannot hurt.  <br />
<br />
Many folks act as if SoE may get angry and nerf us out of spite.  That just wont happen.  We vote with our subscriptions and purchasing power.  SoE wants our votes.  In these online games just like in real life, decisions that hurt different groups are made out of ignorance or because it is politically expedient to do so.<br />
<br />
As long as we are respectful, flooding SoE with our points of view can only help.  Even if the communications are rude it is not going to cause SoE to actively harm us, they will merely stop listening to what we have to say thus increasing the probablity that their Shaman features will not be good for the entire community.  SoE needs our money too much to willfully screw up classes.<br />
<br />
Keep the lobbying efforts going they will produce positive results.</div></div><hr />

I agree but how many people you think will move over to EQ2 rather than WoW or any other game?<br />
<br />
For me, and I'm willing to bet I'm not alone, what happens in the next month will greatly determine if I'm planning on moving to EQ2 as I had been planning to or if I'll find another MMORPG to move to when the time comes.</div></div><hr />

I was exaggerating ever so slightly, but I do  send in feedbacks, bug reports etc quite often, everything from suggestions that it would be nice to finally finish the Initiate talismon quests, to fixing spell stacking issues, loot bugs, quests that were long ago fixed (mostly old Sol Ro stuff) and even was one of the ones that /bugged way back in the day that you could trade no drop items in bags etc.... Instead of getting all testy and pouty about it, I decided a long time ago (been at this 3 1/2 years now) that I would make suggestions the most direct way possible....now as to whether or not any one has listened</div></div><hr />

Somehow, I don't think &quot;poignant&quot; is the word you're going for there.<br />
<br />
Back on track, listen, I think it's silly to think &quot;SOE hates shaman!&quot;  Where's the sense in that?  Changes in class abilities (for better, for worse) have been made along the way in an attempt (judge the success on its own merits) to achieve a balance so that the game can be fun, rewarding and challenging whether you play a necro, chanter, shaman, or paladin.  To fuel this &quot;the company hates shaman!&quot; rhetoric smacks of paranoia: &quot;They're out to get me, I just know it!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Back on track, listen, I think it's silly to think &quot;SOE hates shaman!&quot; <br />
<br />
Absolutely.  I don't believe for a second that the dev team holds animosity towards any class.  I do, however, believe they've always spent the least amount of time thinking about shaman.  If you look at the history of our spellbooks, our upgrades have been cookie cutter stuff that any intern could have cranked out before lunch without fear of reprisal.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't have a beef really if I had not personally made that same comment on these very boards for the last four exansions.  If they would just once break out of the new_spell = (old_spell * 1.05) approach to shaman then I wouldn't even mind being ignored for another four expansions.  I'm bored.  It's our turn for some dev team lovin'.   <br />

<br />
Hey Zern, I'm just the cut-and-paster. It's a reflection on the huge number of concerned, passionate, articulate posters here that I can't even count the number of individuals who contributed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">If you think about it, the fact that there are so many posts on the same subject is indicative of the size of the problem. Why else would so much energy be expended on such a specific issue? Remember the whole warrior thing? There were raging, flaming posts about what is/isn't wrong with warriors all over ever EQ related board in existance. Many people took it upon themselves (almost to a person they hadn't played the class) to say there was nothing wrong. Obviously there was something wrong or so many people wouldn't have gone to so much effort over it.<br />
I'm sure other classes have complaints, and there are always going to be people who whine and ask for unrealistic things, but that kind of stuff is always localized within a small number of posts and specific to that classes boards. Think about what is being said about a class like Beastlords. The only negativity I ever see is about them having too much! I don't see them complaining all over the internet about how hard it is for them to do whatever they are supposed to do in the game (tanking, healing, slowing for example). Thats because there really is no problem. Narrow the gap between us and them and even we won't complain about what they can do.<br />
The fact that this guy is complaining says a couple things about him.<br />
1. He is not quite up to the task of dealing with the public, I've been in positions where I was responsible for dealing with peoples complaints and even alluding to the fact that they are complaining is in bad taste. Its your job, deal with it.<br />
2. The company itself is not real interested in doing the right thing. They would never let things get so out of hand if they were. I believe everytime they start getting flak like this they think to themselves &quot;why can't they just shut up and play the game.&quot;<br />
3. Enough people care to be putting these posts out there, there is some power in that. I think its great he's getting annoyed, that means they are at least being forced to deal with it as an issue, however reluctantly.<br />
I say post all you want, however redundant those posts are. If the moderators here want to consolodate all that stuff into one or a few posts thats fine, but don't stop stating your opinions over at SOE's boards or wherever else you want to express your point of view.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I think its great that we are getting on the devs nerves.<br />
Threads and feedback hitting them from all sides shouldn't just be dismissed as a disjointed front. It shows that the straw has finally broken the camels back. <br />
We have seen in various discussions that there are many ways to play a shaman. The fact is that NONE of these different playstyles got anything approaching an upgrade with GoD, leaving all but the most rosy glassed pollyannas with a feeling of disappointment.<br />
Keep chipping away; so far we've gotten a decent canni upgrade, but from my own point of view this was never really a big issue. Now they need to address at least one of the problems with healing or dps. I don't really care which, but both would be appreciated.<br />
More mana is frankly useless to me when the spells I use have fallen so far behind the pack because of their many and varied limitations.</div></div><hr />
