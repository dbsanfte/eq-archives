<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cosik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just hoping to get some good feedback and see what my options might be on upgrades.  I had seen the type of good information that had been given to others and would hope to gain a bit of the knowlege of the others who frequent the board for myself. :)<br />
<br />
A few things I had been thinking of trying to gain but also some that are probably out of my range (poor shaman here) where things like Kael armor, some sort of regen tunic, Solstice earring.<br />
<br />
I am getting some help to try for a coldain military wristguard over the weekend so will hopefully have that soon.<br />
<br />
Would really like information on any sort of cheaper (possiably under 1 or 2k) but good upgrades I should do. <br />
<br />
My current equipment should be able to be seen through the link in my sig.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KrintixXaneris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sebilite scale legs, shadel bandit ring or a 6ac 65hp one, new bp, but for the prices you want, ummm, hmm, maybe a froglok scale bp or seb scale bp.  New boots, too - maybe tribal war boots if you can get them at a good price, but anything with a little more ac and stats.  Black fur boots would be great for quite a while if you're working on your epic, get your friends to go to mistmore, hell, its almost like a new zone since no one goes there anymore.<br />
<br />
Also, I'd like to commend you on getting the scaled mystic sleeves, it was the only pice I could never get (damn you froglok supplier), and I don't think I've ever seen anyone else with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Jarsath Scale and Sebilite Scale were my upgrades in my late 40's, early 50's, I spent many an hour in Hate before they put our armour in up there, gah. Get on Hate raids soon as you're safe in planar level.<br />
<br />
The upgrades you mention going for are solid. You should be able to pick up a chardok earring, twisted leaves or earring of purity  for the other ear in your price range.</div></div><hr />
