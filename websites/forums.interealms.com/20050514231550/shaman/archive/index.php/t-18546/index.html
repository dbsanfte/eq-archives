1. We don't need some weak god to act as our intermediary to the spirtworld, we commune directly with them.<br />

10) F that, if something bumps into us during the night we kill it. Remember, we can SLOW TIME ITSELF.<br />
<br />
9) Why fall when you can levitate :D.<br />
<br />
8) Wisdom is overrated, duh. :cool:<br />
<br />
7) Why be stealthy when you can tank it IN TEH FACE?<br />
<br />
6) Woad &gt; *<br />
<br />
5) Vah Shir can't get the troll chicks, gotta love the floppy knockers.<br />
<br />
4) Barbs can do that resist cold deal to, and we do it without fur...<br />
<br />
3) Once again, wisdom is overrated. :p <br />
<br />
2) You tolerate the frogs, and that is completely unforgivable.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">10. We're not blind like those barbarians. <br />
<br />
((  1 word acumen<br />
<br />
9. We (almost) always land on our feet. <br />
<br />
(( Notice the almost ;)<br />
<br />
8. We're quick learners. <br />
<br />
(( You shed alot too, who wants to kiss their lover and hack up a furball later.<br />
<br />
7. Most stealthy of the shaman. <br />
<br />
(( Yes unlike other shaman that tank int he face and dont run from danger, kitties have a ability that lets them avoid danger cause they are so fragile<br />
<br />
6. Luxiourous fur coat. Chicks dig the fur.<br />
<br />
 (( Again, furballs. Barbs are the most sexy, i know cause i am one. Chics dig sexy muscles not hacking up furballs.<br />
<br />
5. High ranking Vah Shir can get a harem. <br />
<br />
(( I cant argue there :D  But since the hot ones dont like hacking up furballs, i dont even wanna know what your harem is made up of  /shudder<br />
<br />
4. Built in protection against those cold nights on the dark side of the moon. <br />
<br />
 ((  2 thoughts, dont live on the freaking moon !! Secondly, that just shows how weak you are, cause im from Halas and i run around naked with just a kilt on. Can you say polar bear club?<br />
<br />
3. Most advanced society of all the shaman races.  <br />
<br />
(( Advanced is how you look at it. I view barbs as more advanced in the spirit real cause we right there with mother nature and the spirits of norrath. Kitties are the Dion warwicks of the shaman world while the Barbs are for real ;)<br />
<br />
2. Most tolerant race of all. <br />
<br />
(( Tell that to my iksar !!!  /cry<br />
<br />
1. We don't need some weak god to act as our intermediary to the spirtworld, we commune directly with them <br />
<br />
(( Thats because you are godless scum that have a belief built on lies. Come to the tribunal lil kitty and ill show you the truth.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lets not forget the best reason of all Barbs onw all shaman. We get to be a white polar bear and you dont, na na na na  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Mmmm, Floppy knockers...<br />
<br />
*Ahem* Main reason Vah Shir make the worst shaman is for the simple basic fact that they have their head between their legs when they cannibalize. Ouch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Meryll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">There are Vah Shir shaman? wth was Sony thinking?<br />
<br />
You all know that the only people who play vah shir shaman play them because they like the fishnet bodystocking look of chain armour on kitties. If sony hadn't made vah shir shaman then they'd all be playing half-elf bards!<br />

I actually get asked for SD quite a lot lately when hanging around PoK.  I guess it's the hammer + glowing fist combination.  Though my glowing fist doesn't hit anything.  If you think getting asked for shammy buffs is bad...getting asked for both is much much worse.</div></div><hr />

Agreed, anythings better than another Barbarian.  :rolleyes: <br />
Honestly I wish they would introduce a quota, that, once reached, would not allow anyone else to roll up a barb Shaman.  :) <br />
And if you really want the chicks to dig you, play an Ogre. Just let them get a peek at those muscles and they will get weak in the knees (a strategic area of the female anatomy) and will follow you around like, well, kittens.  :cool:</div></div><hr />

Well, I have no worries over a shovel.  It's that spayed thing I'd be concerned about.<br />
<br />
Of course, all the other races are simply threatened by our elegant fur and mesmerizing tails - too sexah to deal with.  I have to fight off love-sick Barbs with a stick.  And aren't they supposed to be warriors anyway?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Why iksar are best:<br />

10. We don't wear dresses.<br />
<br />
9. We are so wise.<br />
<br />
8. Least tolerant race.<br />
<br />
7. Scales.<br />
<br />
6. Phatest tails.<br />
<br />
5. We progressed the furthest in our plans for world domination.<br />
<br />
4. Frogs are our primary food source.<br />
<br />
3. When we go to war we do it with dragons, not mutant monkeys.<br />
<br />
2. We didn't get kicked out of our starting town by FROGS.<br />

Yah, just forgot to mention they knocked your civilization one step from the stone age. <br />
<br />
We got accidently blasted to the moon and still had cities that weren't using similar architecture to ogres.<br />

Dear Litgruv:<br />
<br />
We, the Iksar, created jaundice bone armor. After a few months we realized we were powerful enough we really didn't need it anymore, and threw it to the frogs and dogs where you softskins eventually scavenged up your &quot;crutch&quot; :)<br />
<br />
Haha ogres architecture? Stone age?<br />
<br />
Hell you cats haven't even figured out how to build teleports yet, even the humans got that one right eventually. You have 1(!) city...our empire covered a continent. You run into a hundred mutant monkies and they have you holed up in your city.<br />

Trolls, thats right and that is why the trolls are the best, besides who really wants a nancy of a vah shir to be slowing your monsters, I'd rather die then have one of my cats ancestors slowing my monsters.
