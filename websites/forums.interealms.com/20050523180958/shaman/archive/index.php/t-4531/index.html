<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Themis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I had played a Shaman to 22 then switched and played a warrior to almost 50.  Warrior life was fun when raiding, but trying to find groups was miserable.  A friend had a 20ish beastlord, so I brought my shaman out and we started messing around..<br />
<br />
 Now I'm 46, my friend is 47 and we are both amazed at what we can do.   There is no down time (unless we run out of mobs to kill) and the exp is flying.  I imagine at 49 things will only improve.<br />
<br />
Anyone else partnered with a beast and found the same situation?  I'd be interested in hearing stories or opinions on the matter.<br />
<br />

**oops, typos galore =p **</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I heard the same thing from a ranger friend who's wife is a Beastlord.  He is *amazed* at some of the things they can take down.  Lot of fun, and the few times that I've tripled with them it's been great.<br />
<br />
ssshhh...don't tell anyone though, Beastlords are a useless class.  No good on raids, etc. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">beastlords suck for raids.  groupwise they are an excellent addition.  wierd =/</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Malaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">beastlords definitely need an upgrade considering raids. SP and savagery are nice, but one bst can do that on a raid...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Why do Beastlords need an upgrade on raids? Should every class be great on raids? Shouldn't there be tradeoffs somewhere?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">hmm maybe the answer to a bst's prayers!<br />

<br />
SP getting upped to 7hp/7mana per tick on test!<br />
<br />
<br />
And yes Litchbane.  They need the upgrade because they have no role and no business in a high end raid.  No doubt there should be tradeoffs, but hey making them utterly useless is more then an unacceptable bargain.  That class has a ton of potential, if only VI could wake up and fix them.  Hmm maybe give them the Spiritual Essence AA ability i popped out last week, since they don't have any class AA's at all yet!</div></div><hr />

dispell the warder buff from the player = dead bst</div></div><hr />

<br />
By your definition then shamans need upgrading too :D Malo and Turgur's are nice, but one shm can do that on a raid... :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">In Luclin, I am finding I really really wish that there were about 4 shaman on each high end encounter. Only thing we havent fought and beaten so far is stuff in VT and Seru himself. But there are definitely some encounters where multiple shaman make life much much easier, such as High Priest, Arch Lich, Cursed, Blood, Emperor. <br />
<br />
Besides that though, Yeah, something to help out beastlords for high end encounters wouldn't be a bad idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If you're in a High End Guild and raidling Luclin Ubers...   once you cross the line to killing Arch Lich, High Priest, Emporer and VT, you need about 3 active Shamans in your guild.   Two can get by, four would be lovely... but three is where it becomes comfy.<br />
<br />
Back when Arch Lich was slowable.. we posted 3 shamans around him who were doing a Malo/Slow Rotation that even shocked the Clerics in it's accuracy.<br />
<br />
Warg</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">BSTs are cool in groups because they add damage. Exp is all about DPS. Faster things die the faster you get exp.<br />
<br />
With a BST you get a mini-Shaman that can add DPS. Steal a KEI from someone (/ooc 100pp for KEI at Nexus Bank) and your BST will never run out of mana slowing for the next 3 hours or so.<br />
<br />
Exp groups = damage is king<br />
Raiding = The &quot;best&quot; is king<br />
<br />
Warriors tank the best... need warriors<br />
Clerics heal the best... need clerics<br />
Enchanters mez the best... need enchanters<br />
Shaman slow the best... need shaman<br />
Rogues/Wizards kill the best... need rogues/wizards<br />
<br />
BSTs are the best at getting their pets dispelled... don't need BSTs</div></div><hr />

I take it you mean 3 shamans at each such raid?  Active shamans in guild seems a bit low, considering people go on vacation, computers break, and some people tend to have outside lives that keep them from living at their keyboards.  <br />
<br />
My guild isn't there yet, but we have 8 active shamans.  Usually about 3 show up to a raid at a time.  Comfy is a good word.</div></div><hr />
