<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Guggles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am about to go to Velious and was wondering about faction.  I heard it was very important there.<br />
<br />
I am lvl 34 troll worshipping Innoruuk and want to someday get the best armor I can with the quests.  Who should I get good faction with?  Or is it not a problem at my level.  <br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />
By the way.  Where do I buy the velious spells at.  I need a poison dd and I was told it was in Velious at a vendor but don't know where.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>extra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Usually velious armor is a logical progression, you begin with thurgadin or plane of growth armor, and then move up to skyshrine or kael armor later...<br />
<br />
I wouldn't worry about it right now, because you'll get thurgadin faction hunting in kael eventually, looking for the peices....  Eventaully when you get skyshrine or kael armor, it will be the whole guild's decision..<br />
<br />
You can buy the level 34 poison DD in iceclad from the gnome pirates.  The 44 poison DD is a drop spell from wakening lands, cobalt scar, skyshrine, great divide, etc ;)  <br />
<br />
hope this helped</div></div><hr />
