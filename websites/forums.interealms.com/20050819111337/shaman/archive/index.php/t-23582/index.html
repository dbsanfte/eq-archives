<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">delete it and re-download it. Also make sure you have the newest OFFICIAL release of your video drivers.<br />
<br />
If that doesnt work come back for more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You do realize that last time I downloaded the patch (last night) it took around two hours? <br />
<br />
/cry</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I do remember a problem when I was installing Luclin, so you probabbly are right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yea, it doesnt matter if its freshly installed and downloaded, you could have got a corrupt download. Happens all the time bro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This is such an upgrade over my previous computer, i'm really dieing to try it out.<br />
<br />
My last computer was like...<br />
<br />
P3<br />
256 RAM<br />
32MB Video Card<br />
<br />
Looks like i'll just be late to raids tonight, heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ok well since your replying quick.<br />
<br />
<br />
Did you go download the latest offical drivers ?  Did you try deleting the exe and downloading a new one yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It may not solve anything, but have you run the thorough file scan?  It may be more trouble than it's worth, but I just thought it might find the problem file and replace it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Also, do other games crash ? Do you have a firewall going or anti virus software running? Did you update your directX to 9?  What OS are you running BTW. Im assuming winXP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yeah, I tried that Litgruv, no luck, though (wow, that was a lot of commas.)<br />
<br />
And yes, I did that as well Tobyus.<br />
<br />
I just uninstalled everything, so we'll see what happens after I get everything downloaded again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">This is the first game i've tried installing, and yes, I am running WinXP.  I have Norton IS and Antivirus, but I had them both off.<br />
<br />
Direct X is also upgraded to version 9.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">install the first CD and see if it runs. check if it runs before each expansion you install and see what you find.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well, good luck.  Hopefully you won't have any problems this time.  It would be bad if your install disks are damaged, especially Luclin or PoP since those can't be downloaded.  Any people you can borrow install disks from in case they are bad?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have multiple copies of each disk.  I loose them, buy them again, then find the ones I &quot;lost&quot;<br />
<br />
I've been playing since release, i've got 4+ copies of most expansions sitting around ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Haha, you've got me beat by a copy or 2.  Creating an account for my wife required an extra copy, and creating a spare account so I could 2 box my rogue required a 3rd copy.  I managed to lose my original EQ disk though :(  That would have been a collector's item!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I've still got my original Kunark disk, along with the guide and map of Norrath it came with :D<br />
<br />
Although both are a little beaten up, they bring back some good memories!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Take off norton anti-virus at least while your playing. It's a good program but it gives me problems when I'm tryin to play. Make sure you at least turn it off when you do the install(I didn't and I had some trouble).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I've still got my original Kunark disk<br />
<br />
Me too, I'm talking about the Original Everquest disks...  I think when I moved from the condo to the house it got misplaced :(  I still have all of the other expansions with their boxes, maps, and figurines intact ;)  <br />
<br />
I started playing in 99....whew, if I hadn't taken so many breaks, I'd have 3-6 level 65 characters :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I put this on another board when this happened to me:<br />
<br />
<br />
After the patch on the 14th, after the patcher but before the EULA displayed, I would get an eqgame.exe error and EQ would crash. To fix it, I had to use OptionsEditor.exe to change my resolution to 800x600. Once in the game, I could change the resolution normally, and everything works fine now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Ima freak, i have every box still with all material inside. I digitally downloaded the last 2 though so of course am missing those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">delete it and re-download it. Also make sure you have the newest OFFICIAL release of your video drivers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Heh, using the &quot;official&quot; video drivers that SOE recommends with my vid card (GF4Ti4400) causes players to appear as player-shaped black holes, some crazy spell effects and unbelievable video lag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Grobbles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">hi Foramorm,<br />
<br />
Solved yer problems yet ? <br />
<br />
This is a new build computer from scratch i take it ?<br />
If ya aint solved yer problems then may i suggest a number of things ..<br />
<br />
1) what motherboard/PSU are u using?<br />
2) Have u tried checking seeing if ...<br />
a. Ram is compatable with motherboard (sometimes mobo's are picky even if ram seems compatable *cough* Asus mobo's<br />
b. try running memtest86 on the ram for a few hours to see if any errors &gt; http://www.memtest86.com/<br />
c. If Ram ok , are they in the correct dimm slots<br />
3) CPU temps within limits ? look in BIOS at temps ,some software utils are a tad craptastic to say the least<br />
<br />
Anyway this is a start &gt; may not be a hardware issue , but these are simple things to check and worth looking at imho<br />
<br />
btw nice to see someone using PCI express , lucky bastage :P<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If no probs at all , post back and i have some other ideas<br />
<br />
Grobb</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">One thought, though I skimmed through the thread, but saw &quot;update video drivers&quot; mentioned often. Some Geforce cards with the 61.77 drivers are having difficulties with the live servers right now (Test is not, next patch is Tuesday). Try logging into Test once, see if you run alright, then try live. If you still crash on live, wait until Tuesday... if not, then you're fixed :p</div></div><hr />
