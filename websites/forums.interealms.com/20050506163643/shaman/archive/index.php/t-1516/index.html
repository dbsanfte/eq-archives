<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>OrangespiderO</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Which did you all chose to go with first?  Specialization or buff duration?<br />
<br />
I am thinking about reinforcement but just want to get some input from other shaman that already have them to see which seems more beneficial.<br />
<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Specialization.<br />
<br />
I don't particularly care how long my buffs last on others, though. So I guess it just comes down to how you're going to be playing it.<br />
<br />
If everyone wants Focus, Gaglain can cast MGB Focus. If people want a Focus that lasts two years, they can ask Groggog. Me, they don't ask me for anything, cos I don't have a PE hammer and my AA points have all gone into making Torpor cheaper to cast. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I went with Reinforcement, mostly for exp groups or twinking my rogue. On raids, people die too often to make Reinforcement much use. In fact, I had this to say about a warrior in my guild the other day and he screenshotted it:<br />

Err, didn't realize he lumped all that into 1 image. I only meant to get my quote on there. Just ignore Milene, Silasis and Robbrown, I do.</div></div><hr />
