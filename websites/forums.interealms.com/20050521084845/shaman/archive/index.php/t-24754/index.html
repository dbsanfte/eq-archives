<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A while back I did spell casting subtlety 1 and was pleased with the result. Since picking that up I've had very little trouble with gaining agro durring my guild's raids. Last night I participated in a pickup Bert raid and died no less than 7 times due to my inablility to stay away from the top of the agro list. My tactics were the same as I always use on guild raids successfully.<br />
<br />
An example... Monk pulls one of the kings into the room and FD's, Warror tags with bow and drags King to the corner, Warrior starts tanking and taking damage (11k warrior) I start a fast cast heal at 70pct and it lands with the warrior at 40pct, the heal hits for a grand total of 1648 (pissing in the ocean of an 11k warrior), King turns on me and smacks me dead in 5 hits.<br />
<br />
Towards the end of this raid I began to think that it couldn't be my fault, the tank had to be doing something wrong so I asked him to link his weapon. He was using: Vanazir, Dreamer's Despair (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=29172) with an Anger III aug.<br />
<br />
My understanding about Warrior agro generation is that it is a combination of DPS, Proximity, &quot;Touch&quot; (speed of hits), Direct Proc Hate (EB,Anger), Indirect Proc Hate (Stuns,Damage) and whatever discs they use. Taunt is merely their backup way of returning to the top of the hate list should they fall behind. Now I know that my guild's tank uses Copper Hammer of Striking (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=62186) with an Anger III aug and Mace of Memories (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70226) with an Anger II aug. He has told me before that his agro generation is mostly because of proc rate (he's done all the aa's to max his proc rate I guess). If that is correct then why the heck was this tank on the pickup raid using Vanazir to tank? I understand it is a time weapon, and very nice. But it looks to me like a DPS weapon for smackin mobs in the rear with. Am I totally wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">DPS is *the* most important factor for aggro generation of a tank. Whoever tells you otherwise, doesn't know better. The Anger procs are huge aggro, but they are and will still remain random.<br />
<br />
That said, Vanazir isn't a huge DPS weapon and it's really easy to outaggro a tank using it.<br />
<br />
If I read your post correctly, you were catching aggro from a single fast heal. Something must have been wrong, definitely. It's hard to say what it was without knowing the details.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm not a pro, but I've usually noticed the MA and SA dual-wielding proccing weapons, and the DPS-types wielding two-handers. <br />
<br />
And I don't think I've ever jumped to the top of the agro list for my little heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you don't own high DPS weapons, then you usually go the dual wielding route trying to maximize your hate generation via procs(2 weapons &gt; 1 weapon proc wise). <br />
<br />
The highend tanks can afford to do both as they dual wield the highest DPS combo and benefit from a higher proc rate(offhand proc rate is lower than main hand, but it will still result in more procs than just using 1 weapon obviously)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haxot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The only peeps I've ever seen wield a 2hander and hold agro are rangers and pallies. Using stuns and that fire beetle thingy.<br />
SKs I've seen hold agro through their direct hate stuff long as they don't run out of mana.<br />
<br />
The warriors I know and trust always dual wield for agro, no exceptions.<br />
<br />
And, um, wow. 1 little blast heal netting you that much agro?<br />
What the hell are the clerics doing, waiting till 10% to CH? /boggle<br />
Something is defintly wrong, and it is not you &gt;.&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">/agree - I started composing that before your post was added, Giac. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">any warrior using a 2 hander at that lvl of the game would seriously make me wonder how long ago the account was purchased.<br />
<br />
you can pull agro off a 2 hander weilding warrior with a jucy fart. the only time I ever have problems taking agro is from a duel weilding warrior with both innate and augmented hate proccs on BOTH weapons. vrs that combo it gets noticably harder to gain agro and much easier for them to get it back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">OK, I'm feeling a little better now. So I shouldn't sweat my gameplay at this point, though maybe be a bit more cautious if I run into this particular warrior again. Thanks all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Malek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The war either forgot to turn on attack, had the wrong target, or was too far to hit while getting the mob into position but of course, taking dmg in the process.  I've played a war for 5 years and only times I've lost aggro to a heal early on is for one of those reasons.  Believe me, a couple wacks with that wep even without a proc is more than enough aggro to cover your heal.  And no, 2handers with an innate aggro proc like the one he was using (ac debuff) plus an anger aug are not bad aggro, they're only slightly behind duel wielding 4 procs, it's the war's using 2handers without innate procs for &quot;uber&quot; dps that give 2handers a bad name :p  The major difference between 2handers with 2 procs and dw with 4 procs is 2handers give a bigger aggro boost early on while dw build up more over time.<br />
<br />
So I don't think you were doing anything wrong, sometimes **** just happens.</div></div><hr />

(cropping, it'll be up in a min)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If I'm doing the healing, sometimes I would rather the Warrior use a 2h weapon though.  I can manage my agro decently, and he takes much less riposte damage (unless he has the AA's).  One fight I logged the warrior using 2-1h weapons and filtered out later all but him.  He took SOOO much damage from riposte.  He might have been a suck warrior, but when he switched to a 2h weapon, we let him build agro longer, but it was much easier to keep him healed in the long run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Valkargen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">DPS actually has NOTHING to do with generated aggro...nada!<br />
<br />
Aggro is based on the potential of the weapon, if damage bonus is applicable, and rate of attacks over a time interval with proc intervention added in.<br />
<br />
Raw attack affects DPS, but it has no bearing on aggro.<br />
Weapon skill affects attack and DPS and has no bearing on aggro.<br />
Mob immunity affects DPS and has no bearing on aggro.<br />
<br />
You can have a skill of 1 in a weapon, attack a target that is immune to the weapons attacks, and have no attack buffs at all...and you will still generate the same aggro as if your attack were 500 points higher, the weapon could land for damage and were fully buffed...<br />
<br />
DPS delivered from a weapon sans proc intervention does not have a direct correlation to aggro generated...it can be indicative however of the weapons potential.<br />
<br />
Using SK terror lines for a raw emperical method of calculating hate a modifier of ~1.2 was determined.<br />
<br />
Using a 20/20 1hander with a 14 damage bonus:<br />
<br />
Mainhand = (20 + 14) x 1.2 = 40.8 hate generated per swing<br />
Offhand = (20) x 1.2 = 24 hate per swing<br />
<br />
Calculating AA and weapon skill triggers is relatively easy to actually calculate paced aggro from weapon sources as a hate generated per second.<br />
<br />
Its then also easy to see what aa selections, ie aa that increase proc rate, dual attack triggers, dual weild triggers, tripple attack or dmg bonus can increase and impact aggro generation.  It can give the player a means to determine their best path to aggro generated by aa spent.<br />
<br />
Its also important to note that the increase in proc rate from increased attack is minimal.  Mobs heavily mitigate more than they have exceptionally high AC...hence hits are often reduced to 0 and show as misses.  Proc determination however occurs prior to mitigation and its why procs can land on misses.  Increased attack has a tendency to raise AVG hit far more than actually increase hits landed...so in terms of proc intervention its affects are minimized.<br />
<br />
The parses to determine these factors involved a lot of people, and weren't soley done by just me, but have been done by many and prompted by similar observations, on many servers, in many settings since Kunark and rudimentary parsers were available.<br />
<br />
Why is aggro constant post and prior to defensive?<br />
How come aggro generation doesn't spike while offensive?<br />
Why aggro is the same while raising a weapon skill?<br />
How can a tank maintain aggro against EMP while having no bane weaponry and no streaks of early proc intervention?<br />
Why after having a shammy and ranger leave a group and losing 300+ attack has my aggro not changed...<br />
<br />
The list goes on but I'm sure most can see how alot of situations in game could leave you with the....hmmmmmmm...feeling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Holy ****. Who the hell taught you all that...nonsense<br />
<br />
How many Warriors use defensive over Stonewall when Stonewall is up?<br />
<br />
A Warrior using Stonewall has a lot better hate generation than a Warrior using defensive and that's because of the higher DPS as the proc rate remains the same.<br />
<br />
Since when does higher Attack increase the proc rate?<br />
<br />
AC values of mobs reduce damage to 0 and show as misses? please? If you connect you will always hit for Damage Bonus + 1*Damage Interval Minimum, unless the mob is resistant to your weapon type. Procs occur on swings, not on hits.<br />
<br />
Again ATK doesn't affect proc rate, nor does it affect hit rate. All it does is pushing your modal hit closer to the max hit the highre it is.<br />
<br />
When using non-bane weapons against a mob that is immune to your weapon, your damage still generates phantom hate(that one you got right), but the damage is reduced to 0 because the mob is immune to the weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Smint</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">He is correct in that aggro isn't related to dps at all, sure he has some weird ideas in there, but his basics are correct. <br />
<br />
Stonewall isnt anymore aggro than defensive. Infact i know alot of wars who prefer defensive just cos snare sucks, sure in a single grp where war dps matters stonewall might be prefered, but has nothing to do with aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Using the same logic, a unhasted or even slowed Warrior generates the same hate as a hasted one, right? Right?!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep.  Tank in my guild uses that exact same combo.  Bane+Blood of Saryrn+Bane of nife + Ancient:Scrounge can do it pretty easily.  Whenever we play in VT, I see how many dots it takes for me to get a trip to bind....<br />
<br />
As to the original posters problem, I dont think the Warrior knew what he was doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Smint</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Where does he mention haste, sure haste matters as aggro is determined 'per swing'. But dps doesnt matter</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ok, let's assume hate generation was based on potential DPS. <br />
How would your argument &quot;A Warrior using Defensive generates the same hate as a Warrior using Stonewall&quot; hold any water considering that the potential DPS of a Defensive(http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4499&amp;source=Live) Warrior is way lower than that of a Stonewall'ed one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Smint</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hate is generated per swing, it's not the same as max hit, it some bizarre formula, but regardless of discs/atk/weither u even connect.

It's not.<br />
It does.<br />
It's not.<br />
Aggro, as you mentioned, is not solely based on damage, so a non-bane weapon tank can hold aggro.<br />
It will change if you lower attack.<br />
<br />
And not every situation warrants a DW'ing tank. I know there are fights where warriors will use a 2hander for aggro.<br />
<br />
If you really think that DPS is not a huge aggro generation, your blind. Why were rangers so bad for aggro that they came up with jolt? Try equipping a warrior with 2 langseax's with anger procs and watch him fight for aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you actually have factual evidence to support your claims? If what you say is theoritcally true, how was aggro maintained before there was augments. How has a 2hand using monk ever stolen aggro? or maintained aggro for that matter. Please, if my argument is so wrong, correct my misjudgements.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Smint</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=3789<br />

<br />
More DPS setup is typically more aggro, though not always, but dont mistake the 2 as being equal.<br />
<br />
Switching to 2h is typically more aggro during furious as it's more aggro per swing. Hope you aren't saying this is an offensive disc though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The only prove I am asking for is the one showing that a defensive Warrior's hate generation is the same as a non defensive Warrior's. Whether or not the hate generation is based on potential DPS or not(and yes, I am starting to believe that's correct), it changes very little as you are always going to seek the highest DPS combo for the best hate generation.<br />
<br />
Therefore the highr your DPS(potential or not) = the higher your hate generation.<br />
The only way this would factor in at the high end game would be if a Warrior chose to max out ATK instead of getting a better ratio weapon. Not like there will ever be a choice to be made about that, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Maivia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">No, furious is defensive.<br />
<br />
And yes, I will admit it is damage potential and not DPS that adds the most aggro. Neither of those links metioned anything about attack not meaning anything for aggro though. The created formulas aren't in fact complete, and something is missing from the formulas to keep them from being accepted fact. They were all done over the short term as well, with damage done not really being able to be taken into account.<br />
<br />
How does this say that the decrease of damage because of defensive doesn't factor into aggro? It decreases damage modifier by 45%, which on the damage formula <br />
<br />
( damage_bonus + ( damage_interval * random_integer_between_1_20 ) )<br />
<br />
is damage_interval. Damage_interval comes from the base damage of the weapon, so why wouldn't the decrease in damage because of defensive factor into aggro. There is certainly no proof of that in those threads. Conversely wouldn't our Sense buff increase aggro? It increases max damage, thereby increasing potential damage. Look at the warrior Agressive Discipline (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4498&amp;source=Live), that also increases damage modifier, and then potential damage. Shouldn't that then be increased aggro?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Sheyrena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Since we are on the subject of Aggro<br />
<br />
I have Spell Casting Subtlety II <br />
<br />
From what I have seen the AA seems to only take effect when the spell is successful. However a resisted spell gains me far more aggro, so I wonder if the AA is applied. <br />
<br />
Am I imagining it, or am I misunderstanding what is happening?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Valkargen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">The early parsework for aggro generation was done during Kunark and hundreds of hours of parswork was compiled then and since and frequently shared on IRC back in the early days...so I have no idea what interval your talking about being too small.  Not everyone posts on the class boards.  In fact prior to class boards most were in 1 IRC channel or another as a matter of course for wipe purposes and almost regardless of guild affiliation, which is the reason for the collaboration.<br />
<br />
Maiva Furious is a riposte disc not a defensive type disc...it can be argued that its both offensive and defensive in nature.<br />
<br />
Aggro from raw melee sources is determined PRIOR to the damage modifier of defensive or aggressive.  The damage bonus is calculated the moment you equip the weapon and is part of the mainhands potential and offhand with spent AA...<br />
<br />
The formulas are in fact consistent, maybe whatever parses your referring to havent been, but the hate modifier was determined within a few months of SK's receiving their terror line.  Used in melee proximity, with back turned to avoid ripostes it is ~1.2  The parsework was extensive and at that time it wasn't unusual for me to have 50 parses in my email box at any given time.<br />
<br />
For proof Giac, since you don't require numerical raw hate numbers, grab a warrior with a weapon that doesn't proc.  Pull a mob and cripple it 7 times and slow it 7 times...count the swings necessary to pull the mob off you...repeat with defensive.  For an even cleaner parse have the warrior equip a mug in the offhand so you don't have to diffentiate between offhand or mainhand.  Thats actually how the original parses were done in regards to figuring out that damage bonus was part of aggro generation and what part of the ratio it formed.  The longer your sampling the more you will get a feel for it, and you can then switch the mug into the mainhand and see firsthand the relative reduction of aggro in relation to offhand.<br />
<br />
In regards to DPS there are Foci, AA, and buffs that affect DPS that have no bearing on aggro generation.  Vengeance and its ilk, Combat Fury, Cleave, SoP, SoT, etc.  To list DPS as generating aggro isn't accurate, as raw attack and weapon crits have no bearing on aggro whatsoever yet they can markedly increase DPS delivered.<br />
<br />
Maive in regards to how warriors held aggro prior to augs and the incite lines...they didn't as you recall, without exceptional proccing weapons, hence the revamp.<br />
<br />
To put things in perspective, at level 70 with a warrior weilding a BoC and GBoS, both aug'd with Anger 3, and 305 dex, with WA5, Ferocity and Ambi with 100% haste and Bazu's as their incite variant a warrior will generate more hate from procs and the incite line than the raw hate from pure melee sources...near 55% actually.  With the weapon combo Samanna list above proc's and incite would be ~40% of aggro generated.<br />
<br />
The proportional relation to offhand/mainhand hate was determined in Kunark...which was actually pretty easy, as most warrior weapon selections didn't proc.  My parsing work began during our first VS runs when after using Mightystrike and Aggresive early on the warriors aggro didn't burst despite marked parsed gains in DPS...hence wizards splatting after the same ammount of lures cast during the same period of time.  After many hours of testing over the course of months and including defensive in our parsing on numerous runs we determined that Combat crits and raw melee modifiers, nor raw damage for that matter had a direct relation to aggro.  At times they decepticely seemed linked, hence the misnomer, but there wasn't a direct correlation.<br />
<br />
The addition of weapon damage + damage bonus was confirmed when SK's recieved the terror series and for the first time raw hate generation could be calculated to finally arrive at a hate modifier...which at the time was accepted by the group that I was parsing with to be between 1.2 and 1.26...we typically round down to 1.2 to be on the safe side.<br />
<br />
Potential of generated weapon hate became (Weapon Damage + Damage bonus) * Hate Modifier = Hate per swing<br />
<br />
Early on we rounded Warrior skill triggers as .82 for dual attack and dual weild...yeilding 1.82 attacks per combat interval for mainhand and 1.49 offhand attacks per offhand interval.<br />
<br />
Haste has a direct proportional impact on aggro generated from raw melee sources...the more you swing the more aggro you create with those very same weapons, but sinces its equally proportional its not necessary to include it in hate per swing calculations.<br />
<br />
Using those formulas we could approximate hate generated per second sans proc intervention, which had the purpose of allowing a warrior to determine base aggro levels with different weapon combinations.<br />
<br />
The reason why we started looking into aggro generation was initially to determine how we could increase warrior burst aggro during quick fights like VS.  It was during that early parsing work we discovered the inconsistencies.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Maadaasaakaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">just on the query reference why do tanks use 2handers for tanking sometimes - mainly because of the huge amount of damage dished out from PoP bosses via ripostes, using a 2hander hugely reduces this the potential riposte dmg compared to a fast DW setup.<br />
<br />
This has somewhat been mitigated latently by new aa that allow you to strikethrough dodge, block, parry and ripostes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Crinic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Although I am a brand new shaman - wanna see how class works - I have played Paladin to 65th level and cleric to 65th season too . . .<br />
<br />
As to the aggro . . . being unaware of heals so far (other than the crap low level one) I wonder if you can do two things to avoid aggro:<br />
<br />
1, Cast a HoT (heal over time) type BEFORE tank pulls mob and then use a slightly less punch-heal? (not sure if shammys have). <br />
<br />
2, keep yourself at max distance for spell contact on Tank. A risk but sometimes works is to SIT DOWN IMMEDIATELY after the heal cast. (Can someone give stats on this working?).<br />
<br />
As a cleric the above worked fine - as a Paladin the HoT saved my arse more than once. However - as a Paladin, I usually wanted aggro . . . A major heal when mob leaves you for someone else (just cast the damn thing on anyone) Pulls the mob back real real fast . . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">The less punchy heal your cleric used probably healed more than our best heal.  If we had to drop to our second-best direct heal it would be laughable.<br />

I have believed for a long time (since killing Emp back when bane weapons were broken) that it was potential DPS, as calculated from the weapon, that generated aggro.  Based on that argument attack SHOULD not add to aggro since it just increases the ACTUAL DPS without increasing the theoretical maximum.  <br />
<br />
However, you need to be careful when assuming that anything that increases potential DPS increases aggro: the aggro formula is almost certainly not calculated off of potential DPS directly, it's calculated off of other factors that combine to give the potential DPS.  Things like the DMG/DLY of the weapon, and recent procs.  I seriously doubt the programmers calculate max potential DPS, taking all spells/AA's/etc into account, when the lower-level raw numbers are just sitting there ready to be used.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Rgallnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Aggro is based on the potential of the weapon, if damage bonus is applicable, and rate of attacks over a time interval with proc intervention added in.<br />
<br />
This is exactly correct.  Some 2handers will create more aggro then 1handers depending on what they are.  BoW comes to mind for example.  2handers are not the devil when it comes to holding aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Kilgaroz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">So, my guild's MT wasn't talking out his arse when he said a BoW was his best chance of both holding agro and surviving as we fight out way through the elementals and into Time?  He commented once that he intends to use his DW setup for inital agro generation, then switch to his BoW for the long haul.  Is this a fairly standard tactic while tanking ele gods?</div></div><hr />

I joined their boards, re-asked my question and got some interesting answers from the warriors themselves. I suggest that anyone who thinks they understand warrior agro spend a few minutes reading through the following posts:<br />

&quot;Taunt and Agro Testing&quot; (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=1811) <br />
<br />
From what I've read now, I believe that the warriors generally agree with the basics of melee agro generation. I do not believe they have done a very good job of explaining it to the other classes, hence some of their frustration with our lack of understanding. I think it is important that we all have a clear understanding of how agro works, our lives often depend on it. <br />
<br />
<br />
Kilgaroz, based on what I've read in the last few days I believe that your tank's plan is actually backwards from what he should be doing. Because of the BoW's high damage &quot;potential&quot; it should grab agro more reliably in the first few seconds of any fight. A 2 hand setup will rely mostly on proc agro and while this is capable of generating more agro over the long-haul it is not guaranteed and consistant durring the first few seconds of a battle. After he has established agro if for some reason he was concerned about his BoW's in-ability to maintain agro late in the fight (add in crit-crazy wizzies and such)then the added proc rate (over-time) from the dual wield would enable him to build a more solid agro lead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Crinic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">(( Again I post from my experiences as a Paladin and cleric - having been a shaman only a very short time ))<br />
<br />
One of the simplest ways to hold aggro from a weapons perspective is to purchase a weapon that has a process and then add another process aug to it. Case in point - I have a Ghoulbane . . . a decent weapon for young to midlevel paladins (against undead!). I added my Nife spell to it - causes damage to undead . . . (this is not an aug but a spell granted to Paladins) - WHAM!!! Good luck for any warrior even with a great weapon to take aggro from me in an LDoN undead crawl.<br />
<br />
Adding a process aug to a processing weapon does same thing - make sure the aug does minimally 75pt damage per process . . . anything weaker might not piss off the mob. On another weapon Lance of Gryme - the weapon had no self process - BUT it had great damage/delay ratio - I added a 125 poison process aug to it and invariably I would either grab aggro from a warrior who either didn't have decent damage/delay weapon OR did not know the warriors skills and how to use them. <br />
<br />
I could hold aggro against a Windblade easily. So much for the theory of HIGH-damage high delay doesn't matter in aggro holding . . . my lance did less damage but the delay added hit after hit before the Windblade would strike. I guess in that sense - my &quot;damage&quot; was much higher. HOWEVER; having a warrior in the group who KNEW how to behave and knew their abilities well . . . They could hold aggro easily and even take it from me if needed . . . (communication is important in dropping aggro and having someone else pick it up!)<br />
<br />
My cleric . . . No matter what anyone says - a CHeal will grab aggro almost without fail !! HENCE; when going up against mobs that could take  down a healer in two blows ( Planes, Main-mobs, or a crawl where you are running HIGH RISK  - damage dealing can run into the 1.4k range ) Using Cheals are VERY risky . . . NEVER use one at the start of a battle ( learned that the hard way) !! <br />
<br />
Heal over time spells - Clerics have ahhhh two powerful ones one I know of heals 500pt/6sec/24time - This has always carried the tank through the first 20% damage dealing on the mob . . . supplimented with very fast lesser heals - there are 3 upperlevel ones ( forget now if that is correct ). <br />
<br />
THEN when mob is down to its 80% health or less . . . start tossing the Cheals or better FULL- heal spells. The 90% health in upper level places IS TOO HIGH!! Those mobs are &quot;smart&quot; and will attempt to take out the healer - Yes I have heard that the programming on upper level mobs is geared to SMARTS in the mob - so be careful. So far in my experience my cleric died between levels 1 and 45 and after that I got a looooong talking to from a three year cleric and LEARNED! Never turn down criticism! After level 45 I died few and far between and my group ( haha - being responsible for my &quot;babies&quot; it was MY group - chuckle ) made it out with none or few deaths.<br />
<br />
Stuns, blind (nice one if you can keep mob from running), heals, processes and D-augs are all serious aggro attractors!<br />
<br />
I hope this helps - even if you DO NOT want aggro - this might help you avoid it. Oh yeah . . . if you are not Main Tank . . . ALWAYS ask if you can use aggro-causing spells and augs. If the tank is aware that you will - they can prepare for it!!! COMMUNICATION more than anything else I have found - KEEPS THE PARTY ALIVE! (chuckle)</div></div><hr />

While most 2-hander DPS melee setups are better DPS for someone like a monk or ranger, the other main reason is to reduce reposte damage.  Repostes will kill an unobservant monk with two fast 1 handers quicker than you can say 'holy sheet'.</div></div><hr />

Warrior here...(MA for my guild - pre-EP)<br />
<br />
If I had a good 2 hander like a BoW I'd lead with Furious and the BoW - the extra swings from the 12 seconds of riposting helps alot for agro.  When Furious was about to run out I'd switch to dual wielding to further build up agro - then back to a 2 hander once Defensive/Evasive wears off (if I was worried about riposte spikes.)<br />
<br />
By the way, I'm pretty sure that direct damage spell crits do not generate additional agro.  (unlike dot crits which apparently do)  But...I'm a warrior, not a caster, so I could be wrong on that one  :p</div></div><hr />

Direct damage spells do indeed cause aggro. And a critical - due to its inheriant extra damage  should by all standards of mathmatic programming cause additional aggro. A wizard casting a D-damage spell for 100hp damage against a tank holding aggro will in almost 100% of the time NOT cause aggro to shift to them. A wizard casting a 2500pt damage spell MOST certainly will, hence; I believe the belief stated may be incorrect. I doubt that SoE refined aggro stats so fine that there is a difference of a 1000pt DD doubling to 2k will not increase aggro . . .<br />
<br />
DD spells do cause aggro and it depends on their damage. A paladin casting a stun (weak no damage one) against a wizard's already attracted aggro will not pull the mob off the wizard . . . casting a high damage stun . . . (as far as stun damages are concerned) stands a much better chance to pull aggro . . . this is from experience. Thank God that SoE developed a damaging stun that casts very quickly - although (boo) it takes 13 seconds to reset.<br />

Does anyone have any info on this one?  Specifically - does a crit on a DD spell generate more agro then a non-crit?  <br />
<br />
While I'm at it - does the amount of DD spell damage affect the agro?<br />
<br />
I was always under the impression that, for DD spells (not Dots), the spell damage didn't matter - it was the potential damage...but...I'm a warrior, not a caster  ;) .<br />
<br />
Note:  In case my earlier post wasn't clear....I know DD spells generate agro...but I thought getting a crit didn't affect the amount of agro for DD spells.  (although I heard crits do affect agro for Dots)<br />

Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Mmmm,, direct damage agro on crits is a fact. Grab a wizzy and go check it out.<br />
It is not, however, gonzo insane as dot crits are, point for point of damage.<br />
Wizys(and mages, and other nukers) who are reasonable about their nukes can easily dish out damage without disturbing the Tank's hold on agro too much.<br />
Even with crits.<br />

Not from my understanding.... (calls up his guild's 10k pally, his best friend who's not joined the guild, and the other pally in his guild, to verify.)<br />
<br />
Mmm,, they all say that if you have been chain casting your low level stuns You should rarely lose agro, let alone be able to get it back.<br />
*coughs*<br />
They also say you don't use your &quot;stun that works&quot; for mere agro, you use it when the &quot;damned shaman&quot; isn't healing fast enough and you need a second to cast a heal spell.<br />
<br />
Stun damage has nothing to do with the agro holding abilities of a paladin.<br />
Wich is why they are quite the prefered for agro holding against a warrior who never looked at his forums for &quot;how to hold agro&quot;.<br />
<br />

P.S. I actualy did zing the pallies a tell/phone call. I don't think all 3 of them can be wrong, and I am sure the stun that works has a decent amount of agro on it. It could be I misunderstand your post, or you simply have a different play style from any of the pallies I group with. Mea apropos</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I believe that current opinion about agro is that it is based on the number of swings and the damage potential of the weapon only, with procs giving a bonus. Whether you land the hits or use a disc doesn't affect the hate generated. A Zanavir should generate pretty decent hate relative to the sorts of folks doing the average pre-elemental pickup raid.<br />
<br />
Using a 2 hander rather than a 1 hander shouldnt be an issue under normal circumstances. I used a BoW for a long time with my warrior and never lost initial agro on a named to a heal unless the heal landed before I actually started hitting the mob. One thing to bear in mind with 2 handers though is that the weapon delay is longer, so if you land a heal too soon under those circumstances you might have problems. Nowdays with the incite line in place, there is no excuse for a warrior not having a decent agro lock on the go under most circumstances. It's possible that he wasnt using incite/bellow/bazu and that might be part of the problem you experienced.<br />
<br />
It's been a very long time since I've done Bert, but its possible that some of the kings mem blurr, slow or stun (I'm pretty sure some do at least some of those things). Any one of those things will cause the MA to lose agro pretty easily.</div></div><hr />
