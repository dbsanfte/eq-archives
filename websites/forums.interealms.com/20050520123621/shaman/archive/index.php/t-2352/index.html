<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I haven't had a chance to check yet since I've spent the last couple nights working on quests, trade skills and doing a bit of buying &amp; selling in FP (sold my fungi, dragon cloak, dragon bracer and got a lodi shield, jungle spider carapace, cheap horse for hunting outdoors and some gear for my necro)...<br />
<br />
Anyone have a  report on Chardok since the npc caster adjustments?  Levi tunnel has been my solo &amp; 2 box (w/ necro) spot of choice lately, however that area usually has a couple necros and a wizard or two per spawn cycle.   I'm a little concerned that a few high-40's necros &amp; wizards might be a bit much to handle given the new changes (at least while mainting decent aaxp / hour).  I'll be visiting tonight to check, but was curious if anyone has a first-hand report to share.<br />
<br />
Also, I'm interested in the Royals area since my guild is planning on smooshing them sometime this weekend...  I'd imagine that we'll be adjusting our tactics quite a bit on that trip.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yep, going on a Chardok ROyals raid on Saturday.  Hehe, should be fun ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Chardok is going to be deserted now.<br />
<br />
With the abundance of Wizards, Necromancers, and shaman mobs deeper in no normal xp minded group is going to go there.<br />
<br />
Sure the entrance and Exit will still be semi camped. but no more deeper things.<br />
<br />
The mobs there were tough to begin with. Lots of Harm touches, Lots of gaters, Lots of funky pathing and such. Now getting Ice comet slapped across my backside by a critter that is not level 49, Never did an ounce of research in his NPC life, and certainly never looked for the staff of the wheel is utter crap.<br />
<br />
Internally consistant my ass. The mobs are not of level to cast the spell. they have meele like Bruce Lee with bare hands (130 a hit) They can cast through walls with no penalty, have a hell of a time being stopped from casting in the first place, Have no limit to how many PC's are hit by thier spells. <br />
<br />
The only thing consistant is that we are toyed with, bent over, and slapped on the ass again by a service provider that feels that they can do no wrong.<br />
<br />
Verant truly has no idea how lucky they are people are so caught up in thier friendships in this game. Because if people didn't have that time spent already they would have dropped the poorly thought out, poorly implimented pile of crap that Everquest is rapidly becoming.<br />
<br />
(yeah yeah I know I am doomsaying, I know it isnt that bad, but damnit where is the fun? I am having fun in SPITE of all the changes verant makes, but the fun level is decreasing daily.)<br />
<br />
The changes should be fun. Not all together easy. But make sense and be Fun.  <br />
<br />
Casters should have the ability to cast spells TO thier level. Not above. They should be limited to a set 8 spell limit, Not every spell that can possibly be cast. They should have Much less hitpoints than thier warrior compatriarts. They should do much less meele damage. They should not kick fun in the teeth and Dispell every 10 seconds. Sure it would be a smart thing to do, but the effect is that players have to rebuff all the time to have a measure of safety. (Rebuff = Time sink_129456)<br />
<br />
If you want caster mobs to be smarter. Then hey why screw around. Do it the smart way. Give casters dire charm and Mana burn. All cast on cleric/enchanters/shaman first. Boom game over. Plunty of time sink there, CR and res time increases and more people are waiting for things to happen. Fun right?     <br />
<br />
Right up to the point when the game is less fun than beating your head against the wall in frustration. Then the people start to leave and the GM's are left thinking Boy these mobs are smart. To an empty server.<br />
<br />
Remember sometimes being the victim is fun. ( belive Abashi said that one)<br />
<br />
God what a load of crap.<br />

<br />
I was in Chardok this morning, was going to head down the lev tunnel and check this stuff out, but I didn't get the chance.  Am looking forward to seeing how tough the caster mobs are now in there.  I'm sure they'll be soloable, but are likely to be too much of a pain to be worth it.  I did notice today I got lots more resists on the exit zone mobs on Pox and Bane and even the Spear, so I wonder if they upped their resists a bit.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty upset in general about this caster change.  Anytime the mobs can instantly just blow you away is just wrong.  On my way to kill Trak with my guild I stopped to solo a Bok Wizard.  The bastage hit me with three dispells, dropping my SoW, Aego, and KEI, then hit me with a few nukes as well, taking me to 60% health.  Thank god I resisted the 1890 DD Elnerick's Electrical Rending he cast or I would have been looking for a res.  And my MR at the time was around 90.  This from a fooking Bok???  Last time I heard, they were not level 60 mobs!  Get real VI.<br />
<br />
I have to say that most of my exping comes from soloing, just far easier that way, and I have for the very first time in over 3 years given strong thought to retiring from EQ.  I know they want to reinforce the role of Clerics in exp groups, but this is not the way.  Forcing soloers into traditional full groups to get exp is a poor way to run a game.  It's bad enough that they have found every loophole they could think of to decrease the real benefits of focus items and skills for Shamans, but this takes the cake.<br />
<br />
The saddest part about all this is that they actually think they did a good thing.  Alan said &quot;I think it’s one of the best changes we’ve seen in a while...&quot;.  Your PAYING CUSTROMERS disagree Alan!  Maybe some of you like your lives made more difficult, but I don't get into EQ each night with the idea that my buffs will be stripped off and I'll be killed several times a night.  I don't have pets that follow behind me and recast KEI and Aego on me every time it gets dispelled.  An occasional dispell is expected...what the NPCs are doing now is not right.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Riokhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yep, I love VI's way of balancing the game. Smarter NPC casters with nukes and attacks they shouldn't have. And placing focus stuff on items they don't belong on.<br />
<br />
It seems like they just did a random roll on what items get what focus level. <br />
<br />
What the heck am I suppose to do with the cougar claw earrings I just got last night off a cougar? Its a level 32 mob. The earrings are a lvl 32 drop. But the mana preserve I on it is only good up to lvl 20 spells.<br />
<br />
Can you say, stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Golrag Spiritfist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just talked to my buddy who is playing his 60 cleric in Chardok -  not pretty.  He says now there are 20 peeps in zone camping entrance and zone out but nowhere else.  I guess there were more when he got there but the groups that had set up at the bridge were all in the middle of a long cr.  Needless to say, they left and everyone is avoiding the area like the plague.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hi Etain :)<br />
<br />
Just got home from work, so I'm going to head over &amp; take a peak for myself.  I'm expecting to find the place pretty useless for soloing &amp; 2 boxing which will have me a little bummed since that's how I get 50 or 60% of my exp :(  I figure the mobs will still end up dead, but if it takes me 2x as long to kill 'em as it did before, then the exp earned just won't be worth the trouble.  I'll update with more details once I have a chance to check things out...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">They want to make mob casting smarter, fine with  me.<br />
<br />
But make sure they no longer hit for 150+ with rusty dagger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yah velks will become even more packed now.  <br />
That's good cause it was getting below 50 people on off peak times.  All fighting and scrapping for the same ****ing spider.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Did the chardok bridge area with myself, 60 monk, 60 warrior, 60 paladin, 60 cleric. Only 1 death, myself, when monk went linkdead for an extended time and the repops started to catch up to us.<br />
<br />
Being ice cometed was a bit annoying, but it really wasn't too bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Again, like I said in another thread, if you're 60 this probably won't hurt as much. Resists have always been affected more by your level then by your actual resist number, HoT is a prime example of that. <br />
<br />
How is it for those not 60, without raid quality gear, who don't have a Cleric or someone who can stun with them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Chardok is going to be deserted now.  <br />
<br />
wrong ,yesterday in chardok : 40 people.<br />
We have camp korocust room , i don't think it's harder than before .May be some higher nuke ,but i have hope it will be more dangerous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well if changes are bad, things go more and more towards the direction which has always been: preferred exp mobs are melee :P Hello Velks and other places. People don't want too risky and challenging things most of the time when they log in for their sessions (aiming to improve their characters). They ain't looking to spend time to run down to fun dungeon (with possibly outdated loots) to be nuked dead, to run back and CR, to spend rest of the time looking for ress... Exp penalty on death is not just about lost exp (which is at higher levels so huge penalty anyway that you will find anyway to get a ress), it's huge loss of time (a lot more penalized exp cause you're wasting your time to recover).<br />
<br />
Or just do things with perfect groups, with ench/bards/clerics/warriors and all. Wait till you get it all woot woot before you do things. Oh well.<br />
<br />
People will adjust, more zones will be left empty as people move to smack down melee mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think paladins just go moved into the perfect group category with their arsenel of stuns. Right now for a caster heavy zone, I would want chanter/bard/cleric/wizard/warrior/paladin.<br />
<br />
That gets you two crowd control, three stunners, two tanks, two and a half healers, two rezzers, ports and nukage. <br />
<br />
Notice there are NO shaman in that group. The chanter will just have to handle slows as well as CC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I've done BK and GY after the changes, and it's really not that bad. Resists are your friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yeah Chardok sucks go back to Seb or Velks ;)  In all honesty the mobs there do cast a wider variety of spells, but with high enough resists it might as well be the same old Gflux and Force Shock.  I didn't notice any real difference post patch.<br />
<br />
I am still waiting to see a Necro mob try and FD me off, or a Wizard mob cast TL on me mid fight.<br />
<br />
~Bax</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Im just afraid of getting hit by a necros FP :P...not that im high enough for chardok anyway :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">&quot;Never did an ounce of research in his NPC life, and certainly never looked for the staff of the wheel is utter crap. &quot;<br />
<br />
Dude, he probably bought the spell in the auction channel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I think the point is lower level Shaman will get owned. If you are 60 you will shrug it off. Not everyone is 60 you know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">That's true.  A lvl 60 will not be as affected.  For example i went to HS for 4 hours after that patch finally went live.  I pulled for the group.  I didn't buff my resists, but then they are ok without buffs (103 MR, 105 CR, 98 FR) and in regular gear.  I got nuked many times, but mostly it wasn't about to kill me.   My druid buddy had to keep a watch tho, and I was more careful about when I popped Canni5.  I made sure to not have caster mob aggro when I used that skill.  Ice comet got cast on me a lot, also some sorta magic based nuke that hurt more than ice comet on average.  IC was landing for between 200 and 300 dmg on me.  The magic based nuke was landing for almost 600.   Then again that's a dungeon I expect to take one or two HTs on each pull, and I max my hps in anticipation of this.  <br />
Btw, I pull because I know that place inside and out, I'm 60 with runspeed3, and I'd rather me pull than a melee do it cause melees are best at doing dmg and I can keep up with most of my own heals (torpor) and do all the slows and buffs without having to stop and med.  So I keep a steady stream of mobs inc, always inc, parked and looking at them waiting their turn to die.  It makes for some pretty fabulous exp!<br />
<br />
But for the non uber player, these changes are gonna suck some ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">But for the non uber player, these changes are gonna suck some ass.<br />
Yep, not fun for me :( First casting mob that I came across was a Druid and the only thing I did resist (unprepared) was root. Which was good, he had dotted me and was nuking my tank down to nothing. <br />
<br />
I might try Chardok today, with an Enchanter though. I'm not going to try duo'ing in that spot without knowing what those mobs will do to a level 55 Shadowknight with half ghetto gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">But for the non uber player, these changes are gonna suck some ass. <br />
<br />
lvl58 ,poor equipement  .Changes are minimal and fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Spraggon-Test</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Its not about gear, its about levels, higher you are, less the effect.  How many 20th-40th level people do you know who's resists go over 50 unbuffed?  Hell, we don't get resist magic until 44 and it is kicking my monk's ass.  Buffed now I can get him to 68MR.  One malisement and he's at 15.  Woohoo.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing from 57 up the changes will be minimal, I'm curious to see how many people saying they are minimal are in groups that have 58+ people in them.  I'm also curious to see how many people who say 'its not all bad' are in full groups or solo/duo'ing.<br />
<br />
Basically the game is now 'fun' if you are 58th+ level and able to take most of this.  However the rest of us where we don't have the levels yet are being screwed.  Overthere/Dreadlands is even sounding like a good place to level... <br />
<br />
I'm not leaving the game over this, but it sure has limited where I will go for xp...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Maboun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Went there to kill Overking for a cleric guildmate last night, 2 groups of 60's. Monk/puller died a few times breaking king room as something in there was casting a 2k DD on him in rapid succession. That is with 150+ buffed fire/magic/cold resists. Kinda makes you wonder about balance.<br />
<br />
<br />
Was even funnier for me to go to permafrost yesterday to farm some crystals and have goblin casters manaburn me. Hello? Granted it's only for 150 points or so but these are level 20 mobs casting a post 60 AA skill.<br />
<br />
Balance and playtesting are good things methinks. I can't believe people on test didn't complain about this or maybe they are all masochists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Spraggon-Test</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Maboun,<br />
<br />
This change hit test probably the same time as Focus items.<br />
<br />
Want to know how long they were on there before live.  2-3 days.<br />
<br />
VI didn't have this tested on test, they did it internally maybe.  &quot;Yep, they're smarter, casting all kinds of mean $h|t put em live.&quot;<br />
<br />
So all servers welcome to the 'testing' of this new 'feature'.<br />
<br />
Please if you don't like the change /feedback on it.  I already have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Chardok has been packed (50 or more people) each time I've gone to check it out since Friday, so my experience is somewhat limited.  I did manage to kill a couple necros and wizards in the levi tunnel during one visit.  As I suspected, the downtime resulting from the &quot;smarter&quot; casters is more than I'm willing to deal with.  The odd nuke or heavy DoT that landed wasn't too bad, but being chain-dispelled was the biggest time waster for me.  With a full group, though I think things will be business as usual basically.<br />
<br />
Overall, I like the change in spirit, but there are some things that need toning down.  Hopefully things will get smoothed out over the next couple of weeks.  That, however, is my greatest frustration with this whole thing - these things should have ALREADY been smoothed out.  I'm not paying to be a beta tester - that's what the folks on the test server are here for. Unfortunately, the dev team seems to believe that using the test server to test big changes isn't necessary.  Whatever internal testing they're doing isn't sufficient - things need to be tested from a TRUE player's perspective.  This is the thing that burns my ass more than anything else about these changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Chardok is ok, but it does help to treat it like a higher end encounter area now.  Leave that first buff slot for a clicky and mebe crap the next two for dispells.  Occasionally, I will get one of those random dispells that eats something buried, but for the most part they go after buffs in order.<br />
<br />
That SBS is looking like a better shield all the time no? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Drydon - Xegony</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Spent 3 hours or so at Herbalist on Friday.  Didn't seem any harder than before.  Actually, I think I was able to kill 1 more mob per repop cycle than I used to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Bloogbloog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Ahhh so this was the caster balancing VI has been talking about. All this time I thought they were working on player casters...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I dont mind that caster NPCs can cast their spells, BUT a level 40 mob should NOT be casting 49 spells.  A caster shouldnt melee like a monk and have the HP of a warrior.  A caster shouldnt be able to use outdoor only spells (sow) while indoors.<br />
<br />
Chardok is a bitch now.  Wizards chain nuking you for 600+, massive dispelling, you name it.  Even with 100 mr im still gettin hit hard.  Places I used to duo with friends are too hard now.  <br />
<br />
Sure I could slap on my resist gear, but then there goes my AC and I get my ass whipped when a caster resists slow and startes hittin me for 150 a pop.<br />
<br />
This whole change is a bunch of crap.<br />
<br />
Could you imagine how hard the Queen is now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Chardok Royals raid was as easy as it ever is with an AoE raid as far as I could tell.   But seeing as how an AoE raid is all about keeping 'em stunned and in the same place, it didn't impact it much.<br />
<br />
Trying to get across Maiden's Eye to the Umbral Plains on the other hand, seriously sucked.  HT and a couple 400+ nukes and I barely made it.</div></div><hr />
