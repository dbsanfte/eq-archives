I sent jack nor **** to anyone of that email address, and the failed delivery messages just began to show yesterday. I'm ****ing angry right now, anyone here able to tell me exactly what is going on?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Makelike</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just glancing at it looks more like someone else got infected and the virus/worm attempted to send the attachment to your account. If in doubt run windows update and any of the free virus scanners available online if you aren't already running something. Free ones include Housecall (http://housecall.trendmicro.com/)  or for long term usage Avast (http://www.avast.com/i_idt_1392.html)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Virus name: Win32:Trojan-gen. {VC}<br />
<br />
My limited knowledge knows that Trojan = ****.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sounds like a Netsky Variant.<br />
<br />
Check www.symantec.com for a removal tool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't think you have a virus but someone who has your address on their system does, and the virus is using their address book as the reply-to field for all it's spam it sending out.<br />
<br />
I'd still scan your PC but you'll probably not find anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't think you have a virus but someone who has your address on their system does, and the virus is using their address book as the reply-to field for all it's spam it sending out.<br />
<br />

correct.<br />
Someone who has your address in his adress list had a virus sent a mail to some adress that does not exist. So Hotmail tries to tell him that and also removed the virus. Actually not really smart of Hotmail as when they recognize the virus they also know they are spamming someone else with this message ...<br />
You are most likely clean yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">this &quot;warning&quot; messages used to be efficient when viruses were really sent from your own computer. but new viruses are just spoofing emails headers &quot;from&quot; with any email adress they can find in an infected computer.<br />
<br />
what is happening is that the postmaster tools are still using this &quot;from&quot; header to notify you, spoofed or not. this is why you are receiving this notification.<br />
<br />
you are most likely not to infected if:<br />
- your antivirus is updated on a regular basis<br />
- you are using anti-trojan tools like &quot;ad-aware&quot; and/or &quot;spybot&quot;<br />
- you are using a firewall with correct settings (use shieldsup at https://grc.com/x/ne.dll?bh0bkyd2 for test)<br />
<br />
and the rate goes up to &quot;99% not infected by new virus&quot; if not using IE and Outlook :)  (go to www.mozilla.org) (or using linux instead of windows)</div></div><hr />
