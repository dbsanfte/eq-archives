I actually had to do it twice because I.. umm.. well kinda accidentally killed the spirit while I was talking to him, heh. <br />
<br />
And the Broken Arrow is part of an as yes unsolved/broken quest.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps )</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Between 30 minutes to one hour. I did it 3 times, and the respawn times were kind of random.<br />
<br />
And the arrow is good for announcing as a &quot;drop&quot; off of some random monster in ToV.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gasp! Send me tells for *link*a broken arrow*link*, include a link to your current gear and faction!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The wait is about an hour.  If you don't see any other NPC's (named ones, not sharks, they don't count) your in the wrong loc.<br />
Took me 3 times to find the right loc.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Iren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When i did this it took me like a hour i found a good way to do it is use invis vs animals not 1 thing bugged me the whole time with it and about the loc of where the stuff spawns i just followed the ogre lady and had np keeping up with her</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ribeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was being very patient for a little over an hour, till I went LD.  I was about to get extremely impatient, but luckily when I relogged, the NPC's had been patient and waited for me, thank God.  This test almost broke me, lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you go to the spot where everything spawns, cast lev on yourself and swim straight up to the surface of the water. There, look straight down and position yourself, in first person view, so your view is just slightly under the surface of the water. If you do this correctly, you'll be able to see everything under the water clearly, without the underwater visual effects. You may be bobbing in and out of that, but you can still see what is spawning at the ocean floor and if there are any sharks nearby. That is, if you have clipping plane set high enough. The sharks won't aggro you at the surface, so you'll be safe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I had a hard time doing that, and ended up bringing a druid friend to track. Those spirits move about and it's hard to see clearly underwater.</div></div><hr />
