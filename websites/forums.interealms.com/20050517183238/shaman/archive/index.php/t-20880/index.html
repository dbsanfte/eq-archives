<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eladrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all.<br />
<br />
I am a new Shaman on VS server and am at lvl 24 so far. I am hoping that some of you high lvl Shamans can help me out?<br />
<br />
I am at a loss tbh on how to play the class well. Should I group? Should I solo? CAN I  solo?<br />
<br />
I am a Barbarian Male. I have never got any class above lvl 56 in 2 years so think I am doing something very wrong somewhere and its so frustrating to me!<br />
<br />
Any help, advice on anything would be so so gratefully received!<br />
<br />
<br />
Many thanks guys and I am sorry if this question has been asked before!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes you can solo or group.  Grouping will get you experience faster, but sometimes you just need to go play by yourself.  I suggest putting up lfg and going solo until you get an invite, or start a group of your own.  LDoN is pretty good exp at the lower levels and you can get a few decent drops along the way if you need them, and you'll start building points for the higher level armor.  As for how to play: read these boards. Go to the level 20-30 section and read where people are hunting and what tactics they are using.  If you need specific help ask specific questions. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Skyline_SZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was on SZ as a 65 Ranger when the good team needed a reliable shaman for raids.  I made a shaman and soloed my way to 52 b4 i actually grouped.<br />
<br />
went from 1 to 25- in 8hours  with a little pl ( lev 6 to 25 in PC)<br />
then went from 25 to 52 within 2 week, about 5 hours play time each day. (Kei/ 9/ SD helps a ton).    <br />
<br />
I wouldnt recommand soloing just because of the fact that its alot more fun to group with others. group up with others, u'll make friends this way. Only solo when u cannot find a group.  Why pay for an online game just so u can solo?  even tho we are the masters of soloing.   I have soloed Zelniak( wrong spell)     the Named Donkey in Umbral planes b4!  1 + hour fight is gay</div></div><hr />

not really at Einnods stage of the game.<br />
<br />
If I were you Einnod I would be looking at secondary forte or FoMM as the next AA choices.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ragack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well if I remember correctly my soloing tactic at about there was kiting the gnolls in the center of South Karana but the XP was slow so groups are a better way to go, you entering a tough patch for a shaman but hang in there till you get canni and regen.<br />
<br />
P.S. I'm on the VS server as well if you need a hand<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There are lots of good guides on how to maximize what you bring to the group. If you are solo, you will find out soon enough with only risk to yourself. <br />
<br />
I would suggest considering the following in a group: (1) pre-buff; (2) most important buffs are usually haste and hit points; (3) control aggro and crowds--your tool for this is root, which you should be ready to cast if cleric or druid gets aggro; (4) use your heal to keep other healers alive; (5) slow is very powerful over the long haul, but dont let everything fall apart to get slow in on mob; and remember (6) you are versatile and can fill many roles for a group of your level. Multiple shaman can be in the same group and fill different roles at your level, and in fact any time before the end game. Practice different roles as long as group understands what you are doing. <br />
<br />
FInally, have fun and be fun for the group. Its a game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Seeler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Seems to me I spent those levels in Lake of Ill Omen. Lots to hunt and plenty of time to work some weapon skills and the all important defense. Pull with slow and then dot....root and back out to heal and step back in. At 24 I believe you have/get your first canni spell and also first regen. I used to canni down then bind wound to 50 percent then regen the rest. I soloed alot and my defense and melee were always maxed. I believe it has helped me in higher levels to deal with many situations because when soloing things do go bad once in awhile. Good luck and good hunting.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Seichan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You can solo quite well...Just remember a couple things.. Canni is your best friend in the whole wide world..do not fear it, use it always.  Your DoT's may seem like your enemy at your level (and for quite a few more levels) always breaking root and such...but stick with them, DoT's are our damage.  And finally, invest the time and points into acquiring the magic line of DoT's from the LDoN expansion.. I so very wish they were available to me when I was a little Shaman.    Enjoy your Shaman</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hi all.<br />
<br />
Hola.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am at a loss tbh on how to play the class well. Should I group? Should I solo? CAN I  solo?<br />
<br />
First off - the key is to have fun.  I suggest you try both ways and see where it takes you.  That is one of the great things I like about Shamans.  They are a versitile class and tailored to be flexible.  For most of my levels, until the 50s, I soloed as much as I could.  A lot of times my schedule would have me logging on at odd hours, and soloing was my best option.<br />
<br />
If you do decide to solo, I would concentrate on HP/AC items.  After all, HP is Mana to a Shaman.  More HP you have, the more you can canni away.<br />
<br />
It is my opinion that you should at least solo a little bit.  This will help you max your defense every time you level.  AC is always good to have, and I was a major AC junkie back in the day.<br />
<br />
Currently, I am more of a group shaman rather than a solo shaman.  I enjoy company a lot more than soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Congratulations, you're past the hard part.  Level 24 is where the Shaman class starts to rock.  Levels 14-23 were tough.<br />
<br />
Read up on Cannibalize and Cannidance in the medicine cabinet.  Sure, Cannidance has become less useful now that mind buffs and horses are so easy to get, but if you don't know about it you'll suffer the ridicule of your peers here on the board :-) and it does have some uses.  If you don't want to bother with Cannidance just cannibalize constantly and keep Regen up.<br />
<br />
Right now you NEED to do some soloing to get your defense up.  Getting defense maxed at 200 is one of your most important tasks in the 20's and 30's.  However, once you've maxed defense for a particular level, go ahead and group, it's faster XP.  Root rot is a viable option for you at your level, but it doesn't raise defense, so get used to mixing it up in there personally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">When grouping, keep in mind that while you can do alot, you can't do it all.  This was my biggest problem at lower levels.  You need to negotiate with your group what you can do for the group, given limited mana.<br />
<br />
If slowing is your main job for the group, you will have less mana available for buffs - and everyone wants buffs.  But if you slow and buff, there will be little mana to heal.<br />
<br />
For most of your career your main job will be to buff the team and slow the mobs.  Healing is always up but as the backup/emergency healer.  Remember that both Clerics and Druids can heal better than you, and Paladins can heal as well as you can.  But keep the regen line up on the team unless a druid already is handling this.<br />
<br />
When you are main healer, you may need to control the pull rate so you have enough mana to cope if something bad happens.  One trick mentioned to me was holding off healing until you teammates get to 50% when mana is tight.  That tends to keep them from being overactive in the pulling department.<br />
<br />
Get stoicism as soon as you can - it redefines the game for shamans. A HoT to recover from Canniing is liberateing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Oh, and a trick I wish I had known back in the 30's....<br />
<br />
Walking Sleep is less than half the mana cost of Tagar's Insects, but has about 3/4 of the effect, possibly more in the early 30's after you just get it.  If you're constantly LOM and have another healer in the party, shift some of the burden onto them by using the cheaper spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Besides reading the many sections on these boards that provide great bits of information on playing a shaman (where, what, solo, grouped, why this item or that one) go out and try stuff.<br />
<br />
Push your abilities while you are still at low levels to learn what your strengths as well as limitations are. Key is not to be afraid of &quot;not doing something right.&quot; You will make mistakes and you will find little tricks that work for you that would not have happened if you didn't try different things.<br />
<br />
My leveling days were spent primarily soloing due to my schedule at the time (and in some cases - preference.) I did have a personally imposed rule, which was to group for ~1 level every new spell cycle. Group dynamics alter as you level up. Spending time in a few groups learning how others change along with yourself only helps you find your balance and usefullness as a group player.<br />
<br />
Bottomline, as always, is enjoy playing. Hopefully that fun can be found with your shaman. If not, there are other classes to try out until you find the one that works best for your playstyle.</div></div><hr />
