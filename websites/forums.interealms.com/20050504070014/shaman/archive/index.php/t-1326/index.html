Every now and again theres a thread that I can't reply to, either using quick reply or by hitting reply. The error comes out as Cannot find Server or DNS error. I'm using IE6.0 on a win2000 machine.<br />

Same error myself, and I don't think it's related to the last person posting, because they vary. Orignally I was under the assumption it was someone's sig messing it up.</div></div><hr />

Has rotted for me. I have Win 2000 and IE 6.0.26....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">The problem is, I see those threads with no problem and can't reproduce the problem. I'm even more surprised because this is a very busy day. I've got over 500 people on both the Ranger's and Shammy boards concurrently at times today, so I'd expect the problem to be bad. However, I haven't seen any other problems today except for what you just noted above.. and it's not a problem that I can see :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Zugugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">We all see the threads with no problem. Its posting replies that don't work.<br />
<br />
PHP has a builtin debugger you can connect to if you enable it. Perhaps find someone who experiences the problem and connect to the debugger while they try to post a reply to one of the threads?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I havent found anymore threads that I can't post to now. I was starting to wonder if it was continuing to be a problem for those of us posting off peak given that me and an AB shaman still seemed to be having problems.<br />
<br />
At any rate, it seems to have stopped happening for now.</div></div><hr />
