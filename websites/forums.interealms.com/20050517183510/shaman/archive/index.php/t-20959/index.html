<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lessurnad_TFS</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does ne one know if were able to make invs potions, i heard that we are able just dunno how. please respond here yall thx.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Invis to undead, yes.<br />
Regular invisibility, no.<br />
<br />
You can get 1 charge invis potions from a few different NPCs, or you can buy cloudy potions in POK (and a few other zones I believe) for about 10-12pp depending on charisma. Note: they don't combine into 10 dose potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Uurgugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We can make Invis potions, they are called Essence of Concealment (burdock root, empty vial, mystic ash and swamp vine).<br />
Unfortunatly the Swamp Vine is a rare forage in Guk LDoNs . They triv at 222</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">of course dont even explain to me while a class that uses rare herbs to make its healing potions for its tribes wouldn't know how to forage them theirselves..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That reminds me, When going to the new God Boat zone I remember seeing some new sort of invis potion with a casting time on one of the alchemy merchants.... Looked like someone had been skilling up and selling them back to the merchant as they were below the merchant's regular products with the snare potions that had also served to skill up.<br />
<br />
Should really have written down the name but anywhoo... I tried combining 10 of them and it didn't work so I left it at that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I suppose they went to the stone-age walmart for components..<br />
<br />
<br />
I have always pictured druids, rangers, and shamans as the classes that were close to the natural world, with clerics and shamans close to the spiritual world.  It would be logical for shamans to have forage I think.<br />
<br />
But of course, 1) this will never happen and 2) we have bigger problems to worry about I guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope - those are vendor sold only.  I guess they had to do something to compete with the huge profits shamans have been making selling invis potions from LDoN.  I imagine there is a shaman somewhere who has made some of those - I know I haven't.<br />
<br />
Or perhaps they needed to nerf the huge profits the vendors were making selling cloudy potions.  <br />
<br />
Or perhaps they needed a reason for classes that are not time flagged and can't cast invis themselves to buy the GoD upgrade they can't play...</div></div><hr />
