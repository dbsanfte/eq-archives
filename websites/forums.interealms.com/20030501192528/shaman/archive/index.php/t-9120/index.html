<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>camibella</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all.<br />
I will be doing the Hole Portion of my Epic in Six Hours.<br />
I want to go to HSK by entering the city and droping down the water fall and taking the tunnel system up. Thats the only way I know. <br />
<br />
Is that drop safe for large races? I have only done it with my Halfling.<br />
<br />
Has anyone gone this rout before? any recomendatoins with it?<br />
<br />
Also another worrie about droping down like this is the warrior epic guy.. whats his agro range like? I'm sure if people Drop and go LEFT like instructed we should be fine but I could just imagin this guy goin all loopy and agroing us ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ooh.. 10k.<br />
<br />
Not safe.  And lev will fade.<br />
<br />
Far more fun to go in and through.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>camibella</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm not talking about droping off from paneel.<br />
<br />
I'm talking about when you go into the city if you go to the RIGHT you will enter a lil area full of water that drops down off the water fall. I did it with my halfling rouge several times no damage cuz I landed in teh water. <br />
<br />
YES It lands you in the same spot as if you had droped in from paneel but somewhat different. <br />
<br />
eeep I guess no one has gone this way. YAYA I will lead my 12 friends in that way and come back and let you all know if it works out. *sigh* *eep* Jeez I was hopeing someone was as crazy minded as me and already thought htis one up and and advice on it ;)<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Ubah tank! Drop down and if you die we'll have the necro summon your corps ;)&quot; Thats the way it will be done *gulp* Or I'll take the plung</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tagra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you're very, very careful you'll be fine.  You have to make sure you're dropping at the right point.  Also have your cleric use DA when they go over... I speak from experience here....<br />
<br />
For some reason I always have a hard time doing this and end up splatting on the ground with half my characters.   Because of my clutziness I've decided it's just as well to go through the city and down the tunnel to the Undead tower.  Really, it's probably just as fast, maybe even faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ooh, haven't done that.  1st person in my raid that was gonna, splatted.  We decided at that point that it wasn't a really good thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I always go down over the waterfall. Just make sure people stay close to the wall and you'll be OK, the pool at the bottom isn't all THAT small :). I usually ask the cleric to DA before jumping, that way if anyone else screws up and dies they can be rezzed back in. <br />
<br />
Expect about 3 mobs when you hit the bottom, nothing too dangerous, I don't think you'll get any golems on the initial jump, just some elementals and an imp. After that you can pretty much pull singles to the undead tower. <br />
<br />
If by warrior epic guy, you mean the scalekeeper, he's non agro. Not sure if he's social, I've always made it a point to fight well away from him. <br />
<br />
Once you get to the undead tower remind everyone no AoE, Invis to Undead and walk up to the last switch-back in the ramp before you get to Kirn's level. That's a safe spot to pull to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Much Love</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Simondavid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Best way to do this portion of epic is to obtain a shiny brass idol from the named orc in Highhold pass....has one cast of DA. drop in from the hole in Paineel. after that just a few mobs to kill before Kirn. I did it with a 61 cleric 55 pally , and me a 56 shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ougabouga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Oh yes, the scalekeeper is social!! And MEAN!  We had a mage drop in from paineel and coth us down.  Something aggro'd one of us and scalekeeper aggro'd even though he con'd indiff, and needless to say raid wiped.  We managed to get cleric back down and rez'd and raid continued.  <br />
