<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There is a general problem with all classes that give up part of their primary ability to gain a secondary ability (paladin healing is a good example). Since they cannot use both abilities at the same time they get to choose which ability they want to be bad at. When you can usually optimize groups to have every needed ability performed by a specialist class being able to do two things worse then these specialist classes is useless.<br />
<br />
The solution is obvious (well, to me it is) - instead of being able to do X or Y ability 75% as well as the specialist you should be able to do X and Y 50% as well as that class (or 75/25 or whatever). So far this has been attempted via recast timers on spells. This does not work though as everytime you give that class a minor upgrade to that ability by giving them a new spell you nearly double their ability since they can just mem both spells. Thus you end up going from 75/25 to 75/40.<br />
<br />
These abilities should just be AAs with near instant casting times instead (and cheap AAs at that if they are to be used for class balancing). That way a new expansion can just improve the existing AA ability. It would also make class balancing easier overall in that you would not need to worry about casting times of secondary abilities affecting the time available for primary abilities.<br />
<br />
Now, not every secondary ability needs this. Buffs are fine as is. Debuffs are probably too much trouble to convert to this system. Rez is fine as is.<br />
<br />
But paladin group heals should be a 0.5 second cast time AA. Cannibalize should be an AA. Zefeer's should be an AA. Ranger nukes should be AAs. And so on . . <br />
<br />
Of course a lot of the abilities would have to be adjusted in magnitude to make up for nonexistant cast times or mana. And some abilities (like healing) should probably still be available as spells to supplement the AAs.<br />
<br />
But overall I think this system would work much better then the current balancing nightmare.<br />
<br />
Thoughts? Comments?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Two main problems to implement this in the current game.<br />
<br />
1. LOTS of coding and thinking would have to go into this and many spells would be deleted.  I really don't see SOE devoting this much time to class balance when I don't really see the secondary abilities of hybrids as really making class balance worse.  All they need to do is make the spells slightly worse, or make other class's abilities better or put spells such as the group heals on the SAME timer (I'm sure this is possible).<br />
<br />
2.  Would require much more AA for what is right now a given ability of each hybrid via a spell obtained each level.  Severely handicaps casual players who don't like to grind out experience/AAs.<br />
<br />
Reason one is why I know this will never happen in EQ1--SOE isn't going to put any effort into it.<br />
<br />
Reason two is why I wouldn't even think of suggesting this to &quot;balance&quot; out classes as it unfairly gimps the casual non-exp grinders.<br />
<br />
*edit, and maybe you weren't talking about exclusively hybrid spells being put on timers, but regardless, I think it doesn't work for the current game*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am not sure about lots of coding actually. If SOE actually any sort of numbers for how much shaman should be able to cannibalize or paladins heal or rangers nuke it would be a lot easier to meet those goals with near-instant cast time AAs then it is with the current system where you have to take weapon delay, spell gem refresh, spell casting times and so on into account.<br />
<br />
I can imagine they would be afraid of the guaranteed flood of angry protests though. It would probably be too extreme a change to have a decent chance of being implemented for existing abilities. New abilities might be balanced in this way however.<br />
<br />
As for AA cost, it should be really low as I already said. Say, one AA per tier of ability, no more then 5 AAs total per class. (for example 4 AAs total for cannibalize 1, 2, 3 and 4).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The only problem is for the most part this doesn't affect anything but hybrids which have multiple spells with long recast times.  In essence, you are proposing to completely demolish and rebuild a skyscraper because a window on the 1st floor was broken with a baseball.<br />
<br />
I stand by ANY amount of AA's being too high a cost for the casual non exp grinder.  They could make these cost 0 AA's and be available at certain levels, but then that system is already in place with spells :)<br />
<br />
For example, your proposal that canni would be 1 point per level (up to 4 points for the level 58 spell) would be unfair to people like me.  I had a grand total of 50 AAs when I quit because I couldn't stand to play all the time to get AAs.  With how long it takes people like me to grind out 1 AA, the system would be totally unfair.<br />
<br />
I don't think its a terribly huge problem that hybrids have those certain spells though.  There is the limitation on how many they can mem at once since there are but 8 spell gems available.  <br />
<br />
It's definitely not a system that should show up in EQ1 in my opinion, but might be a good plan for future games (and I wouldn't doubt that this is what WoW uses for 'spells').<br />
<br />
Hm..and to tack on an idea to combat what you see as a problem of (for example paladins) memming two group heals with long delays.  They could add coding to not allow more than one group heal to be memmed at once.  Or beastlords couldn't mem more than one of the same line of nuke perhaps and so on.  I know the current system won't allow you to mem the same spell twice, so I don't think it would take much coding to disallow  certain spell lines to only allow one to be memmed at a time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It is a little funny about the stacking of these spells.  For BL and the ice spells.<br />
<br />
HP's    mana   Cast time<br />
450    150      3.2<br />
675    250      3.2<br />
742    275      3.2<br />
<br />
1867  675      9.6<br />
<br />
<br />
Shaman:<br />
<br />
925   300      7.8<br />
<br />
So it will take a shaman about 2 casts, or 20 seconds to get the same spell damage a BL can do in 10..the catch is the recast on these BL spells is 30 seconds.  So they cast it in 10 seconds or so, then have 20 seconds of melee.<br />
<br />
We cast it in 20 seconds and have 10 seconds to either cast again or something else.  It isn't a big deal, but just shows that these really low mana/recast time spells aren't a big deal by themself, but when you can stack them, you can get quite some decent casting power.<br />
<br />
Actually, if the BL were chaining the level 59 ice spell during those 20 seconds.<br />
<br />
430 damage  5.3 cast, 2 recast<br />
<br />
so about 3 casts in those 20 seconds..I'm rounding here for 1290 points.<br />
<br />
In those extra 10 seconds we can cast one more 925 spell.<br />
<br />
So a grand total of 3157 for the BL and 2775 for the Shaman.<br />
<br />
Interesting, not a complaint, but it is interesting that our hybrid can out DD us if mana isn't a concern.  We have also talked about how they can outbuff us as well since the stat cap is too low...Just gave me a chuckle when I realized they can out cast us as well as fight us for DD.</div></div><hr />

In essence, you are proposing to completely demolish and rebuild a skyscraper because a window on the 1st floor was broken with a baseball.<br />
It also affects shaman (cannibalize, avatar and possibly Quiescence line), druids (that weird super regen) and probably all classes at some level.<br />
<br />
Also to me the problem is quite a bit larger then what you describe. Taking shaman as an example - I should be able to keep avatar on my group's melees. Quite often I am not able to because I cannot afford to loose a spell gem to it. I quite often do not get to cannibalize at all (except from cannibalisation) - I might squeeze in the cast time but I can not afford the refresh time.<br />
<br />
Both of these should be free in that they should not take time and spell gems away from me. (and mana, although that is debatable with avatar).<br />
<br />

Supplement it with spells then (like I said above). Nothing wrong with keeping cannibalize in game as is. At the level of the game you probably are (if you have trouble making fast AAs) you probably do not feel the pain of cannibalize locking you out of spellcasting for 4 seconds but for me it is a huge problem. Letting me cannibalize &quot;for free&quot; every x seconds would easily be worth a couple AA to me.<br />
<br />
I don't think its a terribly huge problem that hybrids have those certain spells though.  There is the limitation on how many they can mem at once since there are but 8 spell gems available.<br />
Imagine this: the next expansion is released and druids could double their healing at the cost of a spell gem. Would that be ok? Because that is basically what happened with paladins with GoD although the problem is a lot less pronounced since they got a group heal.<br />
<br />

That still leaves us with problems like cannibalize taking much more time then the cast time of the spell indicates.</div></div><hr />
