<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shaben</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When a full group kills a mob, you end up with 216% worth of xp split between you, so if you're all the same level you get 36% of the kill ...<br />
<br />
When a lower level player (e.g. me at 52) groups with higher level players (e.g. 5 level 65s) the higher level players each get a bigger proportion of the xp than the lower level player. <br />
<br />
If it were linear (which I'm sure it's not - I would imagine it would be exponential, but for a worst case starting point ...)<br />
<br />
XP level ratio would be: <br />
individuals level / (total levels of players in group added together)<br />
so in this case it'd be 52 / ((65 * 5) + 52)  = 0.138<br />
and 65 / ((65 *5) + 52) = 0.172<br />
<br />
Soooo, Total XP * XP level ration = 37.2% for the level 65 players<br />
and 29.8% for the level 52 player<br />
<br />
Leading to the logical conclusion (remembering that is a worst case senario - the XP level ratio will be much more in the favour of the level 65s) that all you level 65 players should form a 5 person group and group with me as opposed to some useless level 65 dr00d (ahem) as you'll get more experience per kill  :D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, except I think they changed the XP distribution policy a while back and lower levels get an equal share of XP now.  And from what I've seen with my 45 druid it's true.<br />
<br />
I'll have to try to look up the reference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">From everything I've seen power leveling my wizard, the xp distribution is the same as it has been since they got rid of the hybrid xp sucking thing and its just based on pure levels.<br />
<br />
Example:  A level 65 groups with a level 60.  The Level 65 gets  65/(65+60) = 52% and the level 60 gets 60/(65+60) = 48%.<br />
<br />
Or using the levels above:  the druid would get 42% and the shaman would get 58% of the kills xp.   Considering that most mobs won't be giving you more than 2-3% xp and coupled with the different amount of worth of a &quot;%&quot; of xp on the different characters (due to level, class, and race difference) it would be hard to just &quot;see&quot;.  More or less when you calculate the split, while the shaman gets more of a share of xp, his higher xp needs to gain a &quot;1%&quot; increase makes his share appear similar to the druids because while the druid gets less of a share, he needs for less xp to get a 1% increase.</div></div><hr />
