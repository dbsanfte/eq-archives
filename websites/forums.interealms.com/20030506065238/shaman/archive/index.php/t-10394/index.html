<br />
I was looking to improve my Kael faction.  I'm level 54 at the moment and if I could get some exp while killin dorfs that would be ideal.  Any good spots out their you shaman know of?  I'm currently KoS with giants so I'm going to be in it for the long haul.  Also do you think it's worth it?  I've gotten myself to dubious with dragons, but I'm not sure if I'll ever be hunting or questing with them.  It is nice to be able to walk around though.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Buk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1) Get a friend to invis you while you hand in Coldain heads to the recruiter at the EW zone.  This will get you ally rif.  Stop when you get ally rif, the zek hits are so tiny it's a huge waste of time and plat for coldain heads to keep turning them in to the recruiter at this point.<br />
<br />
2) Slaughter in SS.  I took a couple of friends (you will probably need a very strong group at 54) and we climbed as high as we could, up to where the old quest givers hung out.  There were some very nice drops, including some MP III boots and a shield that was similar to an OOIV (but no drop).  Do this until you are non KOS with zek.<br />
<br />
3) Hand in coldain heads to Captain Bvellos near the bank. This will get you ally Zek/KT.<br />
<br />
Voila.  It took me about a week of solid killing and buying heads and turning them in (very expensive!!) to get ally to all three factions.<br />
<br />
I killed the dwarves in the mines in GD.  There were the simple miners which were very easy to kill and a higher level guard type which were light blue to me at 60 (maybe 61? can't remember).  Nothing sees invis, so a lot of time I would just invis around and pick off the easy miners.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I started my faction work in Velious with just 3 coldain shawls under my belt...I was given/purchased the heads and toes and the only resulting faction hits I had were from this.<br />
My former guild was giant faction so between raids and in my spare time I would go dorf bowling in the GD mines in the south east portion of the zone.<br />
Now the absolute total best way to get non KOS to the giants is a combo of King Dain raids, raids in SS (anything and everything in there, if your going to kill in ToV for armor drops, kiss your dragon faction goodbye) and also Dorf bowling......<br />
Sadly there is nothing that is easily soloable or even duoable for exp that gives Giant faction hits....there are several dorf guards in the mines that will con blue to you, but have TONS of hit points and hit fairly hard. Get a melee type partner, slow em and you can do pretty good in between dorf miner pulls (which are all greenies).<br />
There are 3 seperate miner spawn points in the caves, the first as you enter has 3-4 miners but they rarely drop heads, the middle one has 2 miners and drop heads fairly well, but there is a guard in aggro range/assist range. The third is the sweet spot, with a whopping 7 miners (heck maybe 8, I am senile) that drop heads pretty commonly.<br />
Turn the heads in to Capt Bvellos in the bank or to the guy on the EW zone side.....it works best if your non KOS, but a friend that is gutsy enough to risk eating a death for targeting you would work too.<br />
It took me a total of 5 or 6 long ToV raids (6+ hours each), several of which we killed Torkelenar (or however you spell it) and tagged a few named in WW, 2 Dain Raids with plenty of royals pulled for faction work and 40ish Coldain Heads later (all but 8 self farmed) and I was Max Ally to Zek/Tormax and indiff to the Riff (they are the hardest to get anywhere with, stubborn lot).<br />
Good luck and good work, just take a week or so and as Gloriana has suggested...you can also head to any of the dogs camps in Velks for Kobold Paws....Cpt Bvellos takes those 4 at a time (non stacked now, thanks tons VI /e sarcasm off) they give great Rif faction hits and so so zek factions hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Riff was incredibly easy for me, just turned in heads to the recruiter at the EW zone.  It was the first Giant faction I raised to ally.<br />
<br />
I was KOS, so I had a friend who could invis help me out.  I put 4 heads in the trade window, waited for my friend to invis me, then hit trade.  Ding ding ding ding 4 faction hits.   I don't know if this would work for Bvellos, since he is a much higher level.  The recruiter is green and won't attack you even if you sit down at his feet.<br />
<br />
In my experience:<br />
<br />
Recruiter - big Rif hits, small Zek hits<br />
Bvellos - big Zek hits (not sure about Rif, was ally), moderate KT hit</div></div><hr />
