<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zammatacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The AA first aid adds 10% to binding wounds with each point.  I don't have this on my shaman, but I am going to on my warrior.  My question is this.....<br />
<br />
Does the 10% increase add to each bandage?  So at skill 200 instead of 25hp per bandaid, you heal 27.5 (or whatever they round up / down to) or do you heal to a total of 80% of your hps?<br />
<br />
Any help on this would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you.</div></div><hr />

you heal to a higher total percent of your hp's<br />
ie you can bandage past 50 %</div></div><hr />

What changes is how far up you can heal.<br />
With my monk, because he has 210 bind wound (anything 201 or over) he can bind himself up to 70% health.<br />
With his first 6 aa, I went run3 bind wound3 instead of the tradional run3 regen3.<br />
As a result, my monk can bind wound anyone up to full health, instead of stopping and having to regen the last big up.</div></div><hr />

DOH..  I did the aa skills and was still hitting 70% at 200.  Forgot it had to be 201 to break the barrier, not 200.  Thank you all for the replies and help.</div></div><hr />
