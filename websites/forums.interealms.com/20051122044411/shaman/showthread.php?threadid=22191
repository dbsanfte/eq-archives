	<p>Reading this post <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=22161" target="_blank">http://forums.interealms.com/shaman...?threadid=22161</a> I was reminded of lots of similar posts as well as the tons of posts trying to rationalize solutions for SOE to consider that would make Shaman viable in groups once again.<br />
<br />
History time: Original and Kunark tough content groups (dungeons) needed a tank, cleric, enchanter, shaman and dps/utility. If you wanted extra mana regen/best haste as well as superior crowd control to do more you had enchanter. If you wanted less incoming damage, melee buffs to add damage output and backup healing you had shaman. Cleric filled the role of increasing hitpoints as well as healing damage. Tank was meatshield. Dps was ... dps, kill the mobs faster. Utility was druid - they could take the place of cleric or shaman with heals/damage shield to compensate for lack of slowing. Ideally, with the the addition of a druid the ds contributed to fast killing.<br />
<br />
Even with this group, there was downtime. You could only do so much before the cleric needed to med, the shaman needed to canni/rebuff, yada, yada. Experience was 2-fold: (1) naturally the increase in character experience to make the next level (not aa, there were none); (2) experiencing challenging game content with a group - generally a group of friends having fun.<br />
<br />
You could take the above group makeup and remove each of the 3 primary support classes individually and still have a successful group. Their overall ability took a hit, but the group could still progress through content by adapting to their weakness.<br />
<br />
So what really has changed? Velious expansion is where the devs starting attempting creativity in content design. Recall Skyshrinne version 1? Totally MR mobs that couldn't be mezzed, debuffed, slowed, nuked? That didn't last long. Orcs at the fort in EW, at the time, were monsters to fight and did, at the group level intended, definitely need a cleric as healer. To be fair, ToFS was compensation by giving a nice xp zone to those groups that didn't fit the "mold." Then the dev concept of 'difficulty' began its skewed course of introducing content that reflects very little on the core abilities of all the classes. Beyond the dynamic duo of tank/cleric or the holy trinity of tank/cleric/enchanter content no longer balances itself against the variables of a potential group makeup. Were it not for "mudflation" and the ease of getting great gear each class would feel the skewed balancing/lack of balance a lot earlier than GoD content - in encounters based on the level they were intended for. The concept of 'difficulty' is way out of whack.<br />
<br />
So, what is my point (er, Chapter 2<img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title="smile" smilieid="1" /> )? Rationally, and shaman are a rational bunch (though high strung at times), we continue to point out the problems in the game based on what the content is. The SOE wall we pound our heads against is their argument that classes are "balanced as intended." Frankly, this is fundamentally true ... though I would argue classes are so overlapping and over-balanced already that any more would just turn the mess into a quagmire. Shaman are the poster child for what goes wrong when balancing/adjusting classes to fit too many roles. Don't get my wrong here, I am NOT saying shaman have been adjusted so much that their balance against other classes is skewed. Just the opposite - shaman lack of balance/expansion progression while others have adapted/progressed into shaman abilities points out the inherent flaw in 'balancing.' SOE history clearly defines 'balancing' as making the lines between class individuality blurred to the point of invisibility. With the exception of one single class: clerics. Go figure.<br />
<br />
So what to do? Content. I would like to know who this 'majority of players' is that demands encounters be 'quick.' Personally, if I want quick I can jump on my game cube, PS2 or XBox. Don't get me wrong. 10-15-20-30 minute fights belong against only boss mobs. On the other hand, 25-45 seconds fights are just damn silly. That is how long yard trash mobs in PoFear/PoHate lasted on raids with 30-50 folks ... many, many moons ago. Named fights lasted a few good minutes, and that took work/coordination to do that fast. CT and Inny took a damn  long time ... and you actually thought you accomplished something when you won!<br />
<br />
But I digress ...<br />
<br />
Back in the day, a group working its way into a Seb camp (or holding a Seb camp) worked together to get there. Mobs took a minute+ to kill. Mob dps required the cleric (or rather, primary healer) to heal, but wasn't so massive that a druid/shaman combo couldn't work together to fill the healing role also ... given the shaman was still primarily there to slow/debuff and the druid was there to keep the tank alive until slowed. Without a shaman, an enchanter could fill the slower role - which was tough since they were also doing lots of CC. That was the balance though. Without key classes, roles could overlap satisfactorily to work the content by adapting. Note the difference here - "roles could overlap satisfactorily." Not replace completely, but rather, work in a pinch if that was all you had available.<br />
<br />
This is still very much how the players approach the game today. It is still very viable as an approach up until serious upper 50's/mid 60's content. Note, I said serious content ... challenging, level appropriate content. 60ish though, this approach loses its viability. Except for clerics. This becomes the realm of cleric dominance. This is not a slam against clerics ... rather a slam against SOE game design. The one class that stands out above all others as being the most significantly indespensible are ... clerics. Everything is balanced around them. This is where the game gets stupid.<br />
<br />
Since clerics can adapt to any current content (and 95% or more of it is basically trivial to a top end cleric) the dev approach to content design has become focused on their limitations only. Other class contributions have become minimized/marginalized against this. As long as the cleric can keep the dps folks alive, all is good ... or so seems the new SOE game plan. To make content "challenging" has become more concerned with "how to make clerics cast more, faster and efficiently" than the group sense of taking on a mob and kicking its butt with adaptability, initiative and utilizing varying group talents/skills. It is just blast healing/blast killing. A few years ago I used to have fun doing this type of encounter ... in DOOM and DOOM II.<br />
<br />
So, without any parsing or statistics from me, I will leave my argument that it is not so much the classes that need to be revamped/changed/yada, yada as much as the content needs to be adjusted to allow each class, in a variety of combinations, the ability to face ALL avialable content, adapt to it, and ENJOY PLAYING because they CAN win in it!<br />
<br />
From a shaman perspective, I say this somewhat tongue-in-cheek. At this point in the game our "buff" abilities are moot. Were content changed so that I could, at this level of the game (with the heals/debuffs available to me now), contribute by slowing, back up healing, dealing dps over the long term (IN A GROUP) ... well, I would be a happy camper more than willing to let clerics have their radically dominant healing as well as not having to worry about casting 4-6 melee buffs. How can SOE do this?<br />
<br />
Just make encounters such that over the duration of the fight, or series of trash fights, that I am needed to slow/debuff the mobs or the cleric finds they are using way too much mana to counteract damage incoming. Instead of giving me better heals ... make clerics need my slow in their groups. Mine. Not enchanters, not beastlords ... hell, not even necro slow ... mine. The others already have dominant slots in groups (CC and dps.) (Yes, this is a selfish shaman perspective and, yes, other classes also have viable problems with newer content ... for sake of this board my focus is shaman atm. Sorry to you other folks.)<br />
<br />
If this can't be done, then take the time to prove to me the justification for the arcade-style battles. Who the hell is this 'majority' who want 'faster killing' content? No one I know. Like most of SOE perceptions of the game ("majority of players 30-50 range" - LMAO) I fail to believe this is true, or that they have CLUE-1 what is going on with the player base. It is clear SOE has no clue that what these games are supposed to be is FUN, challenging, FUN, rewarding (risk/reward balanced), FUN. Did I mention FUN also? Not 10 minute fun, or 15 or even 30 ... but an enjoyable experience that can last for years. An ... pardon the play on words here ... EXPERIENCE!!<br />

	<p>Content should be designed on a per-enounter basis. Case and point: Why should "beating" a trial involve clearing countless trash to get there, fighting respawn, etcetera. Look at tipt for example. The trash doesn't make the expedition hard, it just makes it a pain in the ass, and increases the "potential waste of lots of time with the slightest screwup" factor. This isn't <b>Fun</b>. At least ikkinz only has a few repops, and those are like 3 roamers.<br />
<br />
I don't mind clearing trash, but conveyorbelt style killing to get somewhere is just retarded. what OoW really needs is a place where you can go to some fort thing, kill a couple guards, then have it start an event, where you try to sneak around and get to the boss without being seen, or you can brute force your way in. Let players control the method in which they tackle the content. Like the game Deus Ex.<br />
<br />
The experience and rewards should come from the boss, and be worth it. If I spend 3 hours doing tipt, the boss shouldn't give the same experience as the crap I killed to get to him. For wasting a ton of time through the agonizing clearing of the zone and the trials to get there, wouldn't it be nice to get an AA from the boss in addition to loot and the satisfaction of flagging yet another cleric bot for Kod'Taz.<br />
Same goes for raid fights. It's fine and dandy to get the loot from the boss, but would it kill them to make say, some sort of reward for people who slogged through the same **** for the umpteenth time as the slightest condolance?<br />
<br />
I'd love to see more dynamic content designed for groups. Some of the stuff in Qinimi is kinda cool. Or more trial of execution style stuff (hard though it was at the beginning) which requires a balanced mix of healing, tankage, and other flexibility with multiple methods of solving the task besides MT/CH/DPS. And at the end, when the tank wipes the blood of his fallen foe in the grass, The victors will be that much more satisfied.</p>

	<p>PoP has seriously changed the way this game is played. Before PoP most content, even in raids, was endurance content.<br />
<br />
There was next to nothing (even few bosses) that simply walked all over you. What got people killed was running out of mana, multiple adds or overpulls or respawns catching up with you.<br />
I distinctly remember paladins healing just fine in Sebilis, even on the shrooms. The just went out of mana doing so. I remember taking my time with heals because everyone could take a couple rounds of melee.<br />
<br />
Fast forward to PoP. Just about anything is capable of killing you, fast. The first priority is not efficiency but survival. You die not because of mana mismanagement but from such things as slow resists on single pulls, a single MOB getting aggro on the cleric and the likes. Overpulls are "more then we can offroot / mez in 5 seconds".<br />
<br />
Before PoP a cleric was a better healer because he could keep the group alive with less mana and because he could deal better with adds / overpulls.<br />
<br />
After PoP a cleric is a better healer because he can deal with the damage of an unslowed MOB.<br />
<br />
That means that any class must have at least one "impact" capability that is useful for a single fight. Mana efficiency does not cut it - that is what you look at after you sorted out the classes that will not help you survive. Slow does not cut it, not when mitigated. Spending that much time means you should better lock down the MOB for good.<br />
<br />
The only shaman abilities I can think of that fit the bill are haste and VP. Druids have similar problems, having heals that barely fit this category. Clerics on the other hand have CH, excellent emergency heals, group CH, divine arbitration and DA. All of these can turn high intensity fights around.<br />
<br />
Now, you all knew this before - why is this important? It matters because prior to PoP emergency abilities were just that - for emergencies. Post PoP they are par for the course. Every MOB is an emergency. You do not time CH to be efficient, you start it ahead of time and hope it will land. You throw spot heals to barely keep up with the incoming damage, use tools like divine arbitration when it doesn't, use abilities like VP as much to circumvent the spell recast time as for the effect.<br />
<br />
That does not mean that this style of game is worse. It just means that classes need to be redesigned to have emergency abilities, abilities that can, by themselves, turn the fight around. Efficiency we can think about after that is done.</p>

Leave it to SOE to interpret that as wanting faster fights while having to flag your guild 6 players at a time.  Just one more example of them not listening or understanding what the players want.</p>

	<p>I think the first post was very well thought out and stated, although having a warrior, cleric, enchanter, shaman and 2 other chars in the "old days" was hardly class balanced (maybe that's why we are being punished!).<br />
<br />
I also agree with the poster that Clerics are currently balanced for healing and druids and shaman are pretty much ignored.  But, I am a proponent of a strong and viable cleric speciality class (including being the only possible primary healer in difficult content), so I think that's fine.  Just make sure that druids and shaman get enough strength in other areas to compete effectively for slots in groups and we are all gtg.  As I have stated many times, having a lot of clerics is good for the game and tuning them to be strong healers with rez is perfect for new content and perfect for raiding.<br />
<br />
But anyway, you know even though I agree with the first post on many levels, I think the game is immensely faster paced and more fun now.  Additionally, we do have LDON, which is a nice hybrid between the old style and GoD content and at least you get the illusion of moving around and exploring a bit.  Heck, even LDON hard these days isn't so tough after you have fought in vxed and tipt for a while, and it does use a few more skills to stay alive than the complete Zerg that normal is.<br />
<br />
But, its all about having fun, and I for one like the faster fights with higher risk and I applaud Sony for going to that content - even though they should have re-tuned the classes when they re-tuned content (cough cough). I also applaud them for the decreased travel and medding downtime. (And yes, this is from one of their customers who is so critical in certain issues like the racial penalities).<br />

	<!-- message -->
	<p>When I made Zorarian, it was just a few weeks after Kunark came out and I figured if I was going to change from wizard to shaman I might as well go all the way and go Iksar. Due to my schedule, I actually ended up leveling 1-58 all solo and reached 60 for Luclin. Back then, I had about 2 ways to solo: 1) Slow+tanking w/ pet or 2) Rotting. Likewise, in a group there were so many things I could do that it was nothing but spell swapping and casting. Memorizing my spellbook and mastering the /spellbook # really did impress my roommates.<br />
<br />
I look at the game now, and one of the reasons I quit was because nearly all of my versatility is gone. If I wanted to be a one trick poney I would have stayed with my wizard and a lot of that is because shaman require endurance type encounters: we suck at FPS gameplay. What I want most of all for my shaman is to have a set of options when I group. Being locked into a singular play style is neither fun nor addicting.<br />
<br />
The one thing I would add Grafsha is that slow does serves a purpose beyond neutering boss mobs. Sebilis was easier with a warrior, but even better with a warrior+slower. Likewise, knights could work in sebilis, but required a slower to make it worthwhile. This doesn't hold anymore where knight tanks are neither efficient and slow wont even save a warrior. Going back to early Everquest sensibilities would probably fix a lot of problems.<br />
<br />
