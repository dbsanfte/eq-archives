<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Benemyjosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I have a friend that has the three heads from Kael and I have the Frost Giant Overseer's Head.  Can the helm be MQ'd with me just have the one head?<br />
<br />
btw his faction is &quot;ally&quot; in PoG.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Legenial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I MQ'd the Helm of the Tracker with my own level 60 druid, and that worked fine. I -think- I had 2 heads on the druid and 2 on the ranger. I don't see how it would be any different for 3 vs 1. One thing to keep in mind is that the quest requires level 55 and I'm not sure if that restriction applies to the first half of an MQ as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">From what I've read on Allakhazam's, all people involved in the MQ of the heads for the Helm of the Tracker must be at least level 55.<br />
<br />
I'd gotten the Kael heads in my first Kael raid, and got the WL head shortly before dinging 55, however, so I dunno if what Allakhazam's posts said is true or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Amise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yup, both people involved in the MQ need to be 55+, or all the heads will get eaten and you won't get the helm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valedhel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Quick Q-how'd you get ally status in PoG? I've never killed a single PoG mob, and am amiable. Or is it because your friend's a druid?<br />
<br />
Never heard any way of raising PoG faction. . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>makrus quintius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">From what Ive seen and heard from a few Rangers and on websites,  you should be ok as long as you are both 55 or higher and of course no faction issues.<br />
<br />
gratz and good luck on the HoT!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Benemyjosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thank you all for the great information, I'm going to give it a try as soon as I Ding 55, hopefully this weekend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dranex Tical</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I did it with 2 people. I had the Overseer's head and one other, but the friend I did it with wanted to get some of the extra heads out of his bank.<br />
<br />
He handed in the first 3, then I handed in the Overseer's head and it worked great.</div></div><hr />
