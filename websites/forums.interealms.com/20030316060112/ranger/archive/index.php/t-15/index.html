Ahhh, City of Mist. One of my favorite zones to raid when I'm tired of high-end raids. Good place to have fun with the guild and some of our level 40-50's. <br />
<br />
Well, when we go up, we typically do the loop up to Neh'Ashiir and then back down. Now going this way you won't encounter as many black reavers, but it's significantly easier. There is another room to pull, for which you need at least 1 54+ monk. This room contains 4 black reavers and can be quite tricky to pull. IMO - Not worth the trouble. In the time you can pull, get wiped out, and get ressed you could have gone through the entire sky level. <br />
<br />
*****KEEP IN MIND - TIP#1 ******* <br />
Most spawns in CoM are 20 minutes, so no single step that you execute should take more than 20 minutes, or you get respawn. <br />
*****KEEP IN MIND - TIP#1 ******* <br />
<br />
Anyway, here's whatcha do: <br />
<br />
Group up, get everyone buffed, and run to the right side of the first Reaver house. If you look at a map of CoM, this house is all the way at the back of the zone. You could just as easily do the left side; we just do the right side out of tradition. <br />
<br />
Anyway, to get here, you go in from the zone, hang a right and then a quick left, and go through the courtyard area. Go to the back, hang another left and a right and you'll see a big mural on the wall ahead of 'ya. Hang a right here and you'll reach a large open area framed by some houses and facing a very large building with the CoM Star on the door. That's the goo house. <br />
<br />
*****KEEP IN MIND - TIP#2 ******* <br />
If you look upwards towards the zone wall from here, facing away from the goo house, you'll see a clear translucent ramp high up on the wall. You'll be up there later. Just make note of its location now, in case anyone falls down later on. <br />
*****KEEP IN MIND - TIP#2 ******* <br />
<br />
Anyway, proceed through this open area, weaving around the big brown house, past the red pagoda-looking building, and you'll come to an archway with a long hall and a few stairs. Set everyone up at the stairs. This is the first pull spot. This is also the only spot at which I allow pets on my raids. <br />
<br />
Clear the mobs in the area, and then go around the divider wall out to the gazebos. Pull the mobs back to your group. Now, what you need to have here is a Rogue with 200 lock pick skill and a 54+ puller. This puller can be a Paladin, Monk, Ranger, makes no difference. 54 seems to be the magical level at which you can single pull in CoM. <br />
<br />
Have the rogue approach the reaver house and quickly Sneak/Hide. He then picks the door open and you can pull the black reaver right out to the group. They should still be on the small set of stairs around the divider wall, casters in the back (at top of stairs) and melee classes in the front (at bottom of stairs). <br />
<br />
Kill the black reaver. These things hit in the 120's, have quite a few HP, and are completely MR except for wizzie lure spells. They also proc a Blindness spell. When you kill the reaver, it has a chance to either pop another black reaver, or Lord Ghiosk. Jade Reavers do NOT show up when the reaver has them. If you see a spear in the black reaver's hand, it's the Shimmering Partisan (Rare). <br />
<br />
Ghiosk is the same as the reavers, lots of HP, very MR, and he drops the Mace of Shadowed Souls (Common) and Throneblade of the Ykesha (Rare). <br />
<br />
Once the black reaver is dead, have the rogue pick the reaver house door and have the puller pull the other mobs in the first room of the house to your group. After that first room is clear, quickly have your puller go back in and look for a door on the back wall, right hand side. This is where your party needs to move to. <br />
<br />
Have anyone with a pet kill it. No more pets after this point. Get everyone together and move into that back right-hand door, and *QUICKLY* move down the hall to the right. If anything attacks, just pull it with the group until you reach the corner room, which is a little wider than the hallways. This is the second pull spot. <br />
<br />
The hallway you are in is basically shaped like a large &quot;U&quot; and goes around the back half of the city. There are 6 roamers that wander it, starting back near where you entered the hall, and going all the way up the ramp that you now see in front of you. Have your puller pull all the wanderers to your group for disposal. <br />
<br />
After these are clear, give your puller Levitate or DMF. He will head up the hall in front of the corner room until he sees a door at the end of the hall. Your puller should *NOT* open this door. I believe there are 8 or 9 mobs behind it with very bad pathing who will make your life miserable. <br />
<br />
Instead of opening the door, the puller should turn 90 degrees to his right and walk out through the (*hidden*) wall. He will now be on a translucent ramp of mist. On this ramp spawn about 2 or 3 goos. He should run all the way to the top of the ramp, aggroing all of them, and then float back down to the bottom and pull them to the group, careful not to outrun them. <br />
<br />
Once he's cleared the ramp, have him head up once again, and to the top of the ramp. At the top, there is a house. This is the start of the Sky level. There will be 2 or 3 mobs outside the house on the ledge. The puller aggroes these and pulls them down. <br />
<br />
Now, the path is clear. To be safe, in this case, I have everyone on the raid levitate. Everyone. Levitate or DMF. I walk them to the end of the hall, 1 group at a time, and have them move up the ramp SLOWLY, 1 at a time, not pushing each other off. Everyone should get inside the house once at the top so that they don't fall. There will be 2 or 3 mobs spawned inside the house. You could have pulled these previously, but I prefer to leave them up - (with the time it takes to levitate everyone and move them, you could run into respawn at the bottom). <br />
<br />
*****KEEP IN MIND - TIP#3 ******* <br />
Once everyone's at the top... wait, someone fell off? Well, if they did, you've got quite a job ahead of you. If there's a 55 Mage with CoH on the raid, you can summon them up. If not, you need to get the rogue and go all the way back out the first locked door and pick up the fallen member - they will have landed in that courtyard next to the goo house. You'll have to clear out respawns between your current location and the goo house as well (1st reaver house, gazebos, and stairway). <br />
<br />
Basically, make sure everyone goes slowly and carefully enough not to fall off. If they do, you're looking at another 20 minutes before you can move. <br />

posting this in 2 parts</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ven Dragnborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Anyway, once everyone is in the house, kill off the mobs in the first room. Have the puller go through the door, and into the next room. Pull the few spawns hanging out in there. Once the next room (with 2 sets of stairs) is clear, move everyone down the stairs to the next door. <br />
<br />
Open the last door, which leads outside, and there will be 2 goos wandering the next ledge. Pull them. Immediately move your group out onto the ledge and to the corner where the ramp takes a right-hand turn. <br />
<br />
Explain to everyone that no mobs should be knocked off the ledge and extreme care should be taken to see that this doesn't happen. <br />
<br />
Have the rogue move up to the next house, sneak/hide, and the puller pull the mobs from inside. There are 5 spawns in this house, easily pullable in batches of 2 or 3. Once this next house is clear, move everyone inside. <br />
<br />
At the top of the stairs is a raised platform. Have everyone sit down and get comfy, this is the fourth pull spot. <br />
<br />
The puller goes out the door opposite the one he came in, and pulls the 2 or 3 roamers out on the next ledge, careful not to fall through the chipped section of stone. After these are dead, he runs around the corner of the next ledge and pulls the mobs standing on the ledge outside the last house. <br />
<br />
*****KEEP IN MIND - TIP#4 ******* <br />
If the Wraith of Jaxxion is up, and an enchanter needs him for the epic quest, remind everyone *NOT* to kill the Wraith of Jaxxion. The chanter will charm him, hand in an item, and then break charm. You're now free to kill him  <br />
*****KEEP IN MIND - TIP#4 ******* <br />
<br />
The puller should move close to the door of the last reaver house. I mean real close, like 2 to 3 feet. Don't push right up against it; this has a chance to aggro the reaver. Anyway, getting close to the door will aggro the last mob(s) inside the house. Pull them to your group. <br />
<br />
*****KEEP IN MIND - TIP#5 ******* <br />
Have everyone buff up, and remind everyone numerous times *NOT* to attack Neh'Ashiir if she spawns. Neh'Ashiir does not spawn aggro. <br />
*****KEEP IN MIND - TIP#5 ******* <br />
<br />
Have the puller go back to the last reaver house, and follow the ledge around to the backside. This will aggro the reaver and pull it out of the house. Bring it to the group. <br />
<br />
The black reaver fight here is the same as before, except there is either a chance of another black reaver popping, or Neh'Ashiir. <br />
<br />
Once Neh'Ashiir spawns, you have 2 options: <br />
<br />
1) You just got lucky and only had 1 or 2 reavers, so kill Neh'Ashiir <br />
<br />
-OR- <br />
<br />
2) You just got unlucky and had 15 reavers pop, kill most of your people, and you need to res and med up. Do so now. Neh'Ashiir doesn't spawn aggro. <br />
<br />
Once you're ready to kill Neh'Ashiir... &quot;Wait!&quot; your shaman shouts. &quot;I need to do my epic!&quot; All he does is hand in an item, and he's finished. Be sure to ask any shamen if they are to this part of their epic yet, before killing Neh'Ashiir. <br />
<br />
Anyway, Neh'Ashiir is a tougher cookie than Lord Ghiosk. She Complete Heals, slows (Tepid Deeds), and Gravity Fluxes. Grav Flux is the reason you're fighting her inside the house. If you fought her outside, your party would be scattered all over Kunark after getting blown off the small ledge. <br />
<br />
Ideally, you fight her on the platform in the room. You must be careful not to push her towards either door, which she can go through and then you have to fight her outside. (Yuck). Make sure all tanks BASH or SLAM if they can. She usually runs out of mana after 3 Complete Heals if things come down to it. Neh'Ashiir drops the Ornate Runed Shield (Common), Woodsman Staff (Rare), and the mage torch for the mage epic (Very rare). <br />
<br />
After Neh' is dead, heal, med, buff, and res, and have EVERYONE levitate. Move the group outside near her old house. Get everyone up to the last big hole in the ledge before the house, and point out to the right of the house. Everyone should levitate down, aiming for the large iksar statue (which is the area where you fought your first black reaver). <br />
<br />
The first black reaver should be spawned again, so if enough people want to stay you can do the loop again, and again, and again until you're through. <br />
<br />
********************* <br />
Black Reavers without a rogue <br />
********************* <br />
<br />
Yes, there's a way to do CoM without a rogue, with a minimal force of people. However, you'll only get 1 reaver spawn, every 2 hours. <br />
<br />
What you do is get to the courtyard at the goo house, where you looked up before and saw the clear ramp. <br />
<br />
You will need a puller, and an enchanter/wizard. Have the puller position themselves below the ramp and a little bit away from it (West?) Have the caster cast Levitate on themselves, also. <br />
<br />
They should then duel the caster, and let the caster Gravity Flux them up onto the ramp. It takes a few tries to get the hang of it, but is *EXTREMELY* fun for the puller. Or, at least it was for me when I came up with this. Anyway, once the puller is up on the ramp, he can pull the two or three goos on it, and bring them back down to the party. Kill them. <br />
<br />
Grav flux up again. This time, the puller should go straight into the wall as opposed to up the ramp. Once through the hidden wall, he should hang a left and pull the roaming spawns he sees ahead of him. <br />
<br />
Grav flux up again. Pull the rest of the roamers, making sure to go to the end of the hall, and around the corner. There are 6 total. Kill them all off. The goal here is to provide a puller a clear path through to the back door of the first reaver house. <br />
<br />
Grav flux up again. Now the puller should go to the end of the hall again, around the corner, and see a door on his left. He should then go in the door, and stick to the wall like glue. Your puller will now be staring into the eyes of a black reaver. If 54+ as I recommended before, the puller can single pull the black reaver out of the room, down the long hall, out the hidden wall, and then fall down to the group. Kill the reaver. Tada! No rogue. <br />
<br />

(Credit goes to: Mianu Silverfang, my lovely wife, with whom I raided CoM extensively. Order of the White Dragon, for staying with us that last weekend when we finally got a reaver to drop. Brutusnight, the rogue who worked fiercely to get Lock Pick to 200 so he could come with us and open the doors. Vyce, the cleric who was with us the *entire* weekend, and kept me alive in many situations. Reannah, grav-fluxer extraordinare, for not just looking at me crazy when I thought GFlux pulling was a good idea.)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>BP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">you mention only 2 reaver spawns .. in fact there are 4 more.<br />
<br />
Behind the room where lord Ghiosk spawning reaver stands, there is a elevator. To use this elevator you need a rogue to pick it's lock. Once picked, it will move up to a room with 3 or 4 normal mobs and 4 reavers. Mobs do not aggro if  you stand on the elevator. So harmony and single pull them down. Once clear, pull the reaver standing above the stairs. When he is dead, you have 3 more reavers in the back room. Harmony pull will bring at least two, because they path very close to each other when leaving the room. Monk might be a better choice to pull them, possible combined with harmonizing rangers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyhoo, ya can still pull 1 out of 4 golems upstairs with just harmony.<br />
<br />
And if you have a skillful tagger and the ranger is willing to &quot;Feign Death&quot;, ya can pull the rest too. (That's how we did it back when I was hunting for my jade reaver. Took one death to break the spawn. I dragged 2 reavers down the elevator and let them kill me, one left, the rogue tagged the second one)</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is another room to pull, for which you need at least 1 54+ monk. This room contains 4 black reavers and can be quite tricky to pull. IMO - Not worth the trouble. In the time you can pull, get wiped out, and get ressed you could have gone through the entire sky level. <br />
<br />
Rangers or Druids are much better at pulling the 4-reaver room (or any other part of CoM) than monks.  With harmony, and the knowledge of what order to pull them, singles are a piece of cake.  No waiting for the monk to try and split 4 either.  Only time I'd ever have a monk pull CoM is if the chanters were bored :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rupreckt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I don't think you need harmony to get the reavers from the 4 reaver room. The night I got my jade reaver we did it with just a rogue, who pulled the whole night. She was only level 54 and had no problem getting the reavers solo. We also had no warriors with us. A decent mid to high 50s group can do this section of CoM IMHO. I spose what you need to be successful is more about working together than numbers though, as Reavers aren't terribly hard (except for the stupid blindness proc). Reavers are perhaps the most fun thing do do in Kunark, figuring it out is one of the big challenges.</div></div><hr />
