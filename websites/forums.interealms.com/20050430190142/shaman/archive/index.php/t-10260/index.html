<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've noticed something in the last couple of days that I've been playing Everquest.<br />
<br />
Whenever I get hit by something thats either a dark blue con or higher, instead of increasing my Defense skill it increases my offense.<br />
<br />
Now, everytime this has happened (it's happened about ten times now, with no Defense increases) I've checked to make sure that Auto attack isn't on....and everytime it hasn't been.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else notcied something similar to this? I know a lot of people won't as they will have already maxxed their defense/offense anyway.<br />
<br />
Help:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baldaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Did you Have a damage shield on during these times?<br />
<br />
Damage from a DS gives a chance of increasing the offense skill, if I remember my low level gimping correctly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ah right.....Yeah I did have a Damage shield on during that time....so that explains it...thanks mate:)</div></div><hr />
