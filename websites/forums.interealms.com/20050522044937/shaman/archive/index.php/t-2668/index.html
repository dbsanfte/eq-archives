<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gothlips</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can the emerald dragon scale be MQed for this BP?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">is the emerald dragon scale no drop?  <br />
<br />
Are the other two components no drop?  <br />
<br />
I don't think this quest would require any kind of MQing, just hand all the components to one person!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gothlips</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The breastplate isn't no drop, however I don't have a high chance of getting the scale myself (which is no drop, i believe). And I can't afford to buy the breastplate itself, but I could probably afford an MQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The scale is not no drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gothlips</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The scale is the rarest part...i can't see how you could possibly afford an MQ if you can't afford a BP.   Anyone with a scale would be better off making the BP themselves and selling it than handing it in with someone else handing in the breastplate.<br />
<br />
Guess i'm confused.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The scale is NOT NO DROP,  you don't need to MQ it.  Just buy the scale.<br />
<br />
And some guilds sell the scales for cheaper rather than bothering with doing the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>NewShaman1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You can buy the scale.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Yesferatu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">None of the stuff for the quest is no drop, occasionally, you'll see someone selling a scale for like 10k (on my server anyway).<br />
Buy it every time.  Get a blacksmith to make you a Fine Plate bp and get yourself a nice em bp.  Then sell it for 20k and wait for the next guy to sell the scale for 10k.<br />
<br />
You'll have that JBB in no time.<br />
<br />
Quest couldn't really be any easier.<br />
Anyone who doesn't buy the scale every time they see it should have their head examined.  It's at least 5k in profit every time you see it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>XmaX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yes the fungi tunic &gt; than a regen tunic but.... ummm a  fungi cost 50k on my server and i bought the dragon scale for 7k ... the bp itself only sellf for max 12k on my server so there is a huge difference in price and really i dont find a fungi is all that needed anyway i dont have one and i never run oom. just have to know how to control youre mana is all.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">but.... ummm, I didn't say fungi tunic &gt; regen tunic.  ;)<br />
In fact I did not say anything about the fungi tunic.<br />
<br />
I said regen tunic  &gt; neon green wisdom shirt.<br />
<br />
for example, the ceremonial iksar chestplate (a tunic with a regeneration effect) is a better option than the emerald dragonscale BP, in my opinion.  It should sell from 3-8k pp and is campable by a group of low 50s, high 40s.   I did not elaborate further because I thought it was possible she was talking about reselling as the previous poster said.   Or maybe it's a present for a friend!  Didn't ask if they thought it was a good idea, I just can't help but to stick my nose in others business.  ;)<br />
<br />
Also looking at this persons profile it doesn't look like they have a JBB either.  I certainly would buy a JBB before I would buy an EDST.   <br />
<br />
Thanks Henora for your unsolicited advice, now go away.<br />
sorry for OT.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well, in my case I'm wearing the neon shirt.  I could spend 5k on an Iksar regen chestplate, but cash is tight and I need resist gear, a back slot item, and legs, and can't justify it.  The green scale was a gift from my guild and the FS BP was cheap, and the 20 WIS has been very nice for tradeskills as well as mana pool.<br />
<br />
What I really want to do is camp the Iksar breastplate myself, but I tried several nights with no luck.  How rare is that spawn, anyway?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'd tell her to spend some time in Kael hunting giants.  She'll get some armor upgrades here.  Lord knows she needs it.  My only concern would be that she wouldn't survive many encounters with her AC/hps as low as they are.  I'd suggest avoiding aggro as much as possible with that setup.</div></div><hr />

Took me 3 days of camping about 8 hours per day before I saw the Crusader.   The crusader is rare in the cycle, but it seems pretty random.  Some people have seen 2 in a 6 hour camp.   <br />

<br />
Quit masquerading as a Druid. Yes I know it's your play style, but lordy - 630 AC?<br />
<br />
You are paste if and when you ever get aggro in certain zones.<br />
<br />
But to put your AC in perspective.<br />
<br />
My ENCHANTER has a higher AC than you.</div></div><hr />

I think I had that much AC when I was 30 and in Totemic. :p<br />
<br />
She's wearing Ulthork arms too because 3 wis is more important than the 10AC she'd get from JB... :(<br />

(pssst, velium fire opal rings)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">/agree Faern<br />
Though in a bit nicer terms :) <br />
<br />
It's odd, I've seen a lot of these type of magelo's lately. There's another Shaman from another board who is similar to this one but I don't say anything because, well, I just don't want to go there. She seems to think she's doing quite well, as does her guild, so who am I to judge. However she did post a rant wondering why all the &quot;level 30+ nOObs&quot; kept thinking she was a Druid. Personally, I think the Testament of Vaneer might have something to do with it ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Actually I'm more concern with the Othmir fur cap.  6 wis rings aint all that bad (cheap compared to velium opal), supple scale and book of obulus have focus effect.  But the othmir cap is just evil.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">*lip quiver*<br />
<br />
Killing the precious otters is just wrong! I'd leave my guild before I'd give up my Othmir faction!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">So what's the ED BP sell for these days? I got one cheap from a friend many moons ago. Any chance trading that for.....?<br />
<br />
EDIT: EQprices says 14,800 so if anyone on Xev wants one of these babies just slap a JBBracer in me trade window and ya'll be green before ya know it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Eww... didn't notice the hat. Someone should quest her a Totemic. Plate looks cooler to boot!<br />
<br />
I wasn't trying to pick on her either. If she can do what a shaman does dressed like that, more power to her! I want to know her super anti-aggro secrets because I'm ALWAYS getting punched in the face (Beeg has less teeth than my Granny).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>monotikitia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Forget the shiny green tunic.  Get more AC.<br />
<br />
I'm level 35, in far from uber gear, and my &quot;wis gear&quot; AC is over 700.  In AC gear I'm approaching 750.  Pick up a few JBB pieces.</div></div><hr />

Self buffed I'm breakin 900 at 53 and my gear has some SERIOUS flaws in it (ears, hands, arms, feet) which are easily upgradable for me while maintaing a 173 wis base.  Jb is CHEAP (you can get the hat alone for like 4-500, arms for 800, feet for.. well ok I got the feet for every jerk who wants me to buff AGI) gloves and arms make a nice pet helper too (though I'd guess this is psychosomatic for me)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Heh, I think you have the wrong magelo link there, I went to some druid's equipment. ;P<br />
<br />
Sorry, couldn't help it.<br />
<br />
And I'm with Glori, how can you support the killing of innocent otters?!  I'm allied with 'em ;) (death to all ulthorks and bulthorks!)  If they'd only give me a decent gem for those tusks and trunks...<br />
<br />
Self buffed AC 978 here, working on the 1k mark.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I posted no rant, I posted a question, the other folks started the rant =). <br />
<br />
And I rarely get agro, I'm very effecient at root and rot and strategically using my pet. =) But I do highly agree that I need more AC.</div></div><hr />

Reading what Azzikai said, I think he meant the shaman on the other board he reads posted the rant rather than you :)</div></div><hr />
