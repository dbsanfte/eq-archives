<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
Was hoping someone might be able to help me, after downloading the new Nvidia drivers I now get a little pop up box with an error message everytime I boot up my PC. <br />
<br />
It does not effect games in anyway I know of but wondering why I am getting this message.  I also downloaded from the homepage and also downloaded 3 times but nothing, I also get a message when I downloaded a couple of times that file (see below) could not be found.<br />
<br />
Here is the the Error message.<br />
<br />
Error in NvQTwK<br />
Missing Entry:NvCpIDaemon<br />
<br />
So anyone know what this is or how I can fix it?<br />
<br />
Specs are:<br />
98se<br />
512m<br />
1.33 AMD<br />
Geforce 2 64m<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Did you delete the old drivers/adapter before you installed the new ones?<br />
<br />
I had a problem with the drivers when I installed over the top of my old version. Deleting them re-booting the PC and re-installing them fixed it for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No I havent Hal, how would I go about doing that? Dont know much about computers. :confused: <br />
<br />
If you can guide me it would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Right I've not used Win 98 for a while but I've found this in an old install readme.txt<br />
<br />
Windows 98<br />
----------<br />
<br />
To prepare for installation of the drivers<br />
<br />
1 Start Microsoft Windows 98.<br />
<br />
2 Click the Start button, point to Settings, and click Control Panel.<br />
<br />
3 Double-click Display, and click the Settings tab.<br />
<br />
4 Click Advanced, click the Adapter tab, then click Change.<br />
<br />
5 Click Next, click Display a list of all the drivers in a specific  location, so   you can select the driver you want, then click Next.<br />
<br />
6 Select Show all Hardware button, then select the Standard display types from the Manufacturers list.<br />
<br />
7 Select Standard PCI Graphics Adapter (VGA) from the list, then select Next.<br />
<br />
8 Click Next to install the driver, then click Finish. <br />
<br />
9 Click Apply, then click Close.<br />
<br />
10 Click Yes when Windows asks if you wish to restart the computer.  <br />
<br />
This will restart you computer using the basic Windows VGA driver in 640 by 480. You then go to the directory with the new nvidia install set and run it to install the latest drivers.<br />
<br />
You can also use a program that will automatically remove the detonator drivers. you can find it here at www.guru3d.com (http://www.guru3d.com) then click on detonator-destroyer on the left hand side. I've never used it but it is supposed to be very good. You should check it out first as it seems to automatically remove the drivers without any hassle.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps Scurg<br />
<br />
if not post another message and I'll see what I can do :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">too much work for a simple problem. The last few versions of the nvidia drivers have included &quot;nview&quot; which is for virtual desktops.   There is a control panel icon that controls this feature.  All you have to do is run msconfig and uncheck the &quot;nvqtwk&quot; line in the startup tab.  While you are there see what other stuff is running on boot, you might be surprised.</div></div><hr />
