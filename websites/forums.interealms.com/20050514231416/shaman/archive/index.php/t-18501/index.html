<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seveca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does your Intricate Wooden Figurine still gain stats for each plane flag you get?  Since some of the lower tier planes have been given a level requirement OR flag, does it still gain stats for those planes also?  I know I am not explaining this very well, so let me give you my situation:<br />
<br />
I am a lvl 57 with NO flags currently.  Due to my level, I am capable of entering old world planes and lower tier planes, such as Plane of Valor, Plane of Innovation, etc.  BUT, can I get flagged for Plane of Justice, Nightmare, Disease etc. and get stats on my Intricate Wooden Figurine, even though I am capable of entering due to my level?  I was out of the game for a while, and this planar stuff is still a little new to me.<br />
<br />
Or maybe I am wrong about the whole thing.  Someone set me straight please.</div></div><hr />

The tier 1 planes (nightmare, disease, justice, innovation) don't have flags so you can't add to your charm. With a couple of exceptions (PoNb for one?), every plane you need a flag for will give you an upgrade if you get that flag, even if you're high enough lvl to enter that zone without the flag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">you get aa's/ upgrades from access to new full planes i belive, it valor/storms (through trials that is) bot, etc etc (tactics has 2 ways in only one upgrade i belive)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You get an upgrade for every flag your character receives. It doesn't matter that some of the zones were opened up to certain levels. If you get the flag for that zone, you get an increase in your charm stats. This includes access to the Plane of Time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You get upgrades for passing the justice trials (storms/valor access), killing Behometh (tactics access), killing Grummus (Decay access), Terris Thule (Torment Access), AD (Halls of Honor access), and the Bastion of Thunder key quest done in storms.  Basically the rule is if you get access to a new zone you get a charm upgrade with the exceptions of b zones like ponb, hohb, etc.  There are also upgrades for sol ro access, elemental zones and time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not exactly. There are a lot of flags that don't give AA or Charm increases.<br />
<br />
You get upgrades when you are flagged for access to the following zones:<br />
<br />
1)Valor/Storms (Any justice trial)<br />
2)Torment (Killing Terris Thule, or the alternate quest)<br />
3)Access to BoT (Doing the storms collection quest for Askr)<br />
4)Access to Tactics (Killing behemoth, or doing storms diaku quest)<br />
5)Access to Halls of Honor (Killing Aerin`Dar or the box of souls quest)<br />
6)Access to SolRo Tower (Need lots of stuff for this, and they need to be done the &quot;real&quot; way, alternate access won't do it)<br />
7)Elemental Access (Killing Rallos Zek)<br />
8)Time Access (Killing Fennin Ro, Rathe Council, Xegony, Coirnav)<br />
<br />
The rules for getting the bonus AA point are, IIRC, slightly different, but basically follow the same pattern.<br />
<br />
Also have the nagging feeling like I'm missing one there. Wierd.</div></div><hr />

Killing Grummus and getting access to crypt of decay.  Also, since your primary stat (mana for us) goes up 10 at a time for a grand total of 100, I think there is a 10th flag.  It might be PoNB (completing hedge quest) but I am not sure.</div></div><hr />

I'm only Sol Ro flagged for now so I'm not certain but I would think after killing RZ you'd get a charm upgrade for earth, water, and air and then maybe another upgrade for killing Sol Ro and getting fire flagged?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Can confirm of personal (and recent) knowledge that PoNB access, via Hedge trial, does NOT affect your charm.  <br />
<br />
The Hedge trial in PoN and the factory access trial in PoI (Xanamech) give you character flags and access to another area, but do not count as access to a new Plane.  In effect they are sub-quests en route to the next Plane.<br />
<br />
I was hoping, so I went and hailed the dwarf in PoK after each of those runs - even unlocked memories, just in case!  He was polite, but no change in charm, no AA ding.<br />
<br />
<br />
Doing the quests in PoS for Tactics access and for BoT access did get me flags, and I got an AA dings and charm upgrades when I talked to the dwarf.  <br />
<br />
so - there is my 2 cp</div></div><hr />

There are 10 of them. He missed cypt of decay (kill grummus). I am pretty sure sol ro tower is not one of them, but bertox/mm replace that one in the list. (1 upgrade each).<br />
<br />
Also you can be poFire flagged w/o the other elementals, and you can get the other elementals w/o poFire. (agnarr needed for other elementals, sol ro neded for pofire). And I *believe* once you get ALL elementals, then your charm goes up.</div></div><hr />

Don't think so. Aa's and charms always based on access to the zones which is why the alternate quests work. Bert will give you access to torment if you don't have a terris kill already so it's possible you got a bump/aa from that but then you wouldn't get one from terris. Sol Ro tower is definitely one of them. I'm pretty sure that elementals is just one altho it could be 2, one for earth/water/air and one for fire. I'm a little foggy on theses since I was already elementally flagged when they where added. There are definitely 10 tho since with everything but time I'm at 90% on my charm or 9 outta 10 bumps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Oddloots</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm pretty sure that this is how it works. When you gain flag access to any of the following zone sets, you get a charm boost and an AA. <br />
<br />
 1 Plane of Valor/Storms <br />
 2 Crypt of Decay <br />
 3 Plane of Torment <br />
 4 Bastion of Thunder <br />
 5 Halls of Honor <br />
 6 Plane of Tactics <br />
 7 Tower of SolRo <br />
 8 Plane of Earth / Air / Water <br />
 9 Plane of Fire <br />
10 Plane of Time<br />
<br />
I'm positive about the first 6, 99% sure about the last 4.</div></div><hr />

Same thing for me.  Nice to know I'm not the only person that was hoping.  :)</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure this is correct for upgrades, AA is given for the first 7 on the list.</div></div><hr />
