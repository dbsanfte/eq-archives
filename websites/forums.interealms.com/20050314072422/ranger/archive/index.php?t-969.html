<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kahla</div><div class="date">04-09-2002, 12:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm curious as to whats the most TIME efficent method to get to the second floor of hate.  My guild has only in the last month really started to handle Hate as a fairly routine place to raid.  Once we have broken in usually its a walk in the park.  <br />
<br />
However it takes us a good bit of time to clear first floor and this means unless we have many hours to stay in hate we can't seem to work our way up to the second floor.  Now the second floor is where all the ranger apeal is since we have about 4 soon to be 5 Swiftwind wield rangers and no Hate stones, not only that we all wouldn't mind snagging a couple pieces of untamed.<br />
<br />
So is there a website with any maps and strategy for how to get to the second floor in a safe and time efficent maner.  <br />
<br />
Any advice would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Thats where I got mine.  As for time, I've never gotten to the second floor in under 5 hours from break in.</div></div><hr />

Most of the mini's spawn on the first floor, but a couple will pop up on the second floor in the large room by the stair way up. All of the mobs in that area are still first floor mobs. The second floor proper mobs do not drop stones ever... just armor very, very rarely.<br />
<br />
I have seen some wacky agro from the rev house from going up to second floor with out killing all of them first, but most of the rest didn't seem to bad to me. I think you can pretty much head up to second floor as soon as a path is clear.... but I would avoid using aoe's up there. =)<br />
<br />
if you are tring to equip up your rangers/palys/druids, if you are +coldain then do kael, you will equip everyone much, much faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eowen</div><div class="date">04-09-2002, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We got to the second floor the other night in about two hours.  It was some fast pulling though.  We had five nearly full groups which is a LOT of people but thankfully, clerics were not in short supply.  We even had a pull of four spite golems and managed to take then all down and only the puller died.  I don't know if there is any &quot;hard and fast&quot; method to get to the 2nd floor, but I suspect it'd be best to start from the SWC and just pull toward the ramp going up.  Once we got up there and cut through the old Inno house, we were pretty safe as the aggro range on mobs up there is really whacky.</div></div><hr />

We got bored with doing first floor so we desided to try for armor. 60 mini bosses and no stupid stone grr.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarmor</div><div class="date">04-09-2002, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If your goal is to hit Hate second the fastest way is the following:<br />
<br />
A) Break in from SW safe spot.  Hardest part is if you have a rat in the gate house, you will need to dispatch it and re-inviso for the run.  If you have no characters under 59 (58 really) then you are safe to run high on the wall without the south patrol route agroing on you.<br />
<br />
B) From the SW safe spot, clear the kira and any vissible banshee.<br />
<br />
C) Have your monk FD at the North tag point and have your rouge scout the path to Mastero.  Set up your standard Warrior/Ranger tag team.  From there on it's just standard monk pulling a pile while the ranger Harmonies the stack and the warrior tags singles.  Normally you want to re-harmony the pile on each FD to make sure things are always sans assist radius.<br />
<br />
D) Chain Pull everything up to the front of Mastero's place, then clear the revs on the other side of the ramp.  Pull a small pocket out of the Mastero chapel.<br />
<br />
E) Pull up the ramp and wack any extra ashenbones that are sitting there as well as any minis in the old Inny spot.<br />
<br />
F) Move the group up (inviso/non-inviso it doesn't honestly matter) and park up around the corner from the ramp. <br />
<br />
You won't get first floor adds from here and you can easily work your way around second without agro from first.<br />
<br />
Normally a straight shot to second takes about 20min if people know what they are doing and you have good numbers.  With five groups practically don't even need to worry about tagging singles, but it does help to spread things out a little.  The reason you want to be quick is so your roamers don't respawn (roamers == wasted time)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">myusedone</div><div class="date">04-09-2002, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe bring a group of AE types (wizzies druids) get about 3 chanters, and some clerics eheh and have a monk pull the ENTIRE floor put tanks on spite golems with sepret celrics for them , and whula hole floor done in a matter of hours :P just a thought.. hehe<br />
 and trust me ae groups are INSANE in guild INSANE!!! my guild reciently pulled those snarks that spawn in royals , hadda been like 20 - 30 of them durn summoning mobs lol all dead sept one gated , and brought Another train of skelies that spawn in that pit :)  we died lol was INSANE as for the mobs for us to kill as tanks take ALOT longer then them ae's eheh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tilianAran</div><div class="date">04-09-2002, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you have the correct classes and levels, the bottom floor can be cleared in under 30 mins from port up.  <br />
<br />
Your break in point is the zone in, you will need at least 1 or 2 wizards in every group and minimum of 3 good chanters, a bunch of mages with there pboe works well too.  Good conection is essential as it can quickly get laggy up there in the restricted area of the break in.<br />
<br />
Just port up the groups spacing them out in 10 second intervals.  Then just pull trains to the masses and aoe them sticking warrios rangers and pallies on the unstunable mobs.<br />
<br />
A shamen with aow slow helps as well, though more then often just gets them killed :P.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sasandra</div><div class="date">04-09-2002, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the one thing that that used to be an issue, not sure if it still is was if you didn't kill all the clerics on the first floor they would CH the mobs on the 2nd floor thru the ceiling, that would be one thing to take into consideration when skiping thru most of the 1st floor to go to the 2nd fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rounlin Starwolf</div><div class="date">04-09-2002, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">easiest way upstairs is tp pull to organ house and then just pull ya way up the ramp:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Simas</div><div class="date">04-09-2002, 03:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah i guess theres not really a trick, just kill the mobs that are in your way, and kill them as fast as possible.  <br />
<br />
We did 2nd floor a little while back (pick up raid) and went to &quot;the flats&quot;  i dunno why the hell they called it that, but it was on west wall....close to the chapel.....we had about 5 groups, puller was a warrior and he just brought whatever, 5 mobs at a time and such with multiple golems, or drakes, or clerics....we had alot of people though and normally only a cleric, and the puller would die. Seems like one cleric always died.<br />
<br />
Then we moved to the ramp, killed a couple wanderers there and went up.<br />
<br />
No armor, full mini pop no stone (another guild was doing 1st floor and let us take 2nd)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taewedar</div><div class="date">04-09-2002, 05:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've never tried aoeing there, figured you would get wonky agro from 2nd floor. Usually we can clear a path to 2nd floor, including wiping out most mini's bosses in under 3 hours. Then another 2-3 to get to Inny killing as we go. It could be done faster but folks have a bad habit of getting lazy in hate :)<br />
<br />
A ballsy rogue and ballsy coth mage could make it faster, but I don't know any crazy enough to  volunteer to try it yet :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanien</div><div class="date">07-15-2002, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You do have to be careful where you pull upstairs.... the downstairs clerics will CH the mobs you're fighting.<br />
<br />
We usually go to the trouble to clear out all the clerics on the first floor before we head up.<br />
<br />
That being said, either they upped the drop rates on Untamed or I got VERY lucky on my first trip.   BP, Legs, and a bracer dropped, and we only cleared about 2/3 of the agents before we had to go.<br />
