<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>fethanin-eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I did search but nothing came up really.<br />
<br />
Will i be able to solo gaurd cmap in seb at lvl 60 with torpor and pox+ horse. no epic/jbb/fungi/malo.<br />
<br />
I want to know as I will be soloing it for money, so i can get the jbb, and i only have hole and 2 fights in CoM for epic, so i might have that by the time i get to camping guard<br />
<br />
Any suggestions on if i should, and how to solo it will be good :)<br />
( eg. splitting the bugs at start of guard?)<br />
<br />
thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Beranor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You should be able to solo this camp without too much trouble.  PoG might be better for money however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>fethanin-eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">k, thanks for the info :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's not hard to solo there but at least on my server that camp is taken almost 24/7. At 60 you will get 2 bugs often but they are easy to root. Your biggest worry is a krup chanter or wizzy roamer coming by at a bad time.<br />
<br />
With that said I highly recommend PoG for easy money. I've made 15k there in the last week. With KEI and horse it's so easy even without epic. 4 BoNs + 61 alpha pet kill most of the following mobs: gale wolves, spiritflux wolves, sanguine kodiaks, rolling planes steeds(whites are a bit longer fight), glade stalkers. The spawns there are 8 hours so it can empty at times but usually there's enough for me to kill. Avoid spirit stalkers, cullers, wisps and the tranquil treant. Also be sure to read Urdegish's excellent PoG guide at the 60-65 hunting forum.</div></div><hr />
