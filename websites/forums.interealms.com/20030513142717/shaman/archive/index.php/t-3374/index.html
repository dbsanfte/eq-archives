<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First off, I'm a level 44 shaman and I have a lot of my epic finished already. So far I'm at the part where I gotta get a raid going for the hole to kill Kirn.<br />
<br />
My question is this. By the time I get to 46 or 47, if I'm lucky, I may be able to complete my epic. But what I'm wondering is, when I do the final hand in will it work at 46/47, or do I have to be level 50+? I'd sure like to know before hand so I don't screw up and end up doing parts over again :(<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for the advice :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Syrellian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It will work, but so far as I know, you just won't be able to use the right clickable effect (I think it's level 49, but I'm not positive on that).  Anyhow, good luck with the epic my friend :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok. Gonna try it when I get well into 46 or 47. would hate to go to PoF at 46 and die, come back a 45 :( lol<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No level restriction to get the epic.  It has been done by MQ by a level 20 shaman or somesuch.  However, the DoT won't work until 51 I believe.  Epics were designed to be, well, EPIC.  The effects don't work until you are high enough.<br />
