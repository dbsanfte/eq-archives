<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I play on Luclin. I think I have seen a total of 4 63 - 64 spells ever in bazaar and once a couple weeks back someone was selling malos for 150k or something stupid.<br />
<br />
Are other servers seeing these spells in bazaar yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've seen Malos for 190k and Quesi..whatever for 185k on my server. Insane prices indeed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Smellious Oderous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Malos 100k on Nameless in Bazaar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Journy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yup, a few of the spells on Quellious. But at the prices people are currently wanting for them, I'll gladly retire before I pay 180k for ANY spell :)<br />
<br />
And hi Buma, I gotta say hi next time I see you on.......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">But what about 63 - 64 spells? Where are they ?!?!?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">250k for malos!!!<br />
<br />
bwhahahaha<br />
<br />
The first batch of shaman on every server to start getting dupes of the 65 spells are going to be very very wealthy. Some jackass always seems to buy shaman spells for inflated prices.<br />
<br />
I have seen some 63-64 spells on xev. Got talisman of the boar for 5k, and Breath of Ultor for 2k ( think he meant to sell it for 20k lol ) , and the 63 rain spell for 3k. <br />
<br />
on average tho, seems like people are trying to sell them for 10-15k. 'Course it was like that with 61-62 spells at first also. Just hang tight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Journy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Best place for spec parchments is tier 3 zones. You can find them in tier one and two, but usually in the hardest camps or off the named in said zones.<br />
<br />
Such as the Goblin caves in Nightmare as an example. But if you are really looking to &quot;loot&quot; all of the spec parchments you'll need, you are gonna have to get to tier 3 to have a realistic shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">... seen alot of spectrals in tactics (Tier 2)...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Marxxus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Got Malos (yes the 65 one) for 50k in Lanys...someone did not know what they had, or they were being really nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jedani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Got Blood of Saryrn for 50k off a merchant and got Quiescence for 60k -the guy was only selling it for 40k  in ooc in the bazaar,but i had to out bid the person he had agreed to sell it to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Talendar Frostmist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Plane of Tactics is not really Tier 2....I thought it was Tier 3 really because the Plane of Innovation is Teir 1, the Factory is Tier 2...PoT thus Tier 3.<br />
<br />
They nerfed the drop rate of spectrals in the Arena in PoT as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Guntar Ghostdancer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">BoT (Tier 3) spectrals have definately been nerfed. Seen 1 of random mob, all others off named. Seen a ton of ethereals of regualr mobs in BoT</div></div><hr />
