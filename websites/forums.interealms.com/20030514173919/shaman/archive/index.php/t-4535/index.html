Chapter I<br />
<br />
He was a beggar.<br />
But a strong beggar, to say the least. <br />
His name was Bob Insipid, a wanderer of homeless variety. <br />
He had fashioned a sword from a discarded lead pipe, wrapped one end with an old bloody bandage, and was quite used to killing things with it… namely plants and the occasion small shrubbery. Bob considered himself very dangerous, but often found small woodland creatures to be quite the foe. <br />
One day, on his travels, Bob came across an injured halfling. He took the small thing, nursed it back to health, and after offering it great sums of money, fame and fortune, convinced him to be his companion. The Halfling’s name was Koontz, and he too had a weapon of mass destruction... <br />
Koontz had been quite the intellectual, so smart in fact he dropped out of High School when they told him he was a “smart ass.” He took this as a compliment, because even his ass was smarter than everyone else’s was! Koontz later found out these were actually insults, along with about 94.6% of all the other things people had ever said to him. Seeking a bloody revenge, Koontz went about conducting freakish experiments and combining different components and testing them on live subjects (usually some moss, he didn’t have the heart to hurt anything else). After years (hours) of laborious research and painstaking experiments, he didn’t find a weapon he found suitable for his act of reprisal. But, completely by accident of course, a large wooden stick fell from his lab table and was coated with a strange substance he had collected from a nearby river. Once the stick was coated with this clear liquid and it dried, he held up his weapon, and proclaimed to the world he would have his revenge with the stick coated with the clear fish fluid!<br />
 So the two had decided to join efforts, Koontz to get revenge on his lazy coffee drinking High School teachers, and Bob, well, because he was homeless and didn’t like begging for change so he could go lose it somewhere eventually (basically beer). <br />
The two of them traveled together, holy staff and mighty sword thingy in hand, and went about ridding the land of the chains of captivity, so the whole world could take part in what these two already had; freedom! (Along with freedom they had meager wages, constant sickness, tiredness, hunger and thirst, and that annoying green stuff you get around your eyes when you wake up, but damn it, they were happy!)<br />
Or so they thought…<br />
<br />
The burly pub owner easily tossed Koontz outside along with his holy staff, but he had some trouble with Bob. Bob bit and kicked like a girl (proof of his grand warrior training), and on top of all that, he scratched like a mutha!<br />
Finally tossing Bob over the “welcome” mat (which had NOT held up to its name) the restaurant owner slapped his hands together a few times, and stepped back inside. Bob stood; rage in his blue and brown eyes, and shook his deadly weapon at the door. His cardboard armor rustled on his chest as his sock bracer (only had one) slid up and down his arm. Bob’s one sandal and athletic shoe (about four sizes too big) made him look even poorer. <br />
He waved his fist angrily at the pub. <br />
“I will be back you just wait – once I free this land of the chains of slavery you will beg me to come in and eat just so you can sit around a poker table someday and say: “Yah Bob Insipid ate here, I made his burger!” But I won’t come back to your filthy restaurant any day!”<br />
Koontz tugged at Bob’s filthy shorts. <br />
“The guys been gone like three minutes man, and people are staring.”<br />
It was true; about thirty people had gathered around Bob and were staring at him. Quickly noticing them, Bob spun around and waved an accusing finger at each and everyone of them, and Koontz, embarrassed out of his brain, sort of stepped behind the crowds casually and stared at Bob like one of the spectators. <br />
“I will one day save you all!” Bob shouted with a bellow. “I will save this land from the chains of slavery and give you all what all humans deserve, freedom!”<br />
A young lady shook her head. “What are you talking about you moron? Were all free and allowed to do whatever the hell we want!”<br />
“Like beat up old homeless guys who shout!” someone yelled. <br />
They all agreed that was the logical thing to do. <br />
So they picked Bob up and began to march away with him when Bob began to shout, “Koontz! Help me, my loyal comrade!” Koontz was actually in the process of helping carry Bob off, but all eyes were on him like a traitor. He stopped chanting with them and held his fist in the air, motionless. <br />
The angry mob turned and stared at Koontz with evil eyes. <br />
“Get the pig human! He knows the homeless guy!”<br />
Despite Koontz valiant effort to fight back (mostly kicking and scratching, a little whining) they subdued him, and the crowd carried the two of them off to the outskirts of the city. Suddenly, the mob was carrying torches and pitchforks, and dropped Bob and Koontz in the middle of a field. <br />
“Never come back!” the young woman shouted. <br />
“You're stinking up the whole town!”<br />
Koontz rushed up to them with watering eyes. “I don’t know him, I swear, he's just some mean old man who took me hostage and brainwashed me! I'm actually a robot built by his mad-scientist father to do his evil bidding, but I valiantly resisted and here I am now, finally able to get away from him!”<br />
The crowd was silent at Koontz’s tale. <br />
“What are you talking about,” Bob said, standing. “We've known each other for years!” (He meant weeks)<br />
“MORON!” Koontz shouted, “I was almost out of here alive!”<br />
They were suddenly angry and rushed the two of them. <br />
The angry mob stole everything the two of them had…<br />
The spoils included a sock, and an old green sandal. <br />
Convinced they were rid of the two annoyances, the angry mob headed home hungry and poor. They had wasted torches in the attack, and scratched a few pitchforks, and had only a sock and an old green sandal to show for it. But they had, however, gotten rid of Bob Insipid and Koontz, and they were damn well happy for that! <br />
<br />
Bob and Koontz, taking the subtle hint that the town didn’t appreciate their company, decided to walk to the next town in search of those who needed help. Along the way Bob managed to find an old ample trash receptacle (also known as a Dumpster) and he was able to restock the sandal and sock he had lost in the raid. <br />
