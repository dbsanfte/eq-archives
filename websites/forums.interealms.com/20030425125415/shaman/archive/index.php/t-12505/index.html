<br />
What would you upgrade, considering my magelo listed below.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">artificer/barbed ring mail bracer<br />
or<br />
barbed ringmail<br />
or<br />
save a little more and get an ODS<br />
and<br />
buy a black sapphire electrum earring, they're only a couple hundred pp, and replace that imbued thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Basically I would just go to the bazaar and do searches on each slot for hp.  Your wisdom is overly nice already so you could stand to lose some of it for more hp.<br />
<br />
Here are a couple of specific suggestions:<br />
<br />
For next to no cost I would replace your Imbued Ivory golden earring with a black sapphire electrum earring, gaining 35hp and losing almost no mana.<br />
<br />
The shoulders strike me as weak, and would probably look for dragonwing mantles, might find a good deal on one, the +45hp ones and lower are usually fairly cheap.<br />
<br />
You could get a better BP for fairly cheap, I still use (/ugh) a Polished Tin Mail shirt but it has suited me fine, would give you 5 more wis but more importantly 25hp and 7sta.  Optionally you could save a little more money and upgrade to a Tae Ew BP (running around 10k I think) which would give you even more hp and a lot more ac.<br />
<br />
Replacing those 3 slots (weakest on you in my opionion) with my suggestions would run about 6k on Prexus and would get you around 125 more hp, about 10 more ac and a little less mana but you are hardly hurting there imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What would you buy?<br />
<br />
Hmm lets see, I'd be looking at bracers, shoulders and ear I think.<br />
<br />
Barbed Rubicite Bracer (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=27862)  would be nice but seem to be more uncommon since CT went green to the majority of higher levels, got mine for 5k pre-pop. I did notice a Bracelet of the Spiritcharmer (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=40312)  in bazaar for 1.5k just now, not bad. Keep an eye out for cultural as theyre a good investment, not sure if the Trib stuff is going in your price range on BB but most culturals gotten cheaper since blue diamonds become more common with PoP.<br />
<br />
Shoulders, Elder Wolf Hides (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=3396)  seem cheap now, around the 1k mark. Dragonwing (http://lucy.fnord.net/itemlist.html?searchtext=dragonwing) mantles are nice but you don't seem to see the better quality ones too often.<br />
<br />
Ears, Earrings of Purity (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=5814) /Cleansing (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=5815)  seem to have gone up again recently to around the 4k mark, probably the green effect on chardok, Earrings of Twisted Leaves  (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=5813)  holding firm at around 2k, probably becuase they don't drop so deep in.<br />
<br />
Spotted an Abalone Ear Stud (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=40109)  for just under 2k, stats arent bad but not as many HP as the Chardok stuff.<br />
<br />
The rate at which Skull Charms (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=5597)  are cheapening on BB you may be able to get one under 6k in the coming months, havent noticed many Silver Hammers (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=5596)  recently but I suspect theyre in your price range too.<br />
<br />
If you're worried about mana at the expense of a little HP then Shadel Bandit Rings (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=28708)  are cheaper than ever now with lots under 2k, probably due to an influx of Circled Toe Bones (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=10236) .</div></div><hr />
