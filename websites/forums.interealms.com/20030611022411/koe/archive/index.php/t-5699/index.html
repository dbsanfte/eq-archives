<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Redtree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well im stumped i can usally fix most things but here is my problem...<br />
<br />
OS = Windows ME<br />
<br />
system<br />
<br />
Pen III Athlan (msp) 950mhz<br />
<br />
640 ram<br />
<br />
TNT 2 vid card<br />
<br />
Eq runs ok......<br />
<br />
here the problem... Im locking up all the time surfing the net..<br />
<br />
I found one Java based virus and cleaned it...<br />
<br />
but the problem is still occuring.<br />
<br />
It also locks when im editing large picture files.<br />
<br />
<br />
anyone know what this is??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Windigo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I had this problem on a computer at work -- only the internet problem though, so I downloaded Netscape 6 instead of IE and it seemed to fix it pretty well.  Don't know if that will work with the picture files though.  Some might say that Windows doesn't handle any memory above 512 mb well, but I have 640 mb in my ME machine with Athlon processor and I can surf forever and edit anything I want in Photoshop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Are you getting a complete hard lock or just IE freezes?<br />
<br />
If you did get a virus you may have some corruption in IE, if you aren't on IE6 its a good time to upgrade and hopefully it will fix the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Redtree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Complete lock down .... Crl + Alt +Del wont even work....Till i hit it like 8 times to reboot.<br />
<br />
Loaded IE 6 already problem still occurring.<br />
<br />
Weird thing is this has never happened before. (with net)<br />
<br />
When i work on huge Picture files i get booted often?<br />
<br />
:D :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Recent video driver update?  If not what driver version are you running?<br />
<br />
A complete hard lock like that sounds hardware related.  Perhaps an IRQ conflict or something else that is affecting the video card.<br />
<br />
If it continues, remove all non essential cards from your system just leaving the video card and modem/NIC to access the net.  See what that does.  If its ok then start adding cards back in one by one while testing in between.  Make sure you put the cards back in the slots they were in before.  Slots used on most motherboards affect the IRQ used.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>rooknight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What was the name of the virus?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Redtree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The virus came up  with no name<br />
<br />
<br />
It was found in some java script...<br />
<br />
i thought that was it.<br />
<br />
Driver on card is the latest off the EQ site. ((about 2 months old))<br />
Basically only have like 3 new skins on the rest off to stop crappy lag.<br />
<br />
So video card could cause this.  Ive been looking for an excuse to get a new video card</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sounds to me like you have either a corrupted vid driver file ( which I doubt, or I am sure you would have had EQ issues by now ) or a corrupt .DLL file that is only being called while running certain internet apps.<br />
<br />
My best advice would be to clean IE off the machine completely, reboot, then reinstall IE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ssauron Scalebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">After the latest Nvidia driver update, my TNT2 started acting funny.  Might try an earlier release driver.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Redtree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Dumped all old drivers on vid card and restored all new drives across the board as of this minute its hailing butt.<br />
<br />
Think had a goofy .dll and maybe a sucky driver or 2<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks all help</div></div><hr />
