<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Psyloche</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Grats to Boroque on his Ragefire spawn. Its a shame this couldn't be to another, had Boroque already gotten his :( At any rate it was great time getting killing blow and KS on a Dragon :)<br />
<br />
I would just like to state for the record, I have retired from killing Kilrain until he reaches level 60. Until which time I refuse to slaughter him senselessly like I did throughout the Ragefire camp. I would also like to add Crolo, my level 42 (Yes, FOURTY-TWO) warrior got Hammerstalker down to the H in his name in a duel.<br />
<br />
Oh... and to those that missed it, you missed me and Nolani beating on each other like bad girls....<br />
<br />
If you guys decide to camp Rage again I will make my trip to 7-11 earlier as this is the actual trigger to spawning Ragefire....<br />
<br />
Psyloche, who for the love of god would like to learn how to post screen shots because he has tons.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fazzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">AWESOME!!!  Grats Boroque!!!  Wish I coulda been there, but stupid work again interfered with EQ and I had to leave the camp before the pop :(  Anyways, I had a great time in the few hours I was there getting to meet and know some more Keepers.  Many epic duels were had (and lost) by me  (darn you Coatlicue and your poison based dd's and high magic/cold resist).  This was the most fun without getting exp i've had, LOL.  Thanks again for letting me hang out.<br />
Grats again Boroque!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Fazzie!!! 3 times I beat you... COUNT THAT... 1...2...............3!!!!  :p<br />
<br />
Your ice comet barely touched me *grins evilly* Don't worry, we'll duel again and I will once again beat yer scrawny lil arse to the ground!<br />
<br />
I had a BLAST even though I couldn't be there for RF pop!  Many duels, lots of laughs... especially when I won the duel against the almighty Rizz... I even took a screenshot of the winning message, but I'll keep that to personally gloat over even though it wasn't a REAL win because Sinfutura cast rune on me and a sweet cleric (couldn't tell who it was) cast celestial healing on me like 2 times..... <br />
<br />
oh BAH, i STILL WON! MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!<br />
<br />
:D<br />
<br />
thanks for a GREAT time keepers and I look forward to spending even MORE time with you all very soon!</div></div><hr />

I can honestly say that the few hours (compared to others) that I spent there were incredible. I was able to meet several memebers that I didn't have a chance to before.

Congratulations,  Boroque!  Well deserved bro!<br />
<br />
To the guild, and to our friends,<br />
<br />
Thank you all for your help camping Ragefire.  We have one more to go in the immediate, and soon will have a third.  I know camping it is a huge drain, but hopefully we all got an opportunity to get better acquainted with Sol B, and the camp itself.<br />
<br />
Thank you all very much for the red scale as well.<br />
<br />
Humbly at your service,</div></div><hr />

I'll learn some new dances to entertain y'all and polish my spear for round 2 with Rizzie..<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>RizzWulfgard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Zordak finally popped at 3:30 AM Eastern Wednesday.<br />
<br />
Several Keepers were still on hand though very tired.  We knew the server was coming down shortly, and I had been discussing leaving the dungeon when the first Fire Giants popped, as we would have maybe an hour at best until the server went down.<br />
<br />
Fire Giants popped earlier then we expected and in the middle of a Fire Giant, Zordak popped.  I got on the phone with several who were on call, Jice was present and called out to The Corps, Emin and Nazgel of Legion were in Sol B and responded to my call by putting the word out to Legion, Kaleic and Krurk of FoH responded by bringing an FoH contigent.<br />
<br />
7 groups of KOE, Legion, The Corp, and FoH assembled very quickly and the dragon himself was dead in about 17 seconds.<br />
<br />
Congrats to:<br />
<br />
Cidman on Blazing Greaves of Fennin Ro<br />
Aranuil on Red Dragon Scale<br />
Boroque on Heart of Ragefire<br />
Seran on Gauntlets of Fiery Might<br />
<br />
I humbly thank all of the Keepers and friends who held the camp, who spent time in Sol B.  I enjoy the companionship and the fun we shared.<br />
<br />
Thank you to Celestial Tomb who stayed the hell away :)<br />
<br />
Thank you to our friends on Veeshan in several guilds who sent encouraging tells and came in support when Rage finally popped.<br />
<br />
Ragefire spawned 61.5 hours after his last death to Valhall.  Congrats Biral.<br />

I tell ya, for one hell of a long camp, it was a blast during the time I spent there dueling :)  Sorry I could not be there for the pop, but I am sure I will be there for next one!  It was also nice to meet some KoE members that I had not previously met as well!<br />

<br />
I know that to lots of you who have lots of experience with camping these epic mobs this week was a pain in the neck, but I confess to having enjoyed it immensely! I had a chance to spend more time with lots of you in a situation where we could play around some and I got to put lots of faces with names. AND I can now find my way from the lava zone in to the SS room!! WOOT!<br />
<br />
I'm there for the next round!<br />

Again, CONGRATS Boro!!<br />

Props to Rizz for ceding any semblance of a real life while this camping process was going on hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Arsecn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Jice, you rock... dont know you but i've heard about you and have seen you on these boards...<br />
<br />
Just a pipe dream i guess.... But, how bout all the guilds involved on veeshan camp this thing like KoE did...  no one will get steam rolled, trained, or ksed agn by u know who...   It was quite an effort, but we all pulled together in KoE after Boro/KoE was dissed by CT...  a damn long spawn.  But, after learning their stance on the matter, we were not about to let it happen again.  Maybe it's just a dream, but it would be sweet if all clerics and their respective guilds on veeshan... minus CT, were to pull together as KoE did and get their pieces rather than give us more FlameVault threads in the future...<br />
<br />
Gratz agn Boro...  now rezz my trollie ass )</div></div><hr />
