<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slacethehard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Not really a shaman issue but thought I'd bring it to the board just as a matter of interest, to keep it in prespective in relation my guild's size, I'd be intrested in hearing from hardcore raiding guilds, around time capable size.<br />
<br />
Recruitment continues to be a hot potato issue, and can on occasions be a major pain in the ass for a lot of guilds and their officers, GLers. You get a trail member x that looks promising, then you get a couple of threads on the board about how x KS'd me back in the day etc.... and before you know where you are, you face dropping x as a trail, before you lose 2-3 members because they don't like the colour he dyed his armour.........so to speak.<br />
<br />
We currently have 3-4 recruitment officers who talk to applicants who have posted, and establish what progression they have in PoP/GoD, how many appropriate aa's they have, raid times.....all the usual stuff. If said player gets invited as a trail we have a closed section on our boards where members can post on progress or lodge any problems they have with said trail's game play, the recruitment team generally keep intouch with the trail, and issue advice etc. after an appropriate period trail x gets invited as a full member (approx a month). We as members don't vote to accept new trails to membership, we accept the providence of our recruitment team who do a great job.<br />
<br />
I was wondering what your guild's policy is on recruitment? Is it a contencious subject? Do you do anything different other than outlined here? I would welcome some constructive outside input.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Your guild's approach sounds very similar to ours: recruits spend a couple of months raiding with us, during which there is a &quot;recruitment&quot; thread in which comments are made by members. Officers decide when recruit is promoted to membership.<br />
<br />
Our biggest problem at this point is that there just aren't many people left out there who have ANY skills at all and aren't already guilded. There are 4 Time guilds on our server (including us), at least 6-7 guilds who have killed at least one elemental god, and probably a half dozen more that are working on getting to the elementals as well. It feels like the vast majority of those few left floating out there unguilded either have very bad play time, so aren't suitable for raiding guilds, or they are PLed newbs who we definitely don't want in guild, or they were recently dropped by a guild for some reason, or left a guild for some reason. The skillset of the general population is just terrible these days: warriors who have no idea how to get aggro, nor how to position mobs; rogues who can't figure out how to drop aggro, shaman who can't figure out how to avoid aggro, wizards who come out blazing from the start, etc. All the hallmarks of a PLed twink that never had to actually work in a group setting, but instead just had 4K in gear thrown on them, and then sat with a huge DS on them for 40 levels while their main pulled stuff onto them. And they typically have an attitude to go with it....&quot;who the hell are you to tell me how to run this character? I've leveled my xxxfillintheblank up to 65 and 3 other characters besides (all PLed), so FU if you don't like the way I play.&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hail,<br />
<br />
I'm not in a Time guild, but honestly this question isn't specific to those who are.  This is a generic recruitment thread as I see it.  The only difference between a guild that raids HoT compared to one raiding time in terms of getting more folks is the recruiting standards.<br />
<br />
1.  Set baseline standards &amp; post them on your website.  You can set minimum standards 'for trial' and minimum standards for full membership if you feel your 'goal standards' would be too restrictive for classes you want.  For example, a cleric's Trial standard might only be level 65 w/ Run3 and Radiant Cure 1 w/ PoJ flag.  But Cleric full membership requirements would be much more stringent, adding 70-80 aa's and flagged through Elementals.  For classes that aren't in high demand, your 'Trial' and 'Goal' standards can be identical (200 aa's, fully flagged, 40hrs+ per week playtime during suchandsuch hours, yadda, yadda, yadda).  As recruiting needs change, you can change your standards of course.  <br />
<br />
This lets your leadership flex trial standards to a point where you can get new blood but also lets your existing full membership base not get flooded w/ people who are extremely under-geared or lacking flags/aa's/etc that.  At the same time though, it is clear to all that these trials won't be full members until they meet the goal standards.  This '2 standard' system worked well for one of the guilds I was an officer in.  We were able to get additional clerics and wizards, several of whom who wearing horrible stuff and scant aa's.  Gearing them up a bit (as probies) on rot drops to a point where they weren't dangerous wasn't too hard, and they had full access to the guild roster for grouping which helped fill out their AA's.  The dedicated trials are pretty to see, as they are constantly working towards reaching their goal to punch the full member ticket.  The slackers (that are still good people) can stay on as trials if the leadership wants to let them, or you can boot them for lack of progress, as you see fit.  <br />
<br />
2.  Take care of as much of your routine Q&amp;A stuff out of game.  A good interview is very time intensive in my experience, and doing it while either interviewer/interviewee are fighting is generally a bad idea.  If your application questionaire is written well, it takes a tremendous strain off the recruitment officers.<br />
<br />
The application questions should be written on an 8th grade reading level, without any idiomatic expressions or ambiguity that could confuse an ESL player.  A posted up to date Magelo proflie link is a must in my opinion for any applicant as well.  A lot can be revealed in an up to date Magelo.  It can show previous raid experience and give insight into a player's mentality in the way they picked AA's, gear, etc.<br />
<br />
For a Time guild, I'm sure flags (&amp; backflagging) may be a major concern for some of the less needed classes (while for highly sought after classes it might not matter).  To clearly identify flagging status, I recommend having every applicant go to the Seer in PoK, turn /log on, go through the guided mediation and such, then turn /log back off.  Then have them post that portion of their log in their application.  One recruiting officer familiar with the text (and there are spoilers that show what every Seer message line means) can in their spare time assess whether their actual flagging status matches what the applicant thinks it is.  I have had to explain improper flagging (on a pre-EP level) status too many times, and when you are racing for a major target is NOT the time to try to figure out what flags someone is missing or send them off to the Seer to try to fix it.<br />
<br />
3.  Post a point paper on recruitment in your full member area.  Explain clearly what the guild leadership's goals are for recruitment in the broad strokes.  Give the full members clear instructions for the type of comments they should be providing in Trial threads so you don't end up with &quot;No for membership because he has a pink helm&quot; comments.  This is where you need to be honest with the membership as far as how much history crap you will accept, if your guild morals/standards will flex to fill out the roster or if you want to be more selective.  These are the same recruiting dilemnas any organization has.  You can use the &quot;accept all the crap, throw it against the wall and see what sticks&quot; philosophy, or you can carefully vet your applicants so that pretty much anyone who makes it to Trial should make full member barring a disaster.<br />
<br />
4.  Put one officer overall in charge of recruitment.  This should be that officer's primary leadership job.  Someone who also has another time intensive admin job isn't the right person for this.  Done right this job takes ALOT of time.  Set specific times that new applicants will be contacted.  One of the most frustrating things for a new applicant is to submit an application and hear nothing but 2-3 vague /tells in the course of a week.   As soon as an application is submitted, a form e-mail should be fired off that it has been received.  Included in this e-mail is an expected timeframe for application processing.  Applicants are examining the guild as much as you are examining the applicant.  I've withdrawn my application before from a guild partly due to how slow &amp; screwed up their recruitment process was.<br />
<br />
5.  Assign mentors.  Mentors should be willing to do this and should be talking daily with their pupil.  This can address training deficiencies, poor gear selections, and any other number of inumerable faux pas that a new trial might make that a recruitment officer either didn't see or didn't have time to address during a raid.  You can't expect everyone to have learned the game the same way.  Look at new members as fresh clay to mold into your own fighting style.  If they are unwilling to change or not receptive to advice, then maybe they aren't worth having in the first place.  A good mentor is able to overcome the natural defensiveness a player may have when being told they aren't doing something the 'right' way.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Souls of the Arcane is nowhere near being a Time guild, but I'll reply anyway since the feedback and information might be useful for someone out there. <br />
<br />
Our guild uses a very, very simple recruitment policy. All officers, at any time, can recruit a person to guild. Most times, our recruits are people our guildies have grouped with, and have recommended be guilded. These people have almost certainly been invited to at least one of our raids. Other times, a guildie will get someone asking &quot;Hey, can I join SOTA?&quot; and they forward the person to a Council member. Those times, officers handy do a short interview with the person, and send them to our site to read our policies. If they feel they can live with the policies, and if the officer feels they would be a good fit for the guild, they are invited. We have a 21-day probationary period, and if any guildie has a problem with the recruit, they send an officer a tell and explain the issue. Nine times out of 10, we discover the &quot;real&quot; side of the recruit in the 21 days, and either boot them or keep them. We don't use an application, we don't limit the number of certain classes (lol just look at our roster), and we don't allow members to vote on guild invites. It's simple, it's not time-consuming, and it has not failed us yet.<br />
<br />
Once they're invited, we use the &quot;pupil-mentor&quot; process Frekkels talked about, though it's not as structured in our guild. We have a lot of members who are just naturals at taking others under their wing, so to speak, and they help new people with gear selections/AA choices, etc. We don't &quot;assign&quot; mentors, it just sort of happens.<br />

BertoxThis issue isn't going to go away.  For a guild to be successful in recruiting, they are going to have to accept this and adjust.  Do what businesses do that are faces with this challenge every day.  Prepare.  Train.  Mentor.  Promote to keep your talent.  Give them raises.<br />
<br />
Prepare - When you start a new job, you usually get an orientation packet.  Org chart, job description, policy manual, map of where the restroom is and where the soda fountain is.  Prepare your recruits.  Tell them the tools they will need.  Provide them with links to downloading maps, make sure they understand your primary targets and how to get to them from different starting points.  Use class specific advantages or limitations in your descriptions.  Don't tell a BST to port to DSP and run to ME to AR if your raid target is Shei.  Set aside Mondays for tagging new recruits, then make them all meet you in the qeynos newbie zone to get tagged.  Invite members who have time to come.  Make it a meet and greet.  Get some fireworks and some ale and spend 30 minutes screwing around.  Then go raid Crushbone as a mock event.  Corny?  Perhaps, but your recruits will never forget it.  They'll never forget that they met the guild leader when he was kiting Fippy Darkpaw and kept running into trees because he was drunk and couldn't drive his toon.<br />
<br />
Train - businesses put people through training.  Whether it's technical training, product training, sales training, whatever.  Train your recruits.  Write and post strat guides for your guild's primary targets.  If you're a Time guild, so hit TT in PoN.  If you're a SSRA/VT/POP Tier 3 guild, go raid Vindi one saturday afternoon and practice positioning tactics.  Practice centering him, walking him up and down the hallway outside arena.  Walk him from one side of the arena to the other to practice handling adds.  If you're a lower content guild, so raid a target you can do with your eyes closed and experiment.  Get your recruits involved.  Just be sensitive to other guilds that may want to do the event for real progression.<br />
<br />
Mentor - assign a class mentor to recruits.  &quot;Hey new recruit_02, since you are a shaman, you need to follow Uberraidshaman_04 around and listen to everything he says.&quot;  Uberraidshaman_04 then needs to embrace this responsibility and act.  Make a special class specific channel for giving directions on raids.  Take the recruit over to FG (or DL, or whatever) and practice CC.  Teach them the value of AOE slow and VP and meztanking adds.  Take a WAR to POJ (velks, SolB, etc) and make the recruit practice not getting agro but slowing and crippling as early as possible.  Have your raid hotkeys announce everything in the shaman raid channel so they see exactly what you are doing and how often.<br />
<br />
Promote - Titles are important.  Increase rewards proportionally.  For example:<br />
Recruit - earn DKP at 50%, may not bid<br />
Trial member - earn DKP at 50%, may bid after full members have passed<br />
Full member - earn DKP at 100%, may bid on all non-restricted drops<br />
Senior member - earn DKP at 100%, get first bid rights on select gear (FTIV or more, enraging blow, 100 HP +, whatever)<br />
Officer - earn DKP at 105%, get first bid rights on select gear.<br />
Merit things based on title.  ST keys, VT shards, first crack at flags from a POP event.  Bidding rights on banked alt gear, whatever.<br />
<br />
disclaimer: BE CAUTIOUS if you do this.  This is only an example, and I put like 5 minutes of thought into the above breakout.  Put more thought into it than that.<br />
<br />
Bottom line:  EQ is much like the real world.  There just aren't enough talented people at the unemployment office.  You have to make something out of what's there if you are going to be successful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Kind of odd for that.  The select gear thing and earning more DKP sets a preferential standard that doesn't seem to go well with DKP.  Officers should earn more DKP than most members, since they have to be on almost all the time anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is it so hard to understand that I don't ever want to be in a guild again in my life?<br />
<br />
I know you guys see me soloing things that you need a group for, and I con blue to you. And I know you never see my corpse, because I don't die. But please, mind your own business. If I wanted a guild, I'd actually go out of my way to communicate in a polite fashion that I am interested.<br />
<br />
Guild (and group) spamming is just plain wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If you are in a raiding guild, you need to push your members to be mature enough to realize that raiding is a lot like a job.  Lots of people come together with a task to perform, they do it, and then they all reap the rewards.  Just like a RL workplace, you are never going to have a guild where every member gets along well.  I've never had a job where I have liked everyone, and I've never been in a guild where I have liked everyone.  Your members just have to be able to tolerate the person until raidtime is over, then they can just put him on ignore and go about their business like he wasn't even there.<br />
<br />
If you have members saying &quot;if you go through with so-and-so's recruitment, I am going to leave the guild&quot;, call their bluff on it.  I find it highly unlikely that anyone can find someone so unpleasant that they would be willing to abandon their guild over it.  More likely, they just hate the person and are trying to block them from membership out of spite.  Once they see that they're going to be guildmates regardless of deguilding threats, they'll just nut up and accept it.<br />
<br />
Basically, use the &quot;Raiding is like a Job, you don't have to like everyone - just work with them&quot; analogy and it will shut most people up.  As for your recruitment process, though, I really would suggest a guild vote.  In my guild, you go through 3 weeks as a pledge and then have to get a super majority (67%) vote in order to get in (can read our charter by clicking link in my sig).  The problem with having a recruitment council is that pledges will kiss ass like you wouldn't believe if they only have to focus it on a handful of people.  I feel a guild vote is better.  I've been in two large raiding guilds that used a guild vote, and it served both guilds pretty well.<br />
<br />
I think the best way to do it is this:<br />
<br />
1) When you have a potential recruit who meets your requirements, ask the officers of the guild if they have any prior knowledge of the person.  Unless someone says &quot;OMG I HATE THAT BASTARD&quot;, tag him and introduce him to the guild.<br />
2) Have a forum on your guild boards which only members can read.  In this forum, make a thread about each potential recruit.  In this thread, people can post any prior experiences they have had with this person, and any observations they make during their recruitment.<br />
3) After a certain length of time (~1 month), the recruit goes up for a vote which any full member of the guild can participate in.  When you post the vote, link to the thread mentioned in step 2 and encourage people to take that information into consideration.  The vote consists of three options: yes, no, and abstain.  For counting purposes, abstain counts as a no, but basically means &quot;I am voting no because I have barely seen this person&quot;.  If the recruit gets more than a certain percent (~70%), then they become a full member.  If they recieve under 70% yes, the recruitment officer(s) examine the situation to decide what to do next.<br />
4)  If the recruit got a lot of no votes and people have accused him of various dastardly deeds, just let him go.  If he has lots of abstains because he has barely been playing, let him go through recruitment again and encourage him to play more.  Repeat as necessary.  Use your best judgement for any other scenario that comes up.<br />
<br />
I feel that this process works well for a variety of reasons, but the biggest reason is that it lets everyone vote, not just a recruitment council.  If you have a recruit that has issues with a handful of your members, and it is up to 3 or 4 recruitment officers to decide whether or not to let the recruit in, then those officers are going to be under a lot of pressure from the handful of dissenters.  In addition to being very annoying to the officers, it is also unfair to the recruit.  Anyone who actively plays everquest for the purpose of bettering their character has, at some point, rubbed someone the wrong way - regardless of intentions.  I try to avoid conflict and follow the golden rule, but I still have a list of enemies (albeit fairly short).  If the guild is allowed to vote, it becomes much more fair and much less of a hassle.  The opposers can post their bad experiences in the thread, and everyone who has good experiences with the recruit can post those as a counterpoint.  If the recruit has nothing but negative comments, he won't get in.  If he has a mix of negative and good, it usually comes down to how dedicated of a player he is.  If it is nothing but good comments, he's usually in.  That's my experience.<br />
<br />
I think the most important thing is to let everyone have a fair shot at recruitment.  If a handful of people basically cockblock the person before they even get a chance to show what a talented, dedicated, and generally good-natured player they are, it isn't fair to the recruit, and it isn't fair to your guild because they lose out on a potentially great member who has a few bad days.<br />
<br />
So, to sum it up, having your whole guild vote based on personal experience and other people's posted opinions is better than using a recruitment council.  Remember, under my system, the recruitment council still has plenty of influence:  they get to decide what to do about borderline recruits, and their opinion still has a lot of weight when it comes to undecided voters.  If 16_year_old_necro_05 claims that recruit_108 trained him 5 months ago, but your recruitment officer says &quot;I've grouped with this guy for about 40 hours over his pledge period and he's a really great player and person&quot;, then 16_year_old_necro_05's opinion is pretty much null.<br />
<br />
