<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was wondering if you could feedback this-- perhaps they'll listen (haha).<br />
<br />
Currently, if you have Quickbuff 2 and Haste of Mithaniel, your Quiescence is 3.3 seconds.  If you use an ability, like say, Cannibalization, and immediately followup with Quiescence, you will get a &quot;Spell Recovery Time not yet met&quot; message after you finish casting it, and the spell will be completely aborted.<br />
<br />
This is VERY VERY bad.  You don't want your Quiescence to be aborted after a Canni 5-- or at least I don't. hehe.. (and you don't want to Q then Canni 5 if you're full health, or even canni 4 a few times then Q and Canni 5-- you're lowering your efficiency in both cases by delaying your canni 5)<br />
<br />
I've had QB1 and haste of mithaniel for a very long time so I'm very very used to canni 5-Q, and I keep getting that stupid message now that I have QB2.  Now I have to force myself to pause after canni 5, making me delay even longer (poor human reflexes) than if I had just QB1 and haste, which is just plain silly.<br />
<br />
This is true for many quickcasting spells, and I think that it needs to be addressed.<br />
<br />
Possible solutions:<br />
If a spell is cast way too quickly, instead of giving the message and aborting it, just continue &quot;casting&quot; until the server is satisfied that you've waited a long enough time-- then complete the spell successfully.  I think this would solve all of our problems in regards to that annoying message (band-aid approach, need to mess with server/client communications).<br />
<br />
Another option might be to revisit all AAs and add the minimum recovery time to them like they did to spells, but that might actually make it worse for us (brute-force script-and-change-all-and-likely-break-something approach.  requires mass-changing lots of spells/abilities).<br />
<br />
Or how about getting rid of the spell recovery time not yet met message altogether, and just have item effects/AA abilities cast without affecting your refresh timer (so you can't use an instaclick to ungrey your spell icons to cast right away)? (correct fix, may require a restructuring of how item effects work).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'll start feedbacking this as well, its a huge pain in the ass and it has only gotten worse now that I've got a detrimental haste item.  I think every spell in my book except for velium strike and fo7 casts so fast that if I try to cast it right afte canni5 I get this error.  Bad mojo =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>cepheusRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, it annoys the hell out of me too.  I always have to cast quiessence on myself before I c5 if I'm in a situation where I'm likely to take a hit in the few seconds after c5'ing (which oftentimes wastes the healing power of my quiessence if I'm already full hps and don't wanna waste time canni'ing down).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xabaras Soulsreaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Personally bout the Q and Canni5 combo, when i can i usually do that way:<br />
<br />
Quiescence take me 3% mana<br />
Canni gives me back 25% mana about<br />
<br />
so when i am at 78% about i cast Q on me going to 75 mana and as i finish casting Q i Canni5 so i will get the 1st tick from Q a sec after Canni5 is done so i will have full mana (without having to cast Q and burning other mana if casting Canni5 and then Q).<br />
<br />
Btw it wont change much, thats just like i use it when i ve Canni5 up and about 78% mana, to have a full benefit from Canni5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I get this to, annoyingly, if you use any hotkey ability then cast a spell it does this. I have also noticed it before I think when casting tnargs twice in a row. Feedbacked it before, there is hope they will fix it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">if yoru going to hot key cani V and q <br />
<br />
/targ yourself<br />
/g blah blah cani 5 blah blah<br />
/pause 30<br />
/cast (q slot )<br />
<br />
<br />
30 should be enough with max spell haste to compensate any lag and spell recovery and BoR ive had that probelm too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have been feedbacking this too, very very very annoying.   I cast Q first usually when mobs are about, but its more efficient to do it after so you don't miss the first tick while cann5ing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I just make sure my health is not 100% when I canni 5.  Then the first tick of Q still takes full effect.  Works best if you have &gt; 3.5k hp (Virtue is niiiiice).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Personally I've got qb2 and an 18% haste item which, if memory serves, give me a 3.3 second q normally. In that situation I don't ever recall getting the recovery not met msg but if I get a BoR from a cleric I'll get it quite frequently and it does annoy me. Usually I just don't bother to ask for BoR and then I don't have to worry about it. Sometimes clerics sneak it in there when they cast it on themselves or starting to see clerics with the group one now too. It is nice for turgurs and malos to have that extra haste so it really would be nice if they would fix it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">In one of the patch messages (the one where they added the 2.2 second recast time to all spells) it was indicated that this was &quot;step 1&quot; of removing the spell time recovery not met error, with &quot;step 2&quot; soon to follow.  That was about a year ago, if I recall, and &quot;step 2&quot; never materialized.  It sounded like an excuse, anyway.  <br />
<br />
I just assume that they will never fix it, and do my Q before I do my Canni5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Same error happens a lot with QB3. Been playing around with a macro<br />
/g c5q<br />
/alt ability 47<br />
/pause 28 - 30 (still playing with that line to optimize)<br />
/cast 8 (or whereever you have your Q)</div></div><hr />
