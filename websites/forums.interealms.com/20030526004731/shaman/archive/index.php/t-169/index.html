<br />
1.  I was always under the impression that ebolt would be overridden by bane as being the higher level spell in the same line.  Am I wrong on this?  If so, I would have thought the whole argument about which of the two spells was better/more satisfying/etc. would be completely moot, because we'd be loading both of them.<br />
<br />
2.  Is it the same for Plague and Pox?  Again, I thought that Pox would override Plague as being the higher level spell in the same line.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.  Another shaman disagrees with me, and I'd like a little input :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Lor is correct. All the different shaman dots stack. I regularly dot mobs with both ebolt and bane when soloing for exp. Try it on yourself and it's easy to see. Just be sure you have cure poison memed or a cleric near by.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Same as  Taraddar here....I stack epic/bane/ebolt on most solo fights unless the mobs has alot of hps such as gorangas in Maidens....in that case where the fights going to last abit longer...I'll through Pox on him as well. I dont cast ebolt in those cases though.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rathelon Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The only time they wont stack is if you are stacking the same spell, or you and another shaman are using the same spell...i.e. two Bane of Nife dont stack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mirabilis Dictu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">God is that ever sick *grin*  Two 42 sec dots.<br />

Thanks for the info :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">When I first got Pox I decided to see how the dots stacked.<br />
<br />
So I droped Epic Pox Plague Bane and Ebolt on a spider in velks...started clickin the bracer and it died before pox and plague wore off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Floda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">im only 19, but why cant i get disease and affliction to stack if all dots stacK?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">May be the first dot run off before you stack another one in?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Floda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">could it be that it just doesnt work when casting on yourself?  I casted Affliction, and then casted disease for about 30 casts, resisted all of them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">All disease spells (both single target and the ae), and all poison spells stack with themselves.<br />
<br />
It really depends on the situation as to how I stack.  Ive began liking this new sort of method Ive been using...<br />
<br />
pull a dark blue with malady, use disease 1 and 2, root.<br />
<br />
pull another dark blue with malady, repeat...root.<br />
<br />
You can juggle multiple mobs like this, but it does take longer.  For quicker single target fights, I will ignore stacking disease.<br />
<br />
I'm rambling, too.<br />

<br />
ROFL, you kinda answered your own question there.  They didn't &quot;stack&quot; because they never stuck.  You resisted them all.  How are they supposed to stack if you never landed one in the first place?  Try disease debuffing yourself first next time.</div></div><hr />
