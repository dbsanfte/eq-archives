Make it obscene so we we can do more with the less we have (IE: use our lame DD more often to make up for the fact that our DD is lame in the first place).  Perhaps even a self only passive mana regen that stacks with Cann.  We already do pretty much everything, but mana costs and spell mitigation have reduced the effectiveness of our class.  Perhaps with greater mana regen we can use our existing tools to greater effect over time (ie: cast more regularly and do more).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shaman were touted as the &quot;battle priests&quot; in the original EQ literature.  Thats what they were called when I rolled up Thor in 2000.  I think, if you want an honest opinion, that the shaman class should have been more like the Beastlord class is now.  That, incidentally, is why I think that Beasties are getting everything under the sun; SOE has decided that SHaman suck and are fixing the mistakes they made with Beastlords.</div></div><hr />

i would love a melee upgrade.<br />
<br />
but as i have no faith in Sony, i am sure they would implement it like they did when they added to us the throwing skill.  just something worthless that we will not use.<br />
<br />
we are already gimped on the weapon selection side of the game.  go to the bazaar, put in 3k min, search 1b/2b/pierce; and you get:<br />
1b, Soulstripper about 5k, and Orb of Delightful about 10k<br />
2b, you might get Boneshod Great Staff<br />
pierce, REIF and the Goblin Sticker that is for Rogues.<br />
<br />
i think that is about it for bazaar weapons.<br />
<br />
and everyone and their brother wants the Delightfull Orb, as it is all/all and procs the 320DD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Same here when I created Wytch in 1999.  Shaman were the Battle Priest of the time.   Now I can't out melee a Cleric. Training in Slam went to clerics the rest I suggested went to BeastLords.   I won't begrudge Clerics, they were boring to play. <br />
Heck I remember when our skill caps on our weapons where the same as warriors. Sure we did not have any defense skills but Block and Dodge but we could heal, so it was a trade off.<br />
<br />
Still what was said of Shaman when I started  and what they are two different things.  <br />
<br />
I would LOVE to switch to a BL if i could , but just can't. Why?  I Just can't play to level 65, get my AA's,  and redo all those damn Pop Flags.  Not to mention the gear.  Just don't have the heart to start from level 1 again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We should be THE best support class to complement melee (priest for the working class).  That means first rate debuffs and buffs and workable heals.  Our debuffs need to stay meaningfully ahead of the competition.

Kinda sad in a sense when you see people posting time and time again what exactly is a shaman's role in a group??? <br />
<br />

I think we would all like to know..... <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I personally think shaman are sitting pretty good right now.  I can't see them adding something to give us significantly more raw power.  It'd be nice to see them give us a few minor things just so we have something new to consider, which appears to be the way it'll be (appears since nobody really knows yet what's gonna happen).<br />
<br />
I can't see shaman evolving much more because we already have almost every ability in the game and have a pet.<br />
<br />
Our strongest ability is slowing - and we're not gonna get better slows (since it's already so powerful they make some critters immune/mitigate) and we're not gonna get slows with MR adjustments (since slowing is already one of the best abilities in the game they're not gonna make it even easier to land - especially when we have an unresistable MR debuff).<br />
<br />
Our once awesome melee buffs have been rendered less awesome due to loot in the game being out of control, so we're not likely to see significant upgrades there - they'd be pointless.<br />
<br />
Our DDs are pitiful and our DoTs are mediorce - but we do have both in several flavors and have our pet to always add damage - so I can't see us getting any significant upgrades there.<br />
<br />
We have a highly efficient heal over time, a beefy speed heal, and a decent ICH.  The only thing we really lack is a group heal.  Druids can heal somewhat better and clerics are the best healers as they should be.  Given our huge variety of other abilities can we realistically expect to ever be given healing upgrades?  I'd think it's unlikely.<br />
<br />
You put a 65th shaman with all spells and regular gear next to any other class with all spells and regular gear and the shaman is sitting pretty good.  Give either a boatload of AA and/or uber gear and the shaman is still sitting pretty good.<br />
<br />
Develop the mana regen angle.  Make it obscene so we we can do more with the less we have<br />
<br />
Well, err...since we can canniV/canni dance and do cheap heal of time spells endlessly we pretty much already have unlimited mana don't we?  It can take some time to do all the casting to rebuild mana but the potential for neverending mana is there.  Add in gear with lots of +regen/FT and/or group us with mana providers (many classes boost mana regen or provide mana feeds) and we float in mana.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I completely agree.  <br />
<br />
It's insane what they keep giving that class.  They are worse than paladins balance wise.  <br />
<br />
I didn't make a shaman 4 years ago to sit around buffing others.  That's a joke if that's now the vision.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">beefy speed heal, and a decent ICH.  <br />
<br />
You are seriously deluding yourself here. Our speed heal is sad and our ICH is a big joke. My guild isn't even VT or Elemental and my ICH doesn't even make a dent on our tanks. <br />
<br />
Druids can heal 3x as much with their ICH and 2x as much with their fast heal, they're not marginally better they are way way ahead. <br />
<br />
As for mana, our spells are so ineffecient, if I want to put out any kinda of respecatble DPS I can burn my mana pool down in a matter of minutes with full raid buffs and FT13. This is using Bane, Blood, Tears, Torrent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">We're evolving backwards ~~~~~~ We're going to be the new pre-luclin rangers ((((^:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Originally, Shaman were supposed to be the battle priests in EverQuest. But when Verant was running things, in my opinion, they did a pretty bad job of creating roles for classes and filling them in. They designed classes around what would make the most sense from a role playing stand point. Actual game balance was horrible in practice. Not too mention that they made a lot of skills and abilities completely worthless either due to bugs (Alchemy skill ups *are* possible, we swear!) or lack of implementation (Rogues get to disarm traps, but we didn't really put any in game). There are still some things that don't work well, but SOE (which obviously is not the same people that were at Verant) has done a fairly good job at smoothing things out as best they can, when you take into account the pile of crap balancing that they had to work with. It took the development team almost 3 years before they stopped treating hybrid classes like they were gimped up version of their parent class and started giving them more unique spells and abilities.<br />
<br />
I signed on to play a Shaman as a &quot;battle priest&quot;. I wanted to melee a little and have some decent buff spells. But I really don't think that's what Shaman are anymore. I'm much more of a support class now than I was pre-Kunark/Velious. When I'm in an exp group, my primary responsibility is to debuff mobs and buff my party members. But aside from that, I also can contribute some healing and a little DPS with nukes/rains and my pet. I'm not the best healer or DPS class, but it's nothing to scoff at. I'm happier with this role than I was with my role as a battle priest, and I never really thought I would be.<br />
<br />
I see a lot of hostility towards Beastlords here, and I can't deny that they are the battle priests that we used to be. I've got a Beastlord alt I play from time to time. But what I've found is that I didn't want to be a battle priest as much as I thought I did. If you're hung up on being able to melee, you really should try a Beastlord, because that is the class that SOE has created to fill the battle priest role. And I don't think there is much chance of them transforming Shaman back into this role at this point. I personally don't want them to.<br />

- Mez? Rez? Stun? Snare? FD? Aggro reduction? Tanking (no, not PoV yardtrash)?  Ports? DA? <br />
<br />
Our strongest ability is slowing - and we're not gonna get better slows (since it's already so powerful they make some critters immune/mitigate) and we're not gonna get slows with MR adjustments (since slowing is already one of the best abilities in the game they're not gonna make it even easier to land - especially when we have an unresistable MR debuff).<br />
- Welcome to 4 expansions ago. Here is some newsflash, when a (insert random add00) from (insert random boss01) quands for over 1k, what is more efficient? Slow+Tank mez? Snare+root park? Mez? If the add is a wuss (500ish hitter) than it doesn't matter if it's slowed or not, it's going to be destroyed by add control crew.<br />
<br />
Our once awesome melee buffs have been rendered less awesome <br />
- You mean the uber insane ~5-7% DPS you gain from the best STR shaman buff? Some people have a very strange notion of &quot;awesome&quot;.<br />
<br />
due to loot in the game being out of control, so we're not likely to see significant upgrades there - they'd be pointless.<br />
- Newsflash, even before people maxed out STR/DEX/AGI, those were still utter crap.<br />
<br />
Our DDs are pitiful and our DoTs are mediorce - but we do have both in several flavors and have our pet to always add damage - <br />
- Druids have far superior DDs, nice DoTs too. Necros well ... ah never mind.<br />
<br />
a beefy speed heal, <br />
- Too bad, a hybrid can heal better than us group or speed department. A goddamn hybrid.<br />
<br />
and a decent ICH.  <br />
- ROFLMFAOPIMGP!!!!!!!!!! Oh ... you were serious.<br />

You put a 65th shaman with all spells and regular gear next to any other class with all spells and regular gear and the shaman is sitting pretty good. <br />
- Sitting pretty good on a rock (and LFG) in Plane of Tranquility wondering why other classes with his abilities have more group utility than him.<br />

We got to face it, if you balance PvP, you will balance PvE.   Shaman are being swept under the carpet, if we were given:<br />
<br />
Double Attack (we are the battle priest, right?)<br />
True curse dots (that are not resisted at 100 pr consistantly)<br />
Manasteal/destroy dots (similar to chanters, since they share our SLOW line)<br />
A Pet that is base level 61.  We are weakest of the pet classes but w/all the new AAs at least give us a pet that they are useful on.  <br />
A true lure slow AA or a -100 check, 70 percent slow for MR or a -50 check, 60 percent DR slow would be nice.<br />
PBAE Malos<br />
PBAE Slow<br />
AoE Malos<br />
AoE DOTS, we got infectious cloud, and tell me how many of you REALLY use it, I would LOVE to see a AoE lure PR dot that deals 2k to 4 targets in 7 ticks w/lure of -50 to -100 built in at level 65)<br />
Mastery of buffs, 0 failure checks on ALL BENEFICIAL spells/buffs as a AA.<br />
Immunity to all Disease based spells as a AA - we are medicine men/women<br />
Immunity to all Poison based spells as a AA -  we are medicine men/women<br />
<br />
Give us SOMETHING unique, here above are some ideas, please read he who develops and /assist me here :)<br />

I've been playing mine for that long as well. Even though I don't have the levels or AA's that you do, I've been around. All I was saying was that I'm satisfied with the role that SOE evolved Shaman into from the role that Verant had originally set for us.<br />
<br />
You can complain about the role we currently have, but as I said, it really isn't likely to change. Complaining about how a Shaman is not what it used to be, when a completely different team was balancing the game, is not going to get very much done. As a player and a customer, you've got a couple options to make your game experience better - you can switch to another class that DOES fill the role you wish to play, you can switch to another game, or you can just quit. MMOG characters are not an easy thing to give up after you've invested a lot of time into them, but continuing to play a class you hate is just incredibly counterproductive, IMO.<br />

<br />
Totally agree with you, Enarcheos.<br />
<br />
We need :<br />
Debuffs line :<br />
Better slows (&gt; 75% but with normal resist)<br />
Slow with less resiste (lure line)<br />
Slow Poison and Cold based to change.<br />
Better debuffs (Cripple line )Atk debuff (cripple affect atk indirectly).<br />
Casters debuffs (debuff who affect the casting time for example)<br />
Aera Debuffs : aera slow point blank, Aera malo or malos, Aera root.<br />
<br />
Buffs line:<br />
A spell like aura of reverence.<br />
A line of self spells with better effect : Focus line, Resists line.<br />
A rapid proc sharable on players.<br />
<br />
With all of that , i would be happy :)</div></div><hr />

Don't think I ever said I hated the Shaman class thanks.<br />
<br />
As for switching to another class not going to waste 4+ years.  That's like buying  a house and selling it before you can break even.<br />
<br />
As for a new game, im waiting to see if WoW lives up to the Hype. If so I will switch.  Till then EQ is THE best game and as a player of the game who's Ideas where used (just not for shaman) there is always hope.<br />

Resist rates on poision/disease based damage spells exist on too many mobs to make our primary lines of damage spells effective. Durations on our most effective dots take too long to cycle thru, thus minimizing effectiveness in short duration battles. In comparison wizards/mages/and druids do not deal with these problems (well, mages .. a little, but pets make up for his.)<br />
<br />
Wizard can select from 4 groups of spells to ensure damage against targets: fire, ice, magic, lure. They also get inherent level based and resist based modifiers to easier land spells.<br />
<br />
Druid dots are subtle landing (no initial damage) so don't break the root they cast that, when it (the root) landed, did more dmg to the mob than our first strike from dots do. Druid dots are rarely resisted. Did I say rarely? The is giving them the benefit of the doubt that they ever get resisted.<br />
<br />
Fast heals, druid has it over shaman ten times over. What should be our class defining HoT spells are not viable in combat until lvl 65 because of the slow/loss of attack hit they 'provide' tanks. No other priest class gets a heal spell that actually reduces the effectiveness of the target it is healing.<br />
<br />
Root. Compared to snare and druid root our root line is useless due to the resist/breaking rate. Note I said 'compared to.' Druid snare, once landed it's a done deal. Mobs do not break snare before it runs it course. Druid roots are solid and rarely break. Ours on the other hand are like our invis. The percentage swings more towards breaking than holding for full duration.<br />
<br />
Enchanters' tash is a cast and move on spell from the very first level acquired. It lands and lasts forever ... practically. We have to wait 60 levels to get a maloxx spell that is &quot;unresistable.&quot; By that time we have to cast that spell every time to get an increased chance to land our class defining spell, turgur's. If it doesn't land we are generally getting beat upon waiting on it to refresh or trying to cast a root that may or may not stick so we can back off and try to slow again. In the same scenario (getting beat upon) chanters can stun via numerous fast casting spells or mez with numerous fast casting spells and then recast their slow in relative safety. Difference is we can take hits better; reality is chanters can react faster and not take the hits because of a larger arsenal and faster recast times.<br />
<br />
So, to make my point: I don't want to be druid, but I want my dots to land with the same reliability and my roots to be as dependable on the majority of mobs. I don't want to be a wizard but I want some flexibility in my spell lines to allow me to effectively damage the majority of mobs - any place, any time. I don't want to be an enchanter but I want the same ability to do my job fast and efficiently instead of waiting for a 'recast' time. I don't want to be a cleric but I do want to be efficient and capable as a healer because I am a priest class.<br />
<br />
At face value and in many, many situations shaman are a significant powerhouse. Other classes can make the same claim. The downside is this is countered by game walls that minimize, marginalize and even negate everything we bring to the fight. No other class is faced with this type of limitation to the degree shaman are. These limitations have been progressively introduced from expansion to expansion.<br />
<br />
The end result is, no matter how you phrase it, nerfage. Let our tools actually work with the same reliability the class specific tools work for other classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Very well said and to the point.   You  have just summed the points I have been trying to get across. KUDOS! <br />

<br />
Shaman lack in one significant area of damage dealing: adaptability.<br />

Resist rates on poision/disease based damage spells exist on too many mobs to make our primary lines of damage spells effective. Durations on our most effective dots take too long to cycle thru, thus minimizing effectiveness in short duration battles.

Can someone etch this post in bronze and ship it to Sony?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I agree with those who saw this class as a battle priest, from the original info. (Started playing in Aug 99, and did a lot of reading on the few sites, to pick a class while waiting for the game to arrive.)<br />
<br />
One of the biggest problems that's always plagued us is the relative uselessness of stats...  You would assume that a strength buff would make you hit harder, a dex buff make you hit more often, an agility buff make you dodge more, and a stamina buff let you take more damage &amp; resist some physical effects more.  The simple fact is, it's never really worked that way.<br />
<br />
But if you take away our stat buffs, what are we left with?  A small selection of mediocre (compared to the &quot;best of&quot; classes) dots, nukes &amp; heals.<br />
<br />
The solution, the way I see it, calls for some imagination.  When you think &quot;shaman&quot;, what do you think of?  Curses...  blessings... spiritual (not religious) focus on life...<br />
<br />
How could that be implemented in the game?  Curses could be partially seen as our debuffs &amp; dots.  Blessings could be seen as our small selection of heals &amp; cures.  And the spiritualistic side only really in the names of our spells, and our pets.  (Although, our epic storyline was excellently done with that in mind.)<br />
<br />
How about a buff that adds procs or skill abilities?  Spirit of the Snake, adding a poison dd/dot proc.  Spirit of the Bear, which adds a knockback or stun proc when attacking.  These kinds of things, which could be many &amp; varied.  Adding skill levels (for anyone) in backstab, slam, channelling, damage mitigation; or procs that do various stuns, blinds, dd's or dots.<br />
<br />
And it could be done - in GoD they're giving us a stationary ward that increases regen, aa's give our pets a skill (crits) or procs.  How about a stationary &quot;Totem of xx&quot; that gives all in range a... focus of mind, increasing all channelling checks, reducing fizzles, and perhaps a small mana preservation cost?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">in GoD they're giving us a stationary ward that increases regen<br />
<br />
Which utterly boggles my mind, as they have always stated they are opposed to camping... a stationary ward (unless extremely low in cost and duration - which it does not appear to be, based on current Lucy inf0z) encourages you to camp one spot for an extended period.  Just a thought for that anon dev who isn't lurking on this board. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Gudin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">What about a chant type ability? Have it where if we go into &quot;chant&quot; mode (no casting, no melee, etc.) any current spells that are still active that we have casted within a certain radius will be enhanced.  Say we cast slow and go into chant mode, have it gradually increase the power of the slow thats on the mob based on how long we chant.<br />
<br />
Would be a fairly boring ability but it would add some diversity to what we do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I want double attack and the same damage bonus melees get.  There is no way in hell that it makes sense for a 45 pound gnome with a sword the size of an icepick to be doing more melee damage than a 700 pound ogre hitting people with an old-growth tree, I don't give a **** what class the gnome is.  Granted, I'm not expecting them to inject THAT much 'reality' into the game, or there'd be no place for short warriors, but put us on par with, say, bards, melee-wise and I'll be happy.<br />
<br />
Granted, there are much more important things they could focus on, but they'd actually have to play, and/or give a **** about the integrity of, the game, and I've finally accepted the fact that the people who make the decisions at SoE don't do either.  They want to see simple problems with easy solutions.  Their approach is clearly one of &quot;what can we do that's easy and cheap and will make people stop bitching and just give us their damn money every month&quot;.  Significantly improved melee would do that for me.<br />
<br />
What can I say, I'm easily bought.<br />
