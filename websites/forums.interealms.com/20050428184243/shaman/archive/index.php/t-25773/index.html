<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tamormi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm fairly new to EQ, been playing for less than a month now and so I'm still learning about everything. So if my questions seem really off the wall, I apologize for it now.  :) <br />
<br />
Anyways, I'm a lvl 6 Barbarian Shaman, and I was wondering what other classes are good to either duo or group with? Main reason I ask is because my husband plays EQ now too and has a lvl 6 Half Elf Ranger that I've been duoing with. I just want to make sure that at the lower lvls, this is even a somewhat decent combo. If anyone's got any advice, it'd be most helpful and appriecated(sp?)<br />
<br />
Thanks! :)</div></div><hr />

Three quick castings of their lvl 9 snare, and the mobs does not even look at me when I slow and cripple him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tamormi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, so far we're doing pretty well together. Granted, we've joined with a couple other people in groups, but for the most part it's just been he and I, and well, we've now made it as far as lvl 23. It's been a bit of a slow process with just the two of us, but we're doing well.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">&quot;Agro kiting&quot; works well, too.  He snares, you use poison dots to make the mob chase you (but not catch you) while he melees the back of the mob.  That way you spend your mana on damage instead of healing :)<br />

OOooo, you're about to ding and scribe Cannibalize.  Ready to hit the big time? 8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tamormi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Oh god yes.  :D  Dinged 24 last night, went grabbed my lvl 24 spells, but wasn't on long enough to try cannibalize tho. :( Mebbe tonight tho. :D</div></div><hr />
