<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone tried duoing a Paladin/Shaman?<br />
<br />
I've seen a lot of posts on Monk/Shaman duoing and even SK/Shaman duoing, but nothing much with Paladin/Shaman. I would have figured that with overlapping buffs, both being great healers and Paladins being able to mana-free clickyheal a canniing Shaman while medding they'd be an unstoppable pair with little-to-no downtime.<br />
<br />
I've spent a good deal of time reading the Crucible here over the past few days (...when I should have been working...) and learned a lot of new things about Shaman, especially how tricky they can be to learn how to play--which is making me think twice about PLing her and just playing her up in levels the same way I did Kryss. <br />
<br />
My questions are: How effective was it when partnering or two-boxing a Paladin? and any tips for someone who wants to learn the ins-and-outs of the class as if it were another main, other than to read this board religiously?<br />
<br />
I don't like the idea of botting the Shaman. It seems like a real waste. She'd be more of a partner and I have no doubt I can handle playing two 'mains' at the same time. (I multitask endlessly when I work, and moreso when I'm writing and researching between my two PCs and am not afraid to subconsciously teach myself to remember to canni every 6 seconds.)<br />
<br />
Also wanted to say what a nice board you have here. I've dreaded going to class-specific boards for a while because of some of the dreaded Buff/Nerf whinings I always see, but this is a great and friendly community you have here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Borkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The only problems I've had when grouping with paladins is a somewhat lacking in damage output, and a huge lumping of healing power.  Though I have to admit that the clicky helm heals are real awesome for canabalizing.  <br />
<br />
But I've been able to do things with paladins that I havn't been able to do with other classes.  So their are advantages to them.  Every Mellee class, and most all casters can work great in a duo with a shaman, you just have to understand the roles that each of them should do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jukax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Shaman + Paladin can make a great combo; in fact, since Luclin paladins have become one of my favorite duo'ing classes. Paladins have great heals now, and their HP / AC buffs stack with ours. The only problem with paladins is the damage output they have, but you seem to have that licked with your Narandi's Lance. Your Jeldorin is also a great weapon for duo'ing, with DEX buff you'll be proc'ing your self heal like mad. As well, if you plan on taking both chars to level 60 and gaining some AA points, paladin / shaman combo is amazing once you get Undead Crit skill with your paladin. XP absolutely FLYS by if you're hunting undead mobs, in Acrylia or the like. As far as I know, the person with the most AA points on any server is a paladin who bot's a cleric for heals. With Undead Crits doing anywhere from 2000-5000 damage (with a nice 2h wep), he manages to gain an AA point every 2-3 hours. Last I checked he had something like 235 or so AA points. (Yes it makes me cry too). <br />
<br />
Shaman + Paladin cover many skills between the two of them, invis / invis to undead, SoW, HP buffs, AC buffs, pet, tanking ability, DoT's, resurrect, etc. The only drawback to playing both is that both classes are fairly work intensive. As a shaman we cast probably 10 times more spells than any other class because of cannibalize, and a paladin takes some work too. It's not a class like a monk or warrior where you can just hit autoattack and concentrate on playing your shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Talista</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've duo'd with a Paladin and it's fine, but as has been stated here, the dmg output is just lacking.  Expect things to take a bit longer.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Don't totally discount an Enchanter either. At higher levels they can make awesome partners for Paladins without having to push Canni every 6 seconds. That's what I've heard anyway... never seen it myself.<br />
<br />
One of the big problems with hybrids is they eventually run out of mana because if you're using them like you should be (ie. Making them hit stuff) then they're not medding up. Having an Enchanter/Bard gets that licked.<br />
<br />
Plus, if you get an add mez is a lot less hassle than playing with root.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Purtyoogly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i can imagine that this combo would be very sucessful in Karnors Castle in the basement area since its all undead there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have duoed with my guild leader 58 pally and we did fine.  Get the dog out and maybe toss in a DoT here and there and your set.  It does take longer than say with a monk but you dont have to heal all the time.<br />
<br />
Any other race is a good duo with a shaman.  We just rock. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Pally/shaman rocks.  Pally is one of the few classes that can keep agro off of us consistently, along with SK, and still remain standing when they do.  When duoing with a pally, I can dot as much as I like, and never worry about agro.<br />
<br />
If you have a high-end equipped pally, damage output is fine.  However, failing that, your kills will be just a wee bit slower than shaman/warrior (which is also slow).  Just make the Pally hold taunt, and spend most of the fight making mana for more dots, and it's all good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zanja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My roommate is a Paladin so I have duoed with one since level 10 or so. Paladins are a good complement to Shamans. Their heals and hp/ac buffs are damn nice and they are not bad at the damage output really. Finding a nice undead spot to duo is very nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Agreed, especialy if you pack a slow stick from Chardok for the gimpy low blues.  <br />
<br />
Was with our 60pal in guild in Umbral watching him just DEVASTATE the Undead there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Umgrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you are partnering with a WELL outfitted pally, it can be amazing experience in the right areas.  I partner quite frequently with my roommate, he is a 60 pally with slay 3, lance of thunder (52 dam, 46 delay), and primal.  Needless to say, damage output is not an issue.<br />
<br />
I think the classes compliment each other well.  We have said to each other several times that we are glad we picked the classes that we did, because they mesh so well together.<br />
<br />
Be sure to fight undead if your pally is slay enabled, it can make a huge difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">hey Talista! /wave<br />
<br />
didn't know you posted here :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Muktuk Wolfsbreath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">In my experience it's a pretty good duo, but my favorite thing about paladin/shaman is that you can build a really strong group around you. The shaman keeps everyone buffed and healthy most of the time, but the paladin is there with heals or hands for the occasional rough spot (like when the shaman pulls 4 krups). When things are routine, the paladin is doing damage instead of sitting around. Cleric schmeric, chanter schmanter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Damage output is no problem anymore since I picked up my Narandi's Lance, nor is taunt. My sister's boyfriend, one of my usual partners, plays an epic 60 monk with T-Staff (I hated that thing before I got my lance...) and a slew of damaging AAXP skills, and with the Narandi's I only ever have to cast a stun to taunt off him once at the beginning of the fight, then aggro is all mine--especially if the lance procs early on. Toss in Divine Might (65pt casted weapon proc) or Instrument of Nife (245pt undead only proc) and I do pretty well on the damage side of things. And yes, I do plan on eventually getting Slay Undead3 and playing around with the Shissar int he Grey, KC basement, etc... ;) One of the reasons I wanted a partnering class was for the AAXP grind. I didn't feel like dragging my usual partners out to The Grey, Scarlet Desert or Fungus Grove for those endless boring hours where I'll be grinding away because of my weird work and class schedule, and wanted a class I could have fun with when I wanted to step away from the Paladin. <br />
<br />
As for Mana concerns, I have access to KEI on demand and can med on my Holy Steed (first class AAXP I plan to go after) while clicky-helmhealing Trip as she Cannibalizes, plus it's not too difficult to get some Flowing Thought items on both characters (FT3 boots from CT, the FT2 book off of Zelthinak in Umbral and an Earring of the solstice for Trip, Earring of the Solstice, FT2 Narandi's Crown and a FT2 Grodan's Cape for Kryss, both atop Mental Clarity). Any buffs I use on my Paladin are clicky-buffs (Symbol of Pinzarn, Daring, Shield of Words) and wouldn't cost me any mana at all, and what mana I do use is easily regained in less than a minute with KEI--even when I'm chainstunning gating casters.<br />
<br />
Plus, out of all the other classes I've played, Shaman is the only one I can enjoy after playing a Paladin. Warriors are bland, Shadowknights are pretty much the same as Paladins but less versatile in saving the group or raid while being more damaging (fair trade off in my opinion), Monks and Rogues were boring, Casters (Mages, necros, enchanters, wizards) were decent, but again lacked a lot of the versatility I'm looking for. Clerics are nice, but I didn't want a bot. Shaman on the other hand was a challenge, worked well with the Paladin, added to the DPS, buffs stacked and seemed like a pretty powerful duo. Not to mention, a fun class to play as your main as well.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for all your input :) I just restarted Trip on a second account last night and have been playing a round abit with the Paladin parked nearby for an emergency heal or two when needed.<br />
<br />
Edit: Also, to give you an idea of my usual EXP group -<br />
<br />
Epic 60 Monk, KEI-able 60 Enchanter, 58 Cleric, Epic 58 Druid -or- Epic 54 Bard and myself, with the Monk/Chanter occasionally three-boxing his 54 Druid to fill us out when we have the Epic bard with us. We're all pretty-well geared</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm a 60 paladin and my wife is a 60 shaman. <br />
<br />
We complement each other very, very well. We can take on mobs that a cleric/warrior, shaman/monk, or shaman/warrior combo would have no chance at. A monk is going to generally be a better partner for fast xp, simply due to damage output, but the PAL/SHM duo is much more flexible and a hell of a lot tougher. Paladins don't have nearly the damage output of monks, but the amount of mana we save the shaman by allowing them to cann constantly allows THEM to make up the difference with dots.<br />
<br />
Generally we try to save my wife's mana for damage output and slows. Most of our healing comes from regen and CC. This leaves my wife free to stack dots, cann back mana, buff, and slow. <br />
<br />
My wife doesn't have to worry about aggro from slows or dots, she can pile em on right off the bat. A quick stun, and the mob is mine for good.<br />
<br />
All of our buffs stack, the only thing we are missing as a duo are ports, corpse summons, snare, damage shields, and clarity.We very rarely die.<br />
<br />
Basically, a paladin and shaman duo is tough as nails, has most of the bases covered well, and can go almost anywhere and fight almost anything. You cannot find a better partner for a paladin. A monk might be a better partner for a shaman. It all depends on what your priority is. If you want fast xp, go monk. If you want to be able to take down big targets, go paladin.</div></div><hr />

Good point. I'd forgotten that when a dragon construct showed up in Dragon Necropolis and my paladin friend and I fought it, it took forever to land a slow, but he was able to fire off heals over time while I worked on it. Paladins are freaking indestructible, which is nice given that shaman do their best work slowly and efficiently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">didnt read through all the posts, so if its already been said, whatever<br />
<br />
Paladins are pretty good.  They have stuns for one, which is nice.  The also have heals and hp buffs, which are ok.  If the click heal your talking about is deepwater helm, forget it.  Its to slow and doesnt heal enough, waste of time.  I wish they could snare, but unfortunatly they dont really help us there.  As far as their dammage output, it all depends on the gear.  Might not be the best combo, but its better than a pet (laf).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Sounds like a great combo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I've played with a lot of pallys, and really have come to love their helmet heals, celestial heals, and ability to keep a taunt.  <br />
<br />
The tricky part about shamans and pallys is that they both take radical jumps in power at certain levels.  Shaman's radical jump(discounting malo) comes with torpor at 60.  Pallies can seem very low damage until they get really great weapons, and if they don't have celestial heal yet either, can seem like they really don't contribute a lot.<br />
<br />
But even pairing helmet heals with a shaman who doesn't have torpor yet can make a nice difference.  And celestial heal to a pre-torpor shaman is godly.  It doesn't suck to a shaman with torpor either, but it isn't as dramatically empowering.  Besides regrowth, shaman heals are actually pretty miserable at high levels before torpor.  Pally can help a lot with that.<br />
<br />
When you get a torpor shaman and a well-equipped pally, you can be pretty confident.  You still won't generally get the experience you will get if you were with an equally well-equipped monk, because experience groups are more about fast damage than being able to survive forever.  Experience groups tend to seek out weak, low hitpoint mobs.  So monk does better there.  But when a pally FINALLY gets around to putting out significant damage, it's a relief to everyone, and he becomes a really good partner.  Shaman casting haste on him helps a LOT.  <br />
<br />
Undead mobs help a lot, too. ;)  I envy anyone who groups with paladins vs. the undead once they get their AA skills and good equipment.</div></div><hr />
