Watch for good deals and buy them up and turn around and sell them for a profit.   Its really not hard once you get started and it takes little time away from your xp'ing.  Just check out the baz when you log in, then head out to xp, check it again when you get ready to log.  Buy what you find at really good prices and then put them on your trader while you sleep.<br />
<br />
I find spells are usually a good way to make quick cash,  just be sure to do a bit of research first on what is in demand and what going prices are.<br />
<br />
Check NPC merchants too.  As I'm typing this I have a mule in bazaar now.  Today I've sold 4 Chitinous Belts for 750pp (everyone else is at 800+) each that I picked up off an NPC merchant in Fungus Grove for about 10 pp each.  You never know what you'll find on NPC's at times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ill have ot back this up too , knowledge of what sells for what price and buying low adn selling high is probly going to make you the cash the fastest adn easiet way. You can also  do mind numbing camps like HHK  or fight for HG's in Rathe , you can go to  Crystal Caverns and famr velium blocks and sell them in the bazaar to , but thats kinda unfair to swipe such a highly used adn good  30-40 level spot so you can buy some toys  , thats my angle anyway.<br />
<br />
Umm , other then that i cant think of anything , wait till LoY comes out and see what pops up.<br />
<br />
Oh i just remember , The Forest giants in Burning woods inst a bad lil spot for cash too and at your level itll be XP . Oh and Ice giants in everfrost  , but they are ever-camped :(<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />
