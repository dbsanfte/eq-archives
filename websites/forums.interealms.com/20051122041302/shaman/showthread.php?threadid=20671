	<p>Heres something to tick yu off on a fine thursday morning<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" /><br />
Congratulations. You have invited an Enchanter to your group. I'm not a bot, as evidenced by the fact that I left the safe confines of PoK. None of my hotkeys advertise the fact that my buffs are indeed extended. I didn't ask you to initiate a group invite via trade window. <br />
<br />
Just because my class is superior to your own, doesn't mean that I'm unwilling to adapt to the classes, play-style or comfort level of your group. I'm really very adept at increasing the efficiency of your group in a multitude of ways. <br />
<br />
Some of you will need to review some of the basics of group dynamics and tactics. I mastered most of these at Orc 1 in East Commonlands. Some took me awhile longer, but I got them down on Orc Highway in Oasis. I no longer have the patience or desire to reinforce these at go-time. The group is trying to kill stuff right now. And if I gently reminded you about these constants of life inside the game, you'd only exploded defensively--"Don't tell me how to play my class!" <br />
<br />
Assist. GDI, Assist! It's not hard. Make a hotkey. Love it. Use it. That mob that is drooling on itself while you smash his buddy is standing there senseless for a reason. I put him in timeout. He's not tying his shoes. He'll still be there after the one that the MA is wailing on is dead. It is not a testament to how sneaky you are that you can get a free shot on him while he's not looking. In fact, he will run straight at me after you whack him, and I have more important things to do right now than stun him off and put him back into timeout. <br />
<br />
Assist is not an optional rule. Yes, he's beating on the cleric. That's my job. The cleric will be ready to heal you in a few seconds. Just keep helping the MA. <br />
<br />
MA? This refers to the Main Assist. This is the ONE PERSON with the authority to pick something to whack on. All other mobs in the world BELONG TO ME. I own them until the MA has bludgeoned his to death. This is imporatant: ALL JOO MOBS ARE BELONG TO ME! <br />
<br />
That means that the mob hovering dangerously close to the group is MINE. That means the one beating on me is MINE. That means anything pulled into camp is MINE. As a group we have designated the one individual who can chose one of my many mobs to play with. <br />
<br />
Let's talk about this MA again. He's special. Whatever he is hitting is the RIGHT MOB. Are you not sure which mob you should hit? It's the one that he is swinging at. Did I mez the mob he was hitting? Then I was wrong. I'll be retargeting and mezzing something else. It happens. <br />
<br />
MA, yes you with the plate mail, don't switch targets. Once you've locked in on a victim, stick with it. I'll deal with whatever chaos ensues afterward. <br />
<br />
Okay, I know it's against tank instincts to let the cleric take a beating. Okay, you trust me to deal with it myself. Let's cover another, even more likely scenario. I will get beaten on. Mobs don't like me. You may have seen the Wanted Poster we looted off the last mob. Yes, that was my picture. Mobs hate enchanters. When they beat on me, DON'T SAVE ME. I can take care of all of you, and I can take care of me. You will surely kill me if you try to hack up a mob I'm locking down. I don't want your help. I have a panic button that I'll hit if I really want your help. I think I've used it twice in the last couple of years. <br />
<br />
Mr. Cleric. Guess what. I am going to need a heal. Don't sneer at me from behind that plate armor you're wearing and bitch about wasting mana on an enchanter. I do take into consideration your mana. My mana and your mana are group assets now. If I need a fast heal after locking down four or five mobs, so be it. Mana to throw me an occasional heal is far less than the mana you will expend healing our tanks with five unslowed mobs running rampant through the camp. <br />
<br />
Oh, where is my Virtue? Don't want to waste a peridot? Click off C5. How much to do you pay for a group cast of C3 from my whore brethren? Are they here to haste your group so mobs don't last as long--to keep those precious red lines from dropping as far? Suck it up. I'm not a wizard with no idea how to control aggro. I'm going to get it sometimes. Often on purpose. <br />
<br />
Tell me again what I can't do? I can't pull? Let me bag my BCB and give the warrior a chance then. He's an excellent puller. He can single or double everytime. It's a good idea to have your tank or a DPS class out of the party on a consistent basis. I enjoy the time we spend together, even if it is at less than optimal experience. <br />
<br />
My bad, did I imply that enchanter wasn't DPS class? Sorry, that hasted, dual-wielding monstrosity that outdamages the party as a whole doesn't count, right? But you don't like it when I charm anyway. I need a couple of heals when it breaks. He tends to break charm at inopportune times. Um...stun...and let's get this thing back under control so we can continue raping this dungeon or camp. <br />
<br />
Hey all you dotting classes: Stop dotting the incoming pulls. The six-second mezzes don't make me happy. Especially if I've started debuffing. Find the one that belongs to the MA and dot to your hearts' content. Leave my mobs alone. Oh, but it's snared? Great, but I'm not a bard. I can't cast while running. <br />
<br />
For you combat innate junkies...I only have eight slots for spells. That's about ten shy of what I need to do everything I'm expected to. I admit that I lack permanant illusion. So NDT / Boon is a dedicated slot. Unlike other casters, I don't have to select from 'little nuke', 'big nuke', 'ungodly nuke', 'malo' and 'snare' and scrounge the spell book for three more spells to make everything look nice in my UI. If others in your group (surely not you) are making my job difficult then I'm loading root instead of your werewolf form. Sorry for that. But suck it up. <br />
<br />
No, you don't know which spells I should have loaded. Talk to the cleric who is chaining Celestial Heal on the tank and complains that he is OOM from CHealing. <br />
<br />
When I miss a timer for a rebuff, wmp is not really neccessary. I do understand my role. Mana ALWAYS permits for haste. If I have to click off Rune and chew a mod rod to get it back up, there is always mana for haste. Even more so than mana regen in most cases. Don't be shy. "Haste, bitch!" works just as well. <br />
<br />
Rangers and Necros - Aggro kiting, fear kiting, snare kiting, bow kiting...these are all excellent methods of crowd control. I am not arguing the utility of these techniques. I wish I had snare. But these are great ideas IF we have decided that this is how we're gonna operate BEFORE I have locked down, tashed and slowed mobs. Bad news for me. My aggro > Your aggro. If you insist on running dotted mobs all over the zone, please do solo. Don't let them run free in circles around camp, triggering my response of locking them down. Not nice to tease the chanter. Especially when I let you get eaten because I thought you were still just "bored" and "playing with the mob". <br />
<br />
btw, Wake the Dead makes me smile. <br />
<br />
IF you have explained to me that my job will be to just slow everything and nuke when I have mana, don't bitch when your technique of TRAIN-ROOT-KILL gets you killed. I said I could adapt. Yes, I'll be mezzing the rooted casters, but it's your ballgame and I'm gonna play by the rules. This method is kinda fun, but big boy rules, big boy hammer. <br />
<br />
Lastly, I put away those "MEZZING %T." and "%T is MEZZED" hotkeys around level 45. I don't appreciate macro spam in group, so I try not to add to it. I don't care what nuke the wizard is using. I don't care what god the cleric invokes for healing. <br />
<br />
If you see many mobs coming to camp, the MA will whack something and I'll take the rest. I don't feel the need to walk you through crowd control, mob by mob. Don't just whack whatever is closest to you. Don't whine that I didn't SAY I was mezzing it. How do you know I'm gonna mez something? Because it's running around in my camp. And it's not the designated target. (See MA above) I do have a set of macros saved to put these hotkeys back in for the benefit of the group. But c'mon. How different are the basics when pulling Orc 1 from Level 65 LDoN Hard? Just different models. <br />
<br />
If you can't do the simple things, I going to let you die. None of that fancy, "You break it, you buy it~" nonsense. You will see your bind point if you can't play well with the chanter. Being relentlessly tell-spammed for C3 has made me a bitter, nasty toon to deal with. <br />
<br />
Good Hunting. <br />

	<p>nah he got one single (minor) thing wrong<br />
<br />
"When I miss a timer for a rebuff, wmp is not really neccessary. I do understand my role. Mana ALWAYS permits for haste. If I have to click off Rune and chew a mod rod to get it back up, there is always mana for haste. Even more so than mana regen in most cases. Don't be shy. "Haste, bitch!" works just as well."<br />
<br />
there isnt any mana for haste when for the 3rd pull in a row the puller yanked 5 mobs.<br />
<br />
and why the hell would you click off a rune to use a mod rod? you get the mana either way and if it eats your rune so much the better.<br />
<br />
<br />
but man what a beautiful post.</p>

	<p>Now that is funny. I like this bit;<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />Hey all you dotting classes: Stop dotting the incoming pulls. The six-second mezzes don't make me happy.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>I duo with a chanter friend <b>Revere Idlehands</b> and until the new graphics changes for spells made it really easy to spot. I used to dot mobs he had mezzed just to keep him on his toes. <img src="images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt="" title="big grin" smilieid="4" /><br />
<br />
Enchanters are a great class I think if I ever get bored of Hal then I'll be creating an enchanter. Charm is such a good spell if you've got the guts to use it. I think enchanters fall into two camps those that play safe and don't push their limits, and those who use all their power and will charm mobs at the drop of a hat. My friend falls into the second camp and it makes for much fun and excitement.<br />
<br />
At my level I'm still getting lots of fun out of older content and going to places as a duo where we used to raid. We were in kael arena last night me with my dog and him with his pet giant. There's nothing like watching a charmed mob that's been hasted tearing into a slowed mob.<br />
<br />
Ofcourse from time to time and we get our arses kicked when charm breaks at the wrong time. HoH heros hasted spring to mind <img src="images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt="" title="big grin" smilieid="4" /> but where's the fun if there's no risk?<br />
<br />
[edit - Revere reads ths Shaman boards, and moaned that I didn't name check him.... <b>Are you happy now Rev?</b>  <img src="images/smilies/tongue.gif" border="0" alt="" title="stick out tongue" smilieid="6" /></p>

Other than the inevitable chanter-ego flavor, hilarious post.  Guys, a lot of the posts here would probably sound that obnoxious, too, if we had something as overpowered as charm at our disposal.  Or hell, even if slow was worth the trouble it's given us in a lot of these newer zones.</p>

	<p>Personally time permitting I'll slow a mezzed mob and cripple it twice. Guaranteed to go for me not the chanter when mezz breaks, only works on the 1st mezz though, after that it's to much trouble to get back to the top of the list.<br />
<br />
The only issue I have with the article is that 1 out of 1000 will actually CHARM a death dealing mob, so yes for the most part chanters are a zero dps class not counting haste (which is substantial not arguing that, but shaman can add 60% themselves which caps most people anyways).<br />
He's talking about himself and his skills but he's not necessarily representative of the chanter horde either.</p>

</i><hr size="1" /></blockquote>Actually that's not entirely true; even without charming, enchanters can apply DPS in two ways:<br />
<br />
1) regular pet -- it won't tank for you, but geared up and hasted its nothing to sneeze at<br />
<br />
2) nukes -- the top 2 enchanter nukes are 1210 for 330 mana (8 second recast) and 1100 for 300 mana (8 seconds recast) -- both pretty good.  They have long recast times, but you can keep both memmed and use them one after the other if you like.<br />
<br />
As an enchanter, you won't be putting out mage or wizard dps, but they're quite a bit better at the DPS game than we are in the short haul.</p>

and why the hell would you click off a rune to use a mod rod? you get the mana either way and if it eats your rune so much the better.<br />

<br />
but man what a beautiful post.</i><hr size="1" /></blockquote>IIRC, there was a time when you wouldn't get any mana from a mod rod if a Rune blocked the damage it did when you clicked it.  I don't know for absolute sure, I wasn't playing back then, but I've been told by a couple of chanter friends that that was the case.  If that is indeed the case, then it's been changed.  Rune now just absorbs the mod rod damage but still grants mana.<br />
<br />
I had to be careful with this before my chanter alt hit 61 and got the reagent free Rune.  Burning 11 plat on a rune just to have it eaten by a mod rod is annoying.  <img src="images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt="" title="wink" smilieid="5" /><br />
<br />
If that is indeed the case, then the guy who wrote this has probably been around a while.  <img src="images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt="" title="wink" smilieid="5" /></p>

	<p>This is one of those posts where "if the shoe fits ....".  A good shaman is a good friend of a chanter.  I have played a chanter since release, and I have slowly leveled a shaman to 61 in the past year or so.  When I play my shaman, I find myself appreciating the time I spent as a chanter.  And yes, this guy's delivery may be arrogant or abrasive, but chanters arguably die more than any other class, and unfortunately when you die to someone else's lack of play skill for FIVE years, it wears on you.  All in all, a good read.</p>

To that end, after you've cast your mez, and I've slowed all the mezees, I'm going to pick one, send it flying through the air with virulent paralysis, and dot it.<br />

Dot it several times actually.  Might even stick me dogpack on it, and if I'm bored, go hit it meself.<br />

My dots are made for a slow fight.  And there are all these tasty mobs here just waiting in line?  And I'm supposed to just stand and watch you make things glow?  *rolls her eyes*<br />

	<p>I agree with most of what Eriadoc says hehe my main is a 65 enchanter but I would say I like playing my shammy just as much as I do my chanter.  At this stage in the game, I have given up trying to be nice about people breaking my mezes.  I'm not a nazii about it but after 3 or 4 broken mezzes I start to get pretty annoyed.  I mean come on if you haven't learned to assist after 65 levels then I don't want you in my group.<br />
<br />
Chanters are a 0 dps class? lol ok.  I have maxxed fury of magic mastery and can chain nukes that crit for over 2600.  I'm not doing quite as much damage as a wizard, but that doesn't make us a 0 dps class.  Last time I checked I could outnuke my shaman no problem.<br />
<br />
Anyway, its been a while since I've been back here hows it goin guys <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title="smile" smilieid="1" />  Looks like there are still a few that have deep rooted resentment towards chanters for some reason lol.  The original post was a joke!  I thought it was hillarious, good read.  Take it with a grain of salt please guys!</p>

	<p>I play an Enchanter and Shaman. Prefer the Shaman because as quite aften happens in groups if someone goofs and I have to take a whoopin at least my Shaman can take it better. Loved this guys post as I can relate to it and I also have always gotten a kick out of the fact that most if not all good Enchanters feel that they have to take direct control in bad situations in order to ensure group survival.<br />
<br />
Come to think of it....I have seen many experienced Shaman on this board state the same thing. Just goes to show ya that those folks who have the ability to de-fuse a bad situation tend to get very territorial about it. Bards also get annoyed if interrupted in trying to bring order to chaos. Most times a simple bit of communication will allow all the CC folks to work together. An experienced player is gonna react fast and let folks know what he is doin. If on my Enchanter and the Shaman or Paladin for that matter want to handle an add I let them. They can both tank, kill, and heal themselves if needed. Just let me know and have at it....but then I am pretty casual as long as I do not have too many mobs running around loose.<br />

	<p>The only thing that bugs me with this is the title "Y[o]u give a chanter a meter, and they take a mile."  Besides the o -- the saying is an inch (not a meter).  At least you could have said give them a meter and they take a kilometer.  <br />
<br />
As far as a commentary on it goes, I've witnessed many level 65 players to which this would be new and helpful information (how sad is that?).</p>

	<p>We need to go back to the time *before* someone invited said enchanter to enter the group.<br />
<br />
First, when lots of mobs showed up, contrary to popular opinion, we didnt all take an instant trip to our bind point.  Thats right, we all pulled tricks out of our collective bags, and engaged in crowd control.<br />
<br />
The bard mezzed things, or off tanked them, or charmed them, or (in rare cases where it was safe to do so) sent them back to their bind point.<br />
<br />
The mage, after taking that one nasty hit, brought his pet over and taught that mob what-for.  The mage pet often gets the mob dead or near dead before Ive made it there to slow it.<br />
<br />
The wizard stunned the mob and rooted it off into a corner.  Or maybe the wizard and the mage are engaging in some AoE fun.  <br />
<br />
The not main assist melee class?  Shes off taking down the mob.  I helped her out with a slow, and shes doing fine.<br />
<br />
The necro used a pet, or rooted, or FDd the agro onto a tank.<br />
<br />
The shaman?  Shes rooting, or root tossing, or aoe slowing, or single target slowing, or healing that wizard, or just drawing agro away from other classes while they get a handle on things.  <br />
<br />
We all did something more than stand and cry "It's hitting me!  It's hitting me!  Make it stop!" <br />
<br />
The point is, BE, thats Before Enchanter, we had all sorts of ways to deal with multiple pulls and adds.  And these ways were fun.  They involved using different skills, taking chances, and the added spice to the game.<br />
<br />
Then this mouthy enchanter showed up.  Yeah yeah yeah.  As you point out, the Main Assist approach to taking down mobs tactic is basic.  At this point it is even easy.  What it is not is all that terribly interesting or fun.  That is, unless you are the enchanter.  The enchanter has some excitement in getting things under control.   For the rest of the group its just a dull grind.  Perhaps even a safe *shudders* dull grind. <br />
<br />
While the enchanter plays prima donna, the rest of the classes are expected to croon softly in the background, pretending that they dont know the main harmonies, and lack the music for the tune called crowd control. <br />
<br />
Ive been playing this game a long time, and I do not need to practice my main assist basic level tactics.  When the mobs hit hard enough or fast enough that it matters, we can go back to playing that way.  <br />
<br />
But for mobs that do not, and there are quite a few that do not, I refuse to just stand there watching them stand in a drooling line, waiting for the main assist to get to them.  There is just no need for it.<br />
<br />
The group is more efficient at killing if I'm dotting something that no one else is hitting.<br />
<br />
To that end, after you've cast your mez, and I've slowed all the mezees, I'm going to pick one, send it flying through the air with virulent paralysis, and dot it.<br />
<br />
Dot it several times actually. Might even stick me dogpack on it, and if I'm bored, go hit it meself.  And if youre being hit by it, then MOVE.  Because I guarantee that I can hold the agro if you do.  (In fact, Ill hit my hotkey if you like.  %T is now rooted and rotting.  Attack something else, %T is mine.  If youre being hit MOVE.)<br />
<br />
If Im feeling particularly manaful, Ill grab another and root it off too.<br />
<br />
My dots are made for a slow fight. And there are all these tasty mobs here just waiting in line? And I'm supposed to just stand and watch you make things glow? *rolls her eyes*<br />
<br />
Yeah, that was me breaking your mez. I have to do that before Dogdog can.<br />
<br />
At bottom, this EQ thing is a game.  And I play games to have fun.  As do the other 4 members of that group who grabbed a pick up enchanter and got a god complex instead.  <br />

At bottom, this EQ thing is a game.  And I play games to have fun.  As do the other 4 members of that group who grabbed a pick up enchanter and got a god complex instead.  <br />
<br />
SisterLi Salvation</i><hr size="1" /></blockquote>I am somewhat in agreement.  There is a place for mezzing, just not every mob in every circumstance.  Mobs you just cant handle more than one of a time?  Pleased to meet ya, mr/mrs chanter.<br />
Trash mobs we can tank 4 at a time?  Please save your mana and your outrage at the broken mez.<br />
We took a few groups to chardok b to kill Korucust on our raid night (I still want that darn ring!) a week or so ago.  An enchanter friend of one of the clerics came along.  We normally do this without any enchanter, and even the bards dont bother mezzing, its soloable trash mobs on the way.  Naturally, the enchanter started mezzing mobs that were already offtanked, slowed and half dead.  Screaming started after 2 mez were broken and the enchanter hadn't been touched once.<br />
<br />
But for the original post, a fun read.  Its intended to be tounge-in-cheek, no bad mojo from me <img src="images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt="" title="big grin" smilieid="4" /></p>

On the other hand though, I was in an LDoN normal the other day, and the pick-up chanter we grabbed was whining about breaking mez. Heh I just told him to stop mezzing, cause it really wasnt necessary (rest of group was strong). I broke most of the early mezzes myself with Tears, heh.</p>

	<p>Ja, die enchanter man is a girly man, shakes his skirts so the mobs are dizzy. Then I goes and hits them with malos club and malosinia club and shove some bugs down their shirts to slow them--makes them mad at me and I can take their anger. I like their anger.

	<p>I can definitely agree there is a place for mezzing and some of the time its not even worth bothering with ie. normal ldon.  I was talking about places like Tipt, Vxed or Kod Taz+ where if you break mez cause you arent paying attention or whatever the chanter dies, your group might wipe and you just wasted 2 hours of 6 peoples time.  I guess its just cause I have been doing a lot of tipt and vxed lately lol</p>

	<p>Quick fun with a bitchy enchanter (from a Beastlord angle, works fine for Shaman, too)<br />
<br />
1) Inevitably, a bitchy enchanter is one who will mez anything that's swinging. i've met a few that will repeatedly mez the MA's target, just to be safe. Now, these folks are the ones that learned at Orc 1 and Orc Highway that their jobs consist of mez, and mana. Thus they tend to be a little slow.<br />
<br />
2) Take one of their mexxed mobs... Slow it, cripple it, then cast your lowest-level poison DoT (highest disease Dot works too, same aggro and lasts longer!) Congratulations, you now have a mob on you.<br />
<br />
3) Laugh as the chanter re[eatedly mezzes, maybe even roots, while the mob is trying to hack on you, and doing almost nothing, because it's such a peice of crap mob that it didn't need to be mezzed in the first darned place.<br />
<br />
4) Rub it in their face how darn good a tank you are.</p>

	<p>Funny chanter story. Had a chanter in our group one night in POD when I was in my early 50s leveling up. She would unload all her debuffs and nukes at the start of every fight and get killed every single damn pull.<br />
<br />
Later she went afk and didnt return for hours. We didnt care cause she would return to give us clarity and haste. Not too many adds and we had my cousins 65 rogue baby sitting us and i would root park and slow the adds anyway. She didnt die anymore and we were actually complimenting her that she played better afk hehe.<br />
<br />
When she came back she had dinged. She said it was her first ding in months that she was stuck at the level she was from dying so much.</p>

	<p>I think SisterLi's post has merit, except that she overlooks one major point in the original chanter's post -- he said he'd adapt.  If you wanna do all the alternate means of CC, just say so and he'll stop mezzing.  <br />
<br />
Yes, we all know everyone can do CC.  But to deliberately break mez and get the chanter killed is not doing CC; it's just plain stupid/inconsiderate/rude (take your pick).  Communicate ahead of time, and chanters, like shaman, have the tools to adapt to most situations.</p>

	<p>Broken mez does not always mean dead enchanter.  <br />
<br />
Really.<br />
<br />
Often after mez breaks, even with the tank taunting non stop, the mob comes after me.  Not a big deal, as I can take a few hits, but broken mez does not = dead enchanter.<br />
<br />
First, before I break a mez, I slow _all_ the mezzed mobs.  I figure that's my job.  I can have some fun after me work is done.  Even if something crawls out from under mez, it's likely to run after me rather than the chanter.<br />
<br />
Second, before I dot something, or smack it, I root it.  I'm not advocating killing the enchanter because s/he mezzed me mob.  Really.  It is not a death penalty offense.  <br />
<br />
My obection is not to the enchanter mezzing as a tactic.  Although this enchanter begins by stating that he's adaptable, he goes on to say "MA? This refers to the Main Assist. This is the ONE PERSON with the authority to pick something to whack on. All other mobs in the world BELONG TO ME. I own them until the MA has bludgeoned his to death. This is imporatant: ALL JOO MOBS ARE BELONG TO ME! "  Nope.  I beg to differ.  <br />
<br />
Now this should be taken in context.  It's a rant placed on an enchanter board.  He admits that he's bitter.  Consider my rant an attempt to show him the other side of that coin.  A bit of truth comes out of both.<br />
<br />
Grouping with a charming enchanter is one of the funner experiences in the game.  The play is fast paced, but very varied.  You have to be constantly awake to keep the pet off the enchanter when charm drops, and/or the chanter upright and on her/his toes.  It's chaos for all, and quite fun as a result.  <br />
