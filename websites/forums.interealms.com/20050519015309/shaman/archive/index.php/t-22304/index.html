<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ademaro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Today in the OT I was looking for a group, but to my demise, couldn't find one. So, i got a little bored and went looking for trouble. <br />
<br />
Hehehe, well at first it started with a little chit-chat, but then a guildie dared me to attack a cliff golem and see what happens (im lvl 29) Of course I'm no fool, but we Barbarians are not the type to get taken for! So I go up to the GOlem and try to root it, of course he resists, so I start running like crazy. <br />
<br />
Then, this NPC Dark Elf comes out of nowhere and knocks me unconscience. D'oh! I jsut died. <br />
<br />
(1) I get back to my bind point where I last camped in the OT, and so I decided to go back and teach that Golem a lesson! I get back my armor and what not, and I look to see if that NPC is still there. No, he isnt there anymore, and neither is any other NPC. I root the golem again and start running, and as soon as I turn around. BOOM. Another NPC is there to kill me. <br />
<br />
(2) I get back and somehow, I got stuck in a corner, and my guy keeps falling in place. &quot;What the heck is happening!?&quot; I thought. After about 8 seconds or so, I find out that I died, and fell for 20,000 points of damage. i was like WOAH! <br />
<br />
(3) So, I get back my gear and decided that I should go to pok where it is nice and safe. Well, 5 feet away, I see an Iksar guy just sitting in the corner. I go up thinking it is a PC lfg, but to my dismay the thing attacks me! I could tell by it's spells and such that it was a Shaman Iksar npc, so I start running to zone ASAP, and I get rooted. A friendly Ogre Beastlord who just happened to be there tried to help me out, well needless to say I died <br />
<br />
(4). BY this time I my face is red and steam is coming out of my ears, all that precious exp I have been getting over hte past weeks has just gone down the drain. So, I get back into the OT and I find out the Beastlord zoned with 10% health left (typicall......) So I run to where I died, and I see that darned Iksar just sitting in that same corner, this time with 70% health. <br />
<br />
I'm like &quot;okay this is my chance&quot; I memorize all my spells, and I have 100% mana. I root him, disempower him, and then begin to nuke him with Frost Strike. When he got down to 2% health i became OOM, and at that point he reduced ME to 23 health. I run over and proceed to bash him in. He roots me and jolts off, at that point I get enough mana left to csat my final Frost Strike. I see my spell get casted, and I look at the Iksar fall down in frozen pain. Then I see the Beastlord zone in and congratulate me. <br />
<br />
Despite the fact that I lose more then 2 gold of experience, a smile escaped my lips. &gt;:-) dont mess an angry shaman!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hope you never try to do the iksar cudgel quest; you will kick yourself for making the extra faction work :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nah, Ive kind of shelved my shaman..I kept trying to get my epic for about a year and no luck..Im still stuck at the fear part..Ive yet to get into a good enough guild to pull it off and have died a gazillion times in pick up raids..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ademaro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">what server do you play on</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I play on the Drinal server..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ademaro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">oh ok, nvm im on Innoruk (i can never spell his name) but a sister guild of the Fellowship of Justice called Justice Eternal, and from what I know, they are trying to be a raiding type guild so more people would help them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You just killed the liddle Dai key leezard guy. =/  Hopefully, he was factionless.<br />
<br />
Iksar are your friends...they just don't know it yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">dont mess an angry shaman!<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually the message is don't mess with an iksar shaman, the one who almost toasted you 3(?) times is 4 levels lower than you are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Seremont</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Adem, did anyone mention that the Cliff golem is around level 60? (give or take a few levels) He's one of those mobs you just give a wide berth to, until you get uber enough to go solo him.<br />
<br />
As for the DEs, they come out at night and toast non DE folks, they're in their mid 50s or so and run at sow speedish.  Give them a wide berth hunting there as well. They're why most of the camps in OT are near the zonelines. hehe.<br />
<br />
OT's a fun place in the 30s, still get groups there for sure, I've got a 33 pally that's there if I ever want to play a straight up brawler.<br />
<br />
Good story though, sorry if you lost a significant amount of exp though.<br />

<br />
he only killed me once, the golema dnt he DE killed me before, plus he killed me when i didnt have my spells memorized. That is the onyl way an iksar can kill me!</div></div><hr />
