For those too lazy to click. basically if your account was created on a day when the servers were crapped. Like yesterday or day before. There will be an extension of your month. They have not decided how long this extension will be but MY guess is about a week.<br />
<br />
Either way..good times.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">So the regular WoW (not collectors) comes with a free month? Oh good I thought I heard it only came with 10 days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Works like this:<br />
<br />
If you bought wow regular or collector's edition you get the first month free (it's gonna be a little more than a month now)<br />
However the Collector's edition comes with a second trial CDkey that you can give to a friend. That cd key can let your friend play for 10 free days.<br />
<br />

<br />
Hope this helps<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd be quite happy to pay from the get go if the release was free from bugs/server issues and what not. Given the sorts of issues that these sorts of games typically have when they are released, not charging people for the first month is a sensible thing to do (and I imagine avoids all sorts of nasty legal issues relating to services paid for and not provided).<br />
<br />
I doubt that extending the billing start date will make a difference one way or another, its just a few bucks.</div></div><hr />
