<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Omniz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Our guild's trying to decide if it's worth giving this guy a shot in Acrylia.  So far all I've read is he hits for 1.3k, has an AE you should let monk take first then lookup on Lucy, has some adds that spawn during fight, and is a little above the difficulty of Emp.  We can field 40 people in early stages of VT gear.  <br />
<br />
So my main question for you shamans is if anyone knows if he's slowable, if he hits for 1.3k and is unslowable and has adds and what not then we probably won't be giving him a shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sanctifier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">His loot table is horrible, the quest after you get the 4th book is quite drawn out, and then when its all done you have just put 40+ people through a emp type setup with loot worse then emp crush. <br />
<br />
IMHO its not worth it, unless verant puts in a loot table similar to emp for him.</div></div><hr />

On my server with where we are we don't really have many choices for raiding with ~7 guilds in VT and PoP mobs being killed as soon as they pop by giant pickup raids, we like as many options as possible.  The loot would get used and it's something new, would like to try it at least once, just making sure it's within our reach.</div></div><hr />
