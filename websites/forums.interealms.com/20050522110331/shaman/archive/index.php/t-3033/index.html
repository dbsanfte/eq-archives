<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Many sites etc say the shmans are the best solo class and i dont disagree with that but they also say that they really dont stand out until around 30's, True?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Here's an excerpt from an article I found a long time ago, author  unknown.  It's titled &quot;Shaman-King of the Fighters&quot;<br />

<br />
edit:  Looked at its length, decided it was too awkard to put here, so I reposted the article and am now including a link.<br />
<br />
He has a lot of good points.  I found this article about the time Kunark was released, so it is woefully out of date.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">wow...longer than I thought it was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You could say 30's, you could say 51, you could say 60... Maybe Necro's for a better soloing class... although I practically soloed to 59, so I love the Shammy's soloing ability (Dragons, giant Turtles... we can do it all ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Depends on what kind of soloing you are talking about and what levels you are talking about.  At level 60, shamans are probably the best at soloing one, big melee-oriented mob that does not need to be pulled, like WW nest dragons or lodi (if you can steer clear of the KSers).  Other classes are better at soloing for xp (necros, druids, wizzies, well-equipped monks, DC chanters, possibly Rangers with a fair amount of AA), or mobs that are tricky to get solo (e.g. necros soloing Drusella Sathir or Phinny).<br />
<br />
<br />
There is no one class that is best at soloing, because there are so many diferent kinds of soloing and classes vary so much at different levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Aye, it just gets easier as it goes along.  34 marks a HUGE shift in our power and ability to solo things.  You'll find the level or two before we get our new pair of DoTs gets harder, as the old dots just don't quite have the efficacy they did when we first got them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">&quot;Shaman-King of the Fighters&quot;<br />
<br />
Isn't that Eduin's old article?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kieran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">To add to Gorre's post, I also soloed to 60 (only level I didn't get more xp solo than grouped was 56). The levels around 15-25 were probably the hardest of those, because I was wearing leather, still learning the game and our magical capabilities are pretty weak.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, if you're a solo type there is a huge drop-off in effectiveness post-49 because that's when our spell damage output reaches it's highest level. Getting a JBB is the most affordable upgrade to a soloer and can get you to 60 by itself.<br />
<br />
However, I wouldn't recommend it. You can't get your epic solo and without it at 60 you will be desperately short of damage capability. Soloing for cash to buy the 60 spells you need to continue soloing at that level (BoN, malo, torpo) will take you so long your eyes will bleed.<br />
<br />
I soloed to 60 because I had no other choice, and I have to say it was a fun journey. But at 60, it's wretched. 60 Shamans can and do solo brilliantly at that level, but it is important to understand that you have to be grouped a lot, and preferably be part of a powerful guild, in order to get the tools you need to solo at that level.<br />
<br />
I guess the point of all this is - WHY do you want a solo-capable character? Think carefully on this. Shamans are great, but as we progress more and more of our capabilities go into supporting others rather than raw offense. These days I'm mostly levelling a monk - the shaman only comes out on weekends when the US players are on, because without people to group with I can't make any progress.</div></div><hr />
