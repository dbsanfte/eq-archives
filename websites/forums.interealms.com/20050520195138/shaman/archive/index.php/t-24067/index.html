<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Aye, a chanter in my guild was whining this morning. I countered most of his arguments. Kept feeling like telling him to ST*U, but I didn't.<br />
<br />
He kept leaving out abilities that he could do. <br />
I was actually in a group with a different chanter while the guildy chanter was spouting off. When the chanter first joined the group, I had been Malosing and then Slowing (WoS mobs), they started tashing and slowing. Their slow would land before mine and mine would get resisted more often. But after a couple of slowing and then hitting my hotkey announcing it in group they stopped slowing, just tashing and mezzing adds (we had a warrior &amp; druid pulling at various times, most of the time would get multiples).<br />
<br />
How long is the cast time on their slow? I was Malosing as soon as I could (was in a valley of so couldn't see target far away). I know tash is quick.<br />
<br />
Edit: Got my first ever neg rep bump. Wish the person would've at least left a note as to what they disagreed with in my post or inform me where I'm wrong. I'd like to be enlightened. =)</div></div><hr />

Reading that hurt my head.  After 6-8 posts I had to stop as I felt myself getting dumber.<br />
<br />
Don't post in here if you're just going to flame, Enchanters do have a hard time getting a group for some reason. Maybe because we don't get uber shammy buffs. Eh I don't know.<br />
This killed me.  If it was humour, it was poorly phrased, if it was serious, this person lacks any hope of having a clue and are in danger of further contaminating the human gene pool.  What buffs do we have that reasonably compete with Chanter haste and mana regen for occupying a buff slot?  Jack and squat.<br />
<br />
The people who posted that all they do is add DPS and if they are uncomfortable with that all they can do is occaisionally offer some CC ... somewhere out there, the origional VI team is spontaneously combusting.  Well, nice that they don't feel that they should be relegated to a support role, but thats the origional role designed for them and having a main CC role in many situations is still fantastic for them.  These guys are still WAY better off than shaman were in GoD.  I feel so bad though that so many good enchanters I had played with are sharing a class with these guys.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Enchanters are able to Charm starting at level 12. (With a cap of 25).  To suggest this is not a core ability is to suggest that movement increase is not a Druid core Ability (SoW: 14), or Heal for a Shaman (Light Healing:9).<br />
<br />
The problem is not with Enchanter charming it is with the design of encounters. The paradigm switched from longer fights (by definition - slower) to quicker fights where &quot;burst DPS&quot; is key.<br />
<br />
I put forth that a Charmed, Hasted Dual-Wielding Pooka was not overpowered, because it took at least two to four people to maintain that pet.  (Snarer, Maloer, Spot healer, Enchanter). Now certain Shaman may claim &quot;I'm not here to support a pet,&quot; which begs the question - what do you do when a Magician or Necromancer is in the group? Do you not buff their pets? Or yours?<br />
<br />
Furthermore not every Enchanter felt comfortable with Charming. I know. (I didn't for about a month, then once I started (LDON) it was like a drug). It takes a modicum of &quot;skill,&quot; (Mostly fast reaction time, proper placement and a tendency to NOT panic or hit the wrong key) and more importantly AA's and equipment to handle the thing when charm breaks.<br />
<br />
THAT is the key. Any knucklehead can charm, it's handling a break that separates the good from the crappy Enchanter.<br />
<br />
Enchanters brought a lot to the table with Charm. I'm not arguing that. But inefficient nukes and even more inefficient DOTs (1 Shaman DOT &gt; 3 stacked Enchanter DOTS) mean that DPS wise, other than the Charmed Pet Enchanters don't bring a whole heck of a lot to the table.<br />

<br />
Your Enchanter friend is dead on correct.<br />
<br />
In a group everyone will have a higher mana regeneration than the Enchanter. It doesn't matter whether he is contributing to this. Everyone else gets their own mana regen on top of the Enchanter's.<br />
The Enchanter is only better off when he's solo and that is basically not an option for effective exping anymore nowadays.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I didnt like what they did to the enchanter class when the Lull fix came about.  (single pulls equal Snorefest for a class designed around crowd control.) <br />
<br />
Also remember Charming had one MAJOR Major improvement in Pop. Componentless Runes. Eldritch rune and arcane rune were what made charm overpowered. And moved it into the mainstream. along with the spirialing mudflation of HP gear for chanters.<br />
<br />
Then the charm nerf. <br />
<br />
I stopped playing one. And leveled up a Shadowknight instead. (Hot box mind you.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Having charm strip out half a mobs dps is asinine. All they have to do is return it to what it was originally not a permanant boost of chanter DPS power but a quick turn to our side boost then kill it. To fix it Make it fixed duration, if they have total domination three then it adds to the duration by a random amount. And then have 3-4 minutes where charm doesnt ungrey. So you cannot have a Hasted charmed pooka for hours at a time and chanters are back to the situational damage monsters that Control the crowd. <br />
<br />
But since I am not playing a chanter and have not for years as a main I do not feel like I am qualified to truly crusade for it. I am a shaman. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">When did Enchanters become a DPS class?<br />
<br />
Answer, in GoD.  They became the top dps class in the game.  They now have to deal with the &quot;hangover&quot; of being drunk with power (and almost essential on certain GoD trials) in one expansion and going back to playing a support role in the next.  <br />
<br />
However, based on their utility and remaining capabilities, I won't pull out a hanky for them just yet.  Even at 50% damage, before buffing, a charmed pet in a group is still a hell of an offensive weapon.  The only debate is whether the benefits out weigh the risks, but it can be used effectively.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">When did Enchanters become a DPS class?<br />
<br />
Level 12 when they got  thier first charm.  And did monster level damage till charm broke.<br />
<br />
Some 5 years ago. <br />
<br />
The problem was surviving when charm boke. And training the tanks to not hit the monsters. The old school chanters used snare and would burn rampage and a Rune but the runes ate dots so it just wasnt worth it. <br />
<br />
Enter PoP. And Componentless runes.  Also enter the land of the speed fight. With wide open areas and non aggro monsters. <br />
<br />
Then chanters became the death dealers in fact because any old chanter was willing to try it with the safty of the runes. <br />
<br />
Not everything that is done now was done back then. But I remember a fella name Enki that at one time used one named Vrs another in Lower guk. I also remember playing Pana and when stuff got nasty I would charm to turn the tide.<br />
<br />
I don't want to take a damn thing away from chanters. I want them in groups. I want them to have fun. I want them to kick ass and take names. I want them to be effective. <br />
<br />
And for people who bitch about being a support system for the chanter and thier death dealing pet o doom.. Well... Are not all raids support systems for the main tank? Keep the tank alive and you win. (While killing the monster of course)<br />
<br />
Why is it okay to support the beef but not the chanter instead. ?<br />
<br />
Play the game how it is fun for you. Some of the most fun I ever had was with a hasted duel weilding Frog of doom in Plane of storms. No tank. Just a swarm of people going every which way but loose when the frog broke. <br />
<br />
Now I like beating the snot out of stuff with the SK and keeping him alive with the shaman and friends. <br />
<br />
The charm nerf is asinine. They need to fix the system not patch it like they always do. At the very least make it a decent reason like the monster is fighting the charm and the urges of it's new master.  Just because should never ever be a reason.<br />

<br />
<br />
I dont know if thats the exact same thing. When i raid its in support of my whole guild and 50-70 peoples time. When keeping the main tank up i am or can do other things to contribute. But when in a group and i am one of six everyone wants to feel they contribute equally. Some hate the idea of being on pet duty and having to do that to get through a one group encounter. Ive never liked the idea of a pet being so powerful to take the place of multiple people in a group. Would you feel the same way about supporting a raid if the main tank was a chanter pet and you were told not to keep a real player alive all the time every raid but a npc pet?<br />
<br />
Now dont get me wrong ive never been cheering for the nerfs. If i want to try one group stuff without the charmed mob the option is still available to me so i never felt put out by it in general. I also still think they could come up with a better solution to fixing charm. Seems to be one way or another instead of maybe coming up with a revamp. Nerfing the damage but not the after effect hasted damage isnt right. Maybe make the mob have a hangever effect when coming out of charm to keep its damage at a lower level than also.</div></div><hr />

<br />
More like PoP where originally in many zones they could even charm the mini-named.  Right from the get-go of PoP chanters were solo farming BoT wing named - it was quite a sight.  However, it wasn't specifically chanters who got to benefit from the early PoP charming, they could just do it in about any zone.  Necromancers and mages were soloing AA's in 15 minutes.  It was a great time to leech xp indeed! ;)<br />
<br />
Even at 50% damage, before buffing, a charmed pet in a group is still a hell of an offensive weapon.<br />
<br />
I believe that the &quot;it's not a nerf&quot; charm nerf is bugged atm.  The charm nerf was supposed to cut the charmed pets maximum hit by 50%. However, chanters have noticed so far that the mobs max hit is actually based on mob level and is a fixed number far far less than 50%.  A charmed level 67 mob that would normally hit for 1k+ hits for 260ish, which is far less than 50%.<br />
<br />
There's a slew of info here: http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq?category.id=enchanter and http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Enchanters&amp;message.id=2674&amp;jump=true.<br />
<br />
They do have a legitimate complaint about the charm nerf though - specifically that their mobs aren't doing 50% damage but far less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I don't think it is useful to have so much glee at the misfortunes of others - even if those misfortunes are largely a matter of perspective.<br />
<br />
I expect that when things settle down a bit, 'chanters will find that they are perfectly viable group wmwners and they they have to spend about as much time LFG as any other class. Right now it can be tuff to get a group for anyone because there is only so many groups that WoS can support and it seems like everyone and his puppy is congregating there.<br />
<br />
It is a funny thing, and maybe its because Iam not uber enough, so I am never quite at the cutting edge, but I never have a particular mindset as regards &quot;must have&quot; classes for my group. I generally invite the first 5 warm bodies passing by and then see what we have. Sure, some combinations are easier, some are safer, some are faster and some are slower, but for general exp grouping, there are not many combinations that cannot be made to work somehow. <br />
<br />
So, although I am not happy because chanters feel that they have been phuqued over, I am not shedding too many tears either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I can sort of see their point. In a world of single pulls and high MR who wants to be little more than a buff/debuff bitch. The fact that shaman have already been there for quite a while isn't actually a countering argument.<br />
<br />
But yes, charm was broken and they're not going to get a whole heap of support from anyone. But SOE would do a lot better if, when they balance something, they also take a wider look at that classes role. Same as for slow mitigation and shaman.</div></div><hr />

Change &quot;'chanters&quot; to &quot;shammies&quot; and that's what other boards looked like during GoD (except SK.org)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I know this isn't going to be popular, but we are officially the kings of melee buffs again. Hi, damage modifier and increase to-dodge, plus haste plus FA?? We win over haste+atk buffs.<br />
<br />
Let the enchanters whine, they've been left behind this expansion just like we were in GoD.<br />
<br />
You're joking right?<br />
<br />
Which of these two lines would you pick?<br />
<br />
<br />
10 mana/tick................................................10% damage modifier<br />
Increase ATK by 239......................................170 ATK<br />
Increase All Resists by 65.............OR...............7% chance to avoid melee<br />
Increase Max HP by 793..................................680 Max HP<br />
<br />
Just remember that a 10% damage modifier is not a +10% dps increase. And a 7% chance to avoid melee won't translate into 7% as well. The fact that I'm comparing our hybrid's buff line to ours and I'm sitting here scratching my head because I'm not entirely sure which one I would prefer depresses the hell out of me. I don't care that our hybrid can't maintain buffs like these on a full raid because of mana. The fact that they have an equal or better line than us is just plain wrong.<br />
<br />
And it doesn't stop there.<br />
<br />
Rangers buff nearly as much as atk as us and they can do it with a mgb'able spell. Paladins buff way more hp than us. An enchanter can buff one third of the atk we can, give melee 70% haste and a cleave affect - all in one spell. By the way, that spell lasts for 42 minutes, not 6.5 minutes.<br />
<br />
The buffs in OoW bring us up to par with our hybrid, but they most assuredly do not make our buffs as meaningful as you would seem to think. And they sure as hell do not make us the king of buffs.<br />
<br />
The fact of the matter is this.<br />
-We need a long lasting, group Avatar, that not only has a 10% damage modifier, but also has additional affects like endurance regen and ferocity. The name on this spell is Champion. Previous spells were named Avatar. Make it live up to the name. Failing that, they need to upgrade the BST Avatar with a 10% damage mod, make it a long lasting group spell, and then trade Avatars with us.<br />
-We need effects like shielding or stun resist on focus. As it stands now, the only reason you'll take focus is for the measly 680 hp on it. When melee prefer to use a clicky shield effect over focus, baby shaman weep.<br />
-We need an upgrade to bih li; 63% run speed (just under SoE) with either 30-50 attack on it or strikethrough/accuracy.<br />
-We're one of only a handful of classes without a self-buff. SoE needs to upgrade our damn bear spell.<br />
-Add a cleave affect to Ancestral Aid, so that it not only heals our group's hp and endurance, but also lets the melee rain down critical hits.<br />
<br />
Even with all this, we won't be the king of buffing anymore. SoE has dilluted the potency of shaman buffs to the point that nobody would care if they had them around on a raid. In an era when tanks have 10k+ hp, 680 more matters very little. When melee have max atk, 140 more won't matter all that much more. And given that this is all we really have to offer in the buffing realm on raids, what does that say? Do you really think a 10% damage mod - which I repeat, will not be +10% dps - or a 7% melee avoidance buff will make up for our inadaquacies? No, it won't.<br />
<br />
We are not making up lost ground in this expansion on buffing because everybody else is running faster than us.<br />
<br />

chanters can solo damn near anywhere any time they like and are very very effective at it.<br />
<br />
as for the when did chanters become a dps class, yeah it starts at lvl 12 when you get your first charm. the ability to charm a mob that out dps's an entire group pretty much makes you a dps class.<br />
<br />
(edit) oh yeah that guy is a moron while charm may not be working correctly in oow that hardly makes chanters broken, the fact that hes a chanter who cant get a group tells me he sucks, I can get a group anytime I feel the urge usually in minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">What you have to look at is the BIG PICTURE, as it were.<br />
<br />
Yeah, charm got nerfed, and enchanters aren't happy.  I'm not, because my favorite alt is a 65 chanter, and we got hosed.<br />
<br />
Charm itself WAS overpowered, and it DID need to be adjusted.  But what you have to look at is the aforementioned BIG PICTURE.<br />
<br />
See, charm was about all chanters had LEFT.<br />
<br />
Before you go off on me, consider this:<br />
<br />
1:  Enchanters are the kings of crowd control, yes.  But today's camping strategy places that crowd control at the PULL, not the CAMP.  90% of the groups out there won't so much as THINK of doing a camp without a ranger, bard, or monk doing the pulling.  Just as the short fight goes against the very core of being a shaman, a long succession of single pulls goes against the very core of being a chanter.  This leaves most enchanters with very little to do but tash, slow, maybe toss a nuke (which is generally what we do if we're not down there meleeing the mob, like I do.  ;) )<br />
<br />
Auli, my chanter, commonly pulls when she's in a group.  If they're gonna put the CC in the pull, then dammit, I'm gonna be the one doing it.<br />
<br />
2:  Being that chanters are CC kings, SoE has MASSIVELY ripped the class of those very tools.  There is no upgrade to Word of Morrel, the PBAE short duration mez, usually an enchanter's last line of defense against a runaway mob.  They've linked the recast timers of the Omens PBAE stun to other stun-line spells so they can't be chained, eliminating the ability to chain stun to control crowds.  And mobs now have such high MR that attempting a mez before tashing is literally flipping a coin to see wether you live or die.  If mez lands, you live.  If it's resisted, you die.<br />
<br />
What was worse, they farmed out more dependable CC to another class, the Bard class.  Bard mezzes are much more reliable, harder to resist, and bards can stand up to a mob longer than an enchanter while they're trying to mez it.  And if they have the room, they can attempt a mez while running at bard speed, something an enchanter can't do.<br />
<br />
3:  The extreme duration of buffs like KEI and Vallon's virtually eliminates the need for the enchanter in a group.  KEI buffbot vendors in PoK are helping to kill the desirability of the class as a grouping option.<br />
<br />
This is why Auli NEVER sells KEI in PoK.<br />
<br />
4:  Enchanters suffered just as much as we did because of slow mitigation.<br />
<br />
5:  SoE literally &quot;stealth nerfed&quot; charm TWO DAYS before the expansion, and they DID NOT tell anyone.  They instead left it to the Enchanter player liaison to break the news to the Enchanter community that charm had been nerfed, and that was ONLY after an enchanter noticed the changes in charm on Lucy and started making noise on the EQ Live forums and the Runes, the Enchanter message board.<br />
<br />
Even now, SoE refuses to communicate with the enchanter community over the charm change.  The one thing they got from Brenlo was, and I quote:  &quot;This is not a nerf.&quot;<br />
<br />
6:  Charm was literally the last bastion of Enchanter abilities that SoE hadn't torn into little pieces and rendered either useless, mitigated, or nerfed.  And even that was itself nerfed over a series of expansions...first the xp penalty nerf, then the pet agro nerf, then the 4-man hate list nerf, and so on and so on.<br />
<br />
And now charm is nerfed again to the point where the risk versus reward makes it generally unwanted.<br />
<br />
Understand, not many groups are going to want a pet that takes 33% of the xp, hits only slightly harder than a mage pet, but then turns around and does its FULL DAMAGE when charm breaks and it goes after the enchanter.<br />
<br />
And the way things have evolved, charming a strong dps pet was one of the few things left that enchanters could do and do well, given that changing game philosophy and SoE's weakening or farming out of other Enchanter core abilities had reduced Enchanter effectiveness in what's always been an Enchanter's core abiilties.<br />
<br />
Bards are now more effective CC than enchanters.<br />
<br />
Shamans are better slowers, and can heal, which is a VERY big deal in OoW (thus why we're desirable once again).<br />
<br />
Beastlords now come very close to matching the dps a charming enchanter, but without the risk of a charm break.<br />
<br />
Enchanters can slow, and buff, and well, slow and buff.  All their other abilities are now greatly reduced.<br />
<br />
Most enchanters could live with this nerf IF SoE restored their ability to do CC.  Put reasonable resist modifiers on the OoW mezzes that would make the land reliably, introduce an upgrade to Word of Morrel, and stop the ridiculous recast linking of PBAE stuns, and many enchanters would be quite content.<br />
<br />
So yes, Enchanters are ticked.  And as a part-time Enchanter, I completely understand why and fully agree that what SoE did was raw.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In WoS u can survive without ench, but then ppl consider that as DL version 3 ( or maybe 2 if U discard PoN/PoD as version 2).<br />
<br />
Enchanters (or bards) are in no way required for those zones, shaman does great here as does a lot of classes.<br />
<br />
And whoever said they are essential for M1/M2 is just fooling himself. Those trials can be done with lots of different group setups not including an enchanter.<br />

Chanters whining about not getting groups anymore are just flat out lying. Charmed mobs in GoD, for example, was way over the edge. I'd like to see any other class in the game, who - even before GoD - would rack up solo XP like they did, with the charm. Probably only bards with their kiting abilities in the past were equal - or somewhat over them - in this area. Note that BOTH of these classes are actually SUPPORT classes, not primary damage dealers or whatever. They were drunk with power and now, suddenly, when they 'sobbered' up, they can't take the hangover anymore. Bah.<br />
<br />
Especially when their abilities were just put back to normal level in ONE area, while they still retain their full functionality in every other area, including the charm 'departement'. Last I heard the charm wasn't removed from the game, but toned to normal level. Imagine that, the charmed mob wont shred through opponents now within 1-3 seconds, but actually takes 6-9 seconds to do it. What a 'loss', indeed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Giac, I see your point, however, his statements are true.  <br />
<br />
1.  In Tactics, with the &quot;old&quot; charm rules, and anywhere else outside of oow btw, charm is still an extremely powerful way to solo.  Prior to oow, chanters had no problem charming for exp in many zones, at a very good pace.  This has not changed one iota.<br />
<br />
2.  Yeah, but to get the group aa exp you need a group.  :)  Obviously, there are times when you may not be able to get one together, or just prefer to solo.  They still have this option, most other classes do not or can not generate aa exp at that rate solo.<br />
<br />
3.  True.  If I were an enchanter I would not solo in oow.  KK, same can be said about a lot of classes.  Many druid and ranger spells are outdoors only which limits the zones they are most effective in.  Kiting, which many classes use to solo, is limited to areas that allow that style of play, again limiting where druids, rangers, necros, bards, etc. can solo.  Charm killing by necros and druids has always been limited to zones where they could find undead or animals (respectively).  Etc, etc.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but I just can't get to excited about limiting an enchanters solo ability in 8 zones (plus 4 instanced zones) when so many other classes can not solo at all, or are much more limited in the zones where they can solo well.  A chanter charm killing in HoH, Tactics, or the elemental planes will solo better than almost any other class.  So they took a hit in oow, kk, get a group or solo somewhere else.<br />
<br />
Oh, and yeah, I agree, they should get a self mana regen spell.  Seems silly that they don't.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">My whole point is that the Enchanter's argument about their mana regen is dead on correct. Whether or not the charm nerf was warranted is another thing.<br />
I do think that Enchanters have other things they can fall back on and unlike Shamans, they are very competitive in those areas(haste, mana regen, mezz, slow etc.), but I find it hard to justify them losing one of their main abilities after such a long time.<br />
<br />
Enchanters are definitely an overpowered class when they can use all of their abilities, but I think that nerfing that ability drastically without giving them something back, is wrong. <br />
If they gave them a self mana regen buff and made charm available in every zone, that would be enough compensation, though, imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Just on the note on the comment on use not haveing our own self buff:<br />

We actully do have our very own self buff, again thanks to a sony screw-up much early in the game (luclin wasent it?). Yes I am talking about Voice of the berserker. yep its self only sure its south of 60 (59 i think) and sure we have not seen a upgrade to that spell in a while, but it is still our self buff. now wether or not you use it is up to you but it is there. now a upgrade to it would be offly nice of sony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Kjell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Correct me if I am wrong, but isnt a &quot;nerf&quot; a change that impacts &quot;current&quot; spells/content (ie Monk mittigation, slow mittiagtion, etc).  It strikes me that SoE have tethered the chanters charm before it became WAY out of control, they have I believe made no changes that impacted on existing spells/content.<br />
<br />
I always saw charming/DC as a pretty overpowering ability, but once I spent some time in Tipt with a chanter charming I realised how trully obscene it had become.  The charmed pet was chewing through mobs in seconds(to the extent where slowing was pointless as the slow landed with the mob below 20%) and it took the beating FAR better than our EP warrior.  I dont care if it takes a couple of players to support the chanter, charmed mobs were NEVER supposed to out DPS an entire group.  (I even read a comment from a chanter on The Runes complaining that the &quot;nerfed&quot; pets couldnt even match the DPS of an EP rogue /cry)<br />
<br />
As for charmed pets doing &quot;slightly&quot; more DPS than a mage pet, the mage 66 pets hit for about 104, hitting for 250 sounds more than &quot;slightly&quot; more DPS to me.  Mages are balanced around their pets as we are around our slow, yet their pets do 1/2 of the damage of the &quot;nerfed&quot; Charmed pet and they dont get the CC, slow, charm, buffs, rune, root abilities of a chanter.  <br />
<br />
IMO they needed to make these changes to charm, it was always a situational form of CC, a way to turn the tide when things went bad and a source of burst DPS.  I still see the chanter as one of the most desireable classes to be grouped with, they have had a taste of godlike power and are struggling to come to terms with their newfound mortality.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What you missed is that gather mana has a long reuse and it actually costs experience as it is an AA. <br />
Mana taps works fine in Omens till they nerf it, but anywhere else it's highly situational, so that Enchanters aren't even memming it due to the recast time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Actually, Brenlo said this, which I thought was fairly eloquent:<br />
<br />
I understand that many enchanters are upset about this change to the way the spell works on Omens mobs and I can understand why.  However, this is a change to the omens mobs only, not a nerf to enchanters overall (as many are saying).  The fact that an enchanter's charmed pet could do more dps than half a group was never an intended function of charm.  Mobs have and will continue to scale in power faster than PCs.  They have to do so to keep the game challenging.  In order to even allow the use of charm against the more powerful npcs, we had to have some scaling.  <br />
 <br />
Now, risk VS reward has come up many times during the enchanters debate over this issue, the risk has stayed the same as it has been, that monster is going to put a beat down on you when it regains its senses, however the reward was inordinately high.  We have fixed that.  For the risk of having an add that can lay some smack down, which is always a risk and not an added risk by any means, you got to do a crazy amount of DPS.  Now you get to still do a crazy amount of DPS, but granted half of what it was before (which is still pretty close to 2 rogues bashing on the beasty) and the risk is exactly the same, which again is the same risk you face when just normal hunting, that you have an add, the same risk you face when someone breaks mez for that matter.  <br />
 <br />
So perhaps the fault lays with us for allowing you to have that crazy DPS for so long in other zones, but now we have had to decide if we can let it continue as the mobs get tougher and we have decided that we cannot.   We had to change it and enchanters may not see it this way now but it is for the good of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Your Enchanter friend is dead on correct.<br />
<br />
In a group everyone will have a higher mana regeneration than the Enchanter. It doesn't matter whether he is contributing to this. Everyone else gets their own mana regen on top of the Enchanter's.<br />
The Enchanter is only better off when he's solo and that is basically not an option for effective exping anymore nowadays.<br />
Yes but those self buffs conflict with something, often a serious HP buff. The self buff is not without cost. So much so that I usually run with only the cleric self buff on my 6box. And thats because she heals/nukes all the time and drains mana faster than the wizard (who only nukes and has flappy/harvestx2 to help).<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">However, this is a change to the omens mobs only, not a nerf to enchanters overall (as many are saying).<br />
<br />
Well, I would consider it a nerf to any chanter that planned on charming in OoW and is now forced to charm in older zones.  Saying it's not a nerf because it only affects mobs in omens is silly, since that implies that no chanters were planning to charm in omens.<br />
<br />
The fact that an enchanter's charmed pet could do more dps than half a group was never an intended function of charm.<br />
<br />
Fully buffed and armed charmed pets in GoD were pushing well over 1000dps.  I'd say that's quite a bit more than &quot;half a group.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mobs have and will continue to scale in power faster than PCs.  They have to do so to keep the game challenging.  In order to even allow the use of charm against the more powerful npcs, we had to have some scaling.<br />
<br />
The charm scaling was done very poorly though.  If they fix the bugged charm max hit then it will be much more useful.  As stated in this thread so far, charmed mobs using the omens charm hit for far less than 50% of normal damage.<br />
 <br />
Now, risk VS reward has come up many times during the enchanters debate over this issue, the risk has stayed the same as it has been, that monster is going to put a beat down on you when it regains its senses, however the reward was inordinately high.  We have fixed that.  For the risk of having an add that can lay some smack down, which is always a risk and not an added risk by any means, you got to do a crazy amount of DPS.

<br />
A very clear demonstration that Brenlo knows very little about the mechanics of EQ - seriously.  He states that a charmed pet is the same risk of any other add?<br />
<br />
First, a charmed pet will be buffed (haste, +atk, +str, +dex, etc) and given weapons, making the charmed pet far more lethal than a normal mob.  It's not as though when charm breaks the mob drops it's summoned mage weapons and strips all it's buffs.<br />
<br />
Second, last I checked, an add is usually predictable and in many zones rare, but does actually pose much more risk than a properly controlled charmed mob.  The charmed mob will be constantly debuffed, snared, and positioned so there is very little risk.<br />
<br />
Third, as the bugged charm stands, a fully buffed and armed omens pet has a max hit of about 260 - making it roughly a charmed PoI mob!  How this is somehow equivelant to two rogues I don't know.<br />
 <br />
So perhaps the fault lays with us for allowing you to have that crazy DPS for so long in other zones, but now we have had to decide if we can let it continue as the mobs get tougher and we have decided that we cannot.   We had to change it and enchanters may not see it this way now but it is for the good of the game.<br />
<br />
Yes, it is absolutely your fault.  Where else could the fault possibly fall?  I find the idea that Sony would even dream that reducing charm mob potential damage to 25% of what it was expected to be as anything but a nerf.<br />
<br />
While I agree it is for the good of the game and if I were an enchanter I might even ask for several AA refunds, still I get sick of Brenlo's frequently incorrect statements that basically just say a lot of nothing.  I have spoken with him IRL and have very little respect for him.  Perhaps his freedom of speech is indeed bound by what Sony will allow him to say, but on the contrary since he's the only voice we all have to listen to, I feel obligated to criticize what he does end up saying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
as to the self only mana regen line, hell yes I think they should get it, when my shaman has fewer mana issues than my chanter does (and note I am talking self buffed only) I think theres a valid problem. my shaman can handle most of the situations my chanter can in a solo environment with far fewer breaks inbetween. for my chanter to go nonstop I have to go find a pot9 to stack with voq and even then if things go a bit south I have to take a break to catch back up on mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">What you missed is that gather mana has a long reuse and it actually costs experience as it is an AA. <br />
Mana taps works fine in Omens till they nerf it, but anywhere else it's highly situational, so that Enchanters aren't even memming it due to the recast time.<br />
Now lets make some random guesses here.<br />
<br />
Average raid chanter has 5k+ mana (mine has 6.6 but thats beside the point).<br />
<br />
Refresh on gather mana is 100 minutes or 1000 ticks. That means gather mana is equiv to ft5 which is better than the self regen spells given to the other aforementioned classes. Even extracting the fact that you will never likely use it at exactly 0% (but more likely between 5-15% unless you know you arent gonna reuse it and you blow it to refresh to 100% after lets say buffing out the raid), you can not say chanters dont get a buff (of sorts). And lets not talk about how this regen is instant and full vs selfbuffs which take forever. So when I mez myself out of mana I just reload and start again, where my cleric stops healing to regen (and has to sit to have a chance in hell of getting enough to pop a decent heal). No one else gets anything as powerful and only the necro mana regen comes close. Yeah it costs AA but every chanter worth a damn has it.<br />
<br />
GD</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">This change was a no brainer, charm has been overpowered from kunark straight through god. <br />
<br />
If anything chanters should feel lucky that their charm didn't get the same treatment as the necro wake the dead AA where they capped the mobs at a fixed damage comparable to a regular pet.<br />
<br />
Personally I'd simply have given charm a fixed duration and capped it's damage at something reasonable, then removed most of the uncharmable mobs. The tradeoff, less damage vs more reliability. You get mob durability for off tanking but not their insane damage output for trivialising content.<br />
<br />
As for the chanters mana regen being less than any other class.... This is similar to saying shaman are at a disadvantage when it comes to being resisted since our spells were designed with malos in mind and most of them don't have resist modifiers because of this. Personally I think it's a valid point.</div></div><hr />

This is a great point. People keep harping on the risk of a &quot;fully hasted, mage toyed, FAed charmed pet&quot; but you know something, a pet with NONE of those things is still likely to be the best DPS in the group, and the risk goes WAY WAY down without all the extras applied. <br />
<br />
SOE is basically saying &quot;The charmable mobs in OoW are too big to be allowed to become charmed a full power, so they are going to be scaled back when they are charmed&quot;. Thats all. The OoW charm will work fully on other charmable mobs in other expansions. Its ONLY OoW MOBS that are affected. Now, a group has to actually make a decision on whether or not to use Charm, rather than the choice being a TOTAL no-brainer in places like Vxed and Tipt. But as Brenlo said, a charmed OoW mob is STILL about the DPS of 2 rogues. How is this a BAD thing?</div></div><hr />

I'll give ya two reasons:<br />
<br />
1) As others have posted, at 260 DPS they sure as Stuttgart don't equal two Rogues. (Unless Rogues were nerfed and we didn't catch it).<br />
<br />
2) If you think for one second that this nerf (and it is) applies to Omens only, I have some swampland for ya in the Gobi desert. (CHEAP!). A precedent has been set and it will be followed from here on out.<br />
<br />
Or as we say in the military:<br />
<br />
When you lower the standard - you have just set a new standard.<br />
<br />
Oh and brenlo can say whatever he wants. (That's his right living in America). But simply because he says this ISN'T a nerf doesn't make it so.<br />
<br />
A lot of people say something full well knowing it isn't true. (See kerry and his comments on the draft).<br />
<br />
I mean if you think that reducing all Wizzie Nukes to 25% of their former damage would not be a nerf well then, SHARE WHAT YOU ARE SMOKING.</div></div><hr />

The Enchanter always has VoQ if he wants, regardless of whether he's grouped or not. Would everyone feel better if VoQ was self-target only? What is everyone complaining about, anyway?<br />

Quoting Sam for convenience(many have said the same thing or close)<br />
<br />
Mask of the Wild (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5368&amp;source=Live) Druid self buff that gives 5 mana etc. and stacks with everything<br />

<br />
Armor of the Pious (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5276&amp;source=Live) Cleric self mana regen buff that gives 9 mana etc and doesn't stack with Focus or 9, but stacks fine with Virtue(only negligeable when a Druid is in group)<br />

<br />
If you don't see their point now, I am giving up.<br />
<br />
In 99% of the groups the Enchanter has the lowest mana regen in group. Sure you can calculate a 2 hour recasting ability and translate that to FT, but you and I know that this is just virtual crap. <br />
You can throw in ToT and totally ignore that the number of casting mobs up to Omens(which is currently broken and allowing ToT/Scryer etc. on every mob) is negligeable, but I stand by my point that Enchanters have their point in asking for a self buff.<br />
<br />
Just like a Necromancer or Druid benefits from their own resist adjust on their damage spells on top of &quot;my Malos&quot; while I, the biggest contributor, will have the hardest time landing my spells in groups/raids, other casters get their self mana buffs on top of the Enchanter's and regen more mana than them in groups.<br />
<br />
I am not debating or anything, but merely trying to make people understand, that the mana regen issue(which is a very old one and I have been hearing my Enchanters complaining about this for years) is a valid one.</div></div><hr />

Just because Enchanters aren't stupid like Shamans(Hi, those who have been watching Slow mitigation being introduced with and since PoP and not feeling nerfed) and can tell when crippling a main ability is a nerf(duh), doesn't mean it isn't one.</div></div><hr />

Funny how someone who has a 67 chanter, shammy, wizard, and cleric (along with ranger and warrior) doesnt seem to see a problem while a shammy thinks they need more regen. Chanters only run outta mana when they are mezzing the world or charming and supposedly they arent doing that anymore :)<br />
<br />
And if its virtual crap then give it to my shammy, my cleric, and wizard please. Easy to ignore a 6600 mana (or whatever your pool is) near instant regen my ass. And until they nerf the mana drains in OoW then you are even more wrong. ToT = 400 mana every 120 secs or another ft20 (400/20). Likely to be nerfed but still useful at times. As idiotproof as a buff, no, useless hardly, especially with 9 spell gems. Its permamemed whenever I am in OoW since I actually do mez :)<br />

<br />
No one said the ability was crap. <br />
Translating the ability in FT is &quot;virtual&quot; crap, because no Enchanter is going to use it every 2 hours to get the most out of it. In &quot;reality&quot; this is usually used after death and most Enchanters save it for that purpose.<br />
<br />
If your Enchanter doesn't run out of mana, then no other class does according to the list above, right? They should stop upgrading mana regen, because apparently no one needs it.</div></div><hr />

I agree with this.  They are doing the same thing to enchanters that they did to shamans beginning in Planes of Power.  This nerf, however, will not become as crippling (as slow mitigation) until it ripples through 4 more expansions.  Also take into account that slow mitigation also affected enchanters, although it wasn't their &quot;primary&quot; ability.<br />
<br />
Oh, also, I am pretty sure there was a similar uproar from the shaman community when mitigation was added.  You make it sound as if no one said anything at the time.</div></div><hr />

The uproar was very limited from what I remember and shortly after people accepted the nerf as a necessary evil to better &quot;balance encounters&quot;. <br />
That's how I remember it anyways.</div></div><hr />

Before you say &quot;recast time,&quot; are you aware that ToT gives a diminishing return on MOBs &gt; 51? (Might be 55).<br />
<br />
Oh, and I sure as heck don't hit &quot;Gather Mana&quot; every time it pops. It's an &quot;Oh shyte&quot; ability, at a minimum because of its recast.<br />

Currently, it does. Currently, I was with an enchanter in an instance, with a charmed something, doing well over 350 DPS, EASY, wihtout haste, without pet toys. Vxed/Tipt pets STILL totally own those zones.<br />
<br />
Sorry. Charm is overpowered. A charmed pet should be able to put out more DPS than any summoned pet or PC, wiz, rogue, whatever, but NOT 5 times as much. <br />
<br />
The nerf applies only to OoW mobs for now as well. If they retro it to affect Gates, PoP and LDON then I will be right there with ya Faern, but right now, its not affecting those areas. <br />
<br />
Bottom line is that its STILL an amazingly powerful tool. No need to risk full blown hasted toyed up charms. Just snare him and let him wade is un-buffed, and he will STILL pump it out.</div></div><hr />

Ah, well, honestly, I think that is true as well. But as SOE said, mobs have scaled up MUCH faster than players, so halving the mobs on charm keeps them a bit closer to where they have always been. Honestly, Vxed and Tipt are exceptions. Charming has always been viable. Many PoP zones had mobs specifically designed for this purpose. They went away from this for Gates and OoW though, and I dont know why. Seemed a nice compromise.</div></div><hr />

Frankly, it's an Enchanter line that can be done away AFAIC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Kaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">riiiight and why are you comparing your least most important spell line to our best dps spells? <br />
<br />
lets compare charm dps (ench's best) to shm dot dps (our best). its what we use to solo after all. which is usable in more group situations? which is more likely to get the caster killed? which is way more gd dps by a huge margin? hmm. now factor in the charm nerf. does the ranking change one bit??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">Well I don't remember comparing if not to look at overall DPS, Enchanter nukes are pretty feeble as well.<br />
<br />
In any event I think Shaman DOTs should be improved with a comparable reduction in Aggro (*), and I think Enchanter DOTs should be done away with.<br />
<br />
(*) It has always been my contention that Shaman get Aggro from their DOTs because the aggro is calculated at point of impact using full damage potential as well as the corresponding counters.<br />
<br />
EDIT: which is more likely to get the caster killed?  <br />
<br />
Both are, but for different reasons. I fully support Formerly-charmed MOBs hitting their former-masters, but the aggro from Shaman DOTs is unreasonable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">Playing a low level chanter isn't really that easy.  Your only real form of soloing is charm soloing, and that takes total concentration and more than a bit of luck.  Bad luck means running for the zone, and perhaps a death.  Plus mana regen is a problem with only Clarity or less to help.  Generally you can't keep up mana regen while charm soloing.  You have to manage to kill off your pet at the right moment so you can take a break.  My preferred method is to keep one mob charmed until it's near death, then invis and kill it with a nuke on its way to me.  Its opponent should still be rooted and lowish hps so I can nuke/root it to death.  Not all that easy, and not all that fast of exp.  Not to mention that hps are sorta hard to get back when you can't heal.  Runes may be cheap cashwise to cast but they cost a lotta mana.  <br />
<br />
I guess what I'm trying to say is that at lower levels chanters are hardly overpowered.  Druids, necros, monks, beastlords, and even shamans are far more overpowered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Your Enchanter friend is dead on correct.<br />
<br />
In a group everyone will have a higher mana regeneration than the Enchanter. It doesn't matter whether he is contributing to this. Everyone else gets their own mana regen on top of the Enchanter's.<br />
The Enchanter is only better off when he's solo and that is basically not an option for effective exping anymore nowadays.<br />
<br />
I ment it seemed silly as an argument, since their mana regen buff increases the power of the entire group. Rangers can't increase clerics mana flow. I think that mind buffs are still a viable ability that will keep getting groups. Maybe I'm wrong. /shrug <br />
I don't think I've met a cleric yet that'd click off KEI+.</div></div><hr />

The argument wasn't that Enchanters wouldn't get groups...but that somebody's guild mate was complaining because Enchanters have the lowest mana regen in a group, which is correct usually, just because Enchanters have no additional self buff.</div></div><hr />
