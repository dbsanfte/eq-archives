Getting pretty ugly on Stormreaver, and I hear we are closer than most, alliance breed like them hamsters. More to kill, but even tough guys like me get rolled once in a while from sheer numbers, heh. I wonder, if blizzard will take any steps to help. it will be a problem, like it or not, 25,000 paladins eventually can kill folk.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">From what I've heard, Whisperwind (my pve server) has one of the worst imbalances in populations of any server.<br />
Typical situation:  8pm central time.  Walk into the AH in Orgrimmar.  See around 20-30 people hocking their wares and shopping for deals.  Walk over to the bank.  See about 15 people inside, and another 10-15 around the mail box or in transit between the buildings.<br />
Typical situation:  8pm central time.  Lag walk into the AH in Ironforge.  Wait for the screen to refresh.  Look around the room at the 50+ people around EACH auctioneer.  Turn around.  Lag.  Walk over to the Bank.  Lag.  Fall in the pit.  Climb back out.  Turn around toward the bank/ah.  Lag.  Walk over to the bank.  Pass the 30 people around the mailbox.  See the 40 people in the bank.  This doesn't include the 30 or so people walking from the bank to the AH or mailbox.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The other night, alliance were raiding Undercity, Sun rock, Orrigrimar, and xroads, all at once, big raids.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">On Sageras the horde is outnumbered at the high end, but we apparently have more lower level players (I've heard conflicting accounts, this is about as much sense as I can make of it).  What the alliance is doing is nightly trying to disrupt all 20-40 horde zones.  Tarren Mill, Hammerfall, Freewind Post and Splintertree post are nightly spammed accross the world defense channels as the Alliance tries to buy time by disrupting lower level advancement by the horde.  As it is the Alliance seems to be just barely able to win when contested by a major horde force, many times they don't.<br />
<br />
Tarren Mill is a morgue, heavily contested and the bodies are knee deep on a regular basis.  Other spots like splinter tree in Assenvale (sorry, couldn't resist on the name) get over run by usually 2-6 very high level players who disappear when any horde resistance shows up and then come back with a 20 man raid force (cowards).  Mid 20's to 30's people try to put up a resistance (I've stood beside them a few times), but even with the NPCs it's still a slaughter.  One time when I was there, I saw a party of 4, 40+ lvl players chew up the place (2 were lvl 60 pallys).  Two mid 50's from my guild showed up and with the help of the NPCs and the low level players, handed the alliance their asses and they dissappeared for 45 minutes while my guildies went off to exp.  When they (Alliance) returned they brought friends, over ran the outpost, then a few of them left and the eight or so low level players started beating the 2 lvl 60 players (using NPCs) who stayed behind.  Then a raid force of alliance comes in and blinks in and out leaving runners and clearing all NPCs including and especially the wind rider so some folks couldn't escape.  I saw a couple guys get ganked a dozen times as the alliance camped corpses and generally behaved in a pathetic, cowardly manner.  Personally, I showed up once, escaped the 2 lvl 60 paladins and ran halfway to the GY near the lumber camp before I made the mistake of stopping and ducking behind a tree.  The TWO pallies chased me down and one chain stunned me till the other engaged.  I laughed so hard that the morons actually chased me far enough to give time for the guys who got ganked to res and stone/fly out,  better still, that they felt it took both of them to gank me.  Also I led them away from the guys I flew in to trade with AND made a shorter trip to my corpse.  I can't believe how stupid they are.<br />
<br />
Personally, I dislike PvP (I know, I'm on a PvP server), but my friends who I most regularly played with in EQ play on this server so I want to play with them.  Most nights I'll gank any alliance who is +/- 5 levels of me, I've even attacked when outnumbered by equal level Alliance characters and won (honestly, I'm not very good at PvP, but apparently my opponents really suck at it), but I can't believe there are lvl 60 alliance who regularly camp the same mid 20's areas (I can usually find specific alliance players in certain spots night after night) and still find this fun until someone shows up who might actually provide a challenge.  I wouldn't gank at all, but I find if you don't gank, you'll get ganked so it pays to kill them off.  I once worked co-operatively with a gnome mage (using emotes to target) when we were after the same thing (we both lived - in peace).  What is nice about PvP is that after a night of getting pissed off by the alliance, I can take 30-45 minutes to get even by sitting in ratchet and waiting for higher, or similar  level Alliance to come over and either attack or call in support and piss off some alliance tard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">DAOC had the same problems but theirs were due to character imbalances.  WoW doesn't have that.<br />
<br />
Apparently there is &quot; something &quot; alluring about being a human in a MMORPG. I don't know what that is, for example, my only human character in EQ was my Monk. And at the time of creation you only had one choice of race.<br />
<br />
My buddy tried WoW last night on my account, as he was rolling up a human Mage he explained that people like to be &quot; themselves &quot; (ie Human) and do great things.<br />
<br />
I do think the Tauren and Undead starting areas and quests are very interesting.  Dwarf, Gnome and Human not so much. <br />
<br />
There is no happy medium to this problem. You can't force people to play Horde and giving racial bonuses above and beyond in an attempt to get people to play Horde could well unbalance the PvE side of the house.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Deathwing seems close to even when it comes to population. At least as I've been leveling there hasn't been any issue where there are 10 alliance for every 1 horde in any particular contested zone. Maybe 2 to 1? While there have been raids on the major cities like UC I've never heard where all 3 are under attack at the same time. <br />
<br />
After exploring a bit though I do get the feeling that the alliance was fleshed out a lot more content wise. Duskwallow Marsh is a great example. The Alliance have a huge castle at the south end complete with scattered sentry posts that overlook the main road in. The Horde have a shack which includes an outhouse and camp fire.<br />
<br />
Combine that, and the fact that most people will gravitate towards more natural looking avatars is probably a large part of the reason the alliance outnumbers the horde. Look at how many Barbarion Shaman you saw when EQ first came out compared to any other race pre-Kunark.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Completely off the topic, but Mill's post made me think of it..<br />
<br />
Yesterday I was on my 32 (human) paladin and I was in an area waiting for my last point into mining so I could mine the mithril vein.  I finally hit 175 mining and run to the vein, clear to it, and some 32 tauren warrior comes over and rushes my vein and gets it first (ARGH!).<br />
<br />
So I /pvp (yeah..I'm on a pve server..) and /taunt him.  He /laughs several times then decides he can kill me (BIG mistake).  I let him get me down to almost no hp, I heal once and bash him to death.  I love letting people think they might actually win.<br />
<br />
He dies, I get the rest of the mithril vein that was really mine to begin with.  He comes back for more as I'm on my way out to complete my quest, so I kill him again just for taking part of my vein :).  Then, on my way to the griffon point, I run across a 29 orc hunter.  He thinks he might be able to kill me, but just does /rude a bunch of times so I run along after about a minute of nothing happening.<br />
<br />
The warrior and hunter then converge on the griffon point and decide they can 2v1 me.  Being the overpowered paladin that I am, I decide I will teach them a lesson.  So I /pvp and go towards the warrior who has autoattack on and wait for him to hit me at which point the orc hunter engages.  So I kill them both at once (well..warrior first, then hunter) - easily.<br />
<br />
Finally, the warrior gets on his alt &quot;Aliancesucks&quot; and proceeds to spam me for about 30 seconds before getting bored with &quot;YOU SUCK!!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
I haven't really exactly noticed an imbalance of the population, though I know there are fewer horde people.  I'm sure its more pronounced on a pvp server...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Been leveling my preist in Westfall and even on our PvE server, hordies love to sneak in and kill the quest npc's there, dunno if it is for a quest or just to be annoying, but I enjoy keeping my hunter camped out at the tower and switching over when the yellow &quot;under attack&quot; messages pop up :).  Its usually someone around my hunter's level doing it.  I have learned that 1 on 1 PvP fights are tough.  A +2 level mage ate my lunch badly.  We hunters aren't so tough if you stay inside gun range.  <br />
<br />
<br />
As for the faction disparity, I think it was a design error on Blizzard's part to not include a humanoid &quot;pretty&quot; race on the horde side.  People tend to prefer to play heroes, not monsters, and it wouldn't take much market research to show that.  Just basic narcissistic psychology.   Night elves or some other type of elves should have been on the horde side.  Adhering to the Warcraft &quot;lore&quot; is kind of silly, we are not talking about great literary traditions here.  It's the storyline to an RTS game for crying out loud.  You know - those annoying cut scenes most people spam the Esc button to skip.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It's odd to find myself agreeing with Mill (hey, stranger things have happened I guess:)), but I'll have to admit. I'm pretty tired of all the pallies running around, and I'M ALLIANCE. At this point I don't think there's anything Blizzard can do short of nerfing them to make them less appealing. Next in line would have to be Hunters. I hate to admit it, but we're a dime a dozen too.<br />
<br />
Then again, maybe they're *supposed* to be this fun, and all of the other classes need to be 'tuned up'? We can hope.As for the faction disparity, I think it was a design error on Blizzard's part to not include a humanoid &quot;pretty&quot; race on the horde side. I think they did some of the models justice. A few of the female orc and troll facial characterstics and hair style combinations are pretty hawt. Sorry, but the Undead and Tauren females are just....nazty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Being on a PvE server I probably pay less attention to the horde numbers than some, but on Killrogg it seems fairly balanced.  Southshore / Tarren Mill are the place to be for some fun PvP, and Arathi is also pretty interesting with Hammerfall so close. Southshore in particular gets a lot of attention, but it seems pretty evenly distributed between horde winning or alliance winning.<br />
<br />
The one thing that absolutely annoys me is the high level people that come in and kill quest NPC's for lower level characters, or come in and try and kill low levels (we're talking level 60's /dueling lvl 20's etc)  This happens on both sides, and frankly it kinda disgusts me. I see level 50+ recruiting for a raid on crossroads, and can only think, &quot;Oh yeah, so tough, go kill mid 20-30 characters. Yay you&quot;.  <br />
<br />
On the other hand, I had a lot of fun killing some high 40's characters who came to raid Refugee point and kill all the NPC's.  Of course, the fun stopped after they called in friends to assist in killing and then corpse / graveyard camping us (party of 3) for almost and hour.</div></div><hr />

What level is your paladin?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Faern,<br />
<br />
that is cool, but that to me is both the problem, and the cool thing about PVE servers, too easy to pick fights.<br />
<br />
You are probably a good paladin, but jesus, you hear about the farmers in Azshara? Asian people that literally work in offices farming gold? Either they fight occasionally, or there are the most retarded guild full of pallies and rogues ever on my server,  level 60, Paladins and rogues getting killed 10 to 1 by me, and 54 and 50 shaman and a 50 warrior, and not all of us at once, makes me feel good.<br />
<br />
Man, Pallies can be tough, but I am getting an inflated sense of badassness from these dummies.<br />
<br />
Honestly, how do you deal with rogues? Usual fight, I open with CS, 2 combo points, not much damage, by the time I get 5 points and evis they need to shield/heal, if I am hurt more than 1/3 or so I bandage and keep hitting, soon as see damage again I unload with my specials, rinse/repeat. So far, I am able to at worst, run away, normally they try to run but die.<br />
<br />
However, I have been whacked a couple times in a row for 500 + and that doesn't really feel good, not sure if it a special move of yours or just good crits? Wish i knew more about them so could plan better, I still, even after tons of combat, get jumpy and panic fire, forget to use my special powers, etc. All good though.<br />
<br />
Rogues, have yet to meet a rogue that even remotely compares to my combat build, they hit me for 150-200, I return for 200-400, and I think alot of dummies go all agility or something and foerget stamina. 3831 hps now with one more level to go!!<br />

Hitting for 500s isn't all that hard a thing to do.<br />
My shaman at low 40s could crit for 500s.<br />
My shaman has Ravager, and the another 2h mace from SM called something like Moregrin's Might.  Both are 37-38 dps.<br />
I watch to see what kind of crits I'm capable of getting, and I regularly see 400-500 point crits.<br />
Now, I *do* have windfury weapon with talents giving me a massive boost to my attack value which is helping the damage output.<br />
I'm sure that 15 more levels, and more comparable gear for the paladins you fight against should be able to crit 500s without much problem.</div></div><hr />

Oh c'mon Faern!  Seriously, if that's the best story of Horde cowardice you got then they must have put some extra pretty smiley faces on the walls of Ogirmarr, with half-naked dancing hottie fairies in Stormgarde, free beer and Tequila shooters for everyone in STV.<br />
<br />
Three weeks ago, I went to Ratchet to gank alliance (for some reason it's easier to find like leveled alliance there for a fair fight, and you can pick and choose your opponents so you can avoid those skull cons) in 1v1 PvP after getting raped by a couple of alliance raids into SRR.  I find a duo of skull conning alliance ganking every horde coming off the boat from booty bay, the rogue I find later was only 6-7 levels higher than me (keep in mind I was even lower level then).  I was the highest level horde in Ratchet in my low-mid 20's and the pally I find later was in his mid 50's.  Anyway, I call in a warlock from my guild who was lvl 53 and is insanely specced.  He dives right in and drops the rogue and pally a couple times in a row.  They co-ordinate a response, but I dive in and heal my buddy for my little cheesy heals, but it helps and he wins ... again.  So they both hide behind a guard even though they should be owning my guildy.  So my buddy attacks and I pull the guards aggro off of him with direct attacks and lead the guard off while my buddy reems the two alliance cowards.  You know, I'd have felt bad if I hadn't seen these same two gank a dozen high teens lvl hordies, or if they hadn't been such pussies.  The Pally tried to wait out the Warlock, but my buddy was having too much fun and eventually the pally mounted up and ran for the hills leaving the rogue (who I nearly beat one on one, despite the fact that he was a skull con to me, my buddy watched the fight and finished off the rogue with one shot when he was at like 10% health to hand me the win, cheesy, but I did give the rogue 6-7 levels) who died a couple more times.<br />
<br />
I've yet to see any bravery from the Alliance and I know the horde isn't the shining beacon of light some of us hordies like to believe, but both sides gank, both sides zerg rush, both sides do stuff that in carebear EQ I would have reported, but as a horde player on a PvP server, I just don't see any bravery from the Alliance and at the very least I have tried to play with at least some honour in my personal gameplay.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is no bug.  Warlocks concentrate on stamina more than anything else due to our ability to convert hitpoints to mana.  Sound familiar?  We also have less survivability in PvP than most other classes as we don't have any type of root, snare, or shield spells.  Fear only lasts around 5-6 seconds the first cast, even less the second cast and players usually become immune to it after 2 casts.  Another way, if you have the succubus pet out is to seduce your opponent.  Seduce acts much like sheeping, a mez that is broken by damage.  It used to last 15 seconds but was stealth nerfed a few days ago to last only 5-6 seconds in pvp.  In order to survive most PvP encounters we need lots of hitpoints.<br />
<br />
I think nearly every other class has at least 2-3 stats they concentrate on where really warlocks only have stamina.  Not to say that int isn't important at all but its a fairly distant second.  The ability to convert hitpoints to mana reduces the importance of our mana pool and spirit doesn't really help very much.  We also have a 5 point talent that increases our stamina by 15% at a 5% loss to spirit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Actually, stam and HP should be main stats for shaman as well in wow.  It's been more noticeable as I level, but I now need to focus on stam, agil. hps, and AC.  Some more senior shaman have confirmed this at their levels as well.

<br />
Due to the bug with 'shadow HP' some level 60 warlocks actually have more HP than some level 60 warriors. Until they fix that bug, enjoy the HP you have with the stamina you can collect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not entirely sure what you mean by 'shadow HP.'  I think you might be referring to the fact that stamina gained when leveling doesn't add to hitpoints.  I'm honestly not sure though.  If that is the case I believe Blizzard is aware of this and for some reason are ok with it.  Working as intended I suppose.  <br />
<br />
Since stamina gained per level doesn't add raw hitpoints and every class gets the same amount of hitpoints per stamina its just a matter of who has the most stamina gear.  Add the fact that we have a talent that increases our stamina 15% at a 5% loss to spirit and yes, warlocks can have more hitpoints than warriors.  Especially considering most of us make it our primary stat focus with int as a distant second.  Obviously other classes consider stamina to be important but usually have 1-2 other stats they consider as important or almost as important.<br />
<br />
Also, just because warlocks CAN have more hitpoints than warriors doesn't mean something is wrong.  I certainly wouldn't say its the norm.  Definitely not the norm for the more uber players.  Take a quick look at who has the most hitpoints on wow.allakhazam.com or wowrankings.com and they are all warriors.  Give people a couple months to get better gear and I think you'll start to see a noticeable gap between warrior and warlock hitpoints.  Doesn't matter much anyway when you consider the massive gap in armor which is as it should be.<br />
<br />
If this &quot;shadow hp&quot; term isn't referring to not gaining hitpoints on stamina gained via leveling I would be interested to know what it is referring to.  I haven't heard or read anything of it and it seems like something I should know about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Heh yeah of course there's a population imbalance. It isn't about humans it's about elves, a lot of players just love playing elves in these types of games. The only way they could rectify it might be if they made an evil elf race.<br />
<br />
I tried a Tauren first, and it had its good aspects but overall it was slow motion trudging across wide green fields from one near empty village to another. I loved the Navajo style graphics of the Taurens but the general sense was barren and emptiness in the environment.<br />
<br />
I then tried a Night Elf, and right off the bat the architecture and zone is done a lot more detailed and interesting, clearly more attention and effort had been put into the NE area by the designers. A tauren starts in tiny dull Camp Narache, a Night Elf starts near a cool giant tree house with a variety of interesting encounters close by.<br />
<br />
Elves also get faster movement on corpse recovery. Considering there is almost no death penalty in this game other than the run back to your corpse, that is a major advantage as far as enjoyment of the game goes.<br />
<br />
And then there's Darnassus, Ironforge, Stormwind. I've yet to see an evil city, I know there are one or two but on my Tauren I never found them heh. They hid them well I guess. :)<br />
<br />
So all in all it doesn't surprise me that most players choose good.</div></div><hr />

Well, while I will agree with you to some extent, the fact that progression for alliance is easier because there are more quests, they have a subway that's not easy for the horde to get at, while even lowbie alliance can get on a zeplin (there are a few nights on my server when you just can't use the zeplin because it's gank central), plus more flight paths really help.  At that point you'll have an imbalance of high level alliance characters who will, especially when they run out of new content, make it their goal in life to disrupt horde progression.  Guess what faction that frustrated horde player is going to roll up next if they get too tired of the BS?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Tonight at like 2 am MST I was just wandering around on my 35 hunter (horde) and got a little too close to a guard and he agro'd. He being my same level, I just decided to kill him ( I was somewhere near that alliance village that's right on a lake, with an KoS to all Orc outpost not far away.. if that helps anyone know where I was). After he was dead I decided to check my map and see where I was; I'm not familiar with these human areas, cause I've spent most of my time in the horde lands (barrens -&gt; stonetalon -&gt; 1k -&gt; shimmering flats -&gt; desolace)  Was looking at my map for all of about 2 minutes, came out of map view, and about 20 alliance are standing around me.. I had the time to say &quot;oh ****&quot; before I was instagibbed.. didn't even get 1 shot off heh, and from what I could see they were all lower level than me; just the sheer number of them dropped me that quickly.  <br />
<br />
You'd be lucky to get that much horde, that fast, anywhere on my server if it was primetime. Let alone some backwoods crap village at 2 am.. you might get a guy or two to show up. So yeah, I'd say on Cenarion Circle, alliance outnumbers horde by quite a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Kolmirg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">It sounds like you were in Redridge Mountains near Lakeshire, Rokkeb. That's a popular leveling ground for the upper teens through mid twenties for the Alliance. Lakeshire is also just two zones from Stormwind City, so it's not exactly backwoods.<br />
<br />
As for the population imbalance, it can make things less fun on the Alliance side too. The Ironforge bank and AH are slammed with players on evenings and weekends. These two builings are just across the square from each other and right inside the city entrance. My computer will stop and think for 30 seconds to a minute every time I enter that part of IF.<br />
<br />
PvP feels a bit pointless too when the odds are always at least two to one. Typical town raids on my server follow a pattern of five or six Horde show up and kill guards for a bit, then 10-20 Alliance show up and kill/corpse camp the Horde for twenty minutes to an hour - however long it takes the Horde guys to get bored and leave. I'm all for going round for round with the Horde, but that's just overkill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Cool thing is, it usually takes 2 times the number of alliance to put up a decent fight, I have yet to see badass alliance players, they all seem soft and weak. I think their easy mode lands and pally class leads to people being unused to hardship.<br />
<br />
Even numbered fight is too easy for me, is like taking candy from a baby. Last big pvp brawl at TM we were outnumbered and out leveled, I died once, killed probably 15 people and we drove them off.<br />
<br />
Key is, ignore the paladins, they do not know how to heal other players anyway, kill all the squishies first, and slap the paladins around. Immune indeed, you ain't getting away from me there tin can sissy!<br />

It seems to be pretty much understood at this point that Alliance = easy mode.  I don't knock people for choosing it, I played Call of Duty on easy mode.  Alliance themes really just didn't appeal to me the way Horde stuff does.  Even back in Warcraft 2, I played horde... maybe just because of that cool crackling sound Death &amp; Decay made.  I didn't think about it making softer players, though.  Or maybe just that a lot of kids are going to gravitate to the familiar look of more &quot;human&quot; characters, or the idea of playing &quot;good&quot;.<br />
<br />
I'd be surprised if they didn't make Blood Elves a playable race, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Sebanis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Another aspect I feel might have some subtle effect on the population imbalance is actually just aesthetics. Aesthetically speaking, Alliance races, specifically humans and elves, are much more pleasing to the eye than horde races. <br />
<br />
I'm probably also gonna get slapped around silly for saying this but I feel aesthetics also tend to be a bigger factor for female players. But think back to EQ for a moment - how many female players did you know rolled up a troll, ogre, or iksar lady as their main? I bet you not too many.</div></div><hr />

My wife rolled up an undead mage. She actually is kinda iffy on her not so much for the look. But she calls her Undead Mage Pms mage. They have this ( her words not mine) bitchy sounding voice when the &quot;not in range&quot; &quot;cant cast that yet&quot; message comes up.<br />
<br />
 I know you can turn those off but alot of people like to hear them since alot click click click til refresh and you can hear when the message stops. <br />
<br />
 She wasnt real thrilled by the orc female or troll female look either so that might have some validity in alot of people choosing alliance.</div></div><hr />

The undead chicks remind me of Calista Flockheart or Lara Flynn Boyle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I don't know why people say the Horde look so bad. I personally think that the male Orc and Tauren look badass. The trolls are kinda meh, but that's because Blizzard has a different look of trolls than what I'm used to (even though I played WCII way back when, but then the graphics were so awesome you could barely tell what was what anyway). I also like the Undead, though I wish they would have done more with the armor.. I have no problem wearing ratty tatty robes and **** looking armor at lower levels; but when I get higher level, and it still looks like I just pulled it out of someones ass; with dirt and grime all over, and tears and dents.. well that's just lame :( <br />
<br />
Now the females.. tauren female look absolutely horrid. It's like Bliz tried to &quot;humanify&quot; them; and it just doensn't work; they look like a big 'ol pile of turd, and I'm sure if they redid them to make a more fantasy-ish Taurenesque model; instead of a hairy chick with a cow head; more girls wood be likely to play them.  And the female orcs and Trolls suffer from the same thing, they look like a cheap attempt to make them human, when clearly orcs and trolls are not; make them orcs and trolls damnit! <br />
And same problem probably with the Undead females, their armor probably looks like garbage all across teh board. <br />
<br />
My biggest problem with undead though, is we can only be undead humans :( It'd be so badass if we could choose any race to be undead (same exact stats and bonus' for all undead though).. cause an Undead Gnome .. that would be like a dream come true :\</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Skarzon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I'll second what Rokkeb said about Cenarion Circle.  We're badly outnumbered as members of the Horde, but we put up a fight.  Tarren Mills is under attack by raid size forces nightly and the Undercity got raided two nights ago.  I think it'll only be a matter of time though, the Horde seems to work better together and there seems to be a sense of brotherhood that is only being fostered by the constant onslaught, at least on Cenarion Circle.  Just not sure how well tactics are going to offset sheer numbers, alliance sure does have the zerg down pat.  <br />
<br />
I'm hoping that tactics will win out on battlefields otherwise, it's going to be rough.</div></div><hr />
