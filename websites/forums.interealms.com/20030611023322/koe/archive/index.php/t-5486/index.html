<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My bard has now hit 23, but I find, even having made several trips between Queynos, Freeport and that damned Treehouse, I have not been able to find some of my songs... any advice on where to find em?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Amarin Crystalthorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wulf - check at EQ songs or The Concert Hall.  As I recall, there are bard songs in Highold  and Erudin as well.<br />
<br />
Blaydde</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Concert Hall  -  http://www.attcanada.net/~reaper/<br />
<br />
Or <br />
<br />
http://eq.castersrealm.com  has all the bard songs listed with what vendor to buy from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zaythar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Some of the bard songs are sold in the Library in Erudin as well as in Highpass Hold</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You have to make one trip to Erudin (for the 23 song, I think, been a while), and one to HH keep (two songs here, don't remember the levels).<br />
<br />
Eqdiva.com is a good general resource for bard questions.  The Concert Hall is a great place for discussions on game changes that affect the bard class and discussion of the endgame for bards. <br />
<br />
EQsongs.com was the most quantified resource on song effects, but they are shutting down.  Hope someone snatches those pages and hosts them somewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Willowwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">3 songs sold in HH: level 14 Tarew's Aquatic Ayre(makes tiny bubbles...makes you breathe underwater :) ), level 23 Selo's Consonant Chain (our snare song), level 31 Algimente's Aria of Eagles (levitate song).  Lyssa's Veracious Concord is in Erudin Library it gives you ultravision and makes you see invisible.  If you need some people for your bard to group with my cleric is almost at level to partner with my wife's Warrior who is level 24.  She doesn't have Velious or Luclin but there are lots of places in Kunark.  She is currently hanging out in LOIO.  My cleric's name is Wyhll and her warrior is Adriela Shadowmists :D.</div></div><hr />
