<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Unuca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I would like some hunting advice on where to hunt at 24, I would prefer not to fear-kite, but I will if I have to, just to bring up my level, which is suprisingly low for having Unuca for 2 years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wyverne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The best place to hunt at 24 is Luclin.<br />
It will be very easy for you at Paludal Cavern, you can solo there till you reach 26 then most will be light blue.<br />
from 26 to 30 move to Echo Cavern (secret entrance) and solo needlites. They are great for ranger because your damage shield will almost kill them alone :D If they are to easy you can pull some boglings at the same time.<br />
after 30 move to dawshroud peaks, there are many things to kill there. I particulary like shrooms in the ruined castle. But there are also zelniaks you can fear kite.<br />
<br />
Good luck fella<br />
