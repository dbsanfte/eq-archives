<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Zone: Old sebilis<br />
<br />
Mob: Myconid Spore King (lvl 58)<br />
<br />
Mob Rarity: uncommon (around 1 in 4)<br />
<br />
Tunic drop rate: rare (around 1 in 10)<br />
<br />
Recommended: you are 65 with at least cani5 and Q. Also, VP3 / SC3 / LR5 makes this very easy, I grab a virtue as it helps with the split.<br />
<br />
<br />
Getting there...<br />
<br />
I assume you have a map and know how to get to lower sebilis. Fight/walk down into tube, either fight or avoid the single wandering krup then swim to area underneath the jails. Get dog buffed etc and park him in the underwater tunnel, then have a look up through the water to see if any wanderers are close. There are 3 mobs roaming the jail room I usually get agro from 2, swim back to dog, slow both, root one and fight other. If you're feeling brave (or have the AAs/HPs)  just run into the room and agro any or all of them, I can usually fight all 3 with ease. Once all 3 are dead wait for the 2 wanderers that pass LZO to path near the jails, pull and kill them both. If you are struggling to handle the mobs at this point you are unlikely to be able to split the king camp solo, so just zone out. Okay, so now you're past LZO and are standing just past the door to the fungus caves. You have 3 <br />
<br />
options:<br />
<br />
1. wait for mobs to path by you, swim across the little water area and head to safe area<br />
2. fight you're way via the right fork to king spawn area then head to safe area<br />
3. invis and just run to safe area<br />
<br />
The safe/fight/camp out area is in the king room (see attached map).<br />
<br />
<br />
The pre-split preparation...<br />
Its important to know exactly what mobs path where, there are 3 mobs that pass the king near the water and 2 that pass over the &quot;safe area&quot;, although one mob that passes over the safe area has a long pathing route and doesn't appear often. This is why I call it the safe area, you should really only ever get agro from one mob here. This camp is all about patience, wait for the 4/5 pathing mobs to wander by and see if any are adepts or priests. Adepts and priests are your worst enemy and the only thing that makes this camp slightly tough. If you have a healer in the king 3 spawn and one or more wandering healers its going to take longer. If there are no healers in the king 3 it should be easy, simply wait for any wandering healers and kill them one at a time, you must do this before you split the king camp, note: the 3 at king will not agro as long as you don't get too close. If you have healers in king camp move to alternate fight area marked on map and kill all the wanderers leading into king area.<br />
<br />
<br />
The split...<br />
Okay so now you have killed any healer wanderers and are ready to split. The only thing that makes it hard is the healers, otherwise its just a straight 3 mob fight. To split simply root a reaver or warrior but not a healer in the camp, the other 2 will agro you. Slow all 3, have your pet on the healer and use VP3 (if you have it) on any non damaged and non healer mob. So you are fighting 2/3 mobs now, pet on one you on other, epic and BoU both, if they are healers just wait till they OOM, this can take a while, when they are OOM start using your poison dots to finish them. It is actually very easy to fight all 3 as Q will out heal any damage you are taking. When split just spread the spawn time out a bit, grab a beer and kill any healers that path through king room, leave the warriors and reavers up they are your non healing friends. I always save SC3 for healers as they cannot cast through the interupts from the 6 dogs, dot them up get them to 50% then SC3 and they will be dead.<br />
<br />
<br />
The king...<br />
Pull with malos, slow, send dog and root in the safe area corner. Remember when a summoning mob is rooted it will not summon you if dog is on him. Load up all your dots on him, then SC3, Q your dog then just wait till it dies. He hits for around 250 max but casts heals a lot, he is utterly trivial at 65 and I have never had any resists after malos.<br />
<br />
<br />
The loot...<br />
Tunic is rare, I have gotten 2 from maybe 20 kings, never seen the staff, the robe is common (grats destroy). The fungus priests can drop the war only shrink bracer which sells for aroung 15k on my server.<br />
<br />
<br />
Other notes...<br />
If you want a reet crown wait for a group to pass you, follow them and camp out in the reet caves there are 2 caves with 5 reets next to each other, camp in the 2 spawn room, I got my crown after 3 hours soloing. I did try getting there solo but the juggs have too many HPs to keep up and the 5 jugg split is almost impossible past the one way door.<br />
<br />
king/ph spawn time is 27 mins<br />
<br />
reavers hit for 157 max, warriors/priests 120ish<br />
<br />
any fungus can resist slow up to 3 times without malos, be aware of this when splitting, hence why virtue helps with split<br />
<br />
priests will DD you for up to 550 a pop so try to get resists up if you don't have many HPs<br />
<br />
I did this camp at 65, with 3700hps self buffed, all spells and 140AA, it is doable with less but won't be as easy<br />
<br />
Good luck, I'm off to try something more challenging now, but this was certainly very fun and profitable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">with the kind of hp, aa and spells you are talking about. you can actually make it all the way to the trak spawn area solo.<br />
<br />
one can invis all the way to the juggs if you are carefull...takeing 2 at a time is easy, 3 is a little harder, but still trivial.<br />
once you move to the one way door it is a waiting game...the wandering jug is what agroes the whole room...if you pull the right mob at the right time you will get a 2 pull to begin with.  (never tried it but hell, i bet you could beat up 4 or 5 juggs at a time if you can get them all slowed)<br />
<br />
at 65 all of seb is way to easy...trak can be 3 personed and prolly partnered if you do it right (heard SKs can solo it, but have yet to see it done myself.)<br />
<br />
great walk through for the king camp =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nice walkthrough.  I've found it to be a challenging but not impossible solo, have yet to walk out with a fungi though ;)  Exp isn't terrible either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Uh... how can trak be done by 3? are you forgetting he TLs randomly the MT to a random point in the zone?<br />
<br />
BTW, great walkthrough, I've done it myself but never gotten the fungi</div></div><hr />

There is a trick to get him to summon you back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">/sit is a trick?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">tell me the trick please =;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">tell me the trick please =;)<br />
<br />
the only &quot;trick&quot; would be to immediately sit and he should summon you right back for more fun.  The downside to this trick is you might gather some friends from wherever he sent you, and they'll spread the word around the zone about you--i.e. expect a train :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My impression was that if you got sent to a part of the zone that was out of agro range, he wouldn't summon ya back.. That's the experience I've had, at least. I could see doing him with 5 people, but not 3...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">2 SKs duoed him.  Keep in mind that FD makes the resummon trick work better and the effect of two super harm touches on a mob like trak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Slavage909</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Sk 1 gets ported away..<br />
Sk 2 Fds<br />
Sk1 Gets summoned back.<br />
Sk 2 stands up<br />
Sk 1 Fds getting rid of any argo he had from the port.<br />
then Sk 1 stands up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">haven't checked this tread in a while...there is a trick to not get banashed at all....it isn't a sploit either, but i can't give up all the secrets =p<br />
<br />
btw i was talking to one of the SKs on my server...he was saying sk might be able to solo him...something about getting banished hitting FD and waiting for trak to do some of the work.  (can't conferm this solo stuff).  2 SKs can partner him though, it has been done (2 SKs can take down any named in VP as well..i posted that on another thread.)</div></div><hr />
