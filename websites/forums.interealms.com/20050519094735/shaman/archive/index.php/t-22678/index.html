<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys, have you heard of any correlation between cha and Spell Casting Sublety? I had a guild wizard asking me for Cha last night. I finally asked her if she was getting DI from a cleric, she said &quot;no, I read on Graffe's that cha helps with SCS.&quot;<br />
<br />
I did a quick search of Graffe's and didn't find any threads about charisma at all (well, one about Charisma Carpenter from Buffy).<br />
<br />
I had the spell loaded and plenty of mana, so it wasn't a huge deal, I'm just curious. Is there some truth to it, or is it another Cha urban legend?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Charisma is sooo hot  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Umm, lately I've been asked for CHA from Bards and I try and keep mine up.<br />
<br />
But SCS?  AFAIK it's a straight % that they forget / ignore you. (If I have the correct AA in mind)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would find this very hard to believe...  I couldn't find it on Graffe's either, and I asked a wizzy friend who reads that forum every day, and he hasn't heard of it either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sounds pretty far fetched to me. The bard tho was probably asking for Cha because it does help the resist rate on luls and is rather handy when pulling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I know a wizard who begs for IoS off me all the time.<br />
<br />
Not because he wants more stamina but that he firmly believes Dex helps him crit more on his nukes.<br />
<br />
Of course I don't believe him and told him he was wrong, but he kept claiming that he knows it does help. I asked him to link me some parses that show it but he thinks he doesn't need to since he strongly believes he sees more crits with it on. <br />
<br />
I could go put up a bogus post on a few message boards that Agility helps dots land better and no doubt there will be at least a handful of people who will believe it and say they actually SEE a difference in resist rates with higher agility.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">cha helps our slow's  true story :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">That would be an excellent use for cha if it were true. I think all cha is useful for is making sure bards don't miss notes(or was that dex?) and for making a more successful DI check.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">it is dex if you want to help bards.<br />
Cha is about charm and DI isn't it ?<br />
<br />
Oh, and the higher your charisma is, the higher you will be able to stick a slow  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">That would be an excellent use for cha if it were true. I think all cha is useful for is making sure bards don't miss notes(or was that dex?) and for making a more successful DI check.<br />
<br />
Dex helps with notes, charisma helps with lulls (and charms)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">cha helps our slow's  true story :D<br />
<br />
Sigh...I heard that when I was making my shaman 3 years ago.  So I maxed Wis..tossed a few into dex, and the rest into CHA.  <br />
<br />
Such is life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">cha helps our slow's true story <br />
Thats the only thing Cha is good for, that and helping with making the factin hits you take bigger!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
joke btw, not to be taken seriously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Max Cha and I still get my ass handed to me with SCS3.  And bards asking for cha helps with missing notes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Dex helps with notes, charisma helps with lulls (and charms)<br />
Actually, its both Dex and Charisma, with more an emphasis on Charisma, that determines missed notes. Charisma does not actually help a charm or lull land, but it does help reduce the chance of a critical fail on a resisted lull.<br />
<br />
Here is a nice thread on the Concert Hall that has some nifty neato keen parses for your pleasure: http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallfrm8.showMessage?topicID=77.topic<br />
<br />
Now as far as your question Glori, I have done a google search on Graffes and cant find anything remotely about or near charisma affecting SCS. <br />
(for those interested, Copy/paste this into a google search box: spell casting subtlety: graffe.com)<br />
Edit: found a nifty thread, mostly conjecture, about SCS, on the chanter page, therunes.net : http://www.therunes.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=474<br />
Not a ton of info there either, but I would imagine that something like this is tough to parse. There are too many variables to take into account: successful taunt? Does the taunter have some sort of aggro modifier/proc/AA/buff? Are they a chain stunning paladin? Are they a chain Clinging Darkness SK? etc.....would take some long arese parses to see if it actually did any good with a higher charisma. <br />
Anyone with inordinantly large amounts of time and a 2 box capable tank willing :) ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Not sure about SCS, but I've noticed that kinda sorta i THINK cha is helping me land root, perform various /dance animations with more success with the ladies, get stuck in walls less often, and hit for max damage more.<br />
<br />
I did a combine last night with cha buff and gained a tailoring point, so I can say without a doubt that CHA increases your chances at successfully tradeskilling!<br />
<br />
BTW, anybody notice the stealth nerf to SoW last patch?  You go slower when you aren't shrunken.  You can tell by how fast the ground moves.  Those devs must think I'm stupid!  I was born at night, but not LAST night.  Nothing gets by me, esp with this nifty +5 CHA medallion on my neck.  Bling Bling, suckas!<br />
<br />
(But no, have never been asked for CHA as it relates to SCS.  For all I know, SCS is nothing but placebo.  There have been times when I think I have noticed something, but then again I thought I noticed a huge help from 5 STR back in classic, and look at the parses now.  I would definitely be in support of hard numbers or percentages in the in-game AA descriptions.  To my knowledge, the only thing CHA affects are prices, bard songs, and charms).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>vaniar luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Not 100% sure but I think they disproved or got SOE to admit there is no link between CHA and charm duration..... Id have to talk to a group of old school chanters to be sure.<br />
<br />
But I know CHA makes Root stick better :P... BUWAhahahahahahaha .... ok not really but man threads like these bring back memories.<br />
<br />
My personal Favorite was always the ol &quot;Gimme the buff anyway, even though Im capped the game will still count the full amount for melee skills&quot;..... funny the same didnt apply to STA, but he was SOooooooo sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">CHA helps with lull resist aggro supposedly.  Clerics swear by it, and Bards can use it for lull/mez to boot.  I usually only mem CHA when selling, but have no problem dishing it out to lull/mez classes.<br />
<br />
I would assume that DEX effects crit rates for casters just like it does for melee.  Since most papertanks pass on Focus, IOS is a nice spell to have if they feel the need to inflate their casting ego.<br />
<br />
Ado</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Muhaahahahaa!!<br />
<br />
I now have PROOF charisma helps slow .....<br />
<br />
With a Cha of 1 in a nasty zone called Uqua (a zone wide AE stat debuff cast), resists on all slows are sky high ....  I therefore conclude that its the Charisma of 1 causing this :P<br />
<br />
Tek</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">With all the changes the devs have squeezed into the game the last few months, i wouldnt be surprised if they actually made CHA do something...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Not 100% sure but I think they disproved or got SOE to admit there is no link between CHA and charm duration..... Id have to talk to a group of old school chanters to be sure.<br />
<br />
Charisma does affect Charm duration.  By how much or what factor is the sticking point.  Suffice to say somebody with a 305 CHA is going to &quot; in general &quot; (does the fingers quote thing) have longer charms than somebody with a 105 CHA. (all other factors being equal)<br />
<br />
So yes, a higher CHA does help, but is it worth sacrificing loads of HPs to load up on CHA?<br />
<br />
Heck no.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>vaniar luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Maybe it was the factor of improvement then, I know I remember the Chanters being all pissed cause so many of them had gone CHA heavy on gear (to the detriment of HPs and such) only to find out that it wasnt worth the effort,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The charisma effect on charm is probably like the effect of Str on damage.<br />
<br />
Nice to have. But not worth tailoring your charecter towards it in exclusion of all else. <br />
<br />
From my rough guesses playing an enchanter for a long long time First as a main then as a hot box  for quite a while. <br />
<br />
Yeah it helps charm. But like others said. Don't give up hitpoints for it.<br />
<br />
Snoww Silverhammer Bahsy RABId bear E marr</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jovec</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">A low CHA helps necro and SK fear to last longer~  One of my favorite CHA misconceptions.<br />
<br />
-Jovec</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The thing about that &quot;rumor&quot; tho is that so much of SK and Necro gear has negative cha on it it would only make sense.  Charisma HAS to do something other then prices, missed bards notes and DI.  It just has too.... right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I really think they should just make stats past 255 add something totally new, like direct percentages to evasion, combat, and heck, maybe duration of spells for CHA.  Something small so that 300plus CHA meant 15 percent extra on buffs.  Probably too much of a can of worms to open, but it would be nice.<br />
<br />
I seriously think that a lot of it is just what people think is happening.  WTS Dervish Cutthroat Ring...<br />
<br />
Only major stats I cared about in the old days was STR for carrying stuff (before I got reduction bags), INT/WIS for mana (since not many people had 200 it was a big deal) and DEX for procs.  I'd get my CHA to 120ish before buying traveler's boots (lol remember those?) or tink bags, but that was about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Never heard of CHA effecting SCS...but I have tried putting CHA on clerics with TotD AA and they have reported it going off more often.  The message that goes off is the same as for DI, so I only assumed the same rules apply.<br />
<br />
It's just an observation though, no parses, sorry number crunchers :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>vaniar luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">SOE has actually confirmed (or at least they said it was) that CHA does effect the chance for DI spells to go off. I dont remember if they said it had to be on the cleric but I do know that there is proof that it has a noticable effect if the Tank that recieves the spell has it on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">That would be an excellent use for cha if it were true. I think all cha is useful for is making sure bards don't miss notes(or was that dex?) and for making a more successful DI check.<br />
<br />
When you create a new bard character, the stat description window says &quot;descreases the chance that you will miss a note while playing a song&quot; under BOTH charisma and dexterity. The charisma part is obviously an error.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">charisma lowers the chances of getting no prize from the Shadowhaven Casino ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Seremont</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Charisma and bards go together just enough that they hate themselves for stocking up on STA gear when they pull a hard LDoN.  You can't pull a hard LDoN with lull without a massive CHA, and most bard gear doesn't have both STA and CHA on it, so HPs win out.<br />
<br />
As for missed notes, there is no real benefit unless you can get CHA up to 305, then it's noticable over about 10,000 casts (read 5 minutes, hehe).<br />
<br />
Other than that, I use it because Seremont's cha without it doesn't hit 130 for selling.  Other than that. I don't pull it out of the spell book much.<br />
