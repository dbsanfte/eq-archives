<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've almost got my first AA at level 53 as I was planning on dong 6 AA in my early 50s. Was talking with a 60 chanter and was telling me that he was getting about half and AA for every succesful adventure he was going (single group, normal setting). You guys seeing this kind of AAXP who are around level 60?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes.<br />
<br />
I did AA's early in 50's and its pointless. In tier 2 planes at 57-60 i could get 3% AA per kill. Not bothering with AA's yet though, I'm gonna ding 65 first get Q and Malso and solo AA's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm also getting that much at 65</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes, and that's low compared to PoP, so if you're after AA's then you should definitely wait until 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">go for lvl65 before you touch aaxp.. i did and never had any regrets.. usually when ppl are looking for groups they go /w all 65 lfg.. i do and i know most of my guild does also.. they dont care if you are lvl60 with 500aa xp.. ppl making groups won't even know you exist if you're not 65.    Since you get way more groups at 65 i think aaxp goes by a lot faster even with the small penalty because of level.<br />
<br />
not to mention how much easier it will be with your level because of spells and resist checks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I get 40% - 60% of an AA per adventure in normal mode.  Basically LDON adventures are decent XP, decent cash loot.  I consider the adventure points to be a bonus :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I agree with Weissblau. Pass or fail, I sitll walk out of there with good cash and a lot more XP than I expect. Really is nice to gain it again without noticing because I'm just having too much fun. <br />
<br />
I also really dig the interactive chests that pop out xp when opened. They seem to give me about 10 percent aa xp per chest. Nice surprises. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Its a nice balance for sure. In straight XP groups, you can get a little more AAXP/hour, but the loot potential is very limited. In pure loot situations, you are lucky to get any AAXP at all. Very few places give you a solid balance of both, and not only does LDoN satisfy that void, its also more fun than either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ragack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just a quick AA question. I've seen several people say go straight to 65 before getting any AA's, but when I've look up what AA's shamans can get I've noticed some that have a maximum number of points per level. Do these level limit restricted AA's add up if you don't get them per level or do you miss out on getting them to the maximum possible level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ragack,<br />
<br />
If I understand you correctly then the answer is no, you do not miss out by waiting. For example, Virulent Paralysis has a pre-requisite of level 61 meaning you cannot train this until you get to level 61. It then states you can train it every two levels.  Therefore you can train it at level 61, 63, and 65.<br />
<br />
Alternatively you could wait until 65 and train all three levels there.<br />
<br />
So, the only restrictions on AA are when you are &lt;65.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You never miss on AA's out by levelling. Any AA's that are restricted by level have that as a minimum level only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm seeing about 0.6 AAs per adventure. It's not quite as good as grinding in a tier 2 or 3 zone, but the loot's better, get some coin, it's pretty darn safe, and it's a heck of a lot more fun.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and those point thingies =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>darkforest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I used to think get at least run 3 before before you get 65 but with shrew there is no need for it.The aaxp is slower than pop xp but the good thing is you don't have time to notice how much xp you are getting til after it is all done  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Just thought I would throw in my 2cp.<br />
<br />
I couldent IMAGINE trying to work effectivley in a LDoN group withought Can5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">well im seeing 60% AA at 65 as well per adventure most i have been on have only taken an hour. so that means 60% AA per hour. I have to be in a very good group to see faster than this in BoT,HoH,PoTAC. I see myself in LDoN unless im am questing or raiding or helping a friend out from now on. Besides these dungeons are a hellva lot more fun. too bad there is a time limit and a minium # of players in the group. me and a buddy would love to crawl these as a duo :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I get about 80% aa per Ldon run at 65.<br />
I get 1 aa per 45 min in Plane of Earth<br />
I get 1 aa per hour in Tower of Sol ro.<br />
I get 1 aa per hour and some change in Tactics in the Pit.<br />
I get 1 aa per 1.25 to 1.5 hours in Bot.<br />
<br />
<br />
I would recommend you get to 60+ before you AA. 55 will get you into PoS,PoV and CoD. 62 gets you into BoT and HoT.<br />
<br />
Just makes aa go that much faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Bilgoba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I generally like LDoN more than standard exping because it's fun unlike exp grinding.  This is the feature that almost made me quit Everquest for Anarchy Online.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I must've not read enought of the aaxp threads, and wasn't aware of how fast AAs go at level 60+. Thanks for the great information, definately save me countless hours of grinding in my 50s.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Stickygoo Onjooshoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yes.<br />

<br />
No reason to solo anymore with ldon. better to take a group and get some points while you get aaxp.</div></div><hr />
