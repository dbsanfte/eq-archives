<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Guides arent something i use too often. But once in a while i just get kind of stuck and would like to read some ideas to hit. Been doing alot of exploring but in a funk for my pally at lvl 24. <br />
<br />
<br />
Was in Wetlands doing some quests there. Was Down around sentinel hill. Havent done deadmines yet might get a group there soon. But like to find some areas to solo in when i am on at my sometime weird hours. I tend to like to move around alot. Part gypsy dwarf i guess hehe.  Any suggested sites?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wandering and exploring are my guides to where I should be hunting.<br />
Talk to npcs and get every quest you can.<br />
If the quest is yellow, you should be able to complete it solo at your current level, or in about 1 more level.<br />
The quests tell you where to travel to accomplish your task.<br />
Listen to the NPCs and new hunting grounds will open up for you quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I do that all the time. I was just wondering if there were places i could read about zones and level mobs when i felt like it while reading forums to give me ideas once in a while. <br />
<br />
 Ive already have a slew of new quests i was just working on in darkenshire and found the ogre place in the woods. <br />
<br />
   So anywhoo. Maybe guide was a bad choice of words. People seem to get that i want cheat sheets and that isnt the case. Was never looking for detail just ideas like our eq level areas here. <br />
<br />
  Ive found plenty of areas by exploring. Sometimes i'll just get in the mood to head a direction. Was south last time. Than i go til something scares the heck out of me (at my level) and usually kills me than i try a different direction while generally going south til something grabs my attention. But like i said once in awhile i just like to read about zones a bit when i get into a HMMMMMmmm where to go funk.<br />
<br />
<br />
Btw forgot to add. If anyone plays a pally and want a good place to go 20ish and up to later 20's Duskwood seems to be a good place to go. Darkshire to put it close to the spot. Nice undead and quests to kill those undead there :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There are some good continent maps with zone levels at http://www.worldofwar.net/cartography/worldmap/kalimdorcont.php and http://www.worldofwar.net/cartography/worldmap/easterncont.php.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Alla's has a zone by level chart...<br />
<br />
Here's the linky for it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks alot appreciate the responses. Good stuff :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would like to point out that dreadmines is worthless past level 25 as you get absolutely no experience in the zone (unless you do it for the few quests involved with the zone, which are decent).  I went there to finish the staff of westfall quest for my priest at 27 and I got experience on I think three MOBs... (this was clearing the whole zone btw)<br />
<br />
Otherwise, if you do the quests, you should find yourself in level appropriate areas for the most part and experience should just naturally come.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Shilzah, if you aren't on a PvP server, how about going to the other continent?  You can run around uncontested unless you attack a guard or something.<br />
<br />
Barrens Crossroads (take boat to Ratchet) area is decent at your level, can also move on to Stonetalon and Ashenvale.  Just avoid towns/guards and you'll be fine.  Ashenvale is a mix of horde and goodie goodie zone so you could set up base there.<br />
<br />
I know that I go back and forth from Hillsbrad/Thousand Needles/Stonetalon all the time.  Get to see the different quest lines before they go grey to you, which is cool :).</div></div><hr />
