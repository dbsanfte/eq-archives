<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Attika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I printed out a bunch of maps for Skyshrine and they list many locations for the Fe'Dhar, but not specifics. Can someone tell me where Asteinnon Fe'Dhar is located? I may be getting these boots soon and would like to know exactly where I am going.<br />
<br />
Also if anyone on the Nameless has Unadorned Chain Boots for MQ &amp; can give a brother a fair deal I am very interested. :) <br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Get a map, or a guide to get up there =)  Very hard to walk people through the maze of getting up to the quest mobs.  They're all in the same room though, if you know where the rest are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wow, he's right.  It's quite a bit of traveling.<br />
<br />
I've never found a good map of the entire place.  It's huge.<br />
<br />
The maze itself is easy.  Right, left, forwards back.  All you have to remember.<br />
<br />
I usually make the trip more from instinct than memory.  I'll try typing out some directions, but a good bit could be wrong.<br />
<br />
If you zone in from Cobalt Scar, you end up with the room with the fountain.  One exit will take you back towards the Wakening Lands.  Take the other one.  Then, it's something like first right, first left.  Or Second left, or something.  Eventually you end up in a room with a small pool at the end of it.  There is a small stairway on the left side of the room (it blends in with the wall, and hard to see).  Take it up.  Gonna take a left at the top of the stairs, then the next left.  Go through a few doors.  I think eventually you'll take a right, and end up on a balcony with a named wyvern.  There is a small raised surface that is a teleporter.  Either step on it, or jump off the balcony.  Takes you to the same place.<br />
<br />
Then, start running up the stairs, and follow the passage.  Eventually you'll come to an opaque wall.  Go through it, puts you in a small natural cavern.  Follow it till the end, till you hit another opaque wall.  When you go through it, you'll be in the maze.<br />
<br />
That is where the right, left, forwards, backwards comes in.  Take all rights till you get ported.  Then left till you get ported.  forwards and backwards the same way.  Then you are at the exit of the maze.<br />
<br />
Ok, then comes the long part......<br />
<br />
<br />
There aren't a whole lotta turns after that.  Just a long, long stretch of passagewas and stairs.  Start running.  Lots of doors on the left, you wont need to go through any of them.  One thing of note - There are at least 2 invisible pits you can fall through on this run.  Probably lots more.  I usually use lev and dont worry about them.<br />
<br />
Eventually you'll run out of passageway, and have a door on your left.  Take that door.  Start running again.  Follow that passage till it ends.  I think that's when you end up in a library.  Run all the way through the library and exit the other side.  follow that along till you get to a run with a spinning orb.  click on the orb to be teleported.  Then follow that along till you get to a room with another huge orb.  That one doesnt port you.  Go around it and out the door on the other side.  You'll get to a room with another orb.  click on it and you are now in the skyshrine quest givers.<br />
<br />
blech :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Ok, first - some of that could be out of order, or even semi incorrect.  My advice - finid someone who knows where they are going and follow them there once.<br />
<br />
It takes me around 10 minutes to make that trip, and I know where I'm going (at least when I'm doing it).  It took me alot longer to find my way there.  First time I was just exploring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Attika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Those directions should be fine. The maps I printed out are really nice and I should be able to figure it out. I just wanted to avoid going to every Fe'Dhar room to find the guy I need and this should do the trick.<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In the last area prior to the quest mobs, hug the walls heading up, otherwise you will fall into the trap in the floor. It's a long walk as is, even with out starting running again because of stoopid traps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gert Groinwounder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Getting through the maze is actually pretty easy.  When you first appear in the maze, run straight and hug the right wall til you teleport.  When you appear, hug the left wall til you port.  When you appear run forward til you port.  When you appear run backward til you port.  There, you're out...<br />
<br />
And the Shaman quest mob is the first one on the right looking in the room...  <br />
