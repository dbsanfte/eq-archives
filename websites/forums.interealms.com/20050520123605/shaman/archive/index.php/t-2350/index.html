<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am currently amiable to the Coldain so I need to get it higher for thurg armor.  <br />
<br />
It is my understanding that Kromrif toes can be turned in for faction.<br />
<br />
If so which toes and to whom do I turn them into.<br />
<br />
Normaly I would just raid Kael but my guild has moved toward UP as of late so I am looking for somehting I can do solo.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I really have no interest in doing the Prayer Shawl quests.....but what if I hand 4 toes to the Loremaster and destroy the no drop shawl he gives me and repeat the FG toes portion of the quest  again ? Can that be done simply for faction ? <br />
I have a few Frost Giant toes and didn't have a clue what to do with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sliths</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes you can do it for faction. I find during it to hold onto the heads and when you get 10 just get the second shawl also to destroy since it gives even more faction. Got from dubious to amiably with Dain in short order (also capped Coldain).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yep, can repeat the quest - <br />
I just got another box to use in the bank, tho - like the 10 slot containers that hold giant items and cost zero    8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Also if you've actually worked on your shawls you can just turn the second shawl and your seal in for the third shawl. Kinda a slow way to build faction but something you can do solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">for thurg faction i'd suggest soloing the drakkel dire wolves and giant scouts in GD.<br />
<br />
<br />
MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH faster way to raise thurg faction.<br />
<br />
you get 1 hit per 4 toes, and it's a tiny one at that. you can slaughter dogs by the thousands in GD.</div></div><hr />
