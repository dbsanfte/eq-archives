<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lynnara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all.<br />
<br />
I've got that annoying graphics glitch showing extra fabric where my cleavage should be!  Can't have that... so I did /dopropertinting on and zoned but that just got me bugged.<br />
<br />
Now all I see are half nekkid peeps running around, and my bp just looks like a faint mesh rather than the chain look.<br />
<br />
Advice plz?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Are you running the latest display drivers for your video card?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I still get some people in &quot;blackface&quot; if I turn dopropertinting on. Very disturbing to see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I had that problem at one time also.  Green chests and such.  When I turned on dopropertinting, it turned everyone's skin black.  Someone was nice enough to point out that upgraded video drivers are must.  I use a geforce 3 card, and went to nvidia's website and downloaded the latest detonator drivers, then turned tinting back on. all fixed up.<br />
<br />
That's my advice.  Make sure you have the latest drives that you can installed.  It should take care of your problem</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You will also see screwed up armor if you have Velious armors and new models turned on. Seems they didnt bother to code the Velious armor to appear properly on Luclin models. If you set LoadVeliousArmorwithLuclin=False in the eqclient.ini it will fix it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lynnara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well... I updated my drivers (Nvidia TNT2) and made sure that Velious armor was turned off...<br />
<br />
but still having graphics probs - now worse than before actually.  Earlier it just affected chest armor but now it's messing everything up, and some ppl look totally nekkid. <br />
<br />
??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">isn't the TNT2 an old card?  Might just not support the tinting stuff.<br />
<br />
might try the Official tech support boards (http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&amp;number=3&amp;SUBMIT=Go) for everquest for tech support questions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I just looked at the EQ site and it says TNT2 is supported. So just make sure that you have the 29.42 Nvidia detonator drivers and hopefully it will all work out for ya :) If that doesn't do it, can't hurt to upgrade that vid card.... =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Scarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you're going to use /dopropertinting on then make sure your pc is properly cooled.  It was overheating and shutting down my pc within a minute of logging in.<br />
<br />
If you are running a bit hot anyway it could push your machine over the edge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have a TNT 2 also, and I have the exact same problem. I just leave it off, the proper tinting is an advanced option for cards that support it. The TNT 2 being listed as a supported card just means it'll work with the game. It's not supported for the /dopropertinting command. I've been meaning to upgrade my video card for awhile, it's a pretty old card.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Don't even bother. Dopropertinting makes our Velious bracers look like tres femme druid bracers. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lynnara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thanks for all the input guys :)<br />
<br />
I got the graphics back to normal, I guess I'll just live without proper tinting til I upgrade my card.<br />
<br />
