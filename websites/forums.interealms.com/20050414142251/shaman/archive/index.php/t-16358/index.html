<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ioki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well the time has come to retire my old pc to the graveyard. <br />
I have considered buying a Laptop to replace my current pc. <br />
Here is the configuration that I am considering. <br />
<br />
Intel® Pentium® 4 Processor 3.0GHz 800MHz FSB w/ 512KB Cache <br />
512MB DDR PC-2700 - Two SO-DIMMs <br />
Hitachi 60GB 7200 RPM ATA100 with 8MB Cache<br />
AREA-51M NVIDIA FX go5600 Module with 128MB DDR<br />
15.4&quot; WideSXGA+ 1680x1050 LCD Display <br />
<br />
The rest of the details can be seen here <br />

Okay to my Questions. Does anyone play EQ on a laptop. What has your experience been? Does by chance anyone have this same laptop or a simlair laptop? And finally what is you opinion of Alienware's products and customer service.<br />
<br />
I do not want to make this kind of investment and be sorry that I did later. <br />
Thanks for you answers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I play EQ on a laptop and it runs great.  Heres a tip though.  Alienware sells great laptops, but they mark it up a ton beacause of the fancy paintjob.  If you want to save a lot of money, go to http://pctorque.com/.  They make the laptops that Alienware purchases.  Alienware paints them in pretty colors and charges 800 bucks extra.  <br />
So if you dont mind a grey, but still sleek looking laptop, go with Sager instead of Alienware.<br />
Ive had my laptop for two months and I love it.  It runs all models at max texture detail just fine.  It only get choppy in the bazaar and occasionally in PoK.</div></div><hr />
