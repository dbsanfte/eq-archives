------------------------------<br />
<br />
- Corrected a problem that occurred with Charms.  They should be working properly now.<br />
<br />
<br />
Emergency patched for that?  What about the broken spell quests?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">SOE has a history of leaving things out of upgrade messages.  Things that were broken may have been mysteriously fixed now.  In particular, I imagine the single-purchase bazaar bug is probably fixed now.    I can't test anything right now because I'm at work, but time will tell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Forty-SoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Anyone else getting sever lag and framerate issues?  Running 2k and in certain zones the game is almost unplayable.<br />
<br />
I also have a problem staying in my guild's shaman chat channel.  Zoning (especially after death) will cause me to drop from the channel. Nothing I do, short of rebooting, will get me back in.  Last night, the mod of the channel tried to &quot;/chat invite&quot; me but she got a &quot;the player you are inviting is not online&quot; message eventhough I was standing next to her.   /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Quiinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I love 2 hour outtages RIGHT in the middle of the day.  (and the 2 hours assumes it comes up in the next half hour) <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Salamonda Eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Someone go try the Stocism quest... and see if they fixed it this patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's Sony.  We're going on 2 hours downtime (so far) for a 1 hour patch.  *sigh*<br />
<br />
You would think that after 4 years, Sony's server patching skill would be nearly maxxed.  Instead, it appears they haven't gotten a single skill raise.  Guess even Sony hates the RNG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I LOVE these patches.  :D  :D  :D <br />
<br />
It means that sh1t should be up in Ssra Temple when my guild starts raiding in 8 hrs time $$ /drool<br />
<br />
Unless the US guilds stay up late :(<br />
<br />
