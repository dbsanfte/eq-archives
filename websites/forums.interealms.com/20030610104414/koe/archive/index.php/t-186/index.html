<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ganeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all-<br />
<br />
I have been trying to buy Call of the Hero for about a week now.  Have had no luck.  I would greatly appreciate it if anyone spots 1 for sale.  I have 5k saved up for it and hopefully can grab it for this price or less.<br />
<br />
Please let me know.  There are several other rare mage spells I am looking for, but these are not that big of a deal at this time.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help,<br />
Ganeb</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a bunch of stuff to dump (mostly junk, but a couple things that might fetch 1k, or 5k for one item) - so I'll likely be there a while.  Have 3200 or so in cash, if I can just outright buy the thing, I prolly will:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vhela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not sure but I seem to recall that dropping last week when we were at the Shrooms/Jugs. You might want to check with Zelf on that Ganeb.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jlove Fizzboom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was auctioning for this yesterday in fp.  I got one tell, from a guy named Merlian.  I asked him how much he wanted and he told me he had to go check with his wife, as it was on her character.  He never relogged.<br />
<br />
Pretty thin info, i know, but it's all I was able to turn up in many hours in nfp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>burien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">from all ive heard CotH goes for around 3-5k or so, takes awhile to get it, but you can get it sometimes. a thought is to have rizz ask some of the other guilds if they may have it in their guild stash, i think coe had 3-4 copies of it at one time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ganeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the help all...<br />

Burien put me in contact with a seller and I've got it waiting for you.  I bought it for 5k (normally I wouldn't worry about that, but most of that 5k wasn't mine hehe).  Give me a tell and I'll get it to you.</div></div><hr />

Grats Luda!<br />

I have the 5kp for you.  I will try to get on tonight (Monday 4/30/01) and arrange to pick it up from you.<br />
<br />
Thanks all who helped!!!<br />
