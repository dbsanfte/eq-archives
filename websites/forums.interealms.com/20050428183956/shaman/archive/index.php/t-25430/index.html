<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>shraklor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Have never fought them, but will need the Jade Reaver for alt epics, was wondering how MR they are for my Monk/Shaman 2box?  <br />
I understand that they can continue spawning for hours so KEI would be needed.  I'm mostly worried about healing since the best heal I have is only 600.<br />
As I understand it I might also have trouble getting TO a reaver.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tronc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well I'm no expert but I did attempt killing a reaver with my wife (Enc) once...didn't realize that they were immune to everything magic we through at him...and off course what was worse yet was playing blind...oh well a kindly cleric rez'd us so all was not lost.<br />
btw - you can dot him if I recall but disease slow does NOT work.<br />
<br />
First thing you must do is kill the Captain of the Guard as he has the key that opens the door to the back tower area.  Then seeing as you have a monk, killing everything around him shouldn't prove to be too difficult.  At lvl 55 we were able to pull everything but the last two mobs near him - at 61 I suspect you would get him solo even without FD...<br />
<br />
Just have cure blindness up...your disease debuff and dots.  Don't remember sticking any poison on him but I may not have had the chance either.  You won't be able to land Malosi line (MR resist again).<br />
<br />
Make sure you know where your cure blindness hotkey is :)<br />
<br />
From what I gather you they can spawn on top of another's death - so you might want to make sure the shaman is outta agro range when they are just about to die.  Then just FD monk if some down time is needed...don't know if that will work but worth a try.<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't know how much help this is but at least its a response :P<br />
