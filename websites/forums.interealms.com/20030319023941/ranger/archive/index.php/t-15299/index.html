<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mephs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey,<br />
<br />
In a couple of days I'm due to be getting a 2nd computer and I'm already all set up ready to 2 box (all expansions on both accounts).  I have decided to 2 box a chanter because I regularly group with a guy who 3 boxes and a chanter seems the best character to fit into the combo and also seems like a lot of fun (yaay illusions :)!! ).  In fact the guy who 3 boxes also has another friend who regularly 2 boxes.  So all in all between the three of us we could regularly group a 61 Ranger, X level Enchanter, 63 shammy, 63 Bard, 63 Shadowknight, 63 Wizzy and 63 cleric. I'm primarily concerned with how to level up my chanter to fit with this group.  I'd like to hit some non-standard zones and have some fun seeing the less populated areas of EQ while I'm at it (hopefully decent XP aswell)  as I kinda missed out with Mephs and took many standard levelling routes... yeah yeah so I took the LoIO, DL, KC, seb route....!!  I actually see no harm in that though and consider myself a very skilled player despite what some people may think of that levelling route :p<br />
<br />
My thoughts are after reading somewhat briefly about enchanters are that I will duo early levels by using DS techniques, mid levels I will use mem blur on the enchanter in combo with Mephs soloing high reds to the enchanter for a nice XP boost, and finally at higher levels I will charm duo / fearkite.  Can anyone suggest any zones or tactics that would come to good use for getting the enchanter up as fast as possible, while also placing some focus on really learning the ways of the enchanter so I don't become one of those high levellers without a clue how to play my class!?  <br />
<br />
Bearing in mind I will always have Mephs around, my other 2 multi boxing friends aren't a certainty in this and I'd prefer to rely on Mephs solely for the PL'ing, any levelling I get done with the others will just be a bonus.  Perhaps some advice on gear wouldn't go amiss also, I've started preparing items for the enchanter with a main focus on AC/Hp's and most of all Int.  I've read through all recent threads involving chanters rangers and 2 boxing... but I'd appreciate anything and everything anyone else can offer by way of advice :)  A shammy seems a more popular choice for a duo usually, but with one of my regular grouping friends already playing a shammy, seems a bit pointless to add another one in, plus I think I'd find an enchanter that little bit more fun, and thats what EQ is about over all else I think.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Medain Valacirca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just the thought of trying to 2box charm kite makes blood squirt out of my ears =)<br />
Chanters die really really fast.Really fast.Did I mention they die fast?<br />
I would stick with fear kiting for 2boxing.maybe you can get 2box charm to work..but damn its gonna be hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">how will 2box charm he hard? Ranger pulls mob_01 with snare, chanter then charms it and sends it in. Ensnare lasts longer then charms so when charm breaks it will still be/can be easily re-snared then repeat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tadwen_CoTG</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm already doing this exact same thing, but with only Kunark on the enchanter's account.  I started a gnome enchanter and after about an hour and a half of playing time, I've got her almost to lvl 8.  This includes running around and getting spells for lvl 1, lvl 4, and lvl 8.  I figure I've spent about 45 minutes total so far actually hunting.<br />
<br />
What I've done so far is just put whatever buffs I could on her, including a damage shield, had her summon a pet and then pull with a DoT.   DoT will do the damage required and then the mob will beat itself to death on the damage shield, while I healed her holding a Book of Obulous (Improved Healing II).<br />
<br />
Lvl 1 - Killed newbie area stuff until she dinged Lvl 2<br />
<br />
Lvl 2 -6 - Went to the druid circle in Butcher Block and had her kill the  8 skeletons in the area.  You could do this until lvl 9 or so, but XP really slows down at lvl 6.<br />
<br />
Lvl 6-10 - Dwarf bandit camp near the docks in ButcherBlock.  There are 5 or 6 bandits.  Be sure to harmony the camp and pull them to your enchanter a good distance away from the camp.  They seem to have a huge aggro radius.  You'll see anywhere from 5-10% XP per bandit at these levels.<br />
<br />
Lvl 10-12 - I'd recommend the skeletons and various other things wandering around the mino caves in Steamfont.<br />
<br />
Lvl 12 and on - This is where your enchanter will get mem-blur.  This is the magic lvl when your enchanter's XP will start to fly.  As said before, just find something that would be red to your enchanter, but not too red, snare the mob, beat it until it starts to run then back off.  Have your enchanter cast mem blur 2-3 times, just to make sure it sticks and have her finish off the mob.  Easy XP.<br />
<br />
I'd recommend staying away from the typical XP grind cycle and focus on dungeons with an XP bonus.  XP will be faster and you'll get chances to practice your chanting skills on overpulls.  :)<br />
<br />
When your enchanter becomes light blue to you, you should be able to group together and do the grouping and killing green to you, red to your enchanter type thing.<br />
<br />
Not all of this is from experience, but it's what I plan on doing for my enchanter's route of leveling up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mephs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">cool, thanks for the replies so far :)<br />
<br />
Yes Erlanthir, that's the kind of method I envisioned using for charm soloing, hopefully it will be that straightforward, I'm just hoping it is and that there are no small problems, like I know a standard chanter pet cannot be commanded, don't know if this applies to charmed pets or not though.  I can also use root with Mephs if snare isn't enough (though hopefully not often as I want double bow shot dmg when possible!)  Thats something else to consider, Mephs has Endless Quiver, no Archery Master yet but hopefully not far off, I like using archery aas a main form of combat even prior to Archery master and still seem to get reasonable damage so long as the mob is kept busy and not rooted which is why charming tactics sound nice for me.<br />
<br />
I was also wondering about hotbutton setup, I always found 10 buttons to be too few, God knows how I survived with only 8, but I guess for a chanter I wont need a kick, taunt, ranged attack or forage button for starters!  I'm thinking I'll need a follow hotkey, an AFK redirection to speak to Mephs hotkey, assist button, perhaps some common spells thrown in there too.  I've always admired any good enchanters ability to switch to a target not being attacked to mez it, I know that would bother me a bit especially when mob health bars are lagging and it's hard to be sure that the mob you're trying to mez is not being hit.<br />
<br />
Anyways thanks for everything so far, would love to hear more ideas aswell, but heck I could read about it almost as much as I play the game :p<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Medain Valacirca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My brother is a 62 soon to be 63 chanter.Charm kiting is our bread and butter.And has been since  we started grouping at 45th lvl.<br />
<br />
If you think its as easy as snare then charm and all is well...good luck.<br />
<br />
There is a reason the majority of chanters dont charm kite.If it was as easy as snare/charm they would all do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mephs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What I'm not getting is why some are refferring to the tactic as charm &lt;b&gt;kiting&lt;/b&gt;.  Where does kiting come into anything?  I mean maybe I've got the wrong idea but heck I don't claim to be an all knowledgable source of chanter info, or I wouldn't be asking, but I don't see the need for any kind of kiting to be involved?  So if it is not as straightforward as charm, snare, let mob fight, recharm as needed and plink arrows at it with my ranger, what more is there to it?  it's okay saying that wouldn't work but I'm after information here, not criticism!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think charm kiting = charm mob as pet then when you sic it on another mob fear mob #2<br />
<br />
IMO though here is how a chanter lvling would work<br />
<br />
1-12 straitforward, Skin Like + DS (give chanter 2 6ac 65hp rings also for these lvls)<br />
12-41(grp lvl) mem blur killing<br />
41-50 group, ranger slaughters blues<br />
50+ group, chanter slows mob and can also fear-kite all mobs not immune to fear (chanter: 42 sec fear spell against anything)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mephs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hmm you could be right about that, but I would be loath to kite using charm, I mean whats the point of charming a mob to beat on another when I can beat on the mob just fine with Mephs alone, I'd also sacrifice my double archery dmg as it would be a running mob.  I'd rather straight out use a charmed mob to tank allowing Mephs to open a can of whoop ass, then when charm breaks again use Mephs archery/melee to finish off the weakened mob.  Granted this may not work amazingly well in PoP zones with low HP, hard hitting mobs, but in the old world while levelling it should be just fine.  I agree though, if the method of charm kiting is as you think, I wouldn't really have much place for it in my tactics, too much to keep track of, what if fear breaks early?  What if the charmed mob breaks charm (excluding DC of course), I lose my double damage bonus and have two mobs to keep agro control over to avoid a pulped chanter.  Too much going on there for my liking, not that I wont give everything a try of course, my assumptions could be wrong and I'll never ignore an idea without giving it a shot first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Medain Valacirca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Charm kiting is just a term used to denote the tactic of using a charmed pet as tank.<br />
<br />
Lot of people trying to get charm nerfed atm who have no idea of the risk involved in it.They see people doing it and assume its easy.All you do is snare and charm and sic pet and sit back right?What could be easier?<br />
<br />
Charm kiting is one of the few strats/tactics in EQ that actually requires a modicum of skill to pull off successfully and efficiently.Last thing I want is the devs gettin the idea that a lot of people are going to start 2boxin charm teams.Which btw wont work unless you are super fast and super geared.<br />
<br />
Charm lasts from 0seconds to 7+ minutes random duration.It is mana intensive and requires constant attention.Even with a dedicated healer chanter will die on charm breaks some of the time.And when he dies usually the other/s in group will be next.Imagine a 350+ hitting 85%+ hasted pet coming loose with a summing target mob in camp.Think you can 2box that?Now imagine the pet is a summoner as well.<br />
<br />
If I sound harsh its cause Im tired of the nerf bat being brought out because a certain part of the EQ population see's a certain tactic as being &quot;safe&quot; and &quot;easy&quot; as compared to traditional cleric/tank groups.When in fact it is just the opposite.</div></div><hr />
