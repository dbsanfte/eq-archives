<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Porgy Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The two more game balancing spells, Complete Heal and Slow, were so game altering that for a while, neither class got new and interesting things to play with that helped out groups.<br />
<br />
Recently, after some rightful complaining, Clerics got a huge melee upgrade to make up for the fact that Complete Heal was being &quot;balanced&quot; by making it nearly the only purpose of the cleric.  And that Verant was going to hand out some similar healing to Druids.  DPS, and Hitpoints of MoB were increased to try and balance it, which was partly sucessful, and in the end, clerics felt shafted.<br />
<br />
I think the same thing is happening with shaman.  Enchanters, and Beast Lords *can* slow nearly as well as we can, just like shaman's and druids *can* heal nearly as well as a cleric can.  Perhaps (wishing) verant is planning something to fill this gap, the way they did with clerics.  A melee upgrade would be fun, curses would be better, but IMO to make it a lot more balanced, a faster (4 - 6 tick) Dot that deals some reasonable damage, has a fast cast time and reasonably low resist rate.  I'm not talking about 4K in 30 secs here, I'm thinking 500 damage a tick, for 4 - 6 ticks. for like 275 mana with a 2 - 3 min recast. something you can use every other mob, or something.  Make it a curse or lure.  or heck, how come all these people get neat Debuff DoTs those are cool (not really class envy, just trying to come up with something).  Sure... fix DoTs, that needs to happen anyway, but gimmie something to do other than slow, send dogdog, and buff in a fight.  Mobs don't live long enough to warrent spending 250 mana on a slow when I good MT can take a Cheal for 200 mana and mitigate the same damage.<br />
<br />
yes a beastlord gets his 65% slow post 60, a shaman and druid get their Complete Heal at 58.  vs. Clerics much earlier.  I'm talking about end game here.<br />
<br />
And, I love my shaman, I'd never play anything else.  If they don't change a thing, I will still love my shaman.  I honestly believe in the pre 60 game they are almost overpowered.  Tanking, DoTing, Healing, Slowing, Soloing, Buffing, Sowing machines.  But anytime I get outta old world, in a good group, its Slow, Pet Attack, can can can can, Heal (maybe) sit.  And slow doesn't feel all that usefull for its cost sometime.<br />

I totally agree, I made a frog cleric, and kept trying to give some of my old gear to him and remembering &quot;Clerics can't use spears, why didn't I make a shaman, oh wait, I'm a shaman&quot;  I didn't mean this to be complaining, or to fight for something... What I really meant, which on rereading the post was We might have some faith that things will take that turn, like the did with clerics.  Vi has with clerics recitifed the situation that we are in now, and I think that ours will be recitifed in time.  They have done a lot in the last few weeks to help.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hmmm...Heres my thoughts<br />
<br />
A melee upgrade might be fun.  My function in a group is pretty much as follows:<br />
<br />
Buff melee<br />
listen to the cleric complain for a minute and then buff them too (/sigh)<br />
Hand out sows<br />
REgen the MT<br />
Sow again cause the monk was out of range doing gods only know what<br />
Then I slow and cripple the mobs that the main tank calls.<br />
<br />
So after the first 12 seconds of the fight I've pretty much done all that I can do.  So a melee upgrade &quot;might&quot; be fun, just for my own ego really, so that when I swing at mobs for fun I dont miss 6 out of 10. /shrug  I really doubt that VI would implement something like that because, as you say, pre 60 shaman are for the most part balanced (close to over balanced, but not overpowered IMO).  Adding extra melee ability to shaman would start people screaming about overpowered and thats just something I dont wanna hear anymore.  Im glad that most people have gotten over telling everyone that they heard that on some server some shaman soloed something that you should need a cleric and a warrior for.  <br />
<br />
I do not, however, believe that dots are the answer.  From level 19 to about 53 I always had a dot up in my spell line up.  Usually poision, becuase mobs never lived long enough to make Diesease dots mana efficient.  Since then I have stopped loading my poision dots.  Why?  a few reasons.  <br />
<br />
1) I think that they cost too much mana than they are worth.  They add a pittance of damage but do put a dent in my mana bar.  I can canni that back in about 30 seconds, but Im past the stage where I like to canni dance every second that Im in a group and not casting a spell.  Thats why I bought a horse.  Thats why I shell out hundreds of plat a week for KEI.  So that I dont HAVE to do that.  <br />
<br />
2) Dot agro is horribly broken.  Its silly that I can cast one spell and drag a mob away from a warrior that is dealing 100+ damage a swing, a rogue that is backstabbing for 700+ and a ranger that is doing 80+  a swing.  And honestly, I get enough agro from slow and cripple.  After Ive taken a few rounds of damage and the baddie is taunted off me Im really not eager to jump back to the top of the hate list just to deal 1K and change in damage (which is a small percentage of the total HP).  <br />
<br />
3)My spell slots are precious.  I only have 8, and I've got over 200 spells that I have to try and find a place for and about 15 that I use on a very regular basis during fights.  A spell that I can only cast once every 2-3 minutes as you suggest would be virtually worthless in a group setting, but it has a place in my spell book.  Near the back, right beside spirit of scale and all those vision spells shaman get through thier teens and twenties that are really really situational or just totally useless all together.  I MIGHT use such a spell soloing, but since PoP came out exp in the planes is MUCH better than I can find soloing.<br />
<br />
Curses could be fun.  If the lines were well though out and actually usefull to me I might use then.  Hell, if they are really good I might even quest for them.  But please, if VI is conna give me more spells, PLEASE make them something that will actually be usefull to me.  They group Haste and shrink that were recently rolled out were a good step in the right direction.  Yeah, they were broken upon release, but its VI and if you arent used to stuff being broken for a few weeks or months after release you have not been paying attention for the last 3 years.<br />
<br />
Your play style may differ somewhat from mine, if fact it probably is.  No 2 shaman play alike, although we use the same spells and abilities.  These are only my opinions.  I love my shaman and honsetly, every other class except my wizard is really boring after my shaman.  Ive tried them all...shaman was the one that stuck.  Im in it for the long haul, even if I get frustrated with the way the class is treated and some of out shortcomings.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My only true gripe atm is that I wish VI would reimpliment Khura's mending, Kragg's pretty much becomes obsolete beyond tier 2 (Its simply too slow to even remotely keep up with damage output later, and its useless for rampage healing, even in the likes of Ssra) leaving me reliant on a massive amount of AA's and praying for lots of crits on Tnarg's mending.<br />
<br />
Beyond that anything else I'd love VI to look at isnt really game altering stuff, its just things that would make the game more fun, IE making it worth me turning on autoattack again or looking at the agro on poison dots.  I'm not hugely concerned about the state of our dots, I only really use them fully when soloing, I'll stick ulthor on boss encounters if I have the mana and time spare but I'll only really go for damage if I'm at a total loss of anything else to do or the encounter is just gimpy to the point of not needing any real healing effort.  In those situations I'll usually be nuking simply because its better dps for less agro.  Yeah dots as a whole could use a look at these days, but I'll leave the necros to fly that flag inbetween chain casting neurotoxin.<br />
<br />
Oh and Litgruv, no disrespect to ye, but for someone with comparitively little experience as an end game shaman ye are terribly opinionated, I'll enjoy watching you change your tune once the wide eyed wonder disappates, ye can borrow my rose tinted specs in advance if you want =)</div></div><hr />

But .. but .. wait .. we got the almighty Torpor or Quiescence to help heal the tanks. :D<br />
<br />
Sorry . couldn't resist.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm kind of under the impression that we paid our dues for Torpor/Quiescence and additional mana regen by having substantially smaller heals in the first place compared to druids =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zenok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">imo something to balance out would be nice.....why at level 65 am i using a lvl 51 spell still?<br />
<br />
heres my basis for argument.....look at our speed versus an enchanter speed....<br />
<br />
---------------<br />
Speed of Vallon <br />
<br />
2:  Increase AGI by 52 <br />
3:  Increase DEX by 33 <br />
4:  Increase ATK by 41 <br />
5:  Increase Attack Speed by 68% <br />
<br />
---------------<br />
<br />
our speed<br />
<br />
---------------<br />
Swift like the Wind <br />
<br />
1:  Increase Attack Speed by 60% <br />
<br />
---------------<br />
<br />
ok the difference here is not only does it add a % but it adds attack.....(and dex/agi but who cares :P)......<br />
<br />
enchanter slow:<br />
<br />
---------------<br />
Forlorn Deeds <br />
<br />
2:  Decrease Attack Speed by 67% (L57) to 70% (L60) <br />
3:  Increase Disease Counter by 16 <br />
<br />
---------------<br />
Turgur's Insects <br />
<br />
2:  Decrease Attack Speed by 66% (L51) to 75% (L60) <br />
3:  Increase Disease Counter by 16 <br />
<br />
---------------<br />
<br />
my point? both have a small difference in actual % the reason that the enchanter speed is desired is because of its extra bonuses.....i think we should get a higher level version of turgurs, keep the % the same but maybe make a Turgurs/Cripple combination or something of the sort....our slow shouldnt completely paralize a mob so i wouldnt be for a uppage in %age, but nevertheless it is one of our primary class defining skills, and we should be desired for it.....<br />
<br />
I think a slow/dot combo would be neat, but would turn into more of a curse than a blessing due to mez breaking :p<br />
<br />
but i think the ultimate thing that urks me is that we are considered tradeable with a chanter in many groups.....fine im cool with that.....but why is it that every time that i get in a pickup group w/o an enchanter my group cries and whines until we get a KEI or C4/5......we are a support class and we have absolutely no way to support a caster other than HP/stats.....melees love us, but i always gotta hear the clerics/wizards etc whine their asses off that they need mana regen....<br />
<br />
my solution would be one of 2 options......either 1: make clarity potions NOT stack with c5 and make them a HELL of a lot cheaper.....or 2: an upgrade to cannibalize....Canni 6 -148 HP to self +48 mana to group, or something along that line.....both would still follow in line with our current abilities, neither would harm another class like chanters...and for the love of god even Beastlords can Slow AND give their group mana regen....arent they based off our spell system for the most part?....<br />
<br />
anyways, as far as healing goes well.....i dont like to heal, hehe, and when i do need to i can do it well enough imo.....and dot aggro doesnt bother me, i dont pong, i get under the mob if i think im gonna aggro then tank till the real tank gets it off me.....altho the fact that stuff dies before the dot wears off does bother me ;/ but that'd have to be an all around dot fix for necros/shamans/druids....not sure how they'd go about that, maybe a high casting cost spell with a higher dmg/tick that doesnt stack...make it useful in groups but not solo....<br />
<br />
just a few ideas to go off of ;)<br />

Hmm , im 65 which i have been for a long time , i have been leveling in places liek BoT and PoT and HoH and such for a long long time. I have a solid amount of AA and im on the final fights for the elemental planes. I can easily run a 60+ person raid on my own and occasionaly do. I have well over 150 hours of /played.<br />
<br />
Its not rose tinted specs, are you new here or something ? Ive bitched with the best of them , ive rolled my sleeves up and stuck my hands in the crap we were wading in and helped us paddle along to our goals as much as i could and despite disagreement by some ( not all mind you ) i think i have done my part and learned my lessons.<br />
<br />
Im sick of bitching , im sick of arguing with my fellow shaman over a game. I wanna enjoy it before i cancel my account and move on to something different is all. <br />
<br />
Its not inexperience my friend , its OVER-experience that drives my opinions at this point.<br />
<br />
Peace man</div></div><hr />

No it wasnt , ive been playing alot longer then 5 months and i never made a  &quot;drive&quot; to 1000 posts heh . I used to post from work which was at a call center , i had nothing to do but answer phones and TS PC issues. gets kinda boring so i would come here and other places to post. Some people thought i was driving to 1000 posts to get a name or something here ( which you notice i still dont ). I was just trying to not go insane at work :p<br />
<br />
Granted i havent been playing since beta , but i got a few years in my shaman and EQ in general and this isnt my first server to boot. /shrug<br />

/em remembers that wi****lly, born shortly before Kunark was released.  Trying to find that barbarian village in West Karana in the dark, then realizing you went the wrong way... and finding a barnfull of bandits.</div></div><hr />

W I S T F U L L Y --- thanks, naughty word filter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If you're getting bored in your traditional safe exp groups why not try something different? Duo with a Necro/Mage/Enchanter charming, put together a group with another 5 Shammies, be the puller and tank for a group... shake it up a bit. Maybe take up a trade skill or finish off Alchemy. Personally I've got plenty to do in groups I'm in, so I rarely get bored.<br />
<br />
I agree with Sebazy as well, I'd like to see the return of Khura's Mending as well. Kragg's at 65 really isn't too useful; it's simply not close enough to being enough HP healed to make it worth using. Quiesence is what I use 99% of the time, with Tnarg's for spot healing.<br />
<br />
Enchanters, and Beast Lords *can* slow nearly as well as we can, just like shaman's and druids *can* heal nearly as well as a cleric can.<br />
<br />
I dunno about you guys, but I can't heal even close to as well as a Cleric. Not even in the ballpark as close. Anyone with either a lot of HP or people taking a lot of damage generally drain my mana pretty quickly. Healing 1400ish HP for 450 mana or 2kish for 400 versus a Cleric's heals is a joke; it's not even comparable except to say &quot;here's what a real heal looks like&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">*disclaimer*  This opinion is based from BoT exping mostly<br />
<br />
Well , i can be a effective healer , but nearly as good as a cleric ? No freaking way. I think what they have done is split up the healing abilities of the cleric and given them to the druid and shaman. We are the Heal over time , druids are the direct healers. I like it this way to be honest. When i made my shaman &quot; back up cleric&quot; wasnt in the job description and the role i played from 20-34ish ( main healer ) made me wanna quit my shaman. Some shaman of are a different mindset , thats cool , but the fact is we CANT have it all , i dont want it all , i dont want this game to be 50 thousand shaman doing every role in the game. there  is diversity , we need each other.<br />
<br />
As a 65 shaman im a very effective healer if i work my skills , i keep Q on the MT at all times practicly while using Kragg to keep up with the different that Q cant not. I have a 1300 fast casting heal to get around rage or aggro displacment. So again , can i heal like a cleric ? No and i dont want to. can i be a extremly effective healer in almost any XPing situation ? Absolutly. <br />
<br />
And here is the kicker ....<br />
<br />
I dont need any KEI</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Porgy Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">LOL... I'm pretty poor at explaining my original point... but what I was hoping to discuss wasn't how Shaman can heal, class envy or anything like that...  Merely trying to compare two like situations:<br />
<br />
1) SoE giving out mini-complete heals to Druids and Shaman, and likewise getting a melee upgrade<br />
<br />
2) SoE making slow mitigation and giving 65 and 70% slows to Beastlords and Enchanters.. possibly leading to a similar upgrade for Shaman (melee or otherwise) and ideas on what similar truly non-game altering fun we might get as a result<br />
<br />
I went on to say that fixing dots needed changing anyway, so I didn't feel that was what was going to happen.  But it might be neat to get some other things (wherein I then listed examples)<br />
