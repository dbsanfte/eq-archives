<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hyllus you bum.  How are you going to fall into 50k?  I thought you were going to strip my old druid to equip the shammy a bit.<br />
<br />
Btw you had the shammy hooked up phat at one point, why would you need advice on what to get him.  All I can say is regen bp/jbb.  Those 2 plus some misc equip would do great for your combo.  I know you basically are using Hy for slows and heals, so free dmg would be a plus.  Get him a horse again too (I think you sold the original).  Horse + regen bp + jbb + epic monk = good dmb output and mana regen.  <br />
<br />
Everything else is trivial for now.  Don't worry about huge equip upgrades til you decide you really want to keep the shammy this time =)</div></div><hr />
