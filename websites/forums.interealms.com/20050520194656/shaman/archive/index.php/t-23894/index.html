<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sekin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I submitted the same request twice (same toon moving from same server to same destination). It gets me worry that SOE might charge me twice ($150 instead of $75 for the same transfer).<br />
<br />
Has that ever happened to anyone?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When I moved servers, I got this email about how it could take up to six weeks... I got moved the next day.<br />
<br />
Okay, maybe it was three weeks... /shrug. Happened right away, though.</div></div><hr />
