<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Krux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been using a new tactic (new to me anyways) in SD.<br />
<br />
Basically I,<br />
<br />
Ensnare the mob<br />
Cast stinging swarm<br />
sit down and wait<br />
I keep an eye on my mana percent.. when it hits 100<br />
I ensnare again.<br />
<br />
I know this is sort of a well duh.. tatic but I never really used it before as a Ranger.<br />
<br />
It is a slow death granted.. but it's very safe. I sit with full health points. should something happen I can always melee or run.<br />
<br />
I picked up Tolans Vambracer , which cast Stinging Swarm and it's even better. With the bracer I can cast Ensnare about every 30 secs..<br />
<br />
What I like about this method is <br />
A: The mob is parked, not going anywhere. Ensnare last 1min 36 secs. Lots of time to med.<br />
B: Using low mana costing spells, instead of say (Immolate), I can keep my mana near 100%.. <br />
C: If I'm low on health, I can still kill stuff.. and heal while medding.<br />
D. If I'm out fear kiting and I run out of fearable mobs, I can switch to this.<br />
<br />
FYI<br />
Ensnare last 1 min 36 secs.<br />
Sting swarm last about 54 secs.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've been practicing this on two mobs at once, and works good. Just go to watch the mana.<br />
<br />
Why is mana watching or keeping it at 100% important? IT's sort of a safety net.. plus it allows you to constantly cast stuff. IF I'm using a spell combo that I can't gain back while sitting between Ensnares.. then after awhile I'll run out. <br />
<br />
Also keep in mind, the more casting that you have to do.. the less time you have to med.<br />
<br />
Oh and if you can get any items or spells cast on you that help you regenerate mana faster then all the better. You might even be able to switch in Immolate then.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone else have some suggestions that might spice this up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hawkwind Dniwkwak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ensnare is a snare, not a root... don't see how you can sit down the entire time while your dot eats away at the mob... unless you mean you get up and move while the dot does its job. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ytrill Stonebow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think he must mean Ensnaring Roots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Krux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes sorry Ensnaring Roots is the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Yuma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">wow, now that truely is slow killing, u dont even put some arrows into them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Krux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not that slow, I guess I didn't explain it well<br />
<br />
Let me use SD for an example. I will fear kite cheetas till I get low on HP and mana.<br />
<br />
Then I can switch to this while I heal up. <br />
<br />
Also If I run out of cheetas then I can use this.<br />
<br />
If I get argo'd by something I can switch to this.<br />
<br />
I've been trying different techniques like this here are two I'm using.<br />
<br />
I Ensnare root a mob , timer starts 1min 36 sec<br />
I use Tolan Vambracer, stinging swarm<br />
I sit and med.<br />
If I am low on mana to start I keep repeating the above when I see stinging swarm wear off.. You will build mana this way.<br />
<br />
Once I reach 100 mana <br />
I cast Immolate , <br />
Cast stinging swarm (Tolan)<br />
Cast Ensnare roots (Timer starts 1min 36sec)<br />
I sit and med. Usually the above takes me to 82 or so % mana<br />
Once I hit 100 mana again I repeat<br />
<br />
This seems to be most effecient way to use this method with what I have. without outside buffs for mana.<br />
<br />
It keeps the mob parked and I regen Hit points while I med.<br />
<br />
Another version I tried is this.<br />
Once I hit 100 mana<br />
I cast Ensnare roots 3 times. (120 damage), last one starts Timer<br />
I cast stinging swarm (Tolan)<br />
I sit and med.. when I hit 100 I do it again.<br />
<br />
It's important to note that it usually doesn't take the full 1min 36 secs to get back to 100% mana. Using the 100% mana also acts like a natrual timer.<br />
<br />
I was doing the first method with a blue lightcrawler when I was argo'd by a sunflower while medding. <br />
I rooted the sunflower.<br />
Then I would wait time to root the lightcrawler again.<br />
Root lightcrawler, root sunflower, sting both of them..<br />
sit and wait for 100% mana.<br />
<br />
I think it would be possible to kill 3 blues while maintaining the 100% mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xyrauth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You're fighting like a druid! Hehe, that's what druids do, how can you live with yourself....lol j/k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Taylia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">When fear kiting, I start off by smacking the animal then running to my “safe spot”. I then ensnare when it’s in range, then back off a few steps until I can cast immolate. Back up a few steps then cast fear when I can see the whites of his eyes :P<br />
After beating on it for the duration of the fear, I run back to my safe spot and sit and wait for it to catch up with me, then recast fear. I do this until the fight is over. <br />
I find that I’m usually down a ½ - 1 bubble of life and down ¼ - ½ bubble of manna. I start the fight off with my Swarmcaller because I really need to practice my 2HS, then switch to either my Lamentation or Wurmslayer, coupled with my Despair Needle, because I really need to practice my piercing =P<br />
Using this method, I can go almost non-stop through 6 – 7 Mobs before I need to heal and meditate.<br />
Using this method, I get to practice all my vital skills and not get bored silly while soloing.<br />
Although your method is manna efficient, it is not time effective, in my opinion.<br />
If that is the way you like to fight, I would suggest playing a Druid, as they are manna dependant, and being a manna aficionado, you would excel =) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Krux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yes, I understand druids do something similar.. And yes Druids are better at the dot's than we are.<br />
<br />
Any tatic that takes you down to 1/2 bubble of life is not effecient or safe. All it takes at this point is for you to get an add and your toast.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying this is the best way to solo..<br />
<br />
I'm saying it's a way..<br />
<br />
I do this when I CAN NOT fear kite the mob.<br />
<br />
At 50 I've been making excellent exp solo using this.<br />
<br />
I can kill two blues with this at the same time that would other wise tear me apart if I tried to just take on 1 of them with melee.<br />
<br />
Also when I first started testing this method I was using mainly Ensaring roots.. recasting it as soon as my mana got back to 100.. (Usually takes about 25 secs).. This is different from how druids fight.. they dont' have to do it this way because they are more mana efficent.. and have better dots.  But as I was testing out other spells and thier mana cost I switched to immolate and went looking for free damage I could cast. So then it became closer to how druids fight.<br />
<br />
It never hurts to have more than one way to kill something. In theory you could kill any mob with this that didn't resist Ensnaring roots alot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Krux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Xyrauth , Yes you are correct about the summons.. but then again I don't think I want to tackle any summoning mob solo.<br />
<br />
In general if the mob is a spell caster any technique where you sit down and give him time to cast will not work.<br />
<br />
Taylia.. Granted yes that is true.. but as far as experincing bows are not practicle till much higher levels.. than myself.<br />
<br />
For example last time I practiced archery I went though 1 full quiver on 1 mob.. using dmg 8 arrows. My skill went up 1 time.<br />
<br />
I only posted this because I had never used it before, and thought others who may never of considered it might want to know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jalim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Krux: Not to nit-pick but I think Taylia was trying to say that when fear kiting mana/hp went down a TOTAL of 1/2 to 1 bub, not down to 1/2 or 1 bub left in the bar. But ALSO, I have used your tactic myself, and it works well, although I will admit I will do my best to plug a mob full of arrows as well while they are rooted. Yes, this will brake root, but if I stand, use my bow, sit, I can regain quite a bit of mana, and still regen mana sitting decently as well. Soneone else posted this in another thread and seems to work well for me.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I use pretty much everything everyone has said above :)  More ways to hunt = better hunting imho!<br />

<br />
Heck, I know someone who would use root/rot plinking for soloing in BW.  He'd also time it so that he'd be sitting when the med check came in, to get the mana for medding instead of standing.  <br />
<br />
Krux, what level are you?  The 8 damage arrows are a horribly inefficient way to throw your money at mobs unless you're using trueshot.  If you're over 45 then might i suggest getting a Tolan's bracer?  Free arrows, even ifthey are less than half the damage and less range, are better than 8 damage arrows on the ol' coin purse.  Since I've gotten my Tolan's, I've summoned enough arrows that if I'd fletched them I'd have been able to buy a second tolan's bracer.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Vash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">seems like it would be way to long for me =/<br />
<br />
At 51 you can still solo in EW... even at 52 if your really desperate<br />
<br />
fearkiting that is...<br />
<br />
<br />
to stinging swarm a mob a mob to death to me is just yuk =/<br />
<br />
its what 6 points a tick?<br />
<br />
<br />
You could prob bow kite at a faster rate =/ i just a sugestion... i could joust kick a mob to death but it doesn't always make it a good thing lol...<br />
<br />
<br />
but thats just me, just saying it might not be the quickest or the funest way to kill a mob...<br />
<br />
maybe if you were doing this to like 10 mobs at once LOL now that would be some fun... hey that has me thinking lol...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Lauranthalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Yes, it's a common druid tactic, and we are not nearly as good at it, but I use it occasionally when things get tight. I had many, many levels of druid practice to know what the limitations are though. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Vanyarian Singollo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Well that little fit of Krux's was certainly interesting. I fail to see how Archyr's comments were rude in the slightest! In fact, It amazes me that your a senior member of this site if you take such offense to an offhand remark that was made before in the thread! If you don't want to hear ANY negative feedback why submit an idea to public approval in the first place /boggle? I would expect a certain level of maturity, rather than ignorance and barely concealed profanity...<br />
<br />
Oh well, in any case the tactic has promise but imho is FAR too slow to be of much use.  We do not have the DOT power or the numerous other skills that druids use in order to hunt this way.  Even at higher levels, when our DOT's and mana pools are substantially increased, the idea loses strength because the monsters that one would ideally solo simply would not be affected very much.<br />
<br />
My thoughts on the matter anyway.  It's been a long night heh (watching the news for election day...ya I know I'm weird :D ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Lokriek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I with you Krux.  I like your ideas as one method of soloing.  I certainly will be trying this out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Aenedor Trueblades</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Soloing?<br />
<br />
Here's a new one that worked for me.  Buy loads of bandages.  Find a high spot (but not to high) jump and bandage your wounds.  Do this until you have maxed your bind wound skill.<br />
<br />
Find a zone with well spaced mobs or mobs that don't agro.  Use /tracksort con to locate the low dark blues.  Then buff up and melee.  Make sure you are not below 50% health when you start fighting a mob.  You should loose 1-2 bubs of health despatching the mob.  Then bandage until you get the message saying that you are at 50% health and go find another mob.<br />
<br />
I did this at 33 with Wooly Mammoths in Everfrost.  35 with Centaurs in SK.  37 or so with Zelniaks in DSP but got seriously out of pocket in DSP due to cost of bangages and no income.<br />
<br />
Ranger = Versatile.<br />
<br />
Rangers Rock!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Anuvil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Rather than buying band-aids, get an Embalmer's Skinning Knife (Proc: Summon Bandages), and swap it into your main hand slot at the start of a bind wound or solo session.  Fight until you have enough bandages for what you want to do, then put your regular weapon back into that slot.<br />
<br />
With the advent of PoP, you can also get an Anizok's Gauze Press, which is more compact than the 20 stacks of bandages that it can produce between recharges.<br />
<br />
I carry an emergency stack of bandages with me, since you never know when you might be stuck somewhere with no mana, low health, and a pressing need to raise your hitpoints(DoT spell, anyone?).<br />
<br />
We now return you to the original focus of this thread.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Rainingdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">With the advent of cheap KEI (Kodiaks Endless Income - Clarity III) its almost a shame NOT to root and dot for a while, and I have been using K's method or similar for most of my cash farming sessions. Although I will add that when I have plenty of arrows (Tolan's Bracer still beyind my means) I will root then dot then mellee til im down to 60 percent health then I back off and I fire in between heals then sit and med after I'm full health and refresh Tolan's Bracer mana free dot. When the root breaks I'm usually full mana again and so I just let them come and then mellee them to finish. This works great and for some reason sitting and medding while you ahve a mob rooted in front of you is a lot less boring then sitting and medding without!<br />
<br />
Happy Hunting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>TheRiov</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">You might want to throw an Immolate in there too if using this tactic.  Makes it go about 3x faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Brumla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">never tried it, but must be slow killing. Hmm maybe I didnt get it.<br />
<br />
Anyway You have /bow if you can dot mobs efficiently, cause my conjuration sucks too bad :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Maian62</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">To be fair, even though it is fairly obvious I only started using this myself recently (ever since I got my Tolan's sleeves) though I do use arrows as well if I am not running low (no Tolans bracer yet).<br />
And I only use it on stuff that I cannot fear kite or if  LOM.<br />
<br />
The other thing I started doing recently for outdoor groups anyway is kiting a snared and DoTed mob around while everyone else backstabs it.  As long as noone else  tries to grab aggro it works beautifully, including with rogues.  The mobs drop before they knew what hit them and we take no damage.  Do this for stuff that won't fear kite when you have no healer in your group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Jahari Durden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">This method, in combination with both the new PoP nukes (Burning Arrow and Flaming Arrow) enables Rangers to solo hillgiants at level 39... It's not a very efficient thing to do, but it's still pretty cool, considering noone thought it possible. :)<br />

I do agree that the new spells make kiting easier, and should make Krux's method work even better if you can get the DD's in between roots during a short mele session. :-)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Spartacas Jaggedpine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Actually, tolans vams+immolate+tolans bracer are fairly fast.  And it allows you to take adds, and yellows.  You are a fool if you don't acknowledge and try to adapt the tactics of both parent classes to optimal use together.  Also a neat use is that if you sit while the recycle timer on the bow is going you can still get max mana and HP regen while shooting your bow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Jelanen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I think what Krux is trying to say in his original post is that this is his method to maintain an offensive posture, ergo, still bringing in exp, while effectively regenerating mana and HP.  Is this the main method to use to gain exp?  Not for any rangers, but I think its an excellent way to keep the exp flowing instead of sitting around playing gems waiting for mana to go up to heal oneself.  I think what got Krux irritated is that people were dismissing this as an all the time method when it was only meant as an alternative to sitting on your butt.</div></div><hr />

Say you are fear kiting, and you get nailed a few times, and your mana is low. While sitting there medding and doing nothing, wasting time, this guy is killing another mob with his root and dot method. /shrug, makes sense to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Kuwiq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I use a similar 'rest while expin' tactic in PoJ with my 59 ranger<br />
<br />
I find prisoners and sentries an excellent source of income as well as exp (better then fear kiting the rats IMO).<br />
I usually get a few blue/raw/diamonds an hour as well as sellables and random loot items worth a few 100 plat.<br />
never got an official amount of exp I get because it is depressing at 59, but I know I do pretty well. <br />
<br />
Sometimes I go here after a raid for some excellent exp until buffs start dying. Usually I just use KEI.<br />
<br />
Here is how it works<br />
buff up, fight a sentry. Root and heal when needed. After the fight, I fear kite a few rats to 'med up'<br />
I have force of nature, chloro, skin like nature, innate regen and KEI, so as I am fear kiting my hps and mana are going up VERY well. Then I go back and kill some more sentries. So basically I am resting up and expin at the same time.<br />
<br />
This is the only good non stop exp I have ever got solo. <br />
I used to just fear kite the rats all day, but now I have to dodge the PoJ &quot;fear spot&quot; (that all pathing leads to) because I got GM warned. <br />
<br />
The only time I have to rest is if I get a rare KoS add or my Earthcaller decides not to proc.<br />
<br />
Try it out, good fun.</div></div><hr />
