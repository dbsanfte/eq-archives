I'd like to give a big thanks to Chievass / Coleric of wolfsclan on sol ro who helped me kill black dire without so much as anything in return(well except for my eternal gratitude and an advisor robe :) )<br />
<br />

<br />
grats on your piece.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The boots are so cool. I bet you'll be clicking them all the time whilst you run just because you can :)<br />
<br />
That insta click has got me out of trouble a few times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Koraden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks Jinheim, i hope you didn't mind me sending you a tell out of the blue while you were in seb asking about how to spawn black dire :).<br />
<br />
By the way, if black dire is not up and you want to spawn him, kill the advisor (an advisor) in the room just south of the library in castle mistmoore, this is labelled 19 on the eqatlas.com map.</div></div><hr />
