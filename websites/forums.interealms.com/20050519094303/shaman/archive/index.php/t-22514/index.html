<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ronagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I had to zone out of Crystal Caverns last night, runaway orc brought back too many friends...  I was a good ways from zone, but the pet was still alive (5% health) when I did.<br />
<br />
He zoned with me. I thought maybe he would need to be within a certain range, but apparently not.   I like......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't have suspend minion, but I do have pet hold. I parked my pet near a zone, trained my way through it (Emerald Jungle, there was nobody else in the zone) and  my pet was with me on the other side. Good stuff.</div></div><hr />

Watch out, inc. nerf!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ack, don't use the &quot;N&quot; word. :(<br />
<br />
I was very pleased to find that they survive gate now as well..  :) Now the BLs and Necros won't get as pissed when the druid 'accidently' hits the evac button.<br />
<br />
Updated my sig with possible new pet quotes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Now they just need pets to withstand a brush with mistyping bards.  I dont think I've ever been in a group with a bard where my pet didn't bit it at least once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tyck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I wish that there was a &quot;In-Case-Of-Invis-Break-Glass&quot; effect for Store Pet.<br />
<br />
Such as having your pet be auto-stored if you get hit by invis (providing you don't already have a pet stored).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I got momentarily weirded out last night when I gated out of plane of storms and was walking around pok and sat down and there was my pet in my face. I was like what the heck, I had no idea they'd live through a gating, I thought it was only regular zoning between adjacent zones. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I don't have suspend minion, but I do have pet hold.

<br />
I don't understand. If you have pet hold, why did you have to park him during your run through the zone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I park him without pet hold to run through zones. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Azadark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I happy we got zoning pets for free =)<br />
Would have thought for sure it would cost 55 AA points!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">err, I had him pet hold I mean... he didn't have SoW (shoulda cast it) but was waaaaaaaay behind me by the time I zoned, but was reunited once I finished zoning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>TeodorL</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">With suspend minion, just suspend.  Invis to zone line, unsuspend pet, then zone.  No train, no fuss, no muss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm now seriously considering that Pet Affinity stuff. Just when I was starting to cross some stuff off the shopping list...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I know we are broke and all but this is a nice bone to throw us.  I will start doing my ldons again..Nothing was worse for me then zoning into an ldon and that &quot;hey, dont pull squat untill I summon and buff my close in shaman support system..aka scoobie..Now, I can summon the little blighter and buff him along with the rest of the party..not a bad gig..Now when we get into the dungeon, I will be ready to rock from jump!...not bad at all, that and I can now go to ME pull the mini bosses I want to the zone, slip through, wait for the bosses lackies to wander off and zone back in and commence to whoopin his evil bottom..</div></div><hr />
