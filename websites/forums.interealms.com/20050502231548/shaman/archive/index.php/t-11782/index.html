<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kierok2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, I am currently playing with a mage and we are having a great time the combo of Mage and Shammy is great. The only problem we seem to be having is when the earth pet is used. The Earh pet roots the MOB and without fail my poor dogdog is always closest and gets the snot knocked out of him. I was wondering if anyone out there knows of a way to keep dogdog further away with a weapon of some sort or something else? The other Mage pets hold agro just fine and dogdog just bites away. Thanks any info would be greatly appreciated.<br />

The trick is, take off pet taunt and let the mage pet taunt. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kierok2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nope, the agro is not the issue it is the rooting of the MOB. By code the rooted MOB must hit the closest agressor on its hate list and dogdog is always closest. I need to know how to keep dogdog further away so when the Earth pet roots the MOB dogdog is not so close.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">try shrinking the earth pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You cant.<br />
<br />
Even with taunt off on your puppy, and taunt on for the mage pet (any of them) your puppy will always take the hits.<br />
<br />
The attack range on the mage pets is longer than that of the shaman pets.  Your pet will always get closer than the mages pet.<br />
<br />
Without a PC to attack, the mob will attack the closest pet -your puppy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hemmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You might try the air pet instead...I think I have had good success with them in the past in duos, they can stun with procs and with a dex buff they proc pretty well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Get up there and tank in teh face!  Don't hide behind some ball of dirt!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">There is exactly one way to get the dirt clod closer than the puppy. Have the mob right on top of the clod when the clod gets the order to attack. The clod will not bother to move farther away, since it can melee from that range with no dificulty. Send in the puppy AFTER that.<br />
<br />
Of course, once the mobs has been pushed around a bit the puppy may end up being closer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gagner67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well I found that a mage maybe good to group with for weapons for your pet. <br />
<br />
But a necro complements us soooooooooo much better.  God I love to get healed by their heal dot over time while Canni dancing.  <br />
<br />
Plus I don't have to pull with a necro whose in liche (Necro never runs out of mana or have to sit eating their pet for mana).  Plus oh, oh the necro heals himself and his pet!<br />
<br />
Best of all his spectre pet takes all the damage instead of my dogdog.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kierok2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thank you for all of the great information. We will try to get the MOB to stop on top of the Earth pet &lt;aka Ball-O-Mud&gt;for now and in a few levs I will get up there and smack it around myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'd just have the mage stick to the water pet. There's no need to summon an earth pet since you have root. Water pet is 2nd to earth in HP and 2nd to fire in DPS making it an excellent all around choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Izarek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You should test which pet works for you.  If you need the earth pet because of agro problems I think the air pet, particularly with either Gnoll Hide lariat (procs stun) or with the pet weapons that 61+ mages summon (and sometimes sell in the bazaar) should hold agro pretty well.  If agro isn't quite as much of a problem then I think water does more damage than air or earth.<br />
<br />
If you are using earth for just raw tankage believe it for not Air does a much better job on some mobs because of its higher AGI and its stuns.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>AlynaRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Monster Summoning II,III <br />
<br />
You should be able to get a pet with the hps of earth, Ds'es itself, and doesn't cast root with a few tries..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Phinger Bang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I duo with my rogue bot a lot and use root to keep the mob under control.  A nearly guaranteed way to keep mob facing you is to be right in its face.  Since you are slowing and you want the mob in your face, drop as many dots as you can and the mob will love to beat you up.  You'll find positioning pets to be nearly impossible, they are going to move around a bit during the fights.<br />
<br />
Good Luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Icebreaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">On the topic of mage / shammy duing, it works great... probly half of my exp from levels 55 to 61 has been duing or trioing with mage friends in poi.<br />
<br />
I have seen alot of people mention Mage as a solid duo partner for the shaman, but I have not seen as much on beastlords. Does anyone have any experience with a BL/Shammy duo as compared to Mage/Shammy?<br />
<br />
The main thing I am interested in, is if there are things that can't be done as easy with one duo as can be done with the other, levels 60 to 65ish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tranzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">so water and air pets are teh better ones to use in this combo i take it then?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Hadd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">go with air/water when mobs don't hit to hard , change to earth when you really need that extra lil hp ....<br />
doubt BL/mage is that good , Bl would suck as a healer , might be good pre 60 though , but i'd hate to be the beastlord , beeing healer without the good spells for it is a lil hard and in that combo they have a lower slow than shm even so mobs would hit harder and more healing required ...<br />
<br />
Hadd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Baldkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I've duo'd a bit with a BL and it works pretty well.<br />
<br />
I slow and keep him healed, and both our pets tear through stuff.<br />
<br />
Nice thing is, no root parking adds, just slow it and let his pet tank it and we're good to go. <br />
<br />
He heals that thing as well as the 00ber clerics heal the warriors.<br />
<br />
Makes a really great combo, imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>kierok2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well kewl beans I am now 45 almost 46 still dual boxing these two and figure I will start letting the Mage get exp again when I hit 49, he will be 52 with a bub to go for 53.    The reason I also like the Earth pet is that it is the lev 51 where the other water and fire pets are 49 so it is just plain bigger. The 53 Air pet will be the one to use until 54 then from what I am reading, if I want dogdog to stay alive that is. <br />
<br />
  Just a FYI.    Mages are a lot of fun and in IMHO are the best PL in the game.  Many people ask how this can be with Clerics and Chanters running around. I am getting about 1/3 a blue somtimes more at 45 in BW killing the biggest creatures I can find there with the exception of wurms &lt;to many hp&gt;. This is how. Mage and Shammy are not grouped.<br />
<br />
1. Mage gets a pet<br />
2. Mage goes and gets MOB pulling with Malosini &lt;lev24 low mana&gt;<br />
3. Mage runs back and has pet attack<br />
4. Mage sits down and watches spectacle<br />
5. Shammy pet attacks<br />
6. After a short time MOB is wounded bad and turns to run<br />
7. Mage destroys his pet and all the damage it has done to MOB along with it<br />
8. Shammy stands casts a DD kills MOB gets all exp <br />
9. Mage gets another pet<br />
<br />
Costs<br />
Mage pet ====&gt; 200 Mana, 100 Mana Burnout &amp; 1 malachite &lt;1sp&gt;<br />
Shammy=====&gt; Little Mana<br />
As you can see the money is little to nothing and Mana can be maintained with little or no effort.<br />
<br />
    This is fun to do if you want to race from 40-? but I do not suggest you do it any earlier. My Shaman had to earn up to 40 because I did not want his Defence and attack to suffer or weapon skills. I did it with another charecter and he was severly gimped for a long time because his skills suffered so much for so long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>cynwydd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">i duo with a mage (my husband) a lot. as far as mage pet tanking goes, if you're not using your puppy, the earth pet is probaby the way to go. if you _are_ going to use your puppy, air is the best choice, as fire pets are _stupid_ and always seem to cast the wrong spell at the wrong time (dispell, anyone?), and water pets, though the dps can be nice, are rogues, and really are made to backstab and not to tank, and can die _very_ quickly.<br />
<br />
admittedly, most of my experience with these comes from the higher level pets, since i didnt start playing until my husband was 57. mostly we used earth pets, and i didn't use my puppy, since his dps was just not worth the hassle. now i use my puppy most of the time, since the 61 airpet holds aggro _very_ well. (it can also take quite a beating compared to the 62 water pet)<br />
<br />
my advice is this: if you need a good tank, stick with the earth pet, and hold your puppy back for adds and to keep the beastie occupied while the mage resumons if/when his dies. if you _really_ want to use your puppy, have the mage use an air pet. water pets are for use with a people-type tank, and fire pets are just scary.</div></div><hr />
