<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I was looking at the spells I was casting in the last month in my logs and thinking about how to spend my upcoming AA points and I have a couple questions.<br />
<br />
background - 30aa pts total, 2 in bank<br />
run3, regen3, mc3, canni5, scr1, qb1<br />
<br />
Spell Casting Mastery - This ability increases the chance that a player will successfully get a specialization roll.<br />
<br />
The first point increases the chance of specialization by 5%, the second raises the chance to 15% and the third to 30%.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have been working on the QB and SCR for enhanced torpor, but wanted to take a look at Spell Casting Mastery before devoting my next 25 pts to Torpor.<br />
<br />
What I was wonder is since I have specialize 200 in Alteration, I must get successful spec rolls in this discipline fairly often already.  It seems that this skill would be most useful for people who cast a lot of non-alteration spells.  Since the other spell disciplines have lower specialization numbers.  <br />
<br />
I mean would it look something like this??<br />
(pulling numbers out of air)<br />
<br />
Alteration <br />
regular spec chance: 85%, SCM3 spec chance: 115% <br />
<br />
Evocation, Divination, Abjuration, Conjuration:<br />
regular spec chance: 30%, SCM3 spec chance: 60%<br />
<br />
<br />
How does specialization work exactly?  If we have a &quot;successful specialization roll&quot; do we get a fixed percentage of mana cost off our spell?  Or does it vary?  Does this skill increase the chance of successful roll or the varying percentage of mana savings?  Oh I am so confused...<br />
<br />
Help?  :(<br />
<br />
I have read a few threads that say you get 10% mana reduction in your 200 spec discipline 100% of the time.  Then with SCM3 you get 20% mana reduction in your 200 spec discipline 100% of the time.  Freaking complicated... I just wanna know will mana savings on alteration spells be worth it for me to invest into this skill before QB3 and SCR3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i did spell casting mastery even before mental clarity ... why regen mana a tiny bit faster when you can just use less of it  =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Some posts on the Druids Grove cover this. Here's a couple:<br />

My ideas about specialization were waaay out of date, heh.<br />
<br />
This is from the board mod:<br />
<br />
There are no &quot;specialization checks&quot;. You get a certain mana savings every time you cast, based on your spec skill level, and also on your SCM skill.<br />
<br />
Basic Specialization Savings (for 50 and 200 spec):<br />
50 = 3% savings EVERY TIME, no check performed<br />
200 = 11% savings every time<br />
<br />
SCM1, add 2% savings (5% or 13%)<br />
SCM2, add 5% savings (8% or 16%)<br />
SCM3, add 10% savings (13% or 21%) <br />

No source given for the info i could see. Make of it what you will, but if there is no limit on specialization, i'll be doing SCM for sho'.<br />
<br />
I assume that focus item effects are a reduction after that, but couldn't find any info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">cool thanks Darjeeling...<br />
<br />
one question.<br />
this lists 2, 5 and 10 percent savings<br />
<br />
but in game it lists 5, 15, and 30 percent...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think its a bonus 30% to whatever you have, not chance + a solid 30%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ths source of the numbers you found at The Druid Grove is :<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Anyone seen any info on SCM and focus item stacking?<br />
<br />
Eg: torpor costs 200 mana. <br />
After specialize and SCM (21% reduction) cost is 158.<br />
After mana conservation (another 10% reduction?) cost is ~142?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Id get qb and forget scr.  Really dont see the point in getting it.  Your torpor might last longer, but its so insanely cheap to cast and we have such good mana regen casting 2 in a row isnt a big deal at all.  Only problem is if your getting beat down and you want to save yourself.  Or you might want to use the 6 seconds casting that other torpor for better things.  Well with qb is a lot harder to get interrupted and you save time.  Pretty much qb is the way to go there.  Also its good with other spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">thanks for the input guys.<br />
<br />
I still haven't decided if I want to do Quickbuff or Spell Casting Mastery first, but I feel like I understand how it works a lot better now.  :)</div></div><hr />
