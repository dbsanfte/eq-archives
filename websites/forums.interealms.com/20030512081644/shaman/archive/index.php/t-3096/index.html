<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">swear I saw one on these boards once, but cannot find it now.  Was in HoT last nite and getting out slowed by lower lvl shamans who claimed hi charisma helped them land slow, which I think is a contradiction to what everyone else has to say about the subject.<br />

Whatcha think?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yes, charisma affecting every spell from fear to slow to mez is a load of rumours you shouldn't believe.<br />
<br />
