<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zelgadis</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 08:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So has anyone found any group of these to hunt or kill?  In sparse or mass hordes?  We seem to get two big anti-summon spells (which I thought and hoped that the Nature's Rebuke wasn't anti-summoned), but everything I have encountered and tested on so far has seemed to be not summoned.  I was told that the stone guys in the PoJ Trial of Execution are summoned creatures.<br />
<br />
Does anyone else know of any  other areas with summoned NPCs?  Kind of makes it pointless giving us Exile Summoned and making Nature's Rebuke a Vs. Summoned only type proc spell if there's nothing to use it on. :o<br />
<br />
Need to make big ol areas with a ton of summoned creatures like in Planes of Power like there were undead for paladins in Luclin!  I'd hate to have to mem the spell just to go clear the entrance of The Hole or Najena... or Steamfont.  How about clearing the green summoned mobs around Twilight Sea zone and kill our faction there?  O.o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solonaro</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 10:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I imagine once we get into the elemental Planes there will be lots of summoned mobs.  Hopefully they will ALL be summoned, since if you're fighting half of one and half of the other, Nature's Rebuke really isn't that big an upgrade over Cry of Thunder...<br />
<br />
One way you can check this out is by asking your friendly local wiz/mage/cleric to zone in and cast their low-level spell Sense Summoned.  It has a zonewide range (handy for spotting Severillous' pet!) so if there are no summoned mobs at all, you'll find that out.  For example it returns nothing in the Plane of Nightmares, and in the Plane of Disease it returns a mob's pet very far from zonein, so there seem to be zero summoned creatures there as well.</div></div><hr />

This may make rangers even more desired then they currently are for the trials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daesun</div><div class="date">11-01-2002, 09:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sense Summoned does not pick up Enforcers in Plane of Justice as being summoned, but they are affected by Exile Summoned.  Something to be aware of - either the spell or certain mobs are bugged as of 1st Nov.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sure there are more summond mobs to come in other planes though.</div></div><hr />
