HPs: 2450<br />
Max hit: 68 (70 with SoM)<br />
Bash/kick: 24<br />

Having said that, I remember reading that the Omens enchanter animation hits for 75, whereas before their PoP one had the same stats and max hits as True Spirit (except it dual wielded innately).</div></div><hr />

As for DW, tricky one that. I could swear I've seen the odd triple attack without weapons, but that's not exactly dual wielding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Can you maybe give him one weapon to test this?  Would think if he innately dual-wields, you'd get both 'slash' and 'bite' messages if you gave him a sword, for instance.</div></div><hr />

If anyone else gains any info regarding 67 pets Dual weild status please post here and let us know .<br />
<br />
Overall he IS an upgrade now to our 61 pet ... but I think our dogs should hit as hard as enchanter animations so i would have much prefered too see 75 as max hit ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">They've said innate SoW is coming.  Well the sort of did, when they mentioned that every summoned pet was going to have their speed increased to that of their owner's, or something like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This is complete and utter bull****. I'm going to ask a question:<br />
<br />
Since when have enchanters had better summoned pets than us?<br />
<br />
Answer: Since planes of Power, when not only did they get innate dual wield, but they could get AAs to actually command them. Back in the olden days, enchanter pets were a joke. They followed thier masters around and didn't attack until something attacked the enchanter. They had by far the worst pets of any class that could summon them.<br />
<br />
So our pet needs to be brought up to equal, if not greater than the summoned omens enchanter pet. Anything less is inexcusable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Moglyzok Moogleman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Im gonna have to agree here, its great we saw our pet upgrade, and I love the pet to death, I use it all the time.  With this kind of an &quot;upgrade&quot; its completely unpar with the upgrade from the 55 pet to 61 pet, I definetly recall after using the 55 pet for months the 61 pet was MUCH better. <br />
<br />
I dont even mind the upgrades a whole lot, but its the fact they didnt bother to make a WOLF and innate SPIRIT OF WOLF.  What the hell am I missing here?  Innate dual wield is definetly overdue too. I'm not saying make are pets rampage and flurry, Im just saying make em on par, as Grizlor said we have had better pets then them, and while we have fallen behind in MANY aspects, the pet should not be one overlooked, especially when we asked for certain things and called out while waiting for the fix. Anyway, /rant off.<br />
<br />
At least they fixed it  :D .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shayne716</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Good news not sure why anyone is complaining when we have gained 10-15% more dmg from pets.  Good for the enchanters maybe the devs were compensating for the 50% reduction in charm pets dps by upping their summonable ones.   Overall I'm fairly happy with the upgrades both through spells and aa that we have received this expansion and the pet fix was my primary concern that had yet to be addressed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yeah it is kinda BS.  For so long shaman are used to getting +1 improvements while other classes get +2.  Guess we are just used to it.<br />
<br />
Same outrage should be going for our Omens dots, as for our Omens pets and healing.  Every step forward classes take as a whole, shaman just seem to get further and further behind.  And the further behind we are, the more we celebrate the tiny improvements we get after fighting for it for months.<br />
<br />
I just don't understand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Buzcam_Aro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">No innate quad attacks. Still need to give toys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It doesn't appear to me that he innately dual-wields...  Just logged in, summoned a new pet, and gave it one weapon.  It only ever 'slashed', and would think it should bite as well if it were dual-wielding.  I never noticed more than a dual slash + kick round, either, which reinforces the notion that he's not changed in that regard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Retron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Another update - I've seen some bashes and kicks for 26 (without SoM) - looks like they upped that as well.<br />
<br />
Giving the wolf a single weapon showed that he still doesn't dual wield, with nary a bite to be seen in testing against lizards in CT. There were several occasions when there'd be a double followed by a single attack within a second, which seemed odd (I'd used SLTW on the pet).<br />
<br />
Finally, regen is much improved - 7% a tick with /pet hold or after a fight, which works out as around 170 HPs/tick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Since the pet is a warrior, and 63, it should be able to triple, which would account for an earlier posters observations. The PoP pet was level 58, so it didnt do that.<br />
<br />
Btw, warrior triple attack is an additional check if a double attack was successful, so it doesnt happen every round. Double and triple attack only happens with the main hand weapon, unless you have additional AAs (which the pet wont have of course). The pet should be capable of the occasional quad if it is dual wielding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I agree completely. <br />
People are actually seing this as a huge improvement or upgrade, just because the stupid pet was bugged to begin with up till now.<br />
<br />
A Shaman pet should be weaker than that of a Mage, Beastlord or Necro, but it should kick the Enchanters ass against an NPC.</div></div><hr />

against anything with moderate AC, that line of buffs will turn into LOTS of 70s flying by on screen.<br />

Well its 13%, which is pretty standard across the board for an expansion that TRIED to maintain a semi-status-quo among classes (I actually feel that Shaman got the biggest &quot;bump&quot; in power of any class overall)<br />
<br />
I would have liked innate Dual Wield in the pet, I dont bother to summon it if I dont have weapons to give him and I refuse to carry around bags full of rustys. I will go to the bazaar and buy some pet toys, or have a mage in PoK summon me some if I know I am headed to XP, but otherwise, I just dont bother. I am not gonna whine about it too loudly, though. With all the otehr stuff we got, this is a minor issue for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That was triple with the mainhand... err, mainpaw attack. I've been doing some more testing today and can confirm that the pet does indeed triple, meaning in theory you could get three hits from one weapon, two with the other and a bash or kick in a single attack round.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Omens SK pet is impressive, though, hitting for 65 and critting in the low 100s! SK's aren't a pet class either, yet they get a pet crit AA.... Then again they also had SCS prior to Gates, and SCS is what replaced Fury of the Ancients for us.</div></div><hr />

Correct me if I'm wrong, but unless it has been changed .... AGI, DEX, STR buffs don't effect our pets, so they are a waste of mana.  I even question FA having a effect on pets though in concept extra ATK should work but I'm guessing it doesn't.    <br />

Considering they hit for max 68 without might, and for 70 with it, I would say yes for the %damage.  Due to obvious reasons, its harder to see the difference with the %avoidance.</div></div><hr />

Seriously speaking, I agree that Enchanters need something to boost them in today's world of single pull exp groups, perhaps killing the recast on your nukes. But really, all that does is free up a spell slot for anyone who alternated 2 nukes. <br />

FA certainly affects pets, I dont know about the other buffs though. There is marked visible increase in max hits when you drop FA on puppy. On many mobs where before he might be hitting midrange, after FA has been dropped on him, most hits are for max.</div></div><hr />

Take the same mutt. Same spells. and give him full pet toys  and Armour. He wipes the floor with the bat. <br />
<br />
If you want mutt to be a slightly larger speedbump invest in Mage armour. The extra 300ish AC prolly does wonders. and In fact I am half tempted to Get the Suspend 3 aa and Get mutt a real suit of armour. Like a cheapy Set of crustation or something. I spend 60 plat for kei. Spending a couple hundread to make sure Mutt can take 3 hits might be worth it.<br />

After some time passes if I dont get an update I will push this Issue again . Also you have my word that if I do get an update I will post here and let you guys know .<br />
Best we can hope for Grim, thanks. Personally I do not think there is ANY justification for NOT giving our pets innate dual wield and SOW after 60. Both the 61 and 67 pets should have been no-brainers for this feature, especially given the bump that Chanter pets got.</div></div><hr />

The new Sk pet have 3300 hps , proc lifetap like mad , quads for 65 , innate DW , average DPS between 40/60 , and what we got? a big crap<br />
Pls ask for a new Dev , someone who don´t hate Shamans.</div></div><hr />

Pet was not buffed except for the lonely chanter haste. After my heal landed for 2454 HPs I stood there stunned for a few seconds. That's like 1-2 rounds of melee of the mobs we were fighting against each day. That cannot be real .. someone pinch me.<br />

So long<br />

Edit: Yes the pet was at full health after the 2454 heal .. thanks for the heads up, Shiuna.</div></div><hr />

I assume it healed him to full health.</div></div><hr />

I had seen pet crush *3 + slash *2 while farming goos for epic 1.5,  combine with mag pet gear + Fos + Spirit of Sense,  lv 67 summoned pet about 3500 hp, can tank many low blue mob very well.  <br />
(except GoD/OOW mob proc claw of chaso 640 dd, pet won't last long on them)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Chifari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Shaman pets not innately dual wielding is still one of the stupidest things about the class.  Boo, Sony, on this one.<br />
<br />
My pick for stupidest thing is still the long refresh time on Spirit of Bih'Li, which I just can't see any reason for AT ALL.  Can anyone tell me what is so overpowered about being able to chain cast *gasp* group sow?<br />
<br />
I'd prefer shaman pet to hit for 80ish, innately dual wield.  If it has to hit for pathetically low damage, maybe give it the ability to go defensive!  At least could maybe survive some rounds then.  I go through pets in PG/RS like Kleenexes, and their only real function is for my group to generate puns out of their names (Star Trek II: The Wrath of Konn, Konann the Barbarian, Koner MacLeod of the Clan MacLeod, you get the idea).<br />
