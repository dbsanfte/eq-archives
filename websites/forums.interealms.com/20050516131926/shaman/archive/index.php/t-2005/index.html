<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am having a...discusion with a guildmate of mine about exp loss in a duel.  He keeps saying that dots will cause you to loose exp in a duel, as well as pets, and as a result they should be banned from a guild pvp tournament we are likely to have soon.<br />
<br />
Now, I have been around for a while and I know that this used to be true.  I am also 90% sure that this was changed a loooong time ago.  I have been doing some research on this, but I keep coming back with some mixed answers.<br />
<br />
Please comment on the following:<br />
<br />
1. If you are in a pvp area, ie the arena, and are doted, and then leave the pvp area and die, then you are going to loose exp.  This makes sense and I understand why.<br />
<br />
2. If you are in a duel and get dotted, and then a mob comes and attacks you, you and you die, you will loose exp..duh.<br />
<br />
3. However, what happens if you are in a duel in some random zone, lets pick toxxila, and  you kill somone with a dot, will they take an exp loss?<br />
<br />
4. What about the same situation in a pvp arena, where both people stay in the arena the entire time?<br />
<br />
I recently dueled my guildleader in tox, and killed him with a dot and he took an exp loss.  We weren't expecting it and as a result he didn't get a resurection in time and ate a death in level 58.<br />
The gm wouldn't res him, as his corpse had rotted and dissapeared.<br />
<br />
However about a month ago i dueled an enchanter in lower guk and killed her with a dot and she took no exp loss.  <br />
<br />
I have been witness to a guide giving somone a CS res who too exp loss in a duel, and I have been witness to a guide refusing a cs res for someone who died in a duel.<br />
<br />
Half the people you ask tell you one thing, the others tell you another.  So if anyone can answer these question for sure, then please post here.  <br />
<br />
This all pertains to blue severs btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1,2,3 - All generate an XP loss.<br />
<br />
4 - is not supposed to generate an XP loss, though I have seen it happen. If you fight in the Arena (the zone, as opposed to the arenas within towns) you are guaranteed to not lose XP.<br />
<br />
As for getting s CS rez for an XP loss in a duel - unless it is caused by a BUG (you died within an arena area), you are not entitled to one. The time you saw someone get one was an example of a GM/Guide going beyond what he was supposed to do - he (or she) was just being nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zixor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As far as I know it is impossible to lose xp by dying in a PvP area (an arena) whether your killed by PCs or NPCs.  Although there might be some bugs that could cause xp loss in an arena, I always treat DoTs as fair game when dueling in the arena.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You can lose xp in the arena - this happened to a friend just yesterday. We were having a duelling competition (one on one) and one person went linkdead. Of course the linkdead player carried on attacking, but his opponent stopped. Anyway, the LD player won the fight, and the person who died lost xp.<br />
<br />
That's the only time I've seen anyone lose xp in the arena. Although I have heard a rumour that if person A is dotted by person B, then person B dies, then person A dies to the DoT, that person A will lose xp, but I don't know if this is true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You should really have your guild-wide tournament in the arena. Having it through duels is just ridiculous because it allows ijjits to say things like &quot;no dots, no pets&quot; effectively nullifying shamans and necromancers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Duels in the various arenas are extremely boring after a couple of times, PVP in dungeons would be awesome.<br />
<br />
hmmm... guildwar ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">3- Will/Should not generate an experience loss unless the person that DOTed them dies, zones , goes LD or Logs. <br />
<br />
4- An arena battle (in any area of the PvP radius) should not generate any experience loss regardless of death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Steeloak Grouchiebear2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, recently, in the last week and a half...our guild was holding a guild only event in the Arena and I was dueling a 56 Paladin. Amongst my epic dots and running around dispelling him, he eventually died, only to come back to find out he lost XP.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, I stopped dueling at that point with anyone...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've killed about a dozen people with dots.  no one has lost exp yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think its bugged.  I have caused an XP death sometimes and othertimes not.  Killed a friend with dots in the areana (in bazaar)and he took XP.  Also if u get knocked unconciounsess and die from pain and suffering you may take XP loss, happened to me once (in areana).<br />
<br />
XP loss with duels in or not in the areana is kinda messed up right now as far as i can tell.</div></div><hr />
