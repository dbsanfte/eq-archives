<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">These two guys are King Tormax's personal bodyguards in Kael Drakkal. I have been working on trying to break Tormax's throne room with single group of fellow crazies on Quellious (while Tormax is dead of course).<br />
<br />
We have done pretty darn well in our last two attempts. We took out Dlammaz, Kyenka, Yetarr, and all of the Sentinels leading up to Tormax's bodyguards.<br />
<br />
All of these giants were fairly easy to slow using Malo/sini, and then Turgur's.<br />
<br />
However, Vkjen Thunderslayer &amp; Irrek Bloodfist have been our undoing. I had no luck landing malosini or Turgur's even after both Tash and Malo were in place on these guys.<br />
<br />
I checked the &quot;slowable and unslowable mobs&quot; list, but these two are not on it.<br />
<br />
Can any shaman with experience raiding Tormax comment on these two? Are they able to be slowed, or should they really be considered 100% MR?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They are slowable, but it can be a pain to land.  If you have a bard (especially one with AA points in instrument mastery), it can help a lot.  Get Tash, Malo, Occlusion of Sound on there, and you can probably slow them pretty easily.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />
