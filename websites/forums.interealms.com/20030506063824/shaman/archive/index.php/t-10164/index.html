<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is it possible to have a different interface for each toon on your account? I ask because frankly the interface I want for my Bard is not the same as the one I would want for my Shaman.<br />
<br />
Also, will most interfaces install automatically? Or do I have to do some editing / file replacing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yeah each char gets a file called UI_charname_servernumber.ini<br />
So like UI_Henora_64.ini<br />
<br />
that holds the information about each characters UI.<br />
<br />
Interfaces vary wildly by creator on whether they install easily.<br />
Personally I use variations of Vertmod.  <br />
<br />
A great site for UI mods is http://www.eqinterface.com</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can have different UI's loaded for different chars. You need to make a different directory for each and just copy the files you want in there. You can modify the files yourself or download them from someplace like eqinterface.com. For most that you download you simply just decompress the file into a directory and thats all you have to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Set your 2 ui's up in their own folders (c:\...\skins\ui1\ and \ui2\, etc).  Log on your shaman, type /loadskin ui1 1 (the 1 at the end makes it remember your settings).  Then log on the bard, type /loadskin ui2 1.<br />
<br />
Now when you swap around, it should automatically remember which UI you are using on each character.  If you want to change it manually, those savings are in the files Henora listed.<br />
<br />
Usually installing UI's is easy, but once you patch, look out, who knows what VI has changed.  Thank god they quit making the whole game crash if your UI is out of date, I haven't updated mine in 3 months, you just get a message every time you zone about files being incompatible, but it still runs fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In your EverQuest directory there is a file called UIErrors.txt.  Open it and it will tell you what's wrong with your current UI - i.e. the reason you're getting that error message.  If you're a bit technical you can monkey around in the file(s) it lists and fix it.  Worth it just to get rid of that annoying 3-line error message you get every time you zone or switch resolutions :)</div></div><hr />
