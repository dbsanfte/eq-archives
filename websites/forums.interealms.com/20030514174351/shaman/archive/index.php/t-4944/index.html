<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Durnitol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Let's face it, the upgrade in power after Torpor, malo, and focus and AA is just too large to put level 59 and below in the same category.. I know the hunting grounds forums don't see that much traffic, but I'd like to be able to see waht other level 60's are doing, and not have to wade through the rest.<br />
<br />
<br />
That said, neat mobs to hunt are the dorf bodyguards in northwest EW north of the giant fort near GD zone. The ones near Berezin (name?) and the coldain cook. There are 4 of them, all level 50, and they all have like 15-20k hp (seriously). You can't split em, although only 3 of em come if you pull the correct one(don't remeber his name). <br />
<br />
They have specific names, so it's easy to tell what order your chain Epics dots are placed in. Here's the coolest part:<br />
<br />
They hit for like 80 max!!!! Well.. at least only 2 of em do. The first time I pulled I slowed em all, dogdog had one covered whilst i parked the other 2. Dogdog was doing GREAT!!!  After 5 minutes+ of fighting and rooting and Malosini and stuff, dog still had 80% health!!! Now granted i had Regrowth, Focus, and Celerity on him. Each one takes about 7-8 minutes  to kill, at least 4 epic casts, chain JBB, melee with me Dathor Great Hammer, recast slows/heals as necessary, and Bane em when they are at 15%. Yes 15%, Bane only does like 9% damage by itself on these guys.<br />
<br />
Anyways they are wimps when slowed, I recommend having malosini up in case of root resists. Dog stands up really well to them, except for at least one who hits for 122 or so. <br />
<br />
The first will respawn before the third falls, so no waiting for more stuff to kill. They have NO FACTION HITS, and in fact will not KOS you, perm dubious. They drop about 3pp per kill, and occasionally Coldain heads, which you can turn in to Bvellos in Kael for + Kael faction with no negative Dorf Faction.<br />
<br />
Not too frequently camped, easy to beat, a challenge to master, and they are level 50 (above average exp).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baludien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nice post. I do agree that the 60 game, if you have your spells, is radically different than the 50-59 range. However, it seems like this forum is rather underused, making a 60 only forum probably wouldn't exactly be all that active either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm slowly getting used to my new spells.  Have Malo, Torpor, Bane and Pox now.  As well as epic and jbb.<br />
<br />
So am warming up on the bigger mobs.  Played around with the named wurms in BW, they were sort of a joke.   Named in Skyfire and Elder wurms are easy as well.  Coeterie Legionaires are pretty easy.  Have done Lodizal with 5 peps (no cleric), but havn't tried solo yet.  Going to try Yeld soon.</div></div><hr />
