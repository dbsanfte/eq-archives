<br />
Their AA exp granted humans half the regen it granted iksars, as confirmed they were intended to do, by Absor.  So humans got 6 possible points of regen from their AA skills, and iksars got 12.<br />
<br />
The latest patch nerfed iksar monk regen down to human level.  Unfortunately for many iksar, they had already spent quite a few levels in arch regen for what now seems comparatively little value.  Human monks would agree on that last point, as virtually none of them had spent all the points needed for arch regen on that AA skill, as 3 points as a reward was just not enough in the end game to justify spending that many points.<br />
<br />
If you thought it was bad when many of the shamans here were gloating that they had their rare spells and other shamans didn't, even though a great many of those very same full-spell-book shamans were simply gifted at least some of them outright, or got them in a very short period of time...<br />
<br />
and if you thought it was lame that when Verant upped the spell drop rates so that other shamans could get their spells more easily, that actually made some shamans mad or disappointed because their shaman brothers and sisters didn't have it as tough any more and found their shamans more playable and useful and fun... well, we take a distant second place to the monks.<br />

Some of these guys actually wrote Verant, and whined enough on web boards, to enact a NERF ON THEIR OWN CLASS!<br />
<br />
Way to go guys!</div></div><hr />
