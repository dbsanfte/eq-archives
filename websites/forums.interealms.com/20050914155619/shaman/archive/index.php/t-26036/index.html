<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ever since we've gotten pet dual wield I've noticed a problem with our pets attention.<br />
<br />
whenever I get an add while soloing, despite the fact that both mobs will be attacking me, my pet seems to have a wish to off-tank the other mob. I tell my pet to back off and attack my target.<br />
<br />
add mob is no concern for me yet.<br />
<br />
pet stops attacking the mob and attacks my target, until the mob attacks again, pet promptly turns and starts to try to offtank again, in a true ranger fashion.<br />
<br />
this becomes very annoying, I keep spamming pet back-off and attack my target. pet repeats his previous actions. this continues until he manages to push the add into another add, and chain aggro adds up.<br />
<br />
this hasn't killed me yet, but it has come damned close. more annoyed than anything at the moment, as it just happened 3 times, in 3 different ways, 3 different places.<br />
<br />
is there anyway we can remove the ranger attitude from the moronic pet? I don't remember this ever happening before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shamylamy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've noticed this happening too. I've also noticed my pet switching targets to bash cleric mobs to keep them from casting. I swear he has been doing this cause in stillmoon almost everything CHs and the pet saves me from dealing with it sometimes while soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sony tells you, 'go get /pet focus AA'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dogdog never did this before? That is the life of a Necro, damn fickle pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've noticed the same thing, pet always wants to tank the other mob.  Usually backing him off and hitting pet attack a couple times gets him on the one I want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sony tells you, 'go get /pet focus AA'<br />
<br />
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing... I have had this problem myself... tell it to back off and muttley is like f%#* o*&amp;, I'm not budging...<br />
<br />
Might have to get the focus until this bug gets fixed... if it is a bug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Working As Intended.  Thank you, please drive through.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">pulled this from the old Haven Light forums under the app section. figured since everyone was talking about pets it may enlighten those of you that didn't understand how pet hold works =)<br />
<br />
Section 3 - You mean I don’t have to spam /pet back off?<br />
<br />
Most classes that can use a pet have an Alternate Ability which they can get at level 59 called Pet Discipline. This ability allows you to better control your pet. On raids, pet control or lack of it can lead to a raid not succeeding. I highly recommend getting this Alternate Ability as soon as you can. This Alternate Ability is required for magicians and necromancers. To use this ability you need to type /pet hold using your keyboard. This will cause your pet not attack anything unless specifically told to. It is important to realize that mobs that attacked you while your pet was placed on hold are still on the argo list of your pet unless you clear that list by typing /pet back off. If you did not type in /pet back off, your pet would attack the next target you told it to attack and then go back to the mobs that where on its argo list. Not backing your pet off will likely cause a train and cause unneeded down time. Please remember that spamming /pet back off with out first placing it on hold only tells your pet to stop attacking anything on its argo list, but the very next time you are attacked or are hit by a spell, the pet will go right back to what attacked you. This includes area of effect spells. I would also recommend making a social with /pet hold on one line and /pet back off on the next. This will save time in placing your pet on hold and you will also have the argo list on your pet cleared. To determine what you should be attacking you should be using /assist and HoTT. Ideally, in between every pull you will use your social with /pet hold to keep your pet from argoing the mob that is being pulled before the Main Tank can engage it and build argo. A good rule of thumb on boss type mobs on raids is to wait approximately 10 seconds after the mob is placed and engaged by the Main Tank to send in your pet unless specifically told to wait longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yes, I know what /pet back off does... and it is broken.<br />
<br />
I spam that, the pet doesn't seem to back off half the time, the other half, if I tell it to attack a different target (after using /pet back off) it goes back to the original target anyway.<br />
<br />
I would:<br />
1. /pet hold<br />
2. /pet back off 3-4 times<br />
3. get new target<br />
4. /pet attack<br />
<br />
muttley goes back to attacking previous target<br />
<br />
Tried it this way too:<br />
1. /pet back off 3-4 times<br />
2. get new target<br />
3. /pet attack<br />
<br />
muttley goes back to attacking previous target<br />
<br />
Something in the coding is broken, and I bet it has something to do with Advanced Pet Discipline, as others have impled.</div></div><hr />
