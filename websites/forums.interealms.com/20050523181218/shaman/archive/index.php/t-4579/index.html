<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Maximillien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Tried summoning my horse with the graphic off and got a message about needing the horse graphic turned on for it to work. So, does JBBing on a horse still count as medding? Hope so. Guess i'll have to do some tests later if you all havent.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, when did this happen? I never read the patch messages, and havent had a horse for a while (sold it for a jbb, just got another)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snt_asher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Whats happend is thay fixed it so you have to have horse models on to somon your hours, but there is a way around this. if you turn off all the new luclin modles and horse modles you can somon the horse just fine and it helps you zone faster :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I turned all luclin models off. I can summon a horse and I could before I turned it off. Still doesnt seem to increase the regen, even after checking with an insta click item or low mana cost spell such as root.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">With all luclin models off it still works. <br />
<br />
All I do is pull with slow and jbb till dead and I end the fight with more mana than I start.<br />
<br />
Dont forget that if you move or if you have auto attack turned on you wont get the mana regen. Also the bar doesn't update until you cast a spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You don't med when you do ANY action, this includes using JBB.  In the begining they allowed us to cast and use right click items and still get medding mana regen, but they nerfed first one and then the other pretty quickly.</div></div><hr />

I think you're wrong it's been working fine for me so long as I <br />
<br />
A) have all luclin models turned off<br />
B) dont move<br />
C) dont auto attack<br />
<br />
 oh yes and <br />
<br />
D) have horse summoned<br />
<br />
I've been doing mobs in katta, ten mounts, and HHK in the past few days and the pull with slow JBB till dead works. I end up with more mana than when I start (unless I was FM to start with)<br />
<br />
You can test this with your black fur boots canni down a bit then spam your black fur boots till you are back at fm. If you are right you will not regain mana because you are spamming a right click item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>mookle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think its still working<br />
With all luclin models off i'm getting the increased mana regen, whilst using JBB during fights, with the horse summoned. Not attacking or moving either.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's really hard to tell, but I think it's still working too.  I have all luclin models off, pull with slow, apply epic DOT and JBB until dead and I have regained the mana I used for slow by the end of the fight.  I would not expect to gain much mana at all if I wasn't medding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hmmm, I never used my horse without the model on, that actually changes your mana regen?  innnnteresting :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">wait... so med-while-casting DOESN'T work if you have luclin models (including horse model) on, but DOES work if you have NO luclin models whatsoever?<br />
<br />
if this is the case, one of the two is undoubtedly a bug (hopefully the bad one =p) and i at least will be /bugging it as soon as i can prove it (sorry in advance if it gets nerfed).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mullzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Oh and another thing... you can cast SoW on yourself and run at your normal speed (even though you are on the 8.5k, slower than J-Boots horsey).  Perhaps you could always do this (cast sow on someone with a horse), but since I never play with the Luclin models on I never know who's on a horse anyway. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">works both ways.  I play with just barb models on and get the mana regen.  If I go on my other PC I have all models off and still works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You don't med when you do ANY action, this includes using JBB. In the begining they allowed us to cast and use right click items and still get medding mana regen, but they nerfed first one and then the other pretty quickly.<br />
<br />
I can confirm that you do med on horse when :<br />
-- click JBB nuke<br />
-- turning around<br />
-- stand still<br />
-- canni, casting any spell<br />
<br />
you only not med when :<br />
-- you are moveing(not include turining around without move)<br />
-- you have auto attack on<br />
<br />
before nerf, you can cast horse in all difference model set up, now you can only cast horse when:<br />
-- have horse model on, have your race model on<br />
-- turn off all model, turn off horse model, you get med benefit from horse and can run with your own sow's speed<br />
<br />
also, for those who said didn't notice mana bar increase, eg, when you OOM and standing with horse and go afk 10 minutes, after back from afk,you see your mana bar is still OOM but you are actually full mana now, you can update your actually mana bar by casting any spell and it will show actually mana level again<br />
<br />
hope that clear up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ryasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I thought this was nerfed. From what I understand by the patch update, it was now impossible to summon a horse without the models on. Am I wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It's possible only if you have ALL Luclin models turned off.   If you have some on, some off... you'll get the &quot;Can't summon&quot; message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ryasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Thanks Bigguss! Always there with the answers! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Anguil-Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">is this the mediation formula?<br />
<br />
MED SKILL / 10 = MANA PER TICK<br />
<br />
252 [capped med skill] / 10 = 25 [mana/tick]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">So you don't regain mana if you are using the JBB to cast?<br />
<br />
Bummer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Shamam got it exactly right, post-nerf, as of last night.  Medding while chain casting JBB works fine with all models off.</div></div><hr />
