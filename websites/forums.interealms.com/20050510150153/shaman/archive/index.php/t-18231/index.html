<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Long post, sorry.  Anyway, short background:<br />
<br />
I'm generally an EQ newbie, only been playing a year.  Level 65, most of my spells, familiar with most low-end zones/XP areas of PoP zones.<br />
<br />
I belong to a very small &quot;family&quot; guild of about 16 people.  It was formed from a group of people who group together virtually every day, they picked me up, I became part of the group, and we just made it official with a guild tag.<br />
<br />
Now all of the original group is 65 and all have at least 50 AA (I'm the 50, school disrupts EQ grinding), so we're slowly moving up into that area where group-based xp is dropping off in terms of challenge.  Last night we did an LDoN with me as the healer, got 5 pulls in Mistmoore, and took them all down after losing only the group's chanter.  When our C-healing druid and chanter is in the group, we can easily handle 4-5 BoT mobs at once.  We've single-grouped Zlandicar, the Protector of Fire ring event, and the Sleepwalker (though P.o.Fire and Sleepwalker really aren't all that hard).<br />
<br />
Recently, we've picked up a number of new members, all in the low to mid 50's in level, so our guild has kinda created two tiers...the 50's tier, and the 65 tier.  We've been powerlevelling the youngsters as best we can by grouping them all together in sweet spots like PoV IC and stacking a couple of 65's in there with them ungrouped, doing debuffing, CC, or adding DPS to help them out.  When we get them up to 65 and reasonably well equipped, we plan to start low-end raids and such, as well as get keys for better zones.  In short, we're starting down the very long path to the Elemental planes.<br />
<br />
Last week, one of our founding guild members quit the guild.  He said he'd grown tired of grinding and was looking to apply to a raiding guild.  He wanted the gear you can only get from raiding, so he applied to a guild that's about 2 steps from elemental planes.  When we explained that with our new recruits we could start down the path of raiding, he told us that he wants to do it NOW.  <br />
<br />
Needless to say, most of us were stunned.  He'd never said a word to any of us, and what he said got me to thinking about what I want to do.  I realized that since we have to do it all (flagging, getting keys, etc.) anyway, why not do it with others you love being around?  This way, we're all going to get our keys, raid these mobs for the first time, die a lot, but learn from our mistakes and come back and beat them.  We'll get our keys together, get our flags together, then when all is said and done, we'll reach where we want to go together and feel pride in having travelled the road from the beginning to the end.<br />
<br />
Given your choice, would you do what we intend to do, start from scratch and go all the way to the end, or would you jump into a guild that's already well down that road?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have been in this same situation many times over the past 3 years. I've had many good friends leave well established but small guilds to app for the uber guild of the day. I've never held it against anyone. You play for your own reasons and not for mine. It's dissapointing sure but I would never want anyone resenting me if they stayed in the guild. I am content to play my own way and I don't like the schedule I would have to follow if I was in a big raiding guild. I also don't like being told what to do and when to do it nor do I think being part of a 50+ person effort is anything to brag about. I'd rather be in that 2 - 4 group guild and kill lesser mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've already made my choice.  I'm in a non-raiding guild who, if they ever get to the elemental planes (which I doubt, but it could happen), it'll be in a long time.<br />
<br />
My taste of big raiding guilds left me running for mouthwash.  I can't handle the assemblage of rotten little kids that big EQ guilds seem to require.  Nobody else has enough time to raid 5 times a week.<br />
<br />
I understand the urge that sent your guildie running, though.  I'm used to playing video games to The End.  Seeing all that's to be seen, killing everything there is to kill.  Problem is, getting to the End of EQ requires that I spend a lot of time doing things (and being with people) that are just dead miserably boring to me.  Who knows, when I realize that I don't enjoy EQ at all anymore, maybe I WILL hop to a raiding guild and spend my last month seeing &quot;how the other half [10%] lives&quot;.<br />
<br />
I guess what it boils down to is that one of the big reasons EQ is so wildly popular is that it appeals to a wide range of people.  The 80-member raiding guild isn't for everyone.  And not everyone is going to enjoy the homey family guild.  Some people will play for 2 years, and never get past level 25, because they'd rather just sit and cyber (you know there's gotta be one out there).<br />
<br />
I've stopped wondering which is the &quot;right&quot; way to go about it, considering it took me a lot of time and effort to discover what it was that I wanted in the first place.  *grin*</div></div><hr />

That's a pretty big generalization. I'm a working adult, in an elemental guild of mostly working adults.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Let me apologize in advance for the long post ...<br />
<br />
Without a doubt, I'd stay with your guild. Here's why. I never bothered to guild myself until the age of 53 seasons, as I was looking for a guild where I'd be accepted as a person instead of simply a slower. I found that guild in Souls of the Arcane, and I'm one of the, if not THE, luckiest Barbarians in Norrath. <br />
<br />
Our guild is very quickly becoming two-tiered like the one you described. We've got right around 150 mains, and there's just 42 (at last count, I believe) who are 60+. The VAST majority of SOTA is in the 55-60 range, with a few in the 50-55 range and a handful below 50. We are examining our guild's direction now, but it seems a majority of them want to explore elemental flagging. We're working on leveling our 55-60 crowd (woooh, when SOTA gets its 55-60 crowd to be 60+, watch out Karana!) and working on getting our younger crowd up in the-mid 50s. <br />
<br />
It's going to take a HELL of a lot of work, whether SOTA goes VT-Ssra or whether we go elementals, and it's going to take a ridiculous amount of time ...... but who cares? These people have quickly become my family, so to speak, and if I need to group with them in POV for no experience while they fly through their lower levels, or if I need to take them adventuring for no experience ... hell, I'll do it. At level 63, very nearly 64, I'd rather slow my own development and help them with theirs than fly to 65 and get all my AA's for one reason ... I want them with me when I go to places like BOT, HOH and PoTac. I want them at my side when I go to the cool places, and even though I am a hugely competitive person (not my best quality) I realize there is NO time limit on EQ. That's the great part. I'd rather take my time and enjoy myself with people I enjoy being around than join one of those raiding guilds ... because therein lies pressure. My friends who are in the big-time raiding guilds have left those guilds ... be here for this raid or we'll deguild you, have this many points by this date or we'll deguild you ... no thanks. Just like grinding experience gets old, constant raiding gets old. SOTA allows me to lay back, relax, and group with people completely out of my level range and enjoy the game ... and while that doesn't help my character's progression, sometimes, it's more fun.<br />
<br />
I suppose I understand why your friend left ... its hard, sometimes, to be in a group where you're getting little or no experience and have someone link a PoTime item ... but hey ... when I look at my choices ... friendship, fellowship, and fun vs. big-time zones, big-time items and big-time mobs ... I'll choose friendship, fellowship and fun any day of the week.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree...one of the best things about EQ right now is that there is so much choice in what you can do.  In my first run of EQ I was in a so called &quot;uber guild&quot; that did all the big raids of that time (this was years ago) regularly and it was fun but wore on me (that guild is still active as an all 65 raiding guild that I believe now raids time for giggles - I don't doubt they're one of the strongest guilds in the game).  In my second run of EQ I don't even have a guild...I'm enjoying things differently.<br />
<br />
I've lead and been in a variety of types of guilds in several MMORPGs...most recently as a co-guildmaster in a DAoC guild.  People will always come and go from guilds for a variety of reasons.  Sometimes it upsets you but in the end you have to realize that it is a game and people play it to have fun.  Sometimes people need a change in the way they approach the game to continue having fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Binter - it sounds like your friend got tired of PLing new people.  I can't say I blame him.<br />
<br />
To answer your question:<br />
I would start from scratch and go all the way to the end.  BUT I wouldn't want to delay the start of the journey while a new group of people gained 10+ levels and 50AAs.<br />

This may be an unfair generalization, but it's not so far from the truth.  I spent about three months out of work during the summer, so I spent a lot of time playing Everquest between job apps and interviews.<br />
<br />
I could log on at 11 AM on a weekday, and most high end guilds on Rodcet were &quot;too many to list&quot; and in raid zones.<br />
<br />
These aren't working adults.<br />
<br />
To the original poster:  You are doing your guildmates a disservice if you ask them to hang back and powerlevel people.  Absolutely nothing binds these lower level people to you, and half of them will ditch you as soon as they meet the minimum requirements for whatever their next step is.<br />
<br />
If you want to advance: build up your high level people, and recruit other people at the same level of play, or you will become a feeder guild.  Make sure that you have clear goals towards progression and that everyone understands them.<br />
<br />
Oh, and pamper your clerics.  You can replace any other class, but if you aren't the one bending over backwards to give them the world, some other guild will promise it to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Addendum: Find clerics in smaller guilds and promise them the world if they'll just join you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Look at it like this...<br />
<br />
Getting to the elemental planes with your closeknit guild of 16 or so people is simply impossible. To do it, you'll need a guild that can consistently field 60 or so raiders night after night, and more wouldn't hurt. That means you'll probably need 100 or more guildmembers. Perhaps fewer, if you have very full-time raiders, perhaps substantially more if lots of you raid only a couple nights a week. <br />
<br />
What you're committing to do now, actually, is to spend a vast amount of time recruiting and PL'ing people you don't even know. You spend night after night PL'ing them, and getting nothing back in return. Eventually, you might have more guildmembers and friends to play with, and do tougher raids. Or, and this WILL happen, many of them will move on after they've gotten all they can out of the guild and feel they can make more progress in a &quot;higher&quot; guild. <br />
<br />
Why should this long-time guildmember feel that he has to spend tons of time PL'ing people who, at this moment he doesn't even know, so that he can hopefully someday raid the elemental planes with them? If he wants to raid the elemental planes with a pack of strangers, why not get to know people who can actually carry their own weight in such an endeavor, and do it with them, months sooner? The only drawback is that he has to leave the small group of close friends that he has now. Of course, some of you could follow him to the new guild as well, and that may very well happen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Working adult does not always mean a 9 to 5.  Of the last 3 jobs that I have had over the last 8 years, two of them required evening hours.  I spent 40+ hours a week at both jobs.  But when I got home at midnight ot 1 AM, Id sleep for awhile and then I'd log into EQ.  From 8ish to 3ish I had time to play, raid, tradeskill, whatever.  Many (if not most) of the people that I came into contact with during that time were adults that shared simmilar schedules.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I always wonder where the idea of &quot;uberguild = kids&quot; comes from.<br />
For starters, you don't need that much time to be a successfull raiding guild, my guess would be that 15 - 20 h a week would give you full attendance on all our raids.  And that is by no means a lot of playtime for most serious EQ players.  I found that it's actually less time consuming to be in an organized raid guild than a struggling guild that raids targets of opportunity.  <br />
The other aspect is ADD, yes, your 15 year old kid will have lots of time to get to 65 and maybe get into a top end guild.  But by the time he's 17 he'll have long dumped EQ for something else.  The top guilds all have a long history of continued excellence, and that's something you get from mature players with a long term comitment.  Also, the ability to harmoniously work together in a social environment is not something most kids are good at, and with 60+ people at a raid that is exactly what you need.<br />
My experience with top level player has the average age at 25 - 30, with a good sprinkling of &quot;older guys&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Says who?  Are they Euro guilds, Asian guilds?  Just because they play at a time that you think is a time that &quot;working adults&quot; can't play doesn't mean they are kids.  I work grave shift, I get home at 8 AM EST, so do many others.   Quite a few of my guildmates are from Europe, Asia, and Australia, 11 AM is in their evening.  I have guildmates that are self employed and can work any time they choose.   I also have guildmates that are in the last years of college and can schedule their classes early in the day leaving the afternoon free to play.  I also have guildmates that are retired/well off and don't need to work.  What about those that have spouses that work so they don't need to and can play while the kids are at school.<br />
<br />
So, just because you happen to see more than 20 people from a guild on at 11 AM does mean they are all kids.   The youngest person in my guild is 18 or 19 now, but the majority are 24+ with many over 30 like myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">About a year and a half ago, I joined a guild whose primary targets were kunark dragons and vindi.  Today, they have gone through ssra and VT, have killed fennin and xegony, and are currently working on coirnav.  I was with this guild and was with them as they grew from a small upstart guild to the #2 American guild on the server.  However, about 3 weeks ago, I deguilded myself and went to the #1 guild.  I left primarily for personal reasons, but the desire to experience endgame content and advance my character was a (not small) part of my decision.<br />
<br />
I can tell you a few things about this.  The first is that I miss my old guild.  I look back on all of my memories I have from over a year of raiding with that guild, and watching them rise from a unorganized newbie zerg to a respectable raiding machine.  I think of all the things I accomplished with that guild, and I regret that I will never be a part of any of them again.  I also miss my friends.  I enjoyed being able to log on to a GC with 60 people in it, and really knowing who everyone was.  I have plenty of reasons to regret leaving.  However, when I look at my current guild, I realize that I have plenty of reasons to be glad that I did it.  When the next raid expansion comes out, I will be in the number 1 guild on the server.  I will get to forge ahead and experience brand new content, without spoilers.  I will get to be a part of raids in to unknown territory, where the strategy and encounters are not already known.  I am really looking forward to this.  The guild I am in now is hardly done progressing.  We still have work to do (albeit mainly Quarm farming), and a year from now (if I am still playing) I will look back and hopefully have many fond memories of my current guild's progression through the upcoming expansions.  As for friends, I was lucky in that my two closest EQ friends left the old guild and joined the new one with me.  Also, my best friend in RL is in the guild as well, as well as a few other RL aquaintances.  I did lose contact with a lot of my old guildies, but my real friends are still my friends.  I do not raid with them any more, but I still exp and ldon with them.  Also, the people in my new guild are amazingly nice (don't listen to what people say about all uberguilds being full of elitist ******* teenagers.  It just isn't true.  Most uberguilds are primarily working adults and college students.  In fact, as I moved from a small guild to a slightly larger guild, to a high end raiding guild, and finally to an endgame raiding guild, I have actually found that the maturity level of the members has increased).  I have made many new friends and although I felt a little bit like an outsider at first, I am starting to feel like I really belong where I am.  I don't know everyone's little personality quirks, or intimate details about their real life, or any of their inside jokes, but that will come with time.<br />
<br />
As for starting a raid guild from scratch, you really have quite a task set out before you.  When a guild decides to start raiding, they have to recruit more people.  At this stage of the game, there is really slim pickings as far as recruits go.  If you're at the bottom of the guild totem pole, the only people that are going to join you are people with little to no raid experience, and people who have been rejected from more established raiding guilds.  Most of your members will not have the drive to push forward and accomplish guild goals.  If they had this drive, they would most likely be in a raiding guild already.  I don't mean to be discouraging, but the simple truth is that most guilds who form with the intent to start raiding will fail.  Obviously, not all of them do, but the odds are against.  The single most important factor is leadership.  If your leaders can organize and lead raids, inspire people to care about the guild's progress, and teach the members to treat each other and other guilds with respect, then you might have a chance.  If you do decide to try to build your guild up, then I wish you the best of luck.  It is a very rewarding experience, almost enough to outweigh the risk of failure.<br />
<br />
All that being said, in your situation, I would leave.  However, I am not you.  What I want out of the game is probably not the same thing you want.  The only person who can really answer your &quot;leave or stay&quot; question is you.  You have to ask yourself what is important to you and your enjoyment of the game.  However, if you are serious about wanting to see highend EQ, your best bet would be to join a guild that is already well on their way there.  Ask yourself, are you really that attached to your guild now?  When I left my guild, a lot of people told me they were sad to see me go, but only a few kept in touch.  Those people were my real friends, and they are still my friends.  Switching guilds doesn't mean you have to sever all ties with them.  If your guild is really like a family to you, and they are the main reason that you play EQ at all, then you should stay.  Chances are that if you left them, you'd quit the game within a month.  You're the only one that can decide what is best for you, so good luck.</div></div><hr />

Judging by this holier than thou attitude, I know at least 3 people in my guild under 18 who are WAY more mature than you'll ever be. My guild &quot;won&quot; EQ recently (aka hard core raid guild).

<br />
Even now with the raid feature, I have a sour taste in my mouth that some people &quot;need&quot; to be spoon fed exp, when I did whatever I could (including being in some really broken pickup groups with less than skilled people), just to get exp.  Sometimes it's the broken pickup groups that force you to hone your skills - not the sanitized, comfortable groups.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the speed in which the guild is getting to the stuff that would interest him is too slow.  <br />
<br />
Perhaps, if he's a certain class, he's been pestered for months by less than scrupulous guilds to leave his own guild and join them.  There are lots of guilds who &quot;claim&quot; they don't try to recruit tagged people, but many do it anyway (and think they're clever about it).</div></div><hr />

Play how you want to play and with whom you want to play.  You have to respect the decisions of friends who want something different from the game than you do.  <br />
<br />
People who play a lot will outgrow small guilds who do not play as much.  The game quickly becomes a chore in those cases and you can't blame people for wanting to move on.</div></div><hr />

imho, in a one tier guild, (raiding or not) every has a mutual benefit.  in a two tier guild you have the lower tier reaping the far larger reward with the upper tier doing the pwrlvling, the equipment farming, the work.<br />
<br />
i think that every guild should take the top 5% of their guild and boot them, so they can move to the next lvl; without feeling terrible pangs of guilt.  especially after no one can say soandso just used us to get X.  when they horse has pulled the cart more than long enough, it is time to turn him lose to greener pastures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Vulash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I was in a similiar situation as you not very long ago.  I just recently left a smaller guild for an elemental guild.<br />
<br />
I joined this smaller guild when my first character was level 24.  Since then I created my shaman and leveled him from 1-65 (not PLed, kunark era xp).  I was in this guild as a low level when they were the number 2 guild on the server doing Trak.   We've always had one of the best reputations, and valued our friendships and integrity above all.  I watched us build up only to crash hard more times then I care to remember.  Overall I had been in this guild since before Kunark.  To say that these were my best friends in the game is a drastic understatement.<br />
<br />
I have always enjoyed the larger scale raids, yet remained with my old guild out of a sense of loyalty, and because they were my friends :)  For a little over a year before I left I was that guild's raid leader.  We have many &quot;casual&quot; players in the guild that enjoy a smaller atmosphere of friends, and don't enjoy raiding to much.  So I lead us against mobs we could take 1-2 nights a week.  I got myself stuck in a hole, however.  I wanted to see more then Vindicator, and I knew that we would never progress to the point of being the top guild when a new expansion came out because we didn't want that.  Towards the end I WAS somewhat resentful, and eventually left.  I miss my old friends alot, but still talk to them, and groupwith them when I can.  They all understood why I left, and that really meant alot to me.<br />
<br />
I am currently a recruit to an elemental guild.  I am a little over 3 weeks into recruitment, and 4 weeks removed from my old guild.  As much as I miss them, I do not regret my move.  It was the right move for me.  I am also really enjoying this new guild, and finally seeing the elemental planes.  To me it isn't a let down, and now that I've seen the flagging process I realize that had my guild even wanted to grow to that point the amount of work to get there at this stage of the game without a heavy roster is simply insane.<br />
<br />
I have now seen Fennin and Xego downed, and am working on Coirnav<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">One other thing -- If you have a group of 16 really good level 65s with respectible numbers of AAs but you cant field 60 for a raid ... Think of finding 3 other guilds exactly like yours and form an alliance...<br />
<br />
Now you have the best of both worlds... Your guild can do its thing and you will get the elemental access through larger events.  Only thing you lose is some control.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">A long time ago I was in a guild that was about 18 members strong. We were just starting to raid with another small guild when, out of the blue, some of the higher levels started not being active. They were online, anon, with another guild. They were raiding. They decided that working their way up was not as lucrative as just joining in. (To this day if I try and say &quot;hi&quot; to one of them all I get is some gear linked back to me. After two years of that, can't say that I'm sad that they made the decision they did :p)<br />
<br />
I tried a raid guild, not even an uber raid guild, one that had the &quot;family&quot; label and it didn't suit my tastes. I found myself guilded with people who, beyond being a &quot;needed&quot; class, had no redeeming qualities whatsoever. <br />
<br />
Which leaves me where I'm at now. I made the decision that if I ever were to raid again it would only be with people who were &quot;friends&quot;. I don't care if I have to do Kael arena for the 1000th time and teach basic raiding to people. I never want to find myself in the positition of having to turn off guildchat (along with half of the guild) because we had to guild complete tools in order to progress. <br />
<br />
For the over sensitive, the above are my experiences. You may like every single person in your guild that is raiding, you might be lucky enough to not have dead weight who happen to have a CH key. I wasn't so lucky and my opinions are based off of that.</div></div><hr />

I think this is just silly.  I have no desire to move on to &quot;the next level.&quot;  So why would it be necessary to boot me?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Best thing for you to do is see if your guild can be absorbed into a larger raiding guild.<br />
16 people can get themselves flagged for PoV/S and BoT and PoNb (ignore the key quests that suck that you'd have to do 3x over to get everyone &quot;flagged&quot;)<br />
That's it.<br />
Beyond that, you need to raid things.<br />
Even the easiest of easy raid targets, Grummus, hits for 1100+, has multiple AEs that hurt if you aren't prepared to deal with them, procs a MASSIVE slow, and rampages (or flurries, can't remember).  You won't be taking him down with your 16 people.  You can even still quite easily fail with 60 people.<br />
If you actually want to get your numbers up high enough to be able to raid things on your own, first you'll be to recruit another 80 or so people that are ALL competant at their classes, and you NEED a healthy number of healers in the mix, and a good mixture of other classes.  This will probably only take a few months to get the people you need.<br />
Then, you need to learn to raid with each other.<br />
You need to go to places like Kael, Skyshrine, Kunark Dragons, ToV, WW, BoT, and other places like that, and learn to raid with each other.  This will only take you about 2 or 3 months to get the hang of things.<br />
After that, you can spend about 6 months competing with other guilds for targets in Ssra and other Luclin targets gearing yourselves up to be able to not die in POP.<br />
After that, you can start learning how to raid stuff in POP.  You can learn Terris Thule, Grummus, MB, VZ, and AD for the first 2 or 3 months doing them for loot and backflags.<br />
After that, you can think about starting on tier 2 gods, and continuing your way to elemental planes.<br />
<br />
With luck, if you start today on forming a raiding guild out of your 16 person guild, you'll be in the Elemental Planes some time hopefully before 2005 if you raid daily...<br />
Now, you wonder why someone in your guild didn't feel like waiting around to have some fun in the ele planes or wherever else?</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's profane. I prefer to abuse clerics at every opportunity. I have issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Given your choice, would you do what we intend to do, start from scratch and go all the way to the end, or would you jump into a guild that's already well down that road?<br />
  <br />
     You could start from scratch, work your way up, and discover that greaat conversation isn't really what you want, and knowing that its the right thing to do to find another guild that fits your needs better.<br />
<br />
I really would'nt look too much higher than guilds doing HoT, ToV, stuff like that, thought.  You'll miss a lot less that way.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Here's my experience..<br />
<br />
I joined a guild called Eternal Shadows in early 2002. They were a guild made up of just a bunch of friends that like to level. We had about 12 active characters who just levelled together each day. I was lvl 60 at the time, with very few AAs(might have been venerable, but no canni5), and no epic. I was guilded for about 2 weeks before they got my epic. As we got more AAs and got some more epics, we decided we'd start moving up in the world, and we started killing in HoT, with me as the only shaman. Within a month, we had almost doubled in size, and were still in HoT getting gear. By this time, I was full SS quest armor, and most of the original members were getting there. We moved up in the world, killed vindi(a huge step), and started killing him on a regular basis.<br />
<br />
We kept going up the tier lines, killing zlandicar, getting ST keys for a single group. That group would head into ST not knowing a thing about the zone, and attempt to kill the MotG and that other named near the entrance, and getting no primals ;)<br />
<br />
Onward and upward we went. Killed NToV, Sontalak, Keeper, etc. etc. etc. Got more people keyed for ST, along with a CoH mage bum, and started killing warders on a regular basis. We started heading to ssra and taking out the creator and arch lich. We felt like we were invincible. We had become probably the #4 guild on the server in terms of what we could do with the numbers we had. A little while later, we lost our guildleader and a few respected members, but some officers took over, and we kept rolling.<br />
<br />
Then we killed the cursed. A great accomplishment, we could now start getting taunt proccers for our warriors. Then our main cleric/rogue(always 2 boxed no raids) sold his characters because of RL issues(cleric went to a guildmate so we still had him). That was a huge loss for us, he was a great guy. A few months after this, about a year after i joined the guild, the guildleader comes back and says he wants to take back over(at least that's what I gather from it). A lot of our old members didn't like the idea, and left to form a guild of their own. These were about 70% of the hardcore players in the guild, and all of my better friends. I left to be with those friends, and my RL friends in the guild followed me. I stayed in that guild for about a month with my buddies, when they decided that this guild wasn't working out. We didn't have enough clerics, and were wiping out to(what was then) simple mobs, like AL.<br />
<br />
So, a joint decision was made with the officers of the new guild to disband after letting all the members know. We discussed it for a week or so, and in the end, a few of them decided to go to Wudan(#2 guild on server, and the others were waiting on me to decide. I was either going to Wudan or Magus Imperialis Magicus, but i wanted to sit down with my RL buddies and see what they wanted. After a weekend of discussion, we decided on MiM because of my friends' gear. 1 of them could have gotten into AD but the other 2 had no chance. So into MiM we went, and about 6 other people came with us, all of which were the friends that I wanted to stay with. The others went to random guilds, and a couple went back to Eternal Shadows.<br />
<br />
So that's my story, and you can see that, in the end, all my good friends stayed together but went to a raiding guild. I would suggest, if he's as good a friend to you as my friends were to me, to follow him, and bring as many of your buddies as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Genine Goosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I hear what you are saying Binter. I have been the guild leader of a 'family' guild for the last 18 months or so. PLing lower levels does not work. Emerald Unity is the name of my guild and we have gone up and down in numbers in the last 18 months so many time that I cannot even count them. There has been a core membership of about 10-12 people over the course of my leadership. The same people who were in it when I joined at level 17. <br />
<br />
I think what Binter is saying about accomplishment vs. greed is about what I feel as well. There is a certain satisfaction to zoning into Plane of Fear with 3 groups of people. Nobody knowing the zone, only having a map from EQAtlas printed out, no clue on mobs or strategies and spending hours on CRs. Then 2 months later you zone in with the same 3 groups and wipe the zone clean. You earned that, you worked for it and YOU being there made a difference. There wasn't 5 shaman along, and nobody would notice if you showed or didn't. ONE person makes the difference in these types of guilds. You cannot explain the feeling of knowing that you're needed for every encounter. If you go AFK for 5 minutes, people know. They wait for you. They don't leave you behind.  That's the accomplishment factor. <br />
<br />
I think that when people go to larger raiding guilds they just want things easier. Believe me I have thought about it many times, getting tired of leading so people can just leave for larger guilds. But what stops me is knowing that I cannot follow. 95% of raiding guilds just follow along, like sheep. 5% do the actual work. Now you know why people all say, 'bah' all the time :p <br />
<br />
My dignity couldn't handle going to a large guild and them backflagging for me. It would be like a pity flagging :p I just am not the type of person who can sit in the corner while the other 5 ppl in the group get me my flags in PoJ trials and I think Binter might be talking more about that type of thing. What it all comes down to is work ethic. How much work are you willing to put into anything? Or are you going to just follow along behind someone who does all the work?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Another apology for another long post ...<br />
<br />
I don't think a guild really needs to PL it's lower level members ... it seems like, in SOTA at least, they do it on their own. They just need a little incentive. <br />
<br />
It strikes me, sometimes, how much my guild's 50's Crowd looks up to those of us who are in our 60's. When those of us in our 60s ding, the chaos and excitement over it fill my chat window every single time, and (it never fails) then begin comments like, &quot;I need some more levels so I can do adventures with so-and-so&quot; ... or &quot;What new zones do you get to go to now?&quot; ... and that's one of the great things. I completed the Trial of Execution not too long ago, and the moment I did, I was flooded with tells from guildies wanting information on it. I ended up having to post details on our forum for them, and ever since they've been begging me to take them and let them try a trial. When I told them I wanted them to be 60+ to start a trial, it got quiet in Guild Hall for a few moments ... and then the &quot;OMG I need # levels!!&quot; started flying through Guild Hall. They've been working on it diligently ever since, and each time one of them dings, it's &quot;Hey Tordail, I'm one level closer to doing a trial with you!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
SOTA is preparing for it's second attempt on Vindi on Thursday. The first time, we wiped, and wiped terribly and horribly. But not one person complained, I kid you not. It wasn't long after the raid (oh yeah, every last one of us) popped back at our bind points that the &quot;OMG OMG that was so freakin' cool, when do we get to try again?!&quot; started. They wanted to rez the corpses and try again right then and there, matter of fact. But the Council told them we'd come back when the guild had a few more levels under its belt ... and we do. We're going Thursday evening, and since it was announced Sunday that's been the Talk of the guild nearly non-stop. One of them actually said, &quot;If we wipe again, then that means I need more levels. I have a new DD this time around ... maybe I can get it to stick on him!&quot;<br />
<br />
Quite honestly, as an officer, I find myself having to hold them back oftener than I am pushing them forward. Hold them back? Yep ... making sure they're not leveling too quickly for their skills, making sure they don't zone into places they're not quite of a level for ... Generally speaking, they're about the most ambitious bunch I've yet seen.<br />
<br />
Maybe some of you are reading about my guild's ambition and snickering a bit. Maybe POJ Trials and attempts at Vindi aren't the way to encourage lower levels to work hard and level up. Maybe we need to be leveling our lower crowd a hell of a lot quicker than we are, and maybe we'll never, ever get to where we wanna go. Well, if that's the case ... I say this.<br />
<br />
You should never be ashamed of failing ... only of never trying. And there's nobody in Norrath I'd rather fail next to than my family.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Tordail's guild sounds really cool, and I tip my hat to them for having a great spirit.<br />
<br />
I was in a small &quot;family&quot; guild that some friends and I started back in 6/99 or something.  A year later we merged with a slightly larger family guild because we were so compatible.  <br />
<br />
I was with them until a couple of months ago.  It was an extremely hard decision to leave.  I had debated it for some time, but essentially I just stopped having fun along the way.  <br />
<br />
A lot of the &quot;old guard&quot; had left, played different hours or whatever.  We were just &quot;stuck&quot; and while we showed flashes of doing something really cool, we just couldn't sustain.  So, it was an endless series of PoP flagging and epic hunting.  <br />
<br />
I joined a guild that is now Sol Ro enabled.  The type of people in that guild are very much like the type of people in my old guild, mature, thoughtful, mostly working adults.  <br />
<br />
I must say I've had a lot of fun recently.  I got my VT key and raided there several times, and I've done all the PoP fights up to RZTWL several times.  <br />
<br />
It was never about loot, and I don't care about loot.  <br />
<br />
Somewhere along the line I got stale and wasn't having so much fun.  PoP is brutal on smaller guilds with a core of power gamer types, and while our lasted much longer than many guilds on my server, it hurt us badly.  <br />
<br />
So many old time guilds that had lasted 4 years crumbled after PoP.  I never saw another expansion with that kind of impact.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">You really have to try a few guilds before you make any judgements.. and you have to realize that if someone is playing 35+ hours/week and only in a 3-4 times a week raiding senario most likely (not all of them) it means that they apped to an uber guild and got rejected because of inmaturity.. so the mid tier guilds have a lot of rejects that you deal with. Join the best guild on your server or top 2 or something similar, and let your old guildies know that you are trying to see if that's a better guild for you.. you have nothing to loose..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">In a family guild here, only guild I've been in since I started playing 2.5 years ago. A RL friend is the guild leader and I've been on council since a few months after playing.<br />
<br />
We went through some rough times. About 10 months after playing we decided to concentrate on our lower levels and help build them up. A lot of higher levels got annoyed with it and left. What really hurt us though is that we had one week where we had about 7 officers leave to move onto &quot;bigger&quot; guilds. <br />
<br />
That hit hard, and we almost folded the guild all together, but we held on and kept concentrating on lower levels and building ourselves up. From then on the guild just grew and grew. <br />
<br />
When we started working on epics we realized we didn't have enough people and the force to take down some of the mobs and/or do the raids. So we became freinds with a few other guilds and formed an alliance.<br />
<br />
We now have about 60-70 active members. (Guild roster has 385, but a hell of a lot are alts, lol) We also may be adding in another 25-50 with a possible guild merger in 2 weeks. We're doing a lot of things on our own we never thought we'd be able to do. Our levels are mainly 50-65 and we stick to raids where anyone in those levels can do. We don't bother PLing the lower levels, we found they usually can make it to 60+ on their own quickly enough without our help.  <br />
<br />
Do we still lose people who rather skip ahead and move to an already established high end guild? Of course, you'll always get people like that, sometimes the ones you never thought would leave. And as hard as it is, you have to respect their decision. Interesting enough for us though we find about 80% of those who leave come back to us. In fact of the 7 officers who left in that one week over a year and a half ago, 6 had come back. We even re-invited another old officer last night who left us eariler for a raiding guild. <br />
<br />
So from my won experiences I'd suggest sticking it out with your guild. You may be down by your friend leaving and there is a bit of feeling of betrayal but trust me, it will feel good if you can get that guild of yours going and continue on and make it grow..<br />
<br />
And for now you may want to get the elemental planes out of your head. Not saying not to strive for it, just not now. Work on raids that your guild can do now, get people used to how to raid and get them better equiped and work your way up the ladder. <br />
<br />
If ya decide to keep the guild going, I wish ya the best of luck! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">My first guild was a family type guild that was small. I wasn't guilded for a long time cause I enjoyed the solace of soloing and being solo. I soon left that guild cause it was quite noisy and always had a ton of drama happening in the guild hall. Although thats not a bad thing, it wasn't what I wanted. So I disbanded and kept my eyes out for a guild in my timezone that had some character to it. Took me a while but I found them eventually.<br />

To the original poster: grass always seems greener on the other side. People are not all the same either.  Some think like Furor in FoH, living for the spoil, and others are more concerned with the journey. You and I, are of the latter.</div></div><hr />
