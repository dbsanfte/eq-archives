<br />
Seriously, looks like something a pigeon left on my windshield the other day. And with the frog riding it? It was ugly to the third power. Years from now, that picture will be in Webster's dictionary next to the entry for &quot;butt-ugly&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Lol yes, it does look a bit daft =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No way that lizard is so funny looking.. its probably the first and only thing to make me consider turning on new models(assuming barbarians can ride them =p)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Morrighan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If anyne can get the lizards (hope, hope, hope), I will sell my nag, buy a lizard AND turn on the models!! So I have to shrink. So I can't duck. So what if I'm a slow as a snail. I'll be riding a lizard!!!!:D :D :D :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>L33TL355</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">But will their heads get in the way?<br />
<br />
<br />
Ohh and if you were in bear form you'd get a R rating</div></div><hr />

And that comment about riding an ogre in bondage gear? LOL!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hmm, horses are there to run fast primarily. I cant see a lizard running at 200mph around the karanas... Can you?<br />
<br />
So what will they be there for?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">UO added a riding beetle that also functions as a pack animal.  Now if you could toss a saddlebag on the lizard and have extra carrying capacity, I’d farm for a month strait in order to buy one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">That picture can only result in a new batch of Tadpoles sometime in the near future. I, for one, blushed when I saw it! :) <br />

Actually, morphologically speaking, the mount upon which the frog is riding cannot be a lizard.  Lizards don't have their legs underneath them, but have them out to the sides.  The thing the frog is riding looks more like some kind of primitive synapsid reptile from the late Permian or early Triassic.</div></div><hr />

What's a Komodo Dragon considered? Their legs seem to be underneath their bodies. (is this off topic or what? :) )<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Hemmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Just a random thought:  Since the new expansion is on an island and the frogloks are an aquatic race, maybe this lizard thing works like a horse in the water (and may allow you to zone without a boat)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well I don't care WHAT that thing IS.<br />
I don't care about what family species and genus.<br />
It looks like warmed up sh!t that fell and splattered then a frog jumped on it.<br />

All in favour of changing this patcher pic raise ya hands<br />

Something along the lines of the massive flesh eatting chickens of Timbuktu.../shiver thay are scary.:eek:</div></div><hr />

Sorry Krup, you're wrong.  Komodo dragons have their legs to the side like all lizards.  Look closely at the skeleton and you'll see that both the humerous and the femur are articulated in their respective sockets so that they project out from the body.<br />
<br />
The froggy is definitely riding a non-lizard reptile.</div></div><hr />

   I seriously doubt the lizards are anything more than a sifferent looking horse, but if there IS something different about them, I will be praying that they are usable where horses are not (underwater/indoors).   Or maybe just eat less than our friendly little Mr. Ed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
   I sure hope that these lizzies look good with my skelle form, cause I know they won't look so hot under a Wood Elf.</div></div><hr />
