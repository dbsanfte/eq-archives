<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fulgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Time to thank the druids for pushing ..... Duck on horses...<br />
<br />
Absor put his foot down at The Druids Grove after addressing a few posts about being able to duck on a horse. Here is a quote from that:<br />
I guess I’m saying, enough about the whole ducking on horses thing already. It’s that way, it’s probably going to stay that way (free standing med isn’t something we plan to allow). Honestly, it’s probably one of the oddest things I’ve ever seen people get into an uproar about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I dont think you should be able to duck on a horse to stop a spell. But you know what else? Why do we still need to duck to stop a spell? Couldnt just a type of stop cast/interupt be put in?<br />
<br />
Merlin you hurt your back why are you hunched over? No no its ok just changed my mind on my spell wanted to stop casting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Idiots, they should have pushed for no sit aggro!  That woulda at least been devious.  Can you imagine this game without sit aggro tho?  Wow, would be a lot nicer for casters huh?  <br />
<br />
I'm sure at this point wizards would just be glad for proper aggro on crits heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fulgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Am I the only one who noticed.... Absor mentioned you shouldn't be able to med while mounted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  I was thinking this means free standing as in no horse standing med. THought he was saying live with the negatives(horse)if ya want the equal to standing style med. Hard sometimes getting intent through all text and no spoken word but is how i got it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with this One Hundred percent.<br />
<br />
This is the first post I've seen anywhere, on any board, that has actually addressed what the real problem is. The only way we can immediately  interrupt a spell is to duck. All we're asking for is for this to be addressed.....screw the unable to duck on a horse thing.</div></div><hr />
