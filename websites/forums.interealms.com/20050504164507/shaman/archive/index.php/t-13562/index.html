<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I zoned into VP today, and just soloed a Guardian Wurm inside.<br />
WEEEEE.<br />
3% of an AA at level 65.<br />
He appeared to have about 2/3 or 3/4 of the HP of a Golem in PoV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Unless they changed the mobs, some of them can be nasty.  I'm talking GW's that spawn 2 more when they die, or Super Wurms that have massive regen (until you lay some dots on).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Post more details about the fight(s) if you can.  Guardian wurm fight harder than the GWs in Skyfire?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yes they are considerably harder , they have nice lil AoE's and a randomly difficult. You never know what you will get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Guardian Wurms in VP.  There are several Different Varieties.  Some See Invis, some do not.  The mobs range in ability from your garden variety type from Skyfire... to mobs that are harder than Ragefire, having AE fear/up to 500dmg fire or cold based AEs, can hit for up to 1500 double, can have 1000dmg single target proc, can SPLIT on death, can be completely magic immune and/or have some strange massive HP regen.<br />
<br />
It wasn't that hard to solo in VP before the rezbox nerf.  Just get some cleric to agree to give you a rez box and you were good to go, anytime you get a bad pull, big hitter, dragon warping on you(Hoshkar and Silverwing love to do this), just click yes and out you go, safe and sound.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>CasmussSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hmm, they said it would be fun for 1 group now - I wonder if that means that they took out the 2 minute respawn timer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The guardian wurm I killed was luckily one that didn't have the stupid huge regen, and it didn't split afterwards.<br />
I pulled him with spirit call and other hits on so I could see how much he hit for.<br />
Low magic resists<br />
Low disease resists<br />
Low poison resists<br />
(at least after debuffs)<br />
<br />
I played around in there for the afternoon with a variety of poeple.<br />
The hardest pull we survived was killing a wurm with me, another shaman, a necro, and a bard in group.  It split and killed bard fast.  We managed to get the 2 slowed.  We killed one asap, then with just one in camp it was an easy finish to the fight.<br />
A single melee class + shaman should be able to do ok for xp in here and chances for level 60 spells.<br />
I won a copy of the cleric group cheal, and we saw a copy of VoG drop in about 3 hours of dodging Silverwing and Hoshkar.<br />
<br />
The hardest that Guardian Wurms and Racnars hit for all day was under 600.<br />
We never encountered any of the 1k+ hitters.<br />
Guardian Wurms tend to split about 50-70% of the time.<br />
A single split from the wurms is possible, but that only happened once.<br />
Usually 2 mobs split out of the wurm.<br />
A split wurm never split though.<br />
<br />
Only once did we encounter one of those bugged super regeners.<br />
Our group at the time was me, other shaman, SK, wizard, necro, and bard.<br />
We managed to kill it, but it was a rough fight.<br />
Everyone was nuking hard.<br />
Wizard was almost oom.<br />
We got him down to about 30% before we finished him off with a HT.<br />
They are a real bitch to kill, since they regen about 3-4% health every tick.<br />
I estimate they have something like 20k hp total or maybe a bit less.<br />
Three percent HP regen per tick means you have to do at least 600-800 damage per tick just to start beating it's regen rate.<br />
Suppose it regens 4% per tick, and you are doing 5% damage in total per tick, it means you will be doing 1000 damage per tick, and you will kill it in 100 ticks, or 10 full minutes, and end up doing 100,000 damage in total to kill it.  They really suck.  You have to kill them as fast as you can so you avoid them healing.  If it regens 4% per tick, and you do 9% damage total per tick, you'll have it dead in 20 ticks instead, and you'll end up doing 1800 x 20 = 36000 damage in total to kill it instead.  Much less mana spent to kill it then.<br />
<br />
One main thing to watch out for, well 2 things, is Hoshkar and Silverwing.<br />
They path down to the end of the bridge from the zone in, and have a HUGE aggro radius.<br />
Their social aggro seems to be a lot bigger than their plain old aggro radius.<br />
If you fight a mob behind the blue glowy thing on the ramp down to the lava, you should be safe from adds from the Dragons.<br />
I really want for my guild to kill those 2 dragons to get them out of the way so we can actually use the zone for xp.<br />
The super fast respawn time is nice to be able to pull mobs for xp.<br />
And Hoshkar is a big sissy when it comes to melee, only being able to hit for a measly 800 or less.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Oh ya.<br />
The strength of a single Guardian Wurm inside VP is exactly as rough a fight as the Guardian Wurms in Skyfire.<br />
I can verify this because I soloed a Guardian Wurm outside of VP before I zoned in today.<br />
Same fight.<br />
Same difficulty.<br />
Torpor/Q &gt; Guardian Wurm.</div></div><hr />
