<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Codlugarthia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm thinking about getting an Ivory Claw Figurine for the Extended range III effect.<br />
The charm gets more powerful &quot;as you master the weapon skills of your class.&quot; So I guess for the ER III effect I gotta master all my weapon skills.<br />
<br />
My question is:<br />
What exactly does &quot;master&quot; mean?<br />
Does it mean You gotta bring the skills to Master Level at 101?<br />
Or does it mean You gotta max the skills?<br />
<br />
If it's the latter one then I will just forget about the figurine cause some of my skills are very low and I hate time sinks....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">From what I have read about peoples experiences with charms it means you have to max the skills to get the best stats and any possible effects.<br />
<br />
So time to start working on that hand-to-hand skill hehe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Charm specifically notes that Clerics &quot;must also master hand to hand.&quot; That would imply that Druids and Shaman don't need to do H2H for the Charm.<br />
<br />
Of course in EQ all bets are off when interpreting the ingame text.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have this and no, you don't need to master H2H.  If that were the case it would be way too easy because I maxed it at the trainer for a whopping 40p lol.  However, you DO need to max all other weapon skills in order to gain the full effects.  This means 1H blunt, 2h blunt and Piercing.<br />
<br />
I love my figurine, it wasn't all that tough to max my weapon skills as I had started early on all of them thanks to the advice on this board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ryoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">what are the stats on it? and where does it fall?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Click on the pic in my sig for my magelo to see stats on it.  It drops in LoY in Torgiran mines off of The Broken Skull seer, a rare mob.</div></div><hr />
