Change the message on the login sever.  So that when you are patching, instead of it saying:<br />
- Error 1001, can't log on, please try again shortly.<br />
- Login server congested, please try again shortly.<br />
<br />
Make it so that if you are patching it says:<br />
- LOGIN SERVER DOWN DUE TO PATCHING, ETA on Sever up is (insert ETA here).</div></div><hr />

<br />
SOE doesn't come here often, so they probably won't see your thread.. and if they do come here, and it is somehow still on page 1, they will probably ignore it.</div></div><hr />

That's a joke right?  I get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zethrir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I very much doubt it is as simple as that.  I imagine they take the login server down while they are patching (or make it unreachable by the internet) and as such all your client knows is that it cant reach the login server, hence the generic message.  They would need to make something run on the login port return another error message to the client to report what you want it to.  In its self not hard to do, but it would add an extra step to the patching process (IE start up patch server message program after taking the login server program down) and I am sure there are more important things to fix, such as 9 month+ old bugs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Not really, it just needs a bit of code to say 'check if I should put the patching message up, oh look they are, display the patching message!'</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reason why this was being called a joke is for the following reasons<br />
<br />
1.   SoE Feedback system is BROKEN.  It's been broken for months now even with people reporting it being broken, Alan saying that he knew it was broken, and Scott Hartsman saying that they would fix it.  It's Broken ... to the point that saying use the Feedback system reflective of the SoE as a whole ... Talented but so single-minded that they forget to put their pants on in the morning.    <br />
<br />
2.  Email ... funny but I have sent emails to both Scott and Alan in the last year ... never with a reply but didn't really expect one.    Others have posted that they have emailed to SoE folks without a reply.   Many have stated that they sent emails to both Support and SoE in general without a reply.   See the trend here ... email sent to these folks is akin to a BLACK HOLE that gravity, light, and mail falls into while heading off into some other dimension.<br />
<br />
3.  Posting on their boards ... well that's sorta of a no-win as well.   It's CLEARLY stated that other than moderating the boards for &quot;playing good&quot; NO SOE staff member reads or responses to posts on their boards other than Technical support.   So that's a not good option either.   <br />
<br />
Which leaves ... public forums ... and where better to post a idea about the game from a Shaman perspective than on a Shaman board.   Like you said it's not going to get anywhere ( or say like 1/100 % chance of success) but at least you get to fluff your post count ... ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">SoE is spirit of eagle....SOE is Sony Online Entertainment.<br />
<br />
So on the topic of SoE....F druids!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
As for expecting a reply to emails...just imagine how many they get. They can try to skim most of them...but to think they should reply to all of them is just silly.  They have better things to do.</div></div><hr />

I completely disagree with you if you are talking about CS ( Customer Support), Bug Reports, or for that matter any other general Sony Online Entertainment (happy?) based mail.   A simple &quot;we recieved your mail&quot; autobot can be thrown together in just about every commonly used mail system in the known world.   <br />
<br />
Auto-reply memo's are consider &quot;good&quot; customer relation management tools used by most fortune level companys ... Sony is consider a fortune level company.   Joe's MomNPop Code shop could be excused by doing small shop based methods ... Joe@Fortune.Company does not have the same excuse.  <br />
<br />
FYI:   Sony Online Entertainment is part of Sony (General) which is 37th in the World for the globe list.  Though they have dropped a bit from last year ... maybe it's because they don't answer their emails.<br />
<br />
THE 2002 GLOBAL 500 - RANK: 37 - (Previous year rank: 30) - Sony (http://www.fortune.com/fortune/global500/snapshot/0,15198,37,00.html)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">hehe..an auto-reply makes you feel good does it?<br />
<br />
an auto reply means to me that it is not usually even checked by real people...<br />
<br />
I would rather see nothin than see some generic thanks and F off auto-reply</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">To you it's meaningless ... to me it means they got the email, it made it to intended person or que, and the clock has started based on whatever the reply mail outlines.<br />
<br />
Even getting a auto reply telling me to go Fart in a bathtub is better than sitting by the mailbox waiting.   <br />
<br />
IE:   Tannus Vidar mails to Someone@EQonline.com    <br />
<br />
Sorry (Tannus Vidar) but I'm too busy to reply to your email.  Currently we are working on the latest &quot;hide the nerfage&quot; code within the next patch.   Me and all the &quot;boys&quot; are having such a geeful time at it that answering mail is the last thing on our collective minds.   Why ...  just the other day Agent87 was telling me about the really cool secret code that forces any newly equip'd NoDrop clickable spell item to increase fizzle rate for same or higher based class spells.    Anyway ... Thanks for your email but really you are better off posting on your class forums instead.<br />

Edited for spelling ... add that I'm a complete cynic at heart right now dealing with SOE issues.</div></div><hr />
