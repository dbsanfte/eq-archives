<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beemine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With torpor, cannib 5, pox, bane. and extended affliction 3. I can't seem to decide if a pet is worth summoning to solo. I don't melee mobs and he seems to need a torpor every fight or two on slowed mobs in chardok. every fight without spirit quickening I think. my current strat is pull with epic, root, slow, plague, pox. since they are the most efficient dots for the mana. usually have to epic just one more time. and all mobs cept the skele's die whom I usually opt to use bane on right after pox lands. the pet especially at fort seems to be much of a hinderence for agro rules since he will give me adds that I don't get normally.<br />
I'm getting a quarter to a half blue for every kill down there. and each fight usually takes around the time 2 epics dots wearing off with extra 8 seconds in there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kamorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My rule of thumb is simple. <br />
<br />
Either root and rot, or tank mob with torpor while hasted pet munches away.<br />
<br />
Tanking is very effective in FG since the shrooms dont root really well and keeping agro on me, my pet doesnt get hit or cast on. Pull with slow epic, pox recast DOT's at 40% and pull another. Can usually crunch down with CannIV/V during combat and with no downtime average 3plus blue bubs of AA per hour.<br />
<br />
In the grey tho I never use pet, mobs are rootable and would eat pet pretty quick. Kills takes slightly longer but duo with 60 druid partner we keep 5 mobs in camp and we each put 3 DOTS on them.<br />
<br />
I find that using minimal mana during solo sessions works best for me, in FG I usually only have FoS and VoB on myself with just Celerity on my pet. The shrooms cast more than they melee.<br />
<br />
Just my way of doing things, probably other methods out there.<br />
<br />
EDITed cause I left out some stuff and can't spell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shaido</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would have to agree that it really all depends on where you solo and how you are soloing, root/rot or melee.<br />
<br />
For me, I tend to solo in FG alot, so I always use my pet.  When fighting the shrooms, I generate so much aggro that my pet never gets touched.  He's just like another DOT.  I've totaled his dmg output, and on average, he does around 2.5k+ per shroom.  My tactic is to pull with slow, then land pox and epic, and then nuke him to death with jbb.  I never run out of mana and am constantly pulling.  I average a yellow of AA xp per hour.<br />
<br />
I like to keep KoS, KEI and ToE on myself and also put Celerity on my pet. <br />
<br />
That's what I like to do and it seems to work rather well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Siwi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have always wondered what's more effective, to only do epic / pox then jbb, or epic / pox / bane, no jbb at all but canni to be able to cast a 2nd bane at about 40% shroom hp then moving onto the next shroom while pet finishes off this one.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you don't have torpor then I suggest purely root &amp; rot. This is because the shammies mana regen comes from their HP. If they're being hit, then without torpor you're downtime will be considerable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Beemine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually for me with high dps mobs especially, and summoners it seems that epic, plague, pox, and bane all together are most efficient because of how fast I can put mana back together after the fight is done. cannib 5+ torpor+regen 3+ MC3+FT1+bear form+regrowth+ODS = insane mana regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tevash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would say dependant on zones too, although mobs dont attack pets anymore, its sure a pain when they halfway across the dungeon before they help you. If im outdoors i use a pet, otherwise i typically dont. DPS is key...less downtime imo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jargas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I use pet in FG, give him Yak's or some other proccing weapon and he'll dish out more than 2.5k. And yes, they will proc. I won't generally use a dog in UP, though I do in ME if doing toilers against the wall.</div></div><hr />
