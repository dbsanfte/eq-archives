<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I know many of you can solo him and worry about his gating or running back into his spawn room.<br />
<br />
Let me relate a new threat.<br />
<br />
Him running out into the hallway.<br />
<br />
Yep, saw it twice yesterday (gratz Shaman on Bane of Nife).<br />
<br />
Now this isn't a big deal from a damage standpoint because obviously once he's running, he's not whacking you.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, once he gets beyond that door you need a rogue to pick the lock. And if you're soloing that sort of negates having a rogue in your pocket.</div></div><hr />
