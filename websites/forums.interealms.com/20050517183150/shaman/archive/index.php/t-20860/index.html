<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lkano</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone activated the AA Call of the Ancients.  According to the GoD on-line manual, the stationary pet will &quot;continually heal everyone around it&quot;.<br />
<br />
However, the AA states that it will continually provide stamina for everyone around it.<br />
<br />
Which is it, and if stamina why?  Would be useless if stamina, but maybe great if healing.<br />

It's funny you want it to be a healing regen, I think that's pretty useless. I bought it thinking it would be an endurance regen, making us the only class in the game who could regen endurance.<br />
<br />
Still waiting on that refund Brenlo promised us.<br />

I suggest you ask about status of the promised refund<br />
on the EQLive shaman board, with a link back to Brenlo's promise.<br />
<br />
Perhaps it will get more attention from developers on their own board.</div></div><hr />

It would, until they click the link to come here and get firewalled.</div></div><hr />

I don't understand that they promised a reimbursement because the description is wrong, and yet several patches later, I've still wasted my AA.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hope they do it on the next patch.  I only use this to annoy other people on a raid, because it's fun to have like 10 wards spamming everyone.  Some druids in my guild spent their most of their 30 saved AA when on this when GoD came out.  They were PISSED after they found out it died right away to mob AEs.  I'm glad I only bought the first level to test it out.</div></div><hr />

Call of the Ancients, apparently the description is incorrect and we will be refunding any AA's used to purchase it. It is intended to grant HP and not endurance.<br />
<br />
I talked with the &quot;Spell Guy&quot; and he was already looking at making some adjustments to healing including HoT and will let me know when he has something concrete. <br />
<br />
The team is also looking to shift the slow immune creatures about, in some Gates zones, so that there are no concentrations of them in one area. <br />
<br />
I will pass along more information as I get it.<br />

This was posted on 3/8/04 by Brenlo.  My guess is they are looking more broadly at healing issues, and may have delayed this because they might use this AA as a tool in the healing balancing.  Or, they just haven't bothered with it or outright forgot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">As of right now, the patch on the 8th will contain the new AA backend.  It is running on Test right now, and barring any &quot;showstopper&quot; bugs, will go Live on the 8th.<br />
<br />
The upshot of this is that this backend is what will allow the refund for those who purchased Call of the Ancients.  Still no official word on when that will happen until after the backend &quot;officially&quot; goes live.<br />
<br />
Take it however you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Whats a new AA backend?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It's the code that governs how AA's work.  It does things like keep track of which of your AA's are ready for use and how long before an AA will be ready again.<br />
<br />
My guess is that it was not originally designed to handle such a large load and was beginning to cause problems.  Just a guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I find it very useful, it's free regen for a low aa cost. No they don't stack with other wards but you can use the various wards people have in the group serially, since they last for 5.5 minutes and have 30 min refresh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The first level can be midly uesful and is probably worth getting. Beyond that it really seems to scale pretty poorly. If memory serves it's 30hps a tick initally and only goes up to 50 when maxed or something stupid like that for a huge amount more aa's. These need to be immune to ae's like they've done with some other things or give them alot more hps so they don't die to ae's. They should also improve the amount regened like the did with regen spells and probably make them scale better so the massive points spent for the later levels where worth it.</div></div><hr />

They deleted that message .. figures.  What did it say?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Whats a new AA backend? <br />
<br />
It means bend over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">hmm with this, the regen spells, and some gear possibilities some people must be able to hit 100 hp/tick ish. Thats semi impressive, but I guess the fragilitity of the ward, as well as the amount of points it costs kinda makes this useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I think the regen spells, especially if they decide to upgrade them for OoW, make this AA pretty pointless.  But that's just me.  Everyone has different tastes.</div></div><hr />
