Are the baddies in dok b on the same faction as the other sarnaks or do they have a unique faction?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If yer worried bout snark faction, go hunt in Droga a while.  At least u can get exp/cash while you do it.  Sarnak faction is a waste of time however.  Everything it can get you can be easily replaced by simply being in a large guild and going to raids.</div></div><hr />

LOL I like that.</div></div><hr />

Where have you seen negative faction? We've killed in every part of the zone (except Kor) and have yet to see a negative faction hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">On the first day that this zone was on live servers, some of the live sarnaks were giving negative Brood of Di`Zok hits.  That was a mistake which was corrected with the fix-the-patch patch the next day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It was also a typo. The faction didn't actually go down, according to someone I was grouped with who was max ally (and remained max ally after killing a bunch of live sarnak).</div></div><hr />
