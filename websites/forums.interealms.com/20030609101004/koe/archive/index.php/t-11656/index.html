<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As you can see from my signature, I'm closing in on topping all my tradeskills at 188 or so. Here's some things I need. A lot of these things are stuff you might have in the bank or have lotted with an alt or have AE farmed, whatever. Don't go out of your way, just would appreciate the help if anyone's got the stuff to part with. <br />
<br />
Lastly I'd like to offer my skills, if you need anything, please call upon me anytime. Even if it's something simple like, &quot;I want some forged javelens or I could use some fine steel for my new gimp frog paladin&quot;. I also am trying to work on my alchemy, but it's low priority in comparison to the tradeskills needed for the 7th and 8th coldain shawl. If you do need alchemy work done though I'd be MORE than happy to make some for yah, especially if it's skill ups. I have gearlocks and collapsible containers for all my tradeskills with the exception of I still need an alchemy gearlock, but Xunil's getting me one.<br />

Jewlery Craft - 190 Skill, goal!<br />
Fletching - 194 Skill, goal!<br />
Baking - 189 skill, goal!<br />
<br />
<br />
Drinking - 170 currently going for 200<br />
Fishing - 112 currently going for 200 <br />
<br />
Brewing (158 currently going for 188) - Foraged Vegitables (for ginesh) also gnomish spirits, dwarven ale, elven wine, mead (for faydwer shackers) - Can all be bought in Freeport, or running around Faydwer, either way I'm either KoS or they won't sell to me. So if someone could make a run for me I'd pay for the components and their time.<br />
<br />
Pottery (156 currently going for 188) - zombie skin, low quality hides, low quality furs, low quality skins (for making lined and sealed vials, BTW do any rogues want any of these once I'm done making them???)<br />
<br />
Tailoring (66 currently going for 188) - This is gonna be the BIGGEST pain in my ass. I think I'm gonna shoot for Greyhopper Boots (1 Greyhopper Hide from MS and 1 Boot Pattern) which will take me to 95. Then I will work Crystalline silk till 131. Then switch to Nightmare Silk bow strings until 162. Then Acryllia Studded until 188 or so. Tailoring is the biggest beotch... any help here would be most appreciated over all.<br />
<br />
Blacksmithing (139 currently going for 188) - 2nd Biggest pain in my ass, I say 2nd because I enjoy smithing a lot so even though it's gonna be a big money sink, it'll be worth it.... Yes, the joys of Fine Steel. I'm gonna baby step up through gold chain and do platinum chain mail to 162 skill. Then do fine steel the rest of the way through 188. Mainly just need the spiderling silk for thread and LQ hides for padding when doing finesteel, but I'm sure after all my tailoring I'll have a stockpile of that crap anyhow.<br />
<br />
Alchemy (113 currently going for 150) - Potions, potions, potions... you want em, please let me know. I'm ready at this point to start making Flame Skin potions (the better DS potions that every tank wants and needs). Nice thing about thse potions is that they trivial at 135 skill so they'll get me pretty close to my goal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>itchyban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Baking (143 currently going for 191 trivial) - cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese. I wanna make a TON of patty melts. I can buy the bread and the bear meat in SH and PoK, but I've been told the only place to get the cheese is in Surefall which I'm sure I'm KoS there. So if someone could make a run for me I'd pay for the components and their time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Surefall? JPF, I though had cheese. If you are not KoS in JPF, you can get there through Blackburrow. No aggro from Gnolls in there and I can show you the way -- easy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pottery (156 currently going for 188 trivial) - zombie skin, low quality hides, low quality furs, low quality skins (for making lined and sealed vials, BTW do any rogues want any of these once I'm done making them???)<br />
<br />
<br />
Zombie fort in SK, as I recall. Lotsa zombies and a lot easier than sitting in the Oasis and waiting for them to aggro you. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Tailoring is the biggest beotch... any help here would be most appreciated over all.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cry after the supplies either drive you insane farming them, or drain your bank account completely. <br />
<br />
Drink *after* you tailor. A lot...<br />
<br />
GL on it Sori!<br />

Itchy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Deneve</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i have a stack or two of zombie skins you can have they dropped on the zombies in dulak's, i also think i have a few stacks of acrylia ore and crystalline silks for tailoring, was farming for an old friend who quit, i'll talk to you in game sori</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Jagged Pine, yeah that's what I meant. As an Iksar aren't I KoS there? Aren't they wood elves or am I smoking something again?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>itchyban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As an Iksar aren't I KoS there?<br />
<br />
Where *aren't* you KoS???<br />
<br />
Itchy<br />
<br />
Oh yeah -- let me know how much cheese you need ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hehehe, I'm not actually KoS in most of Faydwer, they just won't sell to me. BTW updated my current status on the top of the thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Canoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">FYI - Everything for faydwer shakers can be bought in Highhold Pass - where i do 99% of my brewing if i don't need PoP parts.<br />
 <br />
don't remember the name of the bar but i believe it's the only bar in the pass</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm also KoS in Highhold pass of course so either way I need some booze. You know I should check cabilis, who knows maybe the bar and the brewers have what I'm looking for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Julliette</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Can you make me a Artisan's Seal and how much would it cost about?<br />
<br />
Do you still need me to make those items?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm trivial to the 4 jewlery combines and 1 pottery combine. All the combines are under 100 and I have 151 pottery (I will be getting to 199 pottery as soon as I can get some of those casserole dish scetches from Jagged Pine) and 190 jewlery craft. I also have gearlocks for both.<br />
<br />
To make it, I need 8 velium bars, 1 blue diamond, 1 diamond, 1 black sapphire, 1 jacinth, 1 vial of purified mana (the 4 rubies one).<br />
<br />
Other things are a small block of clay, flask of water, and a HQ firing sheet. I can buy those for less than 1pp if you bring me all the gems, velium bars, and the vial of mana. Accourding to EQTraders the cost on it should be around 2,625.643pp. So 2.6K per attempt at making your GM Tradeskill item.</div></div><hr />
