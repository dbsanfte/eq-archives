Afterlife quit EQ tonight.<br />
<br />
Accolade left Saturday night (another long-time guild on Mith Marr).<br />
<br />
There was a post asking if the numbers have dwindled on our own servers.<br />
<br />
Maybe not the total numbers, but definitely the number of old school players just took a huge hit on MM.<br />
<br />
For some reason, this really made me sad.<br />

<br />
No...this is definitely the right place.<br />
<br />
As corny as it may seem, this really is the end of an era.<br />
<br />
I've watched AL for 3 years, bickering and battling with FoH, etc., and I loved every minute of it.<br />
<br />
This is definitely a sad day for EQ.<br />

/salute to all the AL folks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The interesting thing will be if they (and FoH) actually did get guild invites to WoW beta as some suppose.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah I liked Jenamdar.  It was kind of a cross between a cheap and stupid thrill and real sympathy when I saw him trying not to say anything about Thogg's stupid graphs and idiotic posts.  Now that was a task for a true hero!  Something about his relative silence and evasion seemed more interesting than the usual shrinking in shame or preposterous shoring up when you're left holding the ball for someone else's assinine behavior.  Seemed a nice enough fella, on top of that, too.  Oh well. <br />
<br />
Well, I thought PoP had assinine enough game design to change EQ around, but apparently people were incredibly durable back then, and somehow seemed to weather through the insane change of EQ to a 72-man (or more) pure raiding game, and past the atrocious stupidity of flags -- and it took the compounded stupidity of GoD to do it for a great many.  Long overdue.<br />
<br />
Afterlife is just another bunch of numbers, which is to say, of people.  Won't matter really, unless you think people matter, or speak to each other and recommend games to each other or game companies to each other.  I think this game started thinking of people in terms of numbers a long, long time ago, and by now the human factor is as good as lost for the developers and even many of the players.  Afterlife's leaving may seem like the end of an era to some, but it reminds me of some scientist talking about the end of the dinosaurs.  Some people posit they died from a cataclysm like a meteor strike, but others think they just died of worldwide diarrhea.  Anyway, they're gone forever, god love 'em, but you could hear the trickle, if you had an ear tuned to ****, for years.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The game is not out yet and we already have break downs of the game starting and people waiting to tear it apart. People waiting in line for this to be the next high end raiding game where 80+ of your closest practicaly strangers, can chase down loot from mob A and B to mindlessly zerg your way to the next level of mobs for more loot to get you to the next level of skillless, mindless zerg. What ever happened to just enjoying things cause it was fun? Its doesnt have to be about winning and being hardcore all the time. The problem with EQ now is, its not the journey thats focused on, its the end of it. The point is to get to the end. I was hoping WoW would be centered on the journey.<br />
<br />
<br />
Its just my opinion, but i was really hoping that WoW would not be like the EQ of today. That it would have depth and stories and be more like EQ was before it was turned into the raiding machine that it now is. If WoW is going to cater to this crowd then sadly it looks like WoW will be 100% farless enjoyable then its been sounding. And no, im not talking about raiding and guilds in general, you know the &quot;uber&quot; guilds im talking about. Its the guilds that have a 7 day a week 4-5 hour a night raiding requirement, no matter how many friends you have in the guild, no matter how much you help them. <br />
<br />
And yea, i realize that me wanting the game how i want it is no different or valid then they wanting the game how they want it save for 1.<br />
<br />
Im right ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also wonder how many people W.O.W. will lose if their &quot; end - game&quot; = EQ's &quot; end-game. &quot;<br />
<br />
It has to be better than DAOC (Take keeps, do TS'es or PvP). A segregation of the players is not the way to go imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well they will lose me faern thats for sure. <br />
<br />
However, if they can manage to give attention to all aspects, then they will truly have a powerful game.

I work enough at my first one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You people can bad-mouth and trash-talk EQ all you want, seriously. EVERY SINGLE new game hitting the market is hoping to be HALF as successful. What exactly did everyone expect EQ to be after 5 years? <br />
<br />
Sure, there are problems now, and there are things that can be done to fix them, but honeslty, the non-stop end-game whining is REALLY getting old. I pray DAILY for a game anywhere near as strong as EQ has been over the years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">A segregation of the players is not the way to go imo.<br />
<br />
The problem with comments like this is that there are a lot of differeing &quot;styles&quot; of play. Yeah, EQs player segregation has gotten worse and worse as the YEARS went by. What else was going to happen? Alienate one part of the community or the other? Its really only &quot;grass is greener&quot; crap that makes the &quot;segregation&quot; seem so bad, honestly. If people dindt KNOW what type of gear was dropping in Time and other high-end zones, they certainly wouldnt bitch and moan about the &quot;progression&quot; of their own &quot;sytle&quot;of play.<br />
<br />
If WoW wants to succeed, they had better attract both the hardcore and the casual player. Period. One or the other will not be enough to sustain the game into the epic &quot;EQ Lifetime&quot; proportions that they want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If WoW wants to succeed, they had better attract both the hardcore and the casual player. Period. One or the other will not be enough to sustain the game into the epic &quot;EQ Lifetime&quot; proportions that they want.<br />
<br />
I agree, but I think they need to do this without the extreme power difference that exists today in EQ between the uber and casual players.  End game players should be more powerful than us casual types, but twice as powerful (or more) is too much of a difference because it forces the game designers to adjust the content to the higher end crowd.  (i.e.:  GoD)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I agree, but I think they need to do this without the extreme power difference that exists today in EQ between the uber and casual players.<br />
<br />
And I agree with this statement. Remember the first 2 or 3 years of EQ? How big was the &quot;gap&quot;? Velious quest armor wasn't THAT uber over what was available to the &quot;masses&quot;, at least not by todays &quot;Ornate vs EP&quot; yardstick.<br />
<br />
5 years. The race has been long. And guess what. The guys running faster are gonna get farther and farther away as the race goes on. Its just natural progression. Yeah, they overdid it, no question about it. They focused too hard on the Ubers (PoP), then tried to make up for it with things like LoY (lower level raids, mid-level zones, loot not acceptable though) and LDoN (ok, good try, too time consuming for some, to repetitive for others, etc).<br />
<br />
Any new games success has to look at what makes EQ so attractive, and a HUGE part of that success is the sheer VOLUMES of stuff to do. I am not talking about myself, who has had an EQ account since the day it went live, I am talking about the person playing for a year of so. Most of that type of player hasnt scratched the surface of EQ. Quests, Tradeskills, Dragons, triggered Events, and then, ultimately, Raiding if you wish to go that way, or . . . not raiding if you dont. <br />
<br />
Say EQs quests suck all you want. What sucked was the ability to print out a walkthrough 2 weeks after release. Class armor in the old days, velious quests for progressive items (shawl and ring), etc etc. Those are solid, entertaining quests. I have had a blast doing that stuff. But its not ALL I do, nor is it ALL I want to do. <br />
<br />
Diversity is the name of the game. And people WILL have some patience, just not as much as we had with EQ, because we are spoiled rotten now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">You could call it spoiled... or you could call it reasonable.  *chuckle*   I believe that EQ asked unreasonable things of its players.  From the ridiculous consequences of death (which they fixed somewhat with lower-level rezzes), to the excruciatingly slow leveling (which they fixed with boosted ZEMs and places like Paludal), to the asinine nightmare that is keeping a raiding force EP flagged so you can continue to make progress in the face of rapid defections from this game....<br />
<br />
No, new games will definitely NOT be able to get by with the slipshod approach that EQ has always had.  The launch of CoH was more stable than most EQ patches are even today, just as an example.  Games like Horizons and Anarchy Online have proven that you can NOT start out with the lack of content and stability that EQ got by with - because there were no options back then.  Today there are.  And people won't stay with a game until you &quot;make it fun&quot; even if the carrot on the end of your stick is a gorgeous flying dragon.  It's not enough anymore.  People are spoiled / Our standards are higher.  Tomato, tomahto.  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I think there are 2 factors to the move, one is that eq has dimished somewhat, and two, I think there comes a time when everyone gets fed up of playing the same game over and over. While they may cite other reasons, it sometimes is this that is with the underlying frustration.<br />
It will be interesting to see what eq do now though, to try and keep their customers with the onslaught of the new competition. Also, it will be interesting see how long it will be before servers start to be merged. I'm gonna log back in a few months for a month out of curiousity.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's difficult to cater for all types of players.  All games suck to a certain degree.  It all depends what your threshold and comfort level is.<br />

It will be interesting though, to see what SOE will do to kerb the dwindling numbers.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I'm really hoping WoW follows Blizzard's previous blockbuster titles and is casual-friendly.  Go for a 5+ million playerbase, don't settle for 400k and consider that a huge success.  However, with Furor's hire and apparently a lot of EQ high end guilds moving to WoW to work on the raid game, I've had enough red flags go up that my enthusiasm is flagging (pun intended!).  <br />
<br />
My only request for the raid game beta testers is to be as open and honest as possible when that stage of the game is reached.  As much as I like Blizzard, their propaganda, er, marketing department will lie through their teeth just as much as SOE's did.  Let us know now if WoW's end game (which everyone will eventually reach just like in EQ) is identical to EQ's- bring 72 of your closest &quot;friends&quot; 5+ nights a week for 5 hours at a time or don't expect to see many of the best zones or equip your character outside the bazaar/market/whatever. <br />
<br />
That's why I'm glad there's no NDA- the people that love this will be singing its praises from the rooftops so the mass market types like me will know and can stay well away.  AL, FoH, whomever, give us the 411, eh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">jesus<br />
<br />
get over the uber thing.  there are AL members in WoW beta.  there are FoH members in beta.  it's verified and it's a no brainer.  wow is at stage 2 beta and there's a LOT of people<br />
<br />
however there's no causal reason to think they're in there with the intention of testing end game or &quot;uber&quot; content.  it doesn't say jack about the orientation blizzard has towards end game scenarios to let these people (among others) into the beta.<br />
<br />
simply they're there because they're involved and good players-- a characteristic hopefully all early alpha and beta players would have.  there's no basis to assume that developers of other games (let alone players of other games and genres) place any sort of value of players from FoH, AL, Triton, or anyone else.  I think even among gamers, there's the common perception that EQ is a game that take no skill, just a lot of time.  it wouldn't be of any benefit to bring in these guilds versus other players EXCEPT to exploit the large communities on popular websites (such as furor's visit to blizzard and sigil) but then again that's no different than giving one day credentials to GU comics or alakazam<br />
<br />
as for this uber versus non-uber ****.  basically EQ is an aberation.  it's a game that got made UNDER THE RADAR because no one with any money or brains would have ever made.  it's basically a MUD made for hard core geeks that got mistakenly released to the masses.  it's too hard and smart money will make a more polished, better balanced, more fun and easier game... bad news for someone like me who liked EQ a lot but good news for everyone else<br />
<br />
eq2 will NOT be like eq1.  there will be one more game in the history of the world as hard as eq1 and that will be vanguard.  when that game goes down (or rather is relegated to a small subsegment of the online market) not microsoft nor any other publisher will back a game with such limited appeal.<br />
<br />
enjoy eq while it lasts... we will never see his like again...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">ok... I'm in wow beta (since p2).  As I indicated before, there were several guild invites to beta, many uber, some not.  mine would be considered uber, i suppose (farming quarm is boring, trying to crack uqua).  After 5+ years of being at the top, etc, I'm not (currently) willing to do it again.<br />
<br />
So in WoW beta, I'm playing it casual.  Most of my guild (along with AL, hoss, and other well known guilds) have most members in the high 20's all the way thru high 30's already.  But my rogue made it to 18 before I decided to roll up a warlock, which owns and is now level 9.<br />
<br />
Playing it casually, it's very fun.  I run around doing quests, skinning dead animals for their pelts, and just explore.  If I get xp, I get xp.  So far it's very easy to find somebody else doing a quest you are doing if you need to group up.  There's really no harsh penalty for grouping.  Death, while a PITA, has no unbearably harsh penalties.  I haven't taken a rez from a ghost in the GY yet, just run back and get my body and keep on truckin.  Dying is annoying enough to avoid it, but not such a freakin PITA that it just ruins your whole night if you do die.<br />
<br />
I only get frustrated when I slip into my powergamer mentality and get a flash of desire to be at the top.  When that happens I just log out and go do something IRL....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I would like to think the hiring of the &quot;uber&quot; guild people is a step in the right direction to AVOID the problems that EQ ran into.<br />
<br />
So far, though, there is a disturbing, common theme to the reports I have read. Leveling is easy. This, in and of itself, isnt horrible this early, but if it CONTINUES to be easy all the way to the top, I think you will end up with what we have in EQ, a lot of players hitting the wall and forced to either give up or go &quot;to the next level&quot;, if there even is one. <br />
<br />
Honestly, I think EQs best days were when the game was hardest, and not because of bugs. Leveling took a long time. Dying HURT. Not everyone you say was 65, or almost 65. There was no maps, no walkthroughs, no Vulcons Information Story File. Maybe I am just sentimental though, because I actually remember the boats. <br />
<br />
The whole &quot;appeal to 5 MILLION&quot; thing scares the crap out of me though. Thats nearly impossible for a contineous game like EQ. Sure, you can do it with Diablo and Starcraft, after all, they are mini-games inside a bigger game. WoW isnt going to be like that. <br />
<br />
Whatever happens, the scene is definitely looking brighter, even if your choice is EQ. SOE is being FORCED to listen to their ever-shrinking customer base in order to keep people interested. The next logical step are opening the POP zones, expanding LDoNs dungeons and loot and providing more people with the ability to get equipment to compete in Gates. <br />
<br />
And of course, as someone said, new games MUST provide a better &quot;thingy&quot; in order to un-seat EQ, and they know this. Especially Blizzard. What that &quot;thingy&quot; is, though, is still a mystery to most of the games collecting dust on my shelf.</div></div><hr />

You are a textbook moron. Read carefully. THE TIMESINKS WERE PUT IN BECAUSE THE END GAME CONTENT WAS NOT FINISHED. WHOSE FAULT IS THIS? THE PEOPLE WHO DEVELOP THE CONTENT FOR EQ. Who do they work for again? Ah, yes, SOE. Does the original Rathe, or even the original Uqua zone ring a bell?<br />

Go cry somewhere else, if you don't want to do the timesinks and end up raiding high end zones you don't have to.

Did you ever consider that maybe, just maybe Blizzard asked it testers to test some zones that require a higher level character (scarlet monastry in this case) and thus that people leveled up for that?<br />

Would you rather have the Battle.net crew or the EQ raiding crew test the end content?<br />

Do you have a beef with this guy, and why, I dont think your really gave any solid reasons? yes GoD came out for the people who progress way too fast, do you really think people who progress this fast want to, as you so boldy put it, slog? what does that mean? does that mean slowly get through it or wade through crap, I have no idea? of coarse they will keep it up, why would Sony put out a patch that will have people beat it in a week?.......just what are you saying?<br />
<br />
I used to agree with you on the lackability of shaman, but it really doesnt matter after a couple weeks of solid single grouping with people that are constantly trying to beat these trials to get a raid in....yet agin to get the guild better gear so all can beat them efficiently. I relly dont understand anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I agree with Sladeron, its because there existed hardcore people that they had to  provide content for hardcore people. The nature of this content, however, was to slow those hardcore people down, so that an expansion lasted until the next expansion. I am not blaming the uber people, as even if there wasn't the top guilds, there would be guilds progressing fast, whether defined casual or not.  With the timesink nature imposed from the start of everquest, its really no surprise that hardcore players are a result of it.<br />
<br />
My point is only that while the hardcore players may not be a cause asuch, they are a factor that has contributed to the amount of sinks to slow guilds down, if that makes sense.</div></div><hr />

Totally agree, though I do get annoyed when I see raiders slumming in open PoP zones holding down camps solo that take a group of bazaar players.  That's the exception rather than the rule thankfully.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, I've got a newflash for anyone that thinks you have to be in the very best of the best guild to ever see the endgame in EQ:  There are currently seven guilds in plane of time on solusek ro.  At least 150 members per guild, and that is over 1000 people plane of time flagged on my server.  If you are a casual player, you aren't going to see the end game as soon as someone that plays hardcore, but if you want to see it you will see it - It's not supposed to be easy and it's not supposed to be handed to you.<br />
On my server (A Ro) there are I believe 4 guilds in Time.  I'm not certain there will be a fifth- there is a massive dropoff between the handful of elemental guilds and the rest who want to become elemental.  Someone from A Ro can correct me if I'm wrong, but I get the sense that those who can get into the elementals have done so and those who haven't never will, at least not under the current requirements.  I realize this varies by server, though.<br />
<br />
I really wish we could still see hard numbers on server population.  The exodus of friends in both raid guilds and my casual guild has been staggering lately, but it's still just anecdotal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Sladeron, I really do not think you have a good grasp of the situation here. Every server has 1 or 2 &quot;UBER&quot; guilds, and then they have 10+ guilds of folks just hangin out with each other, campin keys, campin Emp rings, killing Bertoxx and Grummus and TT and RZtW. Not every guild that advances can be blanketed under one description. <br />
<br />
However, there is ONE thing you said that I believe to be a perfect description of some of the thought processes at Verant and then SOE.<br />
<br />
Uninspired, excessive timesinks are put in for one reason only: to slow down people who play too damn much.<br />
<br />
I truly believe this to be the case, but in addition to slowing down the top end, it prolonged the play of the lower ends as well. An example: It took me the average time to get my VT shards (10-15 hours camping). However, that 10-15 hours was spread out over a week. Couple hours in the morning on shards, couple hours in the evening after the kids are in bed raiding. Am I &quot;uber&quot;? Hardly. I got to see VT, and I will get to see Time eventually. Might not be til later this summer though, cause I am not in a big hurry. <br />
<br />
90% of EQs game design is centered around 2 things. Longer playtimes, and re-playability. They want to keep you paying month after month, and the best way to do that is to force you to spend time. If it takes a &quot;hardcore uber&quot; 2 days to do something, that same 24 hours /played is probably a full month for a casual player.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: OH, forgot to finish my thought as it applies to this thread.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard wants WoW to be anywhere NEAR as successful as EQ, they better have a way to keep people paying month after month. If not, it will quickly go the way of Diablo 2 (note, I am not arguing this games success, either financially or conceptually, I bought 2 full versions myself, plus expansions, and enjoyed it a TON) and burn out for MOST in a few months. <br />

Check my magelo. The RETIRED shaman (from almost a year ago) has very subpar gear. The only PoP God I ever killed was TThule. Never seen VT, or Emp. Never raided on a DKP system, and never once won an item with over 100hp on a raid.<br />

I have school, a job, going out, etc.<br />

You're just trying to find reasons to cry at uber guilders. Maybe if YOU would get the      off your butt and either go outside or dedicate yourself to EQ you wouldn't be here crying.<br />

Attention: No one cares about you, or the way you think. The uberguilders are off enjoying themselves in EQ/WoW, and the people here are laughing as you stumble to keep ground under your &quot;arguement&quot;.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">A few years ago, when I started playing everquest, it was all about exploring and seeing the world. It was only a few expansions later that the point became to max out your levels and aa so you could start enjoying the game, simply because the process of levelling consists basically of Pull/kill/pull/kill/repeat as necessary. I've noticed that for lot of new players, levelling is now only an obstacle to experiencing the real game at 65 +.<br />
<br />
Wow seems to be taking a more single player type approach where you progress through the game by experiencing the content (doing the quests). Maybe this means WoW will be a game with a beginning and an end, maybe it doesn't. Either way I'll be curious to see it when it comes out because everything I've heard about it points to fun from A to Z. <br />
<br />
One of the main concerns a lot of people have about new games is what the end game will be like. Having the Uberguilds beta test and have a word in this makes me a lot more confident that the endgame will actually be entertaining and reasonably bug free as opposed to mindless farming of semi implemented zones. Personally I enjoy the sheer scale of a 72 person raid... at least the first few times on new content. It's the timesinks, camps, spawn timers, not being able to do content based on it's availability as opposed to your skill/power/numbers/ability that realy kills it for me. (Anyone else here  is on a crowded server and wishes they'd get their thumbs out and implement a REAL instanced Plane of time ?)</div></div><hr />

I was not in an 'uber' guild.  My guild was about mid way Elemental before broke up from alot of retirements.  However, we, on 'live servers' should not be beta testing SoE's crap.  That's what beta time and test servers are for.  While Test may not have the extreme population of some of the ore crowded servers, ie Mith Marr, that is what they are there for.  One of the Test server SKs posts daily on the SK boards.  They report bugs etc, but this crap STILL gets sent to Live, reguardless.  Have you spoken w/ any people that beta'd/tested GoD? Almost everything that is broken there now, was reported numerous times, but did they fix it then? No The released the unfinished broken crap anyway.<br />

There is a huge difference between making the game harder and making it ****ing tedious and broken.  Vyemm was hard, Sontalak was hard, Arch Lich/High Priest/Cursed were hard, Bertox was hard, Rallos Zek the Warlord was hard, etc.  After a bit of tuning Xegony and Coirnav were hard.   They were tough encounters, but they weren't the broken tedious crap that GoD is.  You can make an encounter hard without making it full of time sinks and broken content.   You can slow progression by making mobs difficult, but not impossible, so that it takes weeks of learning each encounter to move on.  Most guilds took 2-3 weeks learning Rallos Zek to reach Elementals.  If each of the prior gods had been as difficult (and dropped loot accordingly) it would have easily taken a couple months more to reach Time.  Instead of adding all the bull**** crap in Kod`Taz / Ikkinz they could have just made the Kod`Taz bosses a bit tougher, make the Ikkinz raids a bit more difficult.  But instead they made them pushovers and decided to slow people by putting in rediculous time sinks and broken zones.  Unfortunately too many people can't see that because they are too busy taking shots at &quot;ubers&quot; and telling SOE its ok to ship an expansion that isn't even half finished.<br />

I agree with most of the other things you said but I think its actually you that is telling SOE that GoD is ok.<br />
<br />
I spent 2 hours total in GoD so far and have no real desire to spend any more. How many did you spend? If its more than 15 you are indirectly accepting the way SOE made it. There are many complete games (that cost way more than a EQ expansion) that you can finish in 15 hours.<br />

Stop playing or do other things in EQ if you dont like GoD. Dont make it sound like you are forced to do GoD.</div></div><hr />

Concur. SOE is to blame here, but honestly, they simply followed a pattern that has been around a long time. The released content that wasnt ready for the masses, and now its costing them. The Time+ guilds on my server are already sick of Gates. Stupidly Artificially Hard is not the same as Challanging, and it gets more and more obvious the farther along you get in EQ these days. You can hide &quot;hard for stupid reasons&quot; in lower content, but not at the very top, sorry. <br />
<br />
It looks as thought SOE is gonna tweak Gates (theres a shock, I wonder if the fact they have probably lost as much as 5% of their users due to cancellation has anything to do with it, and they have certainly noticed that attendance on servers is way down as well). Possibly too little too late, though. Personally, I think their best bet at this point is to open up some of the content to the &quot;masses&quot;, before the &quot;masses&quot; bail out just like the higher end guilds.</div></div><hr />

Uninspired, excessive timesinks are put in for one reason only: to slow down people who play too damn much.  Forur had his chance in Luclin to show them the error of their ways and he blew it.  He complained and ranted about the timesinks but he and his guild completed them anyway.  <br />
<br />
There's your precedent and that's where the blame has to go for this.  Nobody glued his fingers to the damn keyboard and forced him to play through this crap.  But because he, his guild and other uberguilds showed a willingness(addiction) to slog through that crap, SOE kept it up and did it in PoP and GoD as well.<br />
<br />
You got it all wrong. The problem is that SOE releases all kind of crap which is totally UNFINISHED. They just slap something together, release it with a load of bells and whistles and start to cash in the money. And then lo and behold, along comes Furor-type of people, who are getting dangerously close to the big time boasted places, which in fact are not done, not finished, although these places SHOULD HAVE BEEN finished. And then they slap in these big time timesinks. This crap from SOE is going on since early EQ days, when they simply did not bother to work out Vox and Nagafen at all, and suddenly players got there and smacked these mobs down, only to find nothing on them. GM's came and MANUALLY handed out the &quot;loot&quot;.<br />
<br />
So no, these timesinks were not added to slow down the people who have too much time to play the game, these timesinks were added to slow down the people, who were about to find out that SOE doesn't have half the content finished at all, all the boasted places and items weren't even ready and in the game yet. As far as I am concerned, if Furor and other similar type of players put WoW to same kind of tough test and WoW passes it, then WoW will be one SUPERB game.</div></div><hr />

I'm going to miss alot of the shaman I've talked to over the years, but I won't miss the game. I won't miss the constant fighting with devs over shaman issues, being told shaman are &quot;fine as they are&quot; either.<br />
<br />
I will take away with me some great memories of eq, when it was fun.<br />
The great display of community friendship that came out so clearly at the botb final. I lost in the first round badly because of a reporter incident but it didn't reduce the amount of fun I had that day. <br />
<br />
Perhaps the funniest thing I ever experienced was the ToT3 signup in the arena on RZ. Over 600 people in that zone at the same time and the gm running it.....(can't remember his name, was a barb helping lady D)...lists the first 2 teams in match 1, then tells everyone else to zone out into lake. Well we all zoned out into lake at the same time, it crashed the zone for over an hour :P<br />
<br />
Since this will most likely be my last post here, I do want to indulge myself by paying tribute to the shaman in my mind that really did help improve the class for the rest of us. Hats off to nixx, joror, gugek, tugg, chuk, ooga, kaz, glor, and howjan. Not all the work they put in for the class was ever seen or known about by most of the community, but it still needs to be recognized<br />
<br />
Good luck to everyone still in eq...<br />

One of SOE's best ideas was the implementation of cross server communication, I've really enjoyed chatting with you on the Crucible channel. Thanks for the support and tips.<br />

I hope to see you in a future game!<br />
