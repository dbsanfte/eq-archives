<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is there any truth to the rumor floating around that 2 shadowknights (elemental geared, lvl 65s) duo'd Trakanon, and if so, who has a link to their logs and/or screenshots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It wouldn't suprise me, use a pet to take the trak touch, disc HT and your halfway there in seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i dont doubt it at all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ungerargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Assuming they both got good crits (~8k damage) on their HTs, that means they only needed to do another 16k damage to kill Trak.  With lifetaps, and the ability to pass aggro between them consistently, I definitely see this being possible.  I mean, hell, Trak probably only has 1300 ATK, well-equipped elemental SKs should have in excess of 1600 AC/ATK buffed as well as over 7000 HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I can see it EASILY.</div></div><hr />

SK in my guild solo's the easier kunark dragons</div></div><hr />

<br />
With maxxed AA's for Harmtouch, they will always get at least ~7.2k damage from their harmtouches.  With good 2hs/epic, elementally geared SK's could pretty much put Crapanon to shame.  He's an ugly dragon anyways /grin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Banish sucks though, any time I've fought him we've gotten someone banished off pretty quick in the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yah i'd be interested to know how they got past Banish.  That would have put em back with the juggies fairly quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Pop their DA while 1 is FD, protects them from the initial banish then burn him down with super HTs.<br />
That's if DA protects you from banish, I know it protects from DT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Discordja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah it will protect you from the touch but while DA you are unable to melee/cast.  Plus, once you pop the DA his partner would get insta agro.  Super HTx2 will only do 16k give or take.  The most likely case is that they just got lucky, no banishment procs, and they dropped him in circa 30-40 seconds.<br />
<br />
The numbers say it's possible.  16k from HTx2.  The remaining 16k is pretty fast assuming they have sufficient gear.  Not every melee has a Vanazir, but you figure a 65 sk with Vanazir and the 2h mod item (pushes 2h up to 232 or so) plus pet plus spears/dots/taps can run somewhere around 220(that sound about right?  It may be more but I've parsed Edge of Eternity and Coir hammer out to around 180 melee only so I'm just trying to baseline it) burst dps.  That puts you in the 40 second range.  The aoe will not land at 65 and 500 poison resist, the only other remaining obstacle is the lifetap.  1500 is a lot I think it's more than manageable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">the instant he banishes you, sit down and he will summon you back. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Meladrak Doushi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">They would also have to land their Snare/Dot<br />
<br />
Once Trakanon runs YOU ARE FUGGED.<br />
<br />
I have seen the banishment trick before, its kind of funny actually but usually only works if your the only one banished.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Malaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Once one is banished, other FD and the first sit, he should get summoned.<br />
<br />
As for trak running, they might have saved one HT for the last 25%<br />
<br />
It really doesnt surprise me. however it must be fun :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shaito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">DA does not protect against Death Touches. I'm doubtful it protects from banishes either. I learned this first hand with my 63 necro in PoF against one of the demi-gods. I ran up to Fright attempting to take the DT in pull and got laid out for 20k with Quivering Veil of Xarn on me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Discordja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Trak banish is different than say .. RZ banish.  Pretty sure it will keep you from getting sent to shrooms since it's an actual spell and not just some innate ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gutrippar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">having a 65 sk myself, duoing trak is quite a feat. soloing the old world dragons would be a huge feat too. HT with SCF3, Uber HT1, and Unholy Touch 3 will put it at 7200.<br />
<br />
Lets talk about 65 time equipped sk's, and we have another story.</div></div><hr />
