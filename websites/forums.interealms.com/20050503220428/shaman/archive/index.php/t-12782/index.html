<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Supido</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was wondering if anyone knows..........It seems that all the shammy playable races have a newb quest for some sort of Snare item BUT us poor kitty cat's ( and mabey frogs but bah ) I was wondering if anyone knows of a item (Clicky or even if I have to beat on it 500 times :p) with any type of snare on it that is useable by Vah Shir Shammys. And I'm not talking about charged items, even tho I really want snare, I refuse to pay 5k for a fungas beast gland or some expendable item that I will go through in 1 hour of soloing.<br />

Thanks, <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Do a search on the boards for ways to snare.  The only one with a newbie quest for snare is trolls, if you consider lvl 30'ish quest newbieish.<br />

There are still options, and there has been a thread on it on the front page longer than this thread has been up.<br />

Open your eyes, and the answer shall reveal itself.</div></div><hr />
