<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been noticing more and more lately that people here are less likely to be helpful when questions/ideas are posted and more likely to flame. Has a large portion of the Sk board migrated here looking for new people to be rude to? This board has always been the nicest and most helpful i've found, but lately its turning into a snipe fest where you can't find many serious topics without someone outright blasting others just for stating thier opinions and asking questions,<br />
I'm not talking about the people who post that they disagree but about the ones who are like &quot;man your an idiot if ya don't know that&quot; or &quot;how can ya be such and such a level with gear that lousy or not know this&quot; etc etc. Think before ya post, and remember real people wrote and read these posts. Happy holidays everyone, heres hoping for a nicer crucible in the coming year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well you've got people who've been playing a Shaman for 4+ years. So when they see the SAME, OLD, QUESTIONS that often are stickied (for a reason I might add) at the top, yeah, they're a tad jaded.<br />
<br />
Talamay Crystalspirit had a great FAQ guide, don't know what happened to her or the guide. Think it may have been incorporated. (The guide not Talamay)<br />
<br />
Also people may be growing frustrated with the EQ. Sure that frustration shouldn't translate to being rude on the board, but hey, we're all human. <br />
<br />
Personally, I miss some of the old posters: Tudamorf, Eduin, Robert135. Damn those were good flame wars. <br />
<br />
But I can guarantee you, in the next 72 hours there will be threads created on the following:<br />
<br />
1) Is X part of the Epic changed? {No}<br />
2) What race should I play? {Whatever you think looks cool}<br />
2a) Where should I put my starting points? {Doesn't matter}<br />
3) Why can't Iksar use the JBB? {Interferes with the lizard -&gt; handbag process}<br />
<br />
Then for those who play in the stratosphere:<br />
<br />
1) How does your guild handle 'Y' upper Pop MOb? {Tank, heal, loot}<br />
2) Raid buffing stategies? {Everybody gets everything then click off what they don't want and send tells}<br />
3) How to 'Fix' alchemy? {Wait}<br />
4) Things to make our class better? {Longer Buffs} {No idiot, better buffs} {You two are retards, I'm tired of buffing} {Then why did you pick a Shaman?} {*&amp;*^ you} {Shaman are fine} {No they're not *%&amp;}<br />
{Rabbit Helms with laser beams !}<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">And Faern has outlined almost every reason that people get flamed on the SK boards.  They get flamed for asking stupid questions, saying or doing stupid things.  And mostly, for not using search.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mordaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Where can I get that rabbit helm at?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Alot of it is the same questions over and over.  What AA do I buy.  Is Torpor worth it.  Should I Level to X or get AA points.  Where do I camp X.  What is best place to camp at level X.  And on and on and on and on and on.  People are tired of seeing the same topics.  No excuse to be vicious but I think some people need a smack on the head.  I think its just about as rude to post without having read the rules or to have the respect for others time to atleast attempt to find the answers yourself.<br />
<br />
This community is a great resource and all it takes is about 30 minutes of just exploring, reading stickies to find the information you seek or how to get it.  Some things are bound to get repeated i guess but really use the search feature.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Though I haven't been a member of the forum very long compared to most but I have read it for some time. Lately I've found myself not typing what I want at times because I try to be nice. Sometimes I even start a reply and force myself to close the page.<br />
<br />
Sometimes people say something that's so wrong they deserve a little flame. Normally people try to respond nicely to them but sometimes people are in a bad mood or are just replying to what they think was a personal attack against them.<br />
<br />
I find myself getting tired of all the &quot;Gear Check&quot;, &quot;Where to 2 box&quot;, &quot;Best partner&quot;, etc...<br />
<br />
If it's not a specific question about gear just read some posts. After two and if not one thread you should understand what type of gear you should be looking for. If you don't know what you can upgrade to with your plat then do a search in the bazaar and look at the higher prices. How may times can we type &quot;go for HPs and AC&quot;? <br />
<br />
So many questions are being asked over and over. We have the greatest people on this board and so many reply with great and well thought out ideas. Many times it's the people that have one post asking these questions and I figure they didn't bother looking around for the answer. But then there are people that have been on the board for a year and 150 posts. What's up with that? :confused: <br />
<br />
Ahhh, I could go on forever but I had to get that off my chest. Feel free to flame me on anything I said. Lol.<br />
<br />
Have a good day. :)</div></div><hr />

Dude, can't believe you went there.<br />
<br />
EVERYBODY and their pet knows dump all points into, and look for equipment with DEX and CHA. One so you can cast faster and two so the MOBs resist less.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Sad to say, but the same old questions continue to get asked because it's the same old EQ.  Hasn't been much innovation nor a lot of truly new content in a long time.</div></div><hr />

Sometimes its people who are rude for no good reason. A thread about what ya want to see added in the next expansion isn't really a place to flame, intelligent argument is alot more constructive and alot less rude.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Orgak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I lurk on a lot of boards.  The Crucible is known as &quot;The Happy Fuzzy Bunnies.&quot;  We don't have flaming here.  Now this is flaming:<br />
<br />

<br />
Hell, I can't even say &quot;****&quot; in this forum.  Which is neither here nor there in the grand scheme of things, but it shows just how not-flaming this place is.  <br />
<br />
The people who post on these boards and are &quot;in the know&quot; have worked hard, damn hard, (parsing, beta testing, playing on Test *shudder*, experimenting, etc... ) to gather and detail out information for all of us to have.  90% of the time, posting could have and should have been avoided simply by performing due diligence via searching.  <br />
<br />
Sony's marketing geniuses have brought us into the mainstream.  For many, EQ is the first and only MMORPG they've played.  It's not Diablo or Zelda.  There are no &quot;Ultimate Strategy Guides&quot; with screenshots of every frame or little maps with the hidden treasures.  (Don't even think about mentioning the gimp and failed attempts by Prima which I'm sure Sony had a hand in editing so that they contained absolutely no real information.)  It's different.  To be good at the game you have to spend as much or more time researching and reading as you do playing.  Anyone who took a toon from 1 - 65 with a couple of hundred AA's without PL'ing or ebaying deserves respect.  And by respect I mean not to be bothered with the laziness of new players who want to be &quot;uber!&quot; but don't want to read.  We are already standing on the shoulders of our predecessors.  90% of any information anyone would need about this class or the game in general is already out there and easily accessible.  The sooner the new players learn that, the better.  If they don't want to spend the time to learn their characters or try and think things through on their own before leeching off others, I don't want them in my game.  Chances are, they're the same ones that aggro the turn-in mob or beg me for plat when I'm naked and heading for my corpse.<br />
<br />
Remember, the long-timers in EQ who are holding our hands as we learn the game do not get paid.  They are not Sony employees and they could be doing better things with their time.  Yes, they have a right to lay the smack down when asked &quot;HP &gt; CHA?&quot; for the 1400th time.  &quot;The post is named, just don't read it.&quot;  I'm sorry, but I want them to read MY posts when I post something and have a need.  I want Retired_Uber_Helpful_Shammy_01 to keep in touch and share their wisdom.  And if I'm going to ask them to give me a hand when I need it, I don't want them skipping every thread with my name on it.  <br />
<br />
The posts about ideas for evolvement of the class aren't bad in nature.  I'm sure they are for the most part well-intended.  But, it's pointless really.  Sony has made it pretty clear that they see us as balanced, and I think the majority of those on this board will concede that.  Sure, we'd all like improvement.  Who wouldn't?  But, we aren't broken and even if we were, it'd need to be painfully obvious before we could even hope to see something done about it.  As for the attitudes of a very very few on the boards who's posts get nerfed anyway.  As long as they know what they're talking about, I prefer flaming to coddling.  <br />
<br />
Okay, back to lurking.   :p</div></div><hr />

  I think my favorite flame fest was when a Bard came here and started instructing Shamans in a condescending tone about how to group with Bards in LDoN. That was some fun reading! It really brought out the creativity in us. I think there was even a response written entirely in &quot;Troll tongue&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Absolutely, positively NOT a flame, but I gotta ask.  Is there any shaman ability that hasn't already been handed out to boost another class?</div></div><hr />

cannibalize, alchemy, and rabid bear...pretty much only original abilities for shaman (and two of them are a joke)...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Stareff2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The problem really seems that the some of the posters that replied to this thread cant seem to ignore the duplicate posts and try to empower themselves to reply to those posts by flaming the originator. <br />
<br />
I also love this board not only becuase of my love for our class, but that it isnt a flame haven. Generally we get great queries and intelligent questions. Noone is wrong for not surfing the boards history of threads.<br />
People just want to know the answers that they are dealing with currently and past posts my not be current with patches or updates and new techniques.<br />
<br />
Remember we all started as a  Board noob at one time or another and the questions we asked then could have been already asked but we dont think of ourselves as idiots for posting that question!<br />
<br />
If you see a duplicate posts and it bothers you its simple, keep looking for a thread that intersts you.<br />
I give you permission to not reply to duplicate threads, however if you want to be nice and help a younger Shaman, then feel fre to post a nice reply.<br />
<br />
Most of all guys and gals thanks for being a great Board of folks who care to be nice and helpful! This board rocks.</div></div><hr />

Ah yes, the classic &quot;I Got pwned so I'm gonna pretend this was all part of my master plan and you are foolish monkeys who dance for my amusement&quot; post. <br />
<br />
Of course, since your grammar looks like something a retarded 3 year old howler monkey would smash out randomly, you lose points. F+ on this flame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I'm not sure why people get so upset by questions or just don't ignore the ones they don't want to answer.  If people didn't ask the same questions, not sure how much there would be to talk about other than patches and new expansions, and since the patches are like once a month now it would make for limited conversation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">LOL @ Faern.  <br />
<br />
Ya people here are just impatient with noob questions because most have been in game for a long time.  Most of the older, benevolently helpful people have retired or stopped posting here.  <br />
<br />
Ways to get flamed: <br />
1) Ask one of the questions on Faern's list.<br />
<br />
2) Post about things you think are wrong with the shaman class. (This draws the ire of the fanboys)<br />
<br />
3) Post about how great you think the shaman class is.  (This draws the ire of the cynics, myself included sometimes b/c SoE reads this stuff and thinks &quot;no upgrades for them!&quot;)<br />
<br />
4) Post about how quests, getting spells, or leveling up etc is too hard.  99% of this stuff is infinitely easier now than it was for most of the shamans who read here.  The game gets easier every patch so SoE can attract more people to play who were turned off by the difficulty/timesinks.  <br />
<br />
5) Post how you solo'd Ubermob X.  (Also nerf begging that will get you flamed to kingdom come.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">This coming from a man with the surname Punchyaface.<br />
<br />
The world is full of humor ;)<br />
<br />
As far as your post, its always been like this and as the game slowly winds down itll get worse. Just see it less when there is more to talk about and more when there is less.</div></div><hr />
