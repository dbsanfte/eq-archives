<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I dont often post up in this section but yesterday I was invited to help out on a epic and promptly ended up in the Scarlet Dessert..Now, Ive never hunted there and noticed a few things right away..<br />
1. All the mobs had mad aggro...Even the green ones...<br />
2. The scenery was pretty cool, having that I never hunted there before.<br />
<br />
3. We were after some sort of Rvenent guy, he was sitting under this giant Greek Gazebo looking thing.. We had about twenty five toons.. There was little or no prep and they pulled him...Well, I hit him with malo and insideous malady and then tried to slow him...Turgors wouldnt hit, and neither would cloud of grummis?  Whats the story on this guy..He killed the whole raid, but was listed as a lvl 60 mob... It was truely brutal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ive been hearing about NPC's in different zones that werent there before and so far they have been tied into New epic stuff. Wonder if thats the case here? Is  a lvl 60ish mob in EW for sombodies epic that is rough like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Lots of the new epic mobs are surprisingly difficult.  I'm partially time geared, rest VT, couple junk spots, and figured I might try talking out our first epic mob, the megaladon. Oops hehe.<br />
<br />
I had read the meg hit for 700'ish, was slowable, and was blue to a 65, so gave it a shot.  Well, spin stun for 7 seconds or so, pet dead, me at half life before I even cast a spell... about 8 seconds later, dead.<br />
<br />
SOE has designed the new epic mobs to be a challenge, taking into consideration the gear levels and abilities of classes at this state in the game.  Don't be surprised when you get spanked by brand new mobs.</div></div><hr />

Correcting myself..He is part of the Wiz 2.0 epic..cant believe I got suckered into that raid..sheesh..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In beta there was a Forest Dragon that a bunch of us tried to kill in JP Forest.  To spawn him I think you had to kill a Dire Bear or Kodiak or something like that.  The Forest Dragon was red at 65, and had a cold AE of 1500 that dispelled 4 buffs at a time and had a knockback effect.  The AE range was huge, and with 400+ resists I think people were still getting hit every time by it (heals being interrupted by the knockback too :().  We didn't have enough healers, and our MT went down real quick...as did the raid party shortly after.  We had it down to in the high 70%'s I think, and this was just about 20 or so randomly thrown together people.  With a solid group of people that knew each other and were familiar with raiding mobs like that, I think it would have been doable with 4 groups or so of people.  But for us, it was just plain nasty.<br />
<br />
I wonder if this mob made it onto the live servers, and who's epic it may be for?  Druids/Rangers perhaps?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Friend of mine also noticed a &quot;Plains Dragon&quot; on track the other day, in the Karanas I believe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Somehow, the idea of new mobs in old zones really works for me. <br />
<br />
I hope they don't scare off the diligently levelling newbies.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Bwahaha, diligently levelling newbs - I kill myslef.</div></div><hr />

Those dragons are for the bard epic.  There are 4 of them, one per zone: North Karana, Jaggedpine, Swamp of No Hope and Stonebrunt.  They are normally not up, but if someone kills a &quot;dire&quot; mob in one of those zones, the dragon will spawn on top of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The elite sun revenant (wizzie 1.5 epic START mob) is kind of a badass.  Hits reasonably hard-ish (flurries 1k or so), has a ton of hp, but has some badass AEs.  One is an unresistable mana drain (detrimental) at -1000 mana/tic.  He's got some DoTs and DDs.  Bottom line, he's not good to get near.<br />
<br />
The kill is tedious, but easy.  All his AE ranges are 150 range.  Put a single tank out front, let him get agro, and go to town with spells and ranged attacks.  Pious remedy (supernal remedy), sylvan infusion, and, of course, daluda's all have 200 range for heals.  Once he's slowed, he's cake.  It just takes a while with ranged attacks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Night Eternal killed this mob on Morden Rasp two days ago.  We meleed him instead of fighting ranged, but we were still able to kill the mob.  He is quite nasty, and I was OOM pretty fast from his AE.  It did give me an opportunity to use Ancestral Aid in a raid situation again and then I died *lol*</div></div><hr />
