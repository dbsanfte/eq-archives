<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>breakin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I tried looking for some info using the search feature, but couldn't find anything so I thought I would ask you guys since you seem to know what you are talking about. I'm in a guild that has been growing for alittle over a year now and we are getting to the point that we want to start raiding a bit. We have 4 clerics right now waiting till we're strong enough to take down Ragefire to complete their epic. Problem is that none of them have experience being in a CH chain, and since I've never played a Cleric neither do I. <br />
<br />
What I'm looking for is a mob with good DPS but isnt too hard to get to (something outside would be perfect, like POD if he hasnt been changed in the last couple of years) so we can get our clerics and a tank there to practice the CH chain so when we do it for real they will be on the same page and be comfortable. <br />
<br />
I know it would seems easy enough to those that have done it before, but I'd like for them to get comfortable so they don't blow it during the real thing. Thanks for the help guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Secs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Take your guild to the Rathe Arena, buff your guild, and have all your melee beat on your MT, and let your clerics use a CH rotation to keep him up.  Pretty much the easiest thing to do without a CR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Vindi.<br />
<br />
He's the first true &quot;CH chain&quot; mob any guild will ever encounter.  Assuming you have a warrior with 6k+ HP buffed, the perfect rotation on vindi would be 4 seconds.... if you only have 3 clerics, having one start, the next person count to five, and the third person also count to five, followed by them clicking CH every time it pops up will work, but you'd most likely need a spam healer unless your tank is of Ssra/VT level.<br />
<br />
There's also the added benefit of also learning about rampage.  Make sure you have someone able to withstand regular damage tag him on incoming.  Then designate a druid or two to keep that person healthy. As long as they don't die, you have rampage locked on that person.  If he does, then whoever was the next person to enter the agro list (sequentially) becomes rampage.<br />
<br />
I've Rampage tanked Vindi using self heals and lived till about 10% health...Also RTed Emperor Ssraezha (but had some help once the druids realized I wasn't gonna drop until I ran out of mana :p)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">1st set up a clr chat channel<br />
<br />
2nd Have your clrs make this hot button.<br />
/sit off<br />
/cast #  (# being the spell slot that they have CH in)<br />
/1 ch on == %T ==   SOANDSO your next X seconds<br />
<br />
Have the clrs do rot by Alfa order. This way they will know always where they are in the rot and will be able to quickly set up the rot. Now you can just have your MT standing there to test it. Have someone watching the chat and counting it off to make sure they stay in the proper order and second's intervuals. Once they have that down good. Have a second tank also stand there and practice switching off. This will help for when the MT goes down and they have to goto plan B. Also have them use mod rods and such so they they get use to that to. And have them count how meny CH's they can cast befor OOM. This will help you find any weak links clr that may go oom befor the fight is over and you can be prepared for it. Something eals you can do is have them start the rot on tank A. After a few time though call out that the MT is down and to switch. Do this a few times and call the switch randomly. If all goes wel the chat should look like this.<br />
<br />
ClrA tells chat, Casting CH on Z CLRB your next 4 seconds.<br />
(1-2-3-4)<br />
ClrBtells chat, Casting CH on == z == CLRC your next 4 seconds<br />
(1-2-3-4)<br />
ClrC tells chat, Casting CH on ((((  Z  ))) CLRD your next 4 seconds.<br />
(1-2-3-4)<br />
ClrD tells chat, CH on .... Z ... CLRA yoru next 4 seconds.<br />
<br />
Notice that for the target each clr used a diffrent way of saying the target. Each clr haveing a uniqe call can help. The main thing is that they watch for thire own name has XXXX your next.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">While true what Grizlor said about Vindi, if you can kill him, you can take on about 12 Ragefires at once.  He's not quite the mob you're looking for to &quot;practice&quot; on.<br />
<br />
I like Secs idea about Arena fighting, or you could go find some trash mobs in PoP that should be similar to Rage's DPS without too much hunting around.  You didn't say what levels and flags everyone has.<br />
<br />
Something not mentioned that I know our clerics use is /pause in their hotkeys.  This takes out most of the human factor and allows even those that can't count to 4 to be able to be a part of the chain.  Each number represents a tenth of a second, I believe, or thereabouts.  So /pause 40 will do you for the 4 seconds.  Lag and ping times can have an impact on the timing, though, so test them out in chat a few times first.<br />
<br />
Then you just hit the button when it's your turn and salivate until your next time around.<br />
<br />
Snugglegutz gives a lot of good practice advice above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Try doze in HoT.  Slowable, a decent warrior can tank him with just 1 cleric easily.  Just don't slow him, and let the clerics work.  And if you happen to die, oh well, you're fighting him practically next to the zone in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Try doze in HoT.  Slowable, a decent warrior can tank him with just 1 cleric easily.

<br />
I think Dozekar is too hard. Does he not also require clickys because of dispell and careful positioning?<br />
<br />
Va Dyn (Akheva) is doable by one group with 1 cleric, but my old guild (mostly sub 60) did him raid-style all the time.<br />
<br />
Other than that, many of the epic quests have good practice mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think Dozekar is too hard. Does he not also require clickys because of dispell and careful positioning?<br />
<br />
Yeah, you'll need a clicky to keep buffs up, but that's not too tough to attain (get a gob earring or something for the main tank).  We've killed Doze with as little as 5 people, just pull him up to the ledge and the clerics can avoid AE.  If you really want CH chain testing, just pull him up and let the warrior solo it until the clerics go oom, wouldn't even require the whole guild to come.<br />
<br />
Named drakes are decent in HoT as well, if your tanks are under-equipped.  They hit about like Tier3 PoP mobs, maybe weaker, but with a good bit more HP.<br />
<br />
You might also try Velketor, he stops to cast a lot, so your chain doesn't even have to be that tight, he'll pause enough himself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Personally I have found that /pause in CH macros do more harm then good in the long run. For a long time I 2 boxed a clr in CH chains and I tried a few. And there is just to much that can go wrong. Lets say you set up a maccro that will cast 3 Ch's on a 12 second timer. Any button pushing monkey could use this right? wrong :( Your monkey pushes button #1 like it is sapost to and now knows that he has nothing to do for the next 36 seconds. So he proptly goes back to eatting his nanner, or watching the pretty lights on the screen. While your monkey is doing that what happens if one of the CHes fizzels? MT dosent get Ched. What if your monkey dosent count his 3 Ches and repush button #1? I feel it is much better to have someone sitting there staring at the chat window going. Push 1-2-3-4 Push 1-2-3-4 Push 1-2-3-4 ect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>EQOracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">One time we where messing around and the clerics began practicing CH chain on a &quot;drowning&quot; warrior. It was quite amusing, and he didnt die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Priest of Discord is what my guild practices their CHeal chains on.<br />
<br />
most all melee damage, predictable and no other agro problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Try this - in AR, Va'dynn. He has decent dps, it's all melee, no rampage but does flurry, and high hps. he's slowable, but that's not what ya want. You should pull him, and debuff him(but no slow) and have your clerics practice CH chain on him. When they start gettin LoM, you can slow va'dynn and keep up MA yourself.<br />
<br />
The only trouble is being able to find him up.<br />
<br />
You could also try the rhags in ssra if you can fnid them up. Rhag 1 and 2 would be good for practicing CH line on, I think 1 is unslowable</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Devnull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">As far as 'practicing' on Vindi, Velketor, Dozekar, etc, forget about it.<br />
<br />
I think some of the posters missed the bit where Breakin is &quot;waiting till we're strong enough to take down Ragefire&quot;. I think your best bet is to follow Secs' advice about the arena to get your CH chain down.<br />
<br />
The problem that you may run into with Rage (depending on your levels and resists) is that your CH chain and Main Tank rotation can be screwed up by his fear. You can generally avoid having your clerics feared by utilizing proper mob positioning, but that's a whole 'nother skill for your guild to work on.<br />
<br />
For at least your first run or two at him, it might be very worthwhile to have a few high level folks standing by to finish him off in case you fail. That way you get an opportunity to learn the encounter, but if something goes wrong you have a safety net and your cleric still gets his or her epic. I dunno what server you're on, but there're usually some kind (or bored!) folks who would be willing to come help you guys out. If you're on the Nameless I can help put together a support squadron for ya. The more cleric epics that are around, the better, I say!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If you want to train for Ragefire - train in the reaistic environment.<br />
Unslowed guardian wurms in SF have nearly Ragefire's dps, and you fight them at the same spot as you would fight rage.  This way you get a feel for the spot, the way the adds path etc.<br />
And, if things go wrong, just slow the mob and recover.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'll echo what others have said about Va'dynn.  If your MA has 6.5-8k buffed HP, is a warrior and some AAs then Va'dynn is an awesome practice mob that drops some decent loot for your level, plus key parts to VT that your guild may some day be ready for to save the farming later.  Another awesome part of this is it's great practice for the pull team and CC.  This is a straight CH chain mob with some decent damage output and no suprises.  He's slowable and the CR isn't too tough with a rogue, SK, or necro nearby.  My guild (pre-elemental, pre-VT, totally casual, non-uber) one group him whenever we find him up to get bits for the VT key and to try for the neck piece our MA wants.  If you master your system, this becomes a trivial encounter.  If not, you'll wipe.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how others do this encounter, but if you consult the AR map, we buff at zone in, invis to the second intersection, park in the corner between the hallway we came up and the hallway leading to Va'dynn, get pets and start pulling all the roamers and hall mobs with the SK puller keeping 2-4 in camp at any given time.  SK pulls and MAs, I off tank/CC adds slowing everything.  We pull Va'dynn and take him in the corner with the MA's back against the wall and the pets and rogue coming in behind Va'dynn.  We don't get many adds at all here and positioning is easy.  I'd slow Va'dynn the first couple times JUST to get the hang of it on a 5-6 second rotation depending on your MA.  He's got a truckload of HPs so take it easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Fibonacci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">We did Cazul for our first practice.  Not a challange at all but was more of a revenge thing for some of the older people.  The tank is never in any real danger and with Cazul's regen rate the fight will last as long as you care to drag it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Assuming you all have POP:<br />
I'd practice on Vydaz the Shade in Plane of Nightmare. (spelled something similar to that)<br />
<br />
On my server he is up most the time, you can run and look before you fight to him to make sure he is up. The zone is easy to get to.<br />
<br />
It's a good lil &quot;raid&quot; and exp to fight through the hobgoblin caves to him and you can practice CH's on him all you want. Plus his loots might not be too bad for your guilds level as upgrades.<br />
<br />
He is unslowable, and 1 group killable for good 65's, but the plataue he is on is a nice space to practice fight. Positioning is not a problem, and there is no AE's or adds to contend with. No tricky pulls to deal with.<br />
<br />
He has some ok HP's so you can run your clerics OOM if they want lots of practice, if you hold back some of your DPS. Can practice tank switches , etc.<br />
<br />
If things go south and the tank dies, you can easily camp a cleric, rez and try again. No adds to worry about. Worst case scenario, there is a GY.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Scowler McHowler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I would recommend Taskmaster Aboytt in Greater Divide.  He is part of the Circlet of Falinkan quest and is usually up.  He has about 100k hitpoints and hits for about 275 maximum.  Takes awhile ot kill this guy so the clerics get lots of practice.<br />
<br />
Scowler McHowler</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">We use /pauses in the heal chain all the time.  If your worried about fizzles, you just have 2 lines of /cast CHGem.  If one fizzles then the other will immediatly cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>breakin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Wow guys, thanks for all the super suggestions. Just for reference the character that would most definatly be there are:<br />

57 Cleric<br />

61 Cleric<br />
58 Rogue<br />
57 Pally<br />
61 Chanter<br />
57 Warrior<br />
52 Bard<br />
<br />
Plus a mix of others who are about 52 or 53 average level. Main problem with our guild is we are a bit DPS short and most of our tanks are still &lt;52.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kunderu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">This is taken from my alts guild website...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
For those of you who have never done a chain heal and don't know how to make the hot key for it.. :<br />
<br />
<br />
Go to socials and open up a blank macro..  add the following :<br />
<br />
Line #1<br />
Complete Heal to %T<br />
<br />
<br />
Line #2<br />
/cast  (add the number for the spell slot your complete heal spell is in,  one being at the top eight being at the bottom. <br />
<br />
Line #3<br />
/pause 100  ( number for pause will be changed according to the mob and how long or short a pause you want between heals.. 10 = one second so 100 = ten seconds. <br />
<br />
Line #4<br />
GO (name of person who is next in line in chain) GO !!  &lt; you can ad lib here as long as the next persons name is clear. &gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Here is what mine looks like :<br />
<br />
Complete heal to %T<br />
/cast 6<br />
/pause 100<br />
Go! --Name-- Go!<br />
<br />
<br />
Usually a heal channel is made.. to make this easy to read during a raid make a separate text box for it by right clicking the top of your chat screen and making a new window. Make it so that only this channel is going into that window. If you haven't done this play with it in your spare time and see how it works. <br />
To make the text go into this channel and be seen in the window you have made for it.. Add  /# of the channel at the beginning of the two lines with text., line 1 and 4.  <br />
<br />
i.e.     /4 Complete Heal to %t<br />
         /cast 6<br />
        /pause 100<br />
        /4 Go --Name-- Go..  !!<br />
<br />
The number 4 is just an example.. set it according to what the heal channel is for you.   The number 6 after cast is where mine is. .. make sure you use the number for the spell slot that YOU have complete heal in. <br />
<br />
Here is also a suggestion to rid ones self of the fizzle monster:<br />
<br />
I would also recomend instead of a single line of  /cast #,  using several, for example:<br />
<br />
Complete heal to %T<br />
/cast 6<br />
/cast 6<br />
/cast 6<br />
/pause 100<br />
Go! --Name-- Go!<br />
<br />
This will eliminate the chance of having a fizzle interruption or other interruptions of any kind (toon moving, etc) that could mess up the heal chain.  If the First one goes off without a problem you'll only receive 2 msgs saying you cant cast at this time etc...  but it will not interrupt the chain.  Sometime that first fizzle (even when very rare) can make the difference.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
