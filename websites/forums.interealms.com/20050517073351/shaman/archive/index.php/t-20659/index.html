<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SisterLi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings:<br />
<br />
I took a break from the game about the time LDON was first released, and hence am catching up.<br />
<br />
I'm looking for information on LDON raids.  I need basic info:<br />
<br />
1.  How long do they last?<br />
2.  How many folks are required to start 1?<br />
3.  What loot drops in them?<br />
4.  What do you get for winning?  <br />
<br />
I also need strategy info:<br />
<br />
1.  What can we expect?  How hard is it to win?<br />
2.  What are the easiest dungeons?  What are the hardest?<br />
3.  Any general strategy info<br />
<br />
Please link any good discussions that you recall.  I'll update this message with links as they come in.<br />
<br />
Please also offer any advice.  I'm thinking of taking a group of guildies in who rarely raid.  <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rubitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Can give you the basics.<br />
<br />
every person in raid<br />
   lvl 60+ required <br />
   2+ wins in that camp required<br />
<br />
raid as a whole<br />
   18-36 members<br />
   63 average lvl raid required<br />
<br />
(think im forgeting something..)<br />
<br />
The raids range from vt to time difficulty.<br />
<br />
doing a search on &quot;ldon raid&quot; here will bring up a number of posts with information.  additional information i know can be found in the forums at www.scienceofwar.net.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">****Disclaimer I dont do LDoN Raids and so 99% of what I sayis from talking with friends and reading up the topic from the NUMEROUS other threads available****<br />
<br />
Considering you are &quot;thinking of taking a group of guildies in who rarely raid&quot;  It makes the answers really really simple...<br />
<br />
1. How long do they last?<br />
-- Roughly 3 1/2 minutes for the whole group to get slaughtered by the mobs that are sitting RIGHT there as you zone in.  They hit for 1400 unslowable with 120k hp just chewing up every person as they zone in one at a time.<br />
<br />
2. How Many to start one?<br />
-- Hrm... 18 to start one I think.<br />
<br />
3. What drops<br />
-- Elemental Gear+-<br />
<br />
4. What do you get for winning?<br />
-- Adventure points and loot.<br />
<br />
1. What can you expect, how hard.<br />
-- See answer #1 above.  If you bring friends that don't raid you'll have zero fun at all as you get rolled over.<br />
<br />
2. What are the easiest dungeons?<br />
-- Not sure Think Guk or Ruj was supposed to be the easiest and by easiest it can be done by a guild that can do VT and Elemental Planes.<br />
<br />
3. General strategy info?<br />
-- After you smoke your way to EP and through VT head on over to LDoN raids.  It can be done with lots of trial and error by a guild less equipped but you dont seem too interrested in trial and error.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SisterLi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks Rubit, appreciate the information.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, search is not your friend in this case.<br />
<br />
A search for &quot;LDON Raid&quot; with a limit being placed on just looking at the title gives you 2 posts.<br />
<br />
LDoN Time Raid Armor - Which asks &quot;what drops?&quot; and doesn't get much of an answer.<br />
<br />
The second post is:<br />
<br />
Anyone raiding LDoN much???? no, seriously -- This post isn't that helpful overall.<br />
<br />
Of course, if you search for &quot;LDON Raid&quot; anywhere in the message, you seem to get every message that mentions either &quot;LDON&quot; or &quot;raid&quot; anywhere in the message.  Clicking on &quot;advanced search options&quot; tells you that they've not been written yet.  I've not been able to find a way to get the search engine to look for the phrase &quot;LDON Raid&quot; as opposed to just showing me any message that has either LDON or raid in it somewhere.<br />
<br />
At any rate, I appreciate your courtesy in answering my question.  Wish there were some way to search, but haven't been able to work it out yet.  <br />
<br />
To confirm - are you talking about raids on the &quot;Normal&quot; level?  I expected Hard raids to be very difficult, but hoped that &quot;normal&quot; level raids would be a nice training ground.  <br />
<br />
Gorgos - You sir, are an ass.  Ignorance should not be confused with stupidity.  The former is easily cured. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>GandarrTheletch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You  may think he's an ass, but he's dead on correct.  Taking a group of folks that rarely raid into one of these is going to be a very un-fun evening for you all.   Btw, he was referring to the Normal settings for these, they are just much harder than any other type of LDoN.   Unless you are doing at least VT or Elementals, plan on getting smoked.  My guild has been in Time for a while, and we just hardly ever bothered with these, as the risk versus reward just wasn't worth it.<br />
<br />
Heck, these are about as hard as getting Kodtaz flagged in GoD.   If you want to challenge yourself, I'd do the newer content and get folks flagged for Kodtaz, if you can handle the LDoN raids you can probably do GoD stuff, and the loot there is much better.<br />
<br />
Regardless, please post back with your results and let others know how you fared.... as you said, there's little info posted about these.   Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Unforunately, Gorgos is pretty correct.<br />
<br />
You are going to want a full raid of 36 people, all of them level 65.  In order to participate, each of these 36 people will need two wins in the theme you want to do.<br />
<br />
No loot drops until the very end, and you get 6 loots (might vary from theme to theme but 6 is average) - a mixture of real loots and augs.  Augs are stuff like +25ac, +speed of mithaniel, +50hp, etc... Click my magelo and look at my earring (not grimel) for an example of normal level loot.  Hard level loot is much better, but honestly you aren't going to be beating one of those any time soon.<br />
<br />
When you win you get the loot (it is in chests) and 30 adventure points (YAY).  Raids vary in length.  Ruj hard raid has a 4 hour timer, and you need all 4 hours.  Mistemoore normal is I think 3 hours?  They vary from 2-4 hours, mainly.  I think one of them might have been 90 minutes.  Oftentimes, you'll have a list of subgoals to accomplish in the raid, and you will only have a set amount of time to do it.  For example, after you kill miniboss1, you might only have 30 minutes to kill miniboss2 or else you fail, even though the timer says 155 minutes left.  The only way to figure out these timers is guess and check (oh by the way you can only do each theme once per week).<br />
<br />
Also, some themes (mistemoore hard for certain and I think mistemoore normal - other themes as well but not sure which) have a death limit.  I don't know what the limit is but basically, if your raid wipes twice, you lose.  This can be helpful because quite often it is impossible to CR and without hitting the death limit you'd have to wait 3 hours for your corpses to pop (mistemoore hard is a good example of this - good luck getting out of the entrance room).<br />
<br />
As for strategy:<br />
<br />
What you can expect:  Failure, Frustration, Anger, and raw loathing Hatred - in more or less that order.  Mobs hit extremely hard, although they usually don't have that many hitpoints.  You will have only vague clues (or sometimes none at all) as to what to do and you will have to try repeatedly to figure out what you are supposed to do, and then you will have to try several more times to successfully execute it.  Get used to seeing &quot;YOU HAVE FAILED&quot; pop up on your screen for no appearant reason.  Also expect all kinds of cool gimmicks: mobs that spawn on top of your raid if you aren't standing in a hallway, a gauntlet filled with 99 mobs that hit for 5k each and you have to figure out the trick to despawn them, mobs that ignore you when you attack them and instead run away like feared, coming back with a dozen friends.  And of course, prepare to experience the nostalgia of AE FEAR.  It's just as fun as you remember.<br />
<br />
The easiest dungeon imho is mistmoore normal.  It isn't too bad.  Basically you just clear through a dungeon, and then clear three wings at the end.  Then, three bosses spawn simultaneous, one in each wing.  Go in and engage all three bosses at the same time.  They're easy.  One flurries, one ramps, and one spawns adds.  I can't remember which is which.<br />
<br />
That's all the info I can remember about LDoN.  I tried to block most of it from my memory.  My closing advice is this:  skip ldon raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SisterLi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Gandarr:<br />
<br />
Whether he is correct or not does not change the tone of his post.  I asked a question because I was having difficulty in obtaining the answer through other means.  It's possible to provide the same information without being an ass.  <br />
<br />
The tone of the message board is set by folks who respond to posts.  If this response is any indication, than the tone of The Crucible has changed a lot in the last 2 years.  You may not notice it if you've been with it all along, as the change may have been gradual.  But if you stopped checking the Crucible and recently came back, the change is very noticable.  <br />
<br />
Thanks for confirming the &quot;normal&quot; v. &quot;hard&quot; setting. <br />
<br />
Jinheim:<br />
<br />
Appreicate the info.  Specific, first-person examples are always helpful.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">LDoN raids suck. They are hard to organize and very difficult to win. CR's are no fun (make sure everyone binds as close to the zone in as possible). I agree with previous posters, don't even waste yer time thinking about LDoN Raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You are going to want a full raid of 36 people, all of them level 65.  In order to participate, each of these 36 people will need two wins in the theme you want to do.<br />
<br />
This is specially important, because there's no difference in difficulty if you have 18 people or 36 people.<br />
<br />
Also, there are death limits, and once it's reached, you get the failure message (you also get ported out).  It appears to be a huge limit for normal settings, and happened to us once, but seemed it was buggy.  In hard, a wipe-and-a-half, and we failed.<br />
<br />
Now, my guild has tried each theme, and we never had mobs greet us at the zone in.  Mobs can/are close though, so becareful wandering around.  On our very first LDON raid, however, our raid leader accidently chose Hard setting (MM theme) and nobody thought anything about it.  Mobs did greet us in the zone in with 1k+ quads.  That wasn't fun.<br />
<br />
For normal setting raids:<br />
<br />
MM- We have this down pat.  The rewards, in my opinion are the better well-rounded ones compared to the others.  The mummies are immune to slow, with exception to the named mummy final boss.  Most of the other mobs don't mitigate slow, but nearly needs the &quot;works&quot; to land a slow.<br />
<br />
Guk- Only tried once.  A gnome greeted us and judging by his words and setup, we had to say some phrases to get stuff going.  Maybe we were dumb, but we just couldn't figure it out, so we left &gt;&lt;.<br />
<br />
Mirigul's- Only tried once.  Kind of an interesting setup.  A boss-type mob sends his minions to attack you in waves.  We didn't get too far though.   This is where we got a failure message due to deaths, but seemed pretty buggy.  We had some people unable to zone back in, despite us still inside.  Eventually all of us did after some more deaths. <br />
<br />
Ruj- Did it only once.  We had issues with mobs appearing and running off.  Some mobs you couldn't do anything to.  I'm sure it's scripted to be so, but we gave up, not to mention it was only 3 groups of us messing around for fun.<br />
<br />
North Ro- We &quot;won&quot; twice.  It's real buggy.  You pretty much kill everthing, including special traps that spawn loads of critters.  Reason for the quotes is, near the end, the last few mobs were under the world.  GM's wouldn't/couldn't (mostly because no real GM's around) do anything and only told us to bug report it.  Both times we had about over an hour to spare.<br />
<br />
Personally I like LDON raids.  It's something for us to do once in a while to change the scenery.  But most don't seem to work for us, and only create headaches.  There are some really nice rewards.</div></div><hr />

My group is by no means Uber that I raid with but we are almost Elemental Flagged now (Soon as we get RZ) and we got rolled over like we were a bunch of lvl 30s.<br />

<br />
The info you gave was nice, but way to broad to be very helpful.  In general, conclusions that do not show the work done to reach them are not very helpful.   It could have been more helpful if it were more specific.  For example - the zoning in to many unslowable mobs that hit for 1300.  That's useful info that helps me determine whether or not to do an LDON raid.  A general conclusion delivered with sarcasm isn't helpful, in part because knowing next to nothing of the person delivering it, I cannot evaluate it's accuracy.  <br />
<br />
The information you offered was not by nature offensive, It was the tone of your post itself that was rude.  It had a &quot;go away kid, you're bothering us raiding shaman&quot; aura about it.<br />
<br />
The opening starts with a reference to &quot;NUMEROUS other threads available&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, I tried the search function.  It didn't work.  I've not seen links to the numberous other threads, so I presume that others are also having trouble finding them.  As I explained in my original post, I was not around when these topics were first being posted and discussed.  I don't think you tried the search function before typing.  <br />
<br />
The format in which you conveyed your information seemed to be &quot;you're too pathetic to make it through this raid.&quot;  This impression was sealed by your last comment &quot;-- After you smoke your way to EP and through VT head on over to LDoN raids. It can be done with lots of trial and error by a guild less equipped but you dont seem too interrested in trial and error&quot;<br />
<br />
If you did not intend your post to sound as snotty as it did, then I'm happy to accept your apology.  It's easy for humor and sarcasm to take a post places the poster did not intend it to go.<br />
<br />
But I read your post as an attempt to deliver a slap down and I called you on it.  In rereading it I'm not convinced that my initial impression was inaccurate.<br />
<br />
Negative rep points?  What is this?  A new board feature?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
SisterLi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">&quot;I read your post as an attempt to deliver a slap down and I called you on it. In rereading it I'm not convinced that my initial impression was inaccurate&quot;<br />
<br />
Nope you are right on the money... if you cant get to EP you probably have no business trying LDoN Raids.  *shrug* Think I mentioned how my group is almost into EP and got smoked twice.  Thus if you are not even to that point, chances are you will get smoked even faster.  (My opinion, dont like it? Prove me wrong, that would rock to hear how a lower group can do them through strategy)  Really sorry you are offended that I'm telling you that your group probably cant win with all these things stacked against you but dont shoot the messanger.<br />
<br />
Pretty funny when folks say am an ass for making it so cut and dry and accidently use sarcasm.<br />
<br />
I missed it, but my raid group decided to try the LDoN Raids a few more times and see how they can do (even knowing they would fail).  They just wanted to see for them selves and you know what.... they did better.  They say we have a real shot at beating them after a few more fails.  That is where I was going with the fact that try try try and try again even if you arent as well equiped as who the Raids were designed for (Elemental folks) you can do it but it just takes practice.<br />
<br />
Keep us informed on how you guys do, we're all interrested to hear about less equipped folks doing what the ubers can do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Greetings:<br />
I'm looking for information on LDON raids.  I need basic info:<br />
<br />
1.  How long do they last?<br />
2.  How many folks are required to start 1?<br />
3.  What loot drops in them?<br />
4.  What do you get for winning?  <br />
<br />
1. Varries but as people have said expect several hours min once you get started.<br />
2. 18 to start I beleive but your crazy to try them with anything less than the max of 36. Can't add more people once you start and you will need everyone.<br />
3. Haven't personally gotten any but most of it is at the ok level with the only good thing about it being multiple slots usually including a slot 3. Nothing other than random augment drops which are the same as you'd get on an ldon hard untill you actually win the whole event.<br />
4. Haven't actually finished one but reportedly multiple drops of both items and augments.<br />
<br />
I also need strategy info:<br />
<br />
1.  What can we expect?  How hard is it to win?<br />
2.  What are the easiest dungeons?  What are the hardest?<br />
3.  Any general strategy info<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Depends on the adventure. All the adventures seem to have some sort of trick to them. Expect to fail several times just figuring out what you actually have to do. Often times it seems to involve splitting up the raid and killing 2 or 3 mobs at once.<br />
2. Personally only tried one of the tak raids. Was suppose to be a VT level raid or one of the easier ones. Ruj and MM are suppose to have some easier ones too. My understanding is each raid npc gives a specific raid and that it's only at 1 difficulty level. Which npc you talk to determines what you get.<br />
3. Not really most people who have figured these out spent many hours and multiple deaths figuring them out haven't been too ready to share that hard earned info.<br />
<br />
Some examples of stuff I've heard tho.<br />
<br />
Ruj raid, the easier one, stuff hits for 800ish. Biggest trick seems to be stuff constantly takes off and runs like feared even at high health levels. Not sure how to deal with it other than just killing em fast. Heard some reports like you might have 1 minute to kill the npc before it takes off running etc. Haven't personally done this one.<br />
<br />
Tak, only one I have done, you go in clear a bunch of stuff. Clearing is a bit fun cause there are traps that spawn a bunch of beeltes (like 10). We usually ae'd them if we had a descent caster/chanter crew. Once you've cleared everything you have to split your raid up into 3 groups and move into 3 different rooms. Moving into those rooms will trigger mobs to start spawning. You'll get waves of 5 mobs hitting for 1kish. Need to kill a few waves of them and then a named will spawn. Kill all 3 named and you win the event. Problem is you end up needing a min of 3 mt's, 3 echanters etc since you split the raid 3 ways. Each pair of groups needs to be able to handle what roughly equates to a 5 mob pull on an ldon hard run.  If one set of group fails you can easily end up with alot of mobs up in the room which is pretty much unsplitable. We're an elemental flagged guild and we gave it a few tries and just gave up on this one. Just too much of a pain to try and get exactly the right people on to make the 3 sets of groups work well yet at the same time we're limited to only 36 people so turning others away.<br />
<br />
Want my personal opinion? Forget about ldon raids. Nice Idea with horrible implimentation. Can't add/replace people, too much time clearing trash, no real loot till completely successful, pretty much have to fail multiple times to figure out what your doing and can't retry them on a fail. <br />
<br />
You'd be much better off looking at GoD things. Sewer trials, Tipt/vxed, Arena event and other such things. Much more flexable and better loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>wanedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My guild was doing these back b4 God came out for somthing to do with the 6 days of the week were werent whacking the Time loot pinata. basicly what you need to know about these has been said. LDoN raids were a afterthought to the expantion, hardcore raiders were crying for more raid content and sony slaped together 3 or 4 bugged and really low quality raids per theme to shut the HCR up. <br />
<br />
The main problem with LDoN raids is even if you know what you are supposed to do and have done it before successfully there is no reason a random bug cant stop you from repeating that success. I belive we beat 3 of the raids after months of working on them 6 of 7 days. People hated them, our attendance droped, morale sucked, and I have 77 losses now having never lost a single 6man Ldon ever. Honestly Id rather be molested with a table leg then ever do another LDoN raid.</div></div><hr />
