<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">W00t I had my wizard bound in TT so that i could port the rangers i hire to track my yun shamans. Last night i ported a friend and gated thinkign i was bound in nexus. A mage was in tt at zone and he was 2 boxing and said he saw a WHOLE bunch of yun on track. He killed oen and I got my powder. Very nice guy.<br />
<br />
Now this however pisses me off i spent countless hours in TT i died i wasted money  on trackers at one time i had a druid and 2 rangers combing the zone half an hour straight all at the same time and NO YUN.<br />
Now i randomly pop by and there are saveral.<br />
Well I am level 44 and i finally got it i am happy.<br />
Heh was a good day cause I got a reif too /dance<br />

They are kos to virtually all the mobs that roam the area.  I believe this to be the reason they seem so rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Maybe in this case the frogs took control and overwhelmed the other mobs in that particular area. This is either a rare occurrence or a recent change, cause like Ronax said usually the frogs are the ones who get made scarce</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Y'know, the same thing happened to me. My druid friend had 10 on track, when we had never seen *any* before, after hunting for them for absolutely ages. <br />
<br />
I dunno, but maybe they did something about this in the last patch?</div></div><hr />
