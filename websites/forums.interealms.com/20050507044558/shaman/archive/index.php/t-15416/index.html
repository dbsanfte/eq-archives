<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild is trying to get past this wonderful battle. I would like to hear some opinions on what Shamans should be doing during the fight.<br />
<br />
I'm assuming that we can start by stacking some dots onto RZ and unleashing the puppies/pet before the adds spawn, then switching to defensive add control - rooting any loose boars that we see.<br />
<br />
How much healing/curing do you find yourselves doing during this fight?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Two options basically, and IMO it depends on what part of the script is causing your raid the most trouble.  You can Go all out DPS and nuke/DoT/Rain or you can help the CC by slowing, split tanking, rooting adds.  It sounds like you have the right idea in your situation though.<br />
<br />
The whole script kinda spirals downhill with each mistake you make.  Let an add or two get loose and they can kill off some clerics or CC people early on which is obviously bad.  Put too much emphasis on CC and not enough DPS, then you won't kill him fast enough and get too many adds for your CC crew...<br />
<br />
I'd say you're probably on the right track, toss some DoTs on him early, send in the dogs, and then get to work on Crowd Control.  If things are under control, don't hesitate to toss some nukes and refresh DoTs as able.  <br />
<br />
Before the fight, don't forget to nab as many melee with FA as you can.  Every little bit of extra DPS will help you out here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Or you could heal the MT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, my guild has made it to RZTW three times so far.  Our first try, we failed at 47% (he got pulled on to clerics at 80% and killed 2/3 of them with ae rampage).  Second and third tries we whomped his ass.  With only three tries, though, my experience is a little limited.<br />
<br />
Here's my job during the RZTW fight:  When we first get in pit, I help all the chanters and druids charm mobs from the pigpen, by casting malosinia on them all.  Once we pull RZTW, my first job obviously is to slow him - turgur's will partially land, not too resistant.  Once that is done, I blast heal the MT for a bit until I am sure the clerics have the healing under control.  Once that is done, I make myself busy casting quiescence and blast healing any melees or clerics that might have gotten hit with the AE dot or that have been AE rampaged.<br />
<br />
My guild leaves kiting to the knights and rangers.  The first and second tries, I would throw a slow at any adds that were attacking our healers and try to kite it away, but it never worked out well for me.  I can do a passable job of it, but it really is better leave it up to the melees who aren't that useful otherwise and can take a lot more beating than I can.  I feel that I contribute more by healing melees.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You can actually do several different things on him and still do good. Disease, poison and cold all land well on RZtWL. When he's first pulled, I cast swarm pets on his back side to push him into corner (as well as other swarm pet casters). Then I  Malos, Slow and Cripple (or we split those jobs up between the shamans). Then I land Ultor and Saryrn.<br />
<br />
By the time all that's done, the adds are about to spawn. If they aren't up yet, I toss in a Velium Strike or 2 on RZ. Since I have Fury of Magic 3 and an ID 4 item, I can get pretty good damage out of my cold DD. Once adds are up, I try to malos, slow and root as many wraiths as I can. Don't root boars. Snare them, charm them and have them attack RZ. Rooting them will prevent this. Also, always use Petrifying Earth on the wraiths, for 2 reasons. It's the only root we have with a resist modifier (meaning it's harder to resist), and also it lasts a &lt;b&gt;really&lt;/b&gt; long time if the mob is malos'd and tashed. I think it can last up to 3 minutes, and will normally last at least 1 minute with debuffs in.<br />
<br />
Try to make sure you keep your dots on RZ. If CC is doing ok (unlikely) you can toss in some cold DD on RZ too. You want him to die as fast as possible. You can't control the adds forever, kill RZ as fast as humanly possible. Use your melee disciplines at about 90% on RZ. We corner him, so rangers can't use Trueshot. You probably already know about the AE, AE rampage and what to do to avoid those (buff FR, use max melee range).<br />
<br />
Stick your best nukers with bards for Rizlona's (the DD bonus song). Do everything you can to get your dps as high as possible. Ferocity and Ferine Avatar on rogues/monks, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hail,<br />
<br />
Though I have not experienced this encounter, I feel I must post to correct at least one glaring error.<br />
. Also, always use Petrifying Earth on the wraiths, for 2 reasons. It's the only root we have with a resist modifier (meaning it's harder to resist),and also it lasts a really long time if the mob is malos'd and tashed.  <br />
<br />
The bolded portions are incorrect.<br />
Greater Immobilize (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3195&amp;source=Live) also has a negative 30 resist modifier on it (and a one minute maximum duration).  If you have Scaled Avatar Leggings, I'd recommend using it first in this situation since it is mana-free &amp; you can always cast Petrifying Earth (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.htmlid=3196&amp;source=Live) (maximum duration 3 minutes) after the fact if you want too.<br />
<br />
I have never personally noticed, read, or heard that ANY root spell will LAST LONGER just because a mob is debuffed with the Tashx or Malox line of spells before casting any form of root.  Magic-based spells will LAND easier (I.E. be resisted less) after a mob has been debuffed, but the root duration as far as I'm aware has nothing to do with how well or badly the mob has been debuffed.  If you have information to the contrary, I would be interested in hearing it.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cirin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Everytime we've done the event, we shamans debuff first then switch to patching, and CC/kiting as needed (or as we can). No real one thing to recommend after hes debuffed...RZtW fight is always a little (ok, lot hehe) gonzo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Mobs make a check against the root to break it every tick. Lower their resists, the root lasts longer. This has been public knowledge for years now.<br />
<br />
The great part about petrifying earth is that ever since I got it, it is really quite rare for a mob to break root early (unless I nuke it). The reason why this is so is the resist penalty intrinsic to the spell.<br />
<br />
TashX/MalX most definitely improve the duration of roots (not beyond max of course).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Haha I missed it... adding</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If you are in the CC part, then malo, slow, and root stuff.<br />
If you are in the RZTW kill part, then malo, slow, cripple, dot and AE rain poison and FA if you have mana and spell slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have never personally noticed, read, or heard that ANY root spell will LAST LONGER just because a mob is debuffed with the Tashx or Malox line of spells before casting any form of root<br />
<br />
that is wrong;  if you have a chance to root/dot solo at PoFire, you will easily see how big differece after debuff<br />
<br />
<br />
for RZTWL, you basical don't need take care about add unless raid nearly wipe, CC team ususlly can control 1-5 add and if there are more then raid usually wipe <br />
<br />
I ususlly cover about 5 melee with FA before pull(add more after pull), then busy with debuff, dot; and mem 2 rain + 1 poison nuke to chain rain it for dps untill 10% then nuke; during this time I do some catch heal or slow the mob near camp that control by CC team</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>UloffBigkev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It really depends on how you do the RZtWL event. As Shamam said, (seeing as he's in my guild) our CC is done near the clerics. Basically, we have 1 kiter chain, any mobs that come to camp are dealt with by the CC team who are standing with the clerics. We have SK's drag mobs back to the kiters path as well. Other than that, the fight is all about DPS. (And we need a lot seeing as we do the event with about 50 people or so.) So, it's stack as many DoT's as you can on Mr Zek, FA damage dealers and spot heal then dance the funky chicken when he falls over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well shamans on our RZtW raids mainly spot heal and cure the AoE dots and add whatever DPS.<br />
<br />
Also we heal the clerics on rotation, kiters or any melee that is down on HP and come to the &quot;heal&quot; area.<br />
<br />
We make sure we kill RZtW withing 2 mins so we only need to handle to spawns of adds and so far it has worked a treat.<br />
<br />
hope this helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Ya.  The way the RZTW event is scripted, it's pretty lame IMO.<br />
It's all about &quot;do as much damage as possible&quot;.<br />
It's just a zerg fight doing as much damage as you can before the adds overwhelm you.<br />
I'd much rather have the RZTW fight be like Saryn's fight or like TT.<br />
I'd rather see it *possible* to kill off the adds as they spawn and take down RZTW when the adds are dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Malaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I am generally in the cleric group myself, curing them in case one of them doesnt resist the AE (pretty rare). It is also one of the very few mob i don't patch heal the MT but i go nuts on DPS. <br />
<br />
RZTWL is all about DPS anyway. Which is lame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Etadanik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">There used to be a cap on the number of adds that can spawn, which made CC a possible alternative, though still not as great as just getting 70+ people and killing RZTW as fast as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yeah Rallos is all about DPS. Kill him fast or you will loose period. The rate at which the adds spawn is too fast to be handled you just have to keep them busy long enough for you to kill rz, so they stop spawning and then turn everyone to handling the adds.<br />
<br />
Rains/dots can add a fair amount dps on him since he isn't very resistant. I'd personally stick with your 1 best poison dot since you really can risk over aggroing him and pulling him out of position. Then I'd just chain cast our 2 poison rains and maybe add poison nuke in there.<br />
<br />
Alternatively you can go for the indirect dps. FA on the melee's to boost thier dps. Spot heals to keep the melee's up and doing dmg. Cures on assorted people. Using VP to root park things out of melee range that add on the raid.<br />
<br />
Either way I hate the way this encounter is setup currently. Realy this encounter is still tougher than most encounters in the elemental planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I think you can get better dps out of cold nukes than with Blood of Saryrn (especially with fury of magic 3 and a DD focus item). Plus, cold nukes generate less aggro than Blood of Saryrn. I know cold lands on RZ real well too (as does disease/poison). I usually go for cold DD and poison rains on RZ, and maybe toss an Ultor on for good measure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I drop the debuffs on RZ at the start.<br />
Once that is done, I go off to the side away from any adds and from RZ and mem Blood, Tears, and Ancient Scourge depending on how my mana is.<br />
The time it takes me to mem that gives the main tank enough time to get aggro up that my late coming dots won't pull aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Zakumara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">not sure how you guy manage to have time to do DPS during event as shaman has so much to do.<br />
<br />
First need to debuff the charmed Boar (except slow we need their DPS)<br />
Debuff any adds<br />
Debuff RTZW (including slow)<br />
Heal MT<br />
Quiessence on kiter (range of Q is not good tho)<br />
Heal MT again and again as well as watching all the CH healer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Hmm for RZTW, was debuff the pets pulled pre fight, cure the MT with RGC, Ferine Avatar the charmed pets. And heals maybe where necessary. Oh yeah and debuff RZTW, or arrange with the shamans in your channel that someone does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">We have a heal rotation to heal the main tank.<br />
RZTW is a *****.<br />
He's slowable and only hits for like 1k.<br />
Don't waste your mana healing the main tank.<br />
If your main tank needs shaman spam healing, you have some serious problems.<br />
If you are in CC group then just debuff and heal and root.<br />
If you are nore in CC group, debuff, avatar, and dot/rain the hell out of RZTW, and heal as necessary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">This thread is rather insightful.<br />
Guy asks what shaman's do on this encounter, and EVERYONE has a different answer....we are just too damn versatile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Rellix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Yeah Rallos is all about DPS. <br />
<br />
Wrong my friend.  The adds pop when he is at certain health percentages.  Yes, DPS is a factor but the fight is about crowd control, kiting, and charming.<br />
<br />
If you kill him in 30 seconds with charms then yes, DPS is important but the CC is what gets you there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Malaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">it was true before a few patches ago, now wraiths are popping in the second a corpse has popped, making it nearly impossible to avoid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Wrong my friend.  The adds pop when he is at certain health percentages.  Yes, DPS is a factor but the fight is about crowd control, kiting, and charming.<br />

<br />
When was the last time you did RZ? After the rescent changes the adds are strictly timed and quite numerous and you can't kill the corpses to prevent the wraiths. CC for this event is a keep em busy long enough to kill rz situation. If you can't kill rz quickly your CC will break down. Period. It is impossible to control the amount adds you end up with for very long. This is not like Agnarr or terris where you can deal with the adds and just drag the fight out longer.<br />
<br />
Yes the CC is important but you need RZ dead asap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Thanks for all the replies. I figure when the time comes I'll do a combination of dotting, nuking, curing, healing and CC where I think it's most needed. Simple.<br />
<br />
My guild was successful at killing RZ on the weekend, but I was unfortunately not able to be there. They won despite the 5-man kite team all dying to adds within the first wave. My guilds lead shaman grabbed agro and proceeded to kite them and successive waves for the rest of the fight. <br />
<br />
He reportedly woke up the next morning in a cold sweat after a nightmare wherein the guild decided that he would kite the adds for all future attempts on RZtWL.</div></div><hr />
