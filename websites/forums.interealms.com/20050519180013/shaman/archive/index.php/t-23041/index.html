Like some guys says in the thread....could be real...but I doubt it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">if that is true, wander what the shammys stats will be since the pally one is worse than the others right now :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i'll believe it more if i see an actual link and a screenshot.. then again those can be doctored, or just done on an emulator..  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It wouldnt actually be too amazing....here is some god stuff thats not even end game yet<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I say believe it when you loot it. Not from Missouri here, but one thing that my line of work has impressed on me, never believe anything till you see it yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">its not the fact that its hugely amazing (although the dam/delay is very nice).. its the fact that its not even an item link.. just a list of text, and no one should even KNOW the stats yet</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If the quests are as hard as the first set were when they were introduced then very few paladins will have an epic 2.0 till a year from now and it won't become common till 2 years from now. So..just sayin....keep that in mind, of course it'll be hugely uber, hardly anyone will get it for a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i know i doubt it is the real thing, but still it would be crazy to have that. since the first set of epics had the level cap of 55-60 (i think?) it was meant for around that level, now that we have Potime and GoD gear tons better at lvl 65, with the new cap increase 70, it should be better, well thats IMO.</div></div><hr />
