<p class="largefont">Click here for full thread: <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=16163">Some AA ideas for LDoN</a></p>
<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Now I of course don't think all of the ideas are impliment worthy, hell you can probibly find a reason why all of them are a bad idea, I just want to throw a few ideas out there.<br />
<br />
We all Shamans are annoyed because BL slow. I don't get it personally, but some of you are annoyed.<br />
<br />
We also know that Turgur's will probibly be the best slow we ever get, I don't see VI giving us a 80 or 85% slow anytime.<br />
<br />
But how about a few AA's to tweak our resists and mitigation of our slows.<br />
<br />
Slow Casting Reinforcment:<br />
Level 1: 3 AA's, Decresses a slows chance at being resisted by 3%<br />
Level 2: 6 AA's, 6%<br />
Level 3: 9 AA's, 10%<br />
<br />
Disease Reinforcment:<br />
Level 1, 10-15 AA's: The next disease based slow cast can NOT be resisted and NOT be mitigated, this ability will not work on any mobs Immune to slow. (So you can slow a spite golem lets say but not Vindi)<br />
Reuse time: 24 hours sounds about right.<br />
<br />
Quick Slow: Reduction of casting time on slow's or maybe eliminating the reuse time on Turgur's<br />
<br />
I really think some modified slow AA's would set us far enough apart from BLs, yes, BLs would still be a viable alternative but Shamans would have a diffrence more noticable then 10%.<br />
<br />
Rabid Bear, yes I know, dead horse.<br />
Maybe Taking on a 2000 point rune, or maybe a 50% reduction of all melle dmg done, would make it viable not only as a offensive but defensive as well, &quot;Ohh hell I caught agro from some big ass named mob, thank god RB is up, I might just survive&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It was announced we aren't getting any new AAs for LDON.  That being said:<br />
<br />
*  I would like a Detrimental spell casting haste that stacks with Solusek items to go with QB and Mithaniel focus items.<br />
<br />
* Forget hastened rabidity, I would LOVE hastened can 5 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Those are good, but if I had to pick a new AA, I'd go with double attack.  With a moderate DA skill and the right weapon, melee could at least be situationally viable again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grubnuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'l trade Rabid Bear for an AA that allows all group-based spells to effect all pets in the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Laranu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, I'd lose rabid bear for that too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No new aa's in LDoN as has been said, but my guess is there will probably be more in the next expansion. <br />
<br />
Personally I think what they need to add are racial AA's for the fun of it. <br />
<br />
For a kitty maybe improved sneak ability or very minor tracking &lt;= bard at best. <br />
<br />
Oh and while I think this is cute I know it would be way too powerful:<br />
<br />
Nine lives: Self only DI (same as spell, uses components, ect.) With like a 1 hour reuse hehe. <br />
<br />
Would love to see gnomes get tinkering mastery, races that get slam or bash get improved slam/bash ect. <br />
<br />
At least it would give some more difference between the races which would be really nice near the end game where race matters so little.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>blakkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would like to see an AA ressurection for Shaman and Druids. Nothing overpowering... Something in class, along the order of:<br />
<br />
Renewal of Spirit<br />
<br />
lv 1 3AA = 50 percent res on a 12 hour timer<br />
<br />
lv 2 6AA = 75 percent res on a 8 hour timer<br />
<br />
lv 3 9AA = 90 percent res on a 6 hour timer<br />
<br />
Maybe give it  an expensive component, like a ruby or rare drop gem, or decrease the res percents to 35, 50 75, or increase the timers to 24, 18, 12. <br />
<br />
Nothing game breaking, but that single death in the clericless exp group in the entire play session wouldn't be so disrupting....<br />
<br />
I give it a snowball's chance....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If they gave rez to shaman, Rayne would give me a black eye.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grubnuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah, I'd have to agree that giving rez to the shaman class would be a bad idea.  That's stepping on the toes of the clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">From an unbiased perspective:<br />
<br />
Necro's are able to res, using an 'expensive' stone, but they are hardly ever asked to except in emergencies.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't see an AA that can be used once every 6 RL hours as a threat to the Clerics and their 96% res epic weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I like how people always complain about our abilities being given out to other classes, but think giving us some other classes' abilities is overpowering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Change spell casting fury and its PoP advancement to something DoT-related for dotting classes like Shaman and Necros - just a random thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Really nice idea Mrens</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>skafloc1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I wouldn't mind seeing a aa skill or a new spell that allowed shaman some form of a divine aura type effect.(it wouldnt have to be anything overpowering. Perhaps a 8 minute reuse time would work <br />
<br />
We are priests after all and it would make sense that the spirits would protect us in much the same way a clerics god protects them.<br />
<br />
Atm the only da item we can use is the earring of frozen skulls and it sure comes it handy often.<br />
<br />
The idea of a self rune wouldnt be bad either.Something that is scaled below a int casters but enough to help keep us alive after a malo .slow attempt without having to immediately cast a high agro fast heal on yourself.<br />
<br />
Another idea would be to actually allow shm to further advance their melee skills .. perhaps a improved bash skill that could do more than a mere 1 point of dmg.<br />
<br />
An AA skill or a spell that added some form of proc would be interesting also perhaps something with a deagro effect similar to desperation with a small dd or dot effect?<br />
<br />
Seriously though rabid bear is a great TOY nothing more and for only one reason even with hastened rabid bear its still not a viable means of adding melee dmg consistantly it should be longer lasting or at the very least allow avatar to stack with it so we can have our 10 minutes of fun every  few hours.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Malaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hastened C5 is all i ask.<br />
<br />
However, the idea of decresing resists on turgur is great too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Here's a possible easy way to implement decreased resists - they could adjust your &quot;effective level&quot; when casting Slow spells.  So level 1 of the AA would have a level 65 casting as a level 66, level 2 would cast as a 67, level 3 would cast as a 68, or some such.<br />
<br />
Reduced reuse time on Cann V would be awesome, but likely to be considered too powerful.  Instead, I'd love to see a Cann VI that does even more damage/gives more mana than Cann V but with a proportionally longer reuse time.<br />
<br />
An AA I'd like to see is &quot;advanced Radiant Cure&quot;, which would work exactly like regular RC except it's on a different timer - i.e. you could pop an RC, then before the RC timer pops, hit ARC.  Or just reduce the reuse time on RC, whichever.<br />
<br />
Instead of a rez, which I agree would be a bit much, what I think would be cool is a &quot;spirit summon&quot;.  Cast on the corpse of someone in your group, they get ported to the body like a rez, but it's not a rez - just the transportation portion of a rez.  A rez would still need to be done on the corpse to get XP back.  In other words, if a shaman manages to camp out of a raid, they can spirit summon a cleric back to rez the raid.  Right now camping a cleric, pally, or necro is a raid-saver, this would add shaman to the list, and IMO that's not a bad thing.  Reuse time would have to be high to avoid having necro Summon Corpse + shaman Spirit Summon add up to a mage COH replacement :-)<br />
<br />
Add an AA similar to the new DOT focus effects as an AA, preferably stacking with the existing focus effects at least to some extent.<br />
<br />
An AA &quot;gate to home city&quot; ability with a long cast time, basically a soulbound spiritstone, would be a cool thing to have.  That would let you keep your bind point near Ssra or TOV, for example, and still run around soloing between raids without worrying about what to do if you bite it and end up naked at bind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only problem I see with the shaman class getting a rune, we would eat it with cann.  Due to our compulsive desire to convert hitpoints into mana, we wouldn't use it as a rune per se, we would use it save hitpoints on canning.  <br />
<br />
In that case, it's very likely that any rune we would receive would have an extremely long cast time (to prevent shaman abusing the rune for cannibalization without the risk of hitpoint loss) making it useless for the situation you describe as well as for mana regeneration.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I agree with Glorianna's first post.<br />
<br />
We need detrimental haste.<br />
We need a better faster Canni - whether it be a spell improvement or AA.<br />
Res:  please you know that's COMPLETELY unreasonable.<br />
Rune:  useless in the face of Canni.<br />
<br />
Either way we aren't getting any of the stuff we really want anytime soon.<br />
<br />
I'm quite turned off by what I've seen of our LDoN spells so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I wouldn't mind a modification of Taanan Mastery.  Let casters get a second Specialization... I would LOVE the specialization AA if I was spcialized in Conjuring... cheaper DoTs would rule.   But I won't give up my Alteration specialization for anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I really don't think we need a faster canni, 3 minutes is already awesome.<br />
Yes sometimes I find the time too long, but you have canni 4 to wait for reuse time<br />
I would like to get some AA (passive) that works with our illusion great bear, because we no longer use it ( doesn t work with horse because of illusion )<br />
so it would be like:<br />
at the final level ( I think 12 AAs: 3/4/5 )<br />
increase str, dex, agi, sta  + 20, +50ATK<br />
increase mana regen of 10 per tick, doesn t stack with meditate<br />
double attack skill 75(?), DD proc of 75 disease based<br />
we would get all these abilities at AA rank1 but with lower stats and it would increase by rank<br />
<br />
I really think it would let us get back our &quot;melee priest&quot; abilities and sounds like the line of yaulp 5/6 of clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Well, I hope Sony does get a move on and add new AA's for all classes because lots of us are at the stage of working on the &quot;worthless&quot; ones.<br />
<br />
Shaman AA's that I would like to see that would not be overpowered are:<br />
<br />
1) Some sort of detrimental spell haste<br />
2) Some sort of DOT damage crits like our DD line<br />
3) Continue the ND line for more hit points (like an advanced ND)<br />
4) Continue our healing aa's ...make them expensive though<br />
<br />
That would probably be enough for a while.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Haass Wolvesbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Can't believe no one else has come up with this, but an AA I'd really like to see could be 3/6/9 or whatever for 5, 10 and 25% better ratios on the cannabalize line (exclude cann 5 if you want, but it should definitely hit cann 4).  It would still take 148hp, but istead of giving 82 mana or whatever it would give 86, 90 and 102 mana back.  That's really the only AA I wish shammy's had.  The rest is fluff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Adinaya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">' We all Shamans are annoyed because BL slow. I don't get it personally, but some of you are annoyed. '<br />
<br />
Ok, the reason I got annoyed is not that I have anything against Beastlords but that it is another example of Beastlords being SOE's obvious favorite class, and shaman being their forgotten, troublesome child. Their new componentless 'Ferocity' spell is better than Ferine Avatar. They were handed their difficult to get spells. ( Let's not make them dropped more often or researchable, let's put them on vendors!) Personally, I love Beastlords. If I have an open spot in my group, assuming we have a healer and tank, they are always a welcome addition. I have a problem with the fact that they are getting alot of new very nice spells and abilities in addition to getting alot of our best spell lines, and we are getting stuck with regurgitated strength and charisma nonsense. We have been complaining about things like alchemy and lack of melee ability and rabid bear, etc. and we are for the most part ignored. Give them a good slow? No problem here. How about giving us Spiritual Dominion. Or Ferocity. Or a kick-arse pet. Or the melee ability. The sad thing is that alot of us thought that we were making a ranger-comparable melee with a pet and a slow when we made our shaman. That's what Beastlords turned out to be. Except their pet rocks. They melee very well. Their Spiritual Dominion line is awesome. Ferocity is phenomenal. Their Paragon AA is wonderful. Downside is...their slow is not as good...except now, it's almost as good. Before this, their slow was only 50 percent and that didn't seem too bad. They don't get strong nukes and dots? So what? They and their pets do enough DPS that they don't need them. Now, they just have it all. It's not that I want them nerfed...I just want us to have some fun too.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the hijack. Just had to get that off my chest.<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as an AA I would like them to offer us, one that comes to mind is a better invisibility. If not an aa then how about giving us an alchemy recipe for Superior Invis? Please???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Trena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Umm, really hate to be the bee in the bonnet but, the first two of your suggestions just scream 'overpowered' Mrens. As it is, you have a dev team who believes that slow is one of the biggest mistakes ever made (right up there with complete heal) because it's 'overpowered' and makes balancing encounters more difficult (even with mitigation). To a certain extent, they're right. EVERY shaman on this board can cite examples of mobs that are hard (or downright guaranteed wipes) unslowed but totally gimp once slowed. As it is now, with most mobs (I say most because mobs prior to elementals and Time are more in sheer numbers than ele/time mobs) after your typical debuffs, they're fairly easy to slow. Add those AAs (and make no mistake. If those AAs are added to the game, EVERY shaman of level to get them will grind to snatch them up ASAP) and it stands to trivialize things even further.<br />
<br />
Another possible issue is class envy. How many classes can cast slow spells (Shaman, enchanter, necro, bard, beastlord)? Now, if Shaman get that AA (or even just the slow casting reinforcement one), do you leave the other slow casting classes out?<br />
<br />
Rez? *checks her address bar* did I make a wrong turn and go to the druid board? :p (Yes, I'm joking. jeez!) Seriously, farming out other classes' abilities is EVUL. Wanna give Pox and Bane of Nife to Beastlords? How about Malos to Mages? A case can be made for both of those scenarios (i.e. Shaman is a parent class of BLs and Mages got an unresistable resist debuff slightly worse than Malo previously). Nothing good ever comes from blurring class lines and abilities.<br />
<br />
I think Hastened Cann5 would be a good idea to be added. It's Shaman specific and there's no balance reason why it's reuse couldn't/shouldn't be reduced at least some. If the AA worked like this:<br />
<br />
Hastened Cannibalization<br />
Level 1: 10% reduction in reuse time (takes it down to 62 seconds)<br />
Level 2: 15% reduction in reuse time (takes it down to 58 seconds)<br />
Level 3: 25% reduction in reuse time (takes it down to 51/52 seconds)<br />
<br />
would be a bad place to start. Hell, double the reductions (bringing reuse down to 55/48/35 seconds) and it's still an ability with a fairly sizable downside (how fast can you regen 1924hp? Using Q eats into the efficiency of cann though in a group setting with certain classes, it would be KILLER. Imagine a 35 second refreshing cann5 grouped with a BL with Paragon or a druid with spirit of the wood).<br />
<br />
Double attack? ehhhh, while a VERY compelling case could be made for adding this as an AA (Bards got it. Why not?), I honestly don't know how this would fare under playtesting. They could balance it easily using the skill cap on it. I would think that adding an AA that would allow you to raise your Dodge cap would be more useful though, wouldn't it? Bringing the dodge cap from 75 to say 125 or 150 would be more useful than double attack, I would think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I think I speak for us all when I say I'd like an AA skill that further decreases the refresh time on Rabid Bear. Right? Call it... Even More Hastened Rabidity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">MGB Shrink, give it a half hour repop so people cant grife with it and a pop up window.<br />
<br />
Cann6 (this would be best has a spell) keep the hp mana ratio close to cann4 but double the HP's taken say 300hp for 162-170mana. Point here same result from fewer casts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Sekin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I want female darkelf illusion aa</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Canni 4 is crap.  It is/was good for a time.  But any shaman in high end gear with high hps and a deep mana pool..  well Canni 4 is hardly worth the effort anymore.

OR some kind of AA to decrease the refresh timer on the Canni AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Sbag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Advanced regen would be great to have as well,in 10hps/tick increments with upto 3 bands.<br />

<br />
I don't really think a new spell along the lines you suggest is very likely.<br />
<br />
Shaman Mana regeneration isn't really something that needs to be looked at either, there are quite a few other minor things that would be more important.<br />
<br />
Oh, and no, Cannibalize 4 is not crap.</div></div><hr />
