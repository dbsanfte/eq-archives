<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The same friend who got me hooked on EQ 4 years and abit ago showed this crazy little game recently.  Great for anyone whos trying to ween themselves from EQ.  Be warned, it seems harmless enough, but I ended playing hookey from work to play, just like another game I used to play alot of.<br />

I dont recall seeing it posted on these boards before, but if it has been sorry, my mistake.  The 3 day trial is free, then you gots ot pay to play.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm into a four month absence from EQ and anything to get you away from EQ is worth a look. I've been playing a few other games and have cancelled one EQ account with one still going.<br />
<br />
With summer almost here the break free moment of cancelling my active account and burning the large box of cds, books, maps and various EQ crap in a drunken rage is almost upon me. If it actually happens pictures will be taken and posted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm taking a break from EQ and considering just cancelling and waiting for the next good MMORPG (hopefully WoW, EQ2, or DnL - one of them needs to not suck).<br />
<br />
I'm not really missing EQ at all.<br />
<br />
Fun games to play while not wasting time with EQ:<br />
1. Sacred (Diablo-esque light RPG/action game)<br />
2. Rise of Nations (part RTS, part builder simulation ala Civ series)<br />
3. Silent Storm (WWII turn-based squad level game ala XCom series)<br />
4. Call of Duty (mission based WWII shooter)<br />
<br />
CoD and RoN have various game of the year awards, SS is little known title very much worth playing, and Sacred was just released and isn't widely publicized either.  I bought all of em after playing their downloadable demos.<br />
<br />
Next on the list:<br />
1. Divine Divinity<br />
2. Spell Force<br />
3. Still hope of getting into a later phase of WoW beta  :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So let me see if I get this right.  You are looking to break one addiction by starting another addiction?  It would seem to me the best way to break your addiction to 'gaming' is not to play anymore games.  I guess I just don't get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Heh....what EQ site was it that once posted a big update about toontown?  I'm thinking it may have been a guild site, but I'm not sure.<br />
<br />
I played it for a short time, and it was...uh...interesting.  Then I uninstalled it and did other stuff.   :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hmm I gave that toontown a fair chance but its too kiddy like. I been playing warcraft 3 recently, an essential pc game which I have only bought recently, and I like some of the simularities with eq. I might buy rise of nations soon. <br />
<br />
I'm not looking for a game to get addicted like I got to eq, that was a bad mistake and was my own fault. However, I am certainly considering playing WoW following Warcraft 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Quitting EQ for another game is like switching from heroin to methadone.</div></div><hr />
