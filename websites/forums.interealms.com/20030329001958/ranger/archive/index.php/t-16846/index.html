<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ToyzRusKid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Please note I am extremely upset at the moment, and I will probably be playing EQ again within a week, but I have to vent, and I figured this would be a good place to do it. On that note...<br />
<br />
Sony can suck my fat, hairy, feces encrusted ass! The pillow-biting, coco puff eating, no milk having, rejects that are employed by this corporation obviously do not have a clue/don't care as to what happens to most of their clients. The real sad thing is that their supporters take Sony's explosive, vomiting dung.<br />
<br />
To make my point, I was on a raid with my superb guild in the Plane of Hate, and the Shattered Emerald of Corruption dropped. An officer decided I would be the beneficiary of the drop, but since I was playing an alt, a guildmate looted the item to MQ it. Ten minutes later the slug monitored server (Ayonae Ro) goes down. Well guess fricking what? The server comes back up; the guildie that looted it informs me that the emerald is gone. 2 F00KING BAD 4 J00! :p<br />
<br />
Make no mistake; I could really care less if I got the epic piece. Earthcaller would be nice to have, but I honestly thought it would go to someone else in the guild. When it was announced I would get it I was surprised to say the least. What does upset me, however, is that one has to spend more time to get the piece of crap than it does to take a lump of coal to turn to diamond, and then have it lost within seconds because of a technical difficulty. Why am I paying three more dollars a month for this vomit? To make Sony executives so rich they deficate quarters? It's obviously not for F-ing tech support! Or to ensure crap like this kind of bung raping doesn't happen!<br />
<br />
Luckily, someone had a log of what happened i.e. what was looted (supposedly). But it's the players' responsibility to ensure that things are constantly documented? When I first started playing this game, tech assistance could take some time, up to an hour, now it takes fricking days?!?! And I am paying more goddamn money! What the F-uck! I mean... goddamn people... this, to me, is complete and utter bullcrap.<br />
<br />
I guess this is the straw that broke EQ's back for me. I refuse to pay anymore of my undeserved cash to an institution such as this. I hope, in a way, that this rant will make people realize how donkey screwed this system is, and that Sony will change it because of mass account cancellations. I am quite idealistic though, and the reality is that people will keep playing this screwed game (including me *sob*), even though it would not take that much to change it. Yeah! That's a hint! Once money comes into the equation, S-hit happens. Catch my drift?<br />
<br />
I work in the game industry, and I know EQ has gotten to the point were it is just a big marketing piece of poo and there is just enough support to keep players content (for the most part). Take a look at the 'Official' EQ website for god sake. It is nothing but ads... for other fricking games! Oh! Let me spend more of my fricking cash on your crap products! Yay! :(<br />
<br />
Anyway, I am too drunk and angry to keep typing. Thanks for reading. I am going to go polish off this bottle of vodka. Please post comments/flames as you see fit. To be honest, I hope I get replies as to why I should keep playing. Keep unthoughtful, unintelligent comments to yourself. Good day :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>TraccAnkeeel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The tech difficulty you experienced is called 'rollback' and when a server goes down, it reverts back to your last save point. Any XP or items gained after your last save point will NOT show up in your inventory or on the log's.<br />
<br />
This suxxors major league A$$ but I can assure you that you are not alone, we have all been bitten by rollback. A full group of my guildies where denied their exe marks in exactly the same way.<br />

This has happened before many times to my guild. Recently, ToV leather legs dropped and the recipient lost them on a zone crash. A GM showed up and presented her with a quested set of legs for her trouble.</div></div><hr />
