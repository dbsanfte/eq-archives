<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ehrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I left EQ in early 2000, but apparently, I just can't shake this crack addiction!<br />
<br />
I played a ranger the first time around, but I was always upset I couldn't have a bear hat.  I'm a barbarian this time.<br />
<br />
Now I get to have a bear hat. :)<br />
<br />
Can anyone recommend any beginning gear?  I have a friend who says he can give me some cash to start with(plat grows on trees now I hear).  So far I have chest/legs/feet/hands/1 wrist filled.  Someone gave me a shield too.<br />
<br />
I look forward to knowing more about the class, and y'all. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gwynhwyfar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hi Ehrik.  I'm a shaman on Cazic Thule too.  I'm not sure about barabarian shaman really, but when I finally found my way to Shadowhaven, and the bazaar I found a lot of great armor there for very little money.  I was fortunate that I had found a perfect owlbear pelt, and that a helpful necromancer prevented me from selling it to someone in Paludal for a pittance.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, when I was looking for armor for shamen (before I realized I needed to specify VahShir shamen), I found Northman ringmail pieces for 30 to 40 platinum.  Lots of great stuff out there if you like to shop.  :D <br />
