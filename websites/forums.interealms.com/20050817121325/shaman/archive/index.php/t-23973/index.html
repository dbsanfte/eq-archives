<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lathyrnia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, though my character's level doesn't suggest it, I'm a bit old school when it comes to EQ players these days.  In fact, i actually quit caring around New Years, and canceled my account awhile after.  But now I am in college, without a job, and utterly bored for 70% of the day.  I end up just surfing message boards for hours on end.  Unfortuanetly, WoW and EQ2 are both months away, and my laptop (2.2GHz P4, 512mb RAM, GForce4 440 Go) will never be able to handle SOE's next offering anyway.  So I figure maybe i'll take EQ back up to pass the time.  I wouldn't be suprised if my characters are still around, unless they started actually clearing out their servers since I left, which I have never heard of them doing before.  Now being a Shaman, I'm not really concerned with finding places to hunt, anywhere with blue / black mobs usually works, but have there been any major gameplay changes / things I need to know about to start playing again lately?  The last expansion I got was the one that put in Dulak and such.  LDoN came out before I left, but I just didn't care enough at that point to get it.  Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

What was boring about it compared to EQ. Maybe your just bored with MMORPG's.</div></div><hr />

One of my main problems with WoW is that the leveling is too fast paced.  You're not in a single level range long enough to develop an identity, to become familiar with your surroundings, to feel accomplishment as you advance.  Not to mention that I only died what, like twice the whole time I played?  Easy soloing + boring combat engine + incredibly low difficulty does not a fun game make.</div></div><hr />

I don't know took me about a 7 solid days to reach 17 or 18, I could dwarf that in the EQ of today in 7 solid days. Of course I was doing a lot of sightseeing too, which I intend to do again when it's live, but I never felt like leveling was too fast.  Far as dying goes I agree in the earliest levels but around 14 or so I was at risk of dying or did die quite a bit, maybe just unique to a warrior, but finishing some of those quests was definitely hazardous to your health.<br />
<br />
I get the impression that it's not really a game where you sit at one spot and grind out experience, I had most of my gains while completing quests, which was quite fun. It was hard not to drop into the exp grind rut, which EQ had conditioned me for, but their quest system made it easier to resist.</div></div><hr />

Oh, trust me, I did tons and tons of quests. (There's a certain kind of satisfaction to be had in turning a Satyr into a frog)  However, I couldn't have had more than 20 hours /played before I hit lvl 12 as a NE Hunter.  Not to mention that the majority of quests are of the &quot;Bring me 5 Elephant Tongues, 53 Anteater Farts and 24.8 Koala Toenails and I'll give you something good&quot; type.</div></div><hr />

Load up EQ and have fun. Like i said many times. WoW is not EQ and if you come to WoW thinking it is there is no way you will like it. You have to open yourself to the different style of play and adjust to it.<br />
<br />
If you cant do that its pointless and you should go back to EQ.</div></div><hr />

Yeah.  Then again, it's not like the things I griped about before I left all those months ago have gotten any better, probably worse.  Maybe I oughta just wait for something a little different, like Guildwars.  D2 / MMORPG hybrid.</div></div><hr />

They as of right now are happy with how fast/slow it goes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">We found even cons to be pretty easy, too, which is why we started taking on more oranges and reds, and got more sloppy with pulling - often taking on 2 and 3 at a time.  Challenge level is all about how you do it.  *grin*<br />
<br />
My guess is that the changes in EQ mainly consist of the stuff in the bazaar being higher quality for the same plat, and the old hunting grounds and grouping spots being relatively empty (unless they're good plat farming camps).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I certainly dont find levelling in WoW to be too easy. And my dwarf hunter is only 14 so far. Maybe it was different in the stress test?<br />
<br />
If you get quests that are yellow they will be a challenge solo. Orange and red require varying degrees of grouping so it doesnt have to be so easy. A grey collection quest on the other hand is very easy.<br />
<br />
But damn is it a great game. The gryphon rides are fantastic the first time you try a new route. Not having to click a bazillion times to get 5 skill increases in a tradeskill is great. Having a minimap and a dynamic zone map is brilliant. And and and.....   :-)</div></div><hr />

Go do something besides EQ.  When you are old(er) and think back fondly on your college days, you don't want to remember it as &quot;the 4 years I stayed indoors and played on the computer&quot;.<br />
<br />
If your bored, take more classes.  join a club of some sort, god knows there are enough on a college campus.  Go find out where the next anti-bush protest is and either a) throw rocks or b) join in (or c) hook up with the opposite sex).<br />
<br />
<br />
Personally?  I'd join 3 or 4 campus organizations and go from there.  Either that or get a job and fix that whole &quot;College=broke&quot; equation.<br />

Good Luck.  :)</div></div><hr />

And this is going to be the biggest challenge to Blizzard. If you dont put those things in (i.e. EQ) then can you keep enough new stuff out there to keep people interested? Timesinks are there for a reason (to keep the programmers sane).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Observe the depth of the named loot pools, which I believe is being somewhat extended by partial randomization. Blizzard, with their D-2 experience, are not entirely noobies to the problem of keeping capped characters busy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Pjrell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Anyone remember when DAoC came out?  I was between jobs at the time and picked it up the day it went live.  I ZOOMED thru the levels there and had the first level 48 dwarven healer on the Bedevere server in one month.  My guild and I had farmed the crap out of Spindlehalla (the highest level dungeon at the time in Midgaard) and I had completed every available step in the epic at the time.<br />
<br />
Levelling quickly will cause a very quick burnout and once I left after that month I never turned back despite all the expansions that came out for it.  I sure hope WoW or EQ2 arent like that.<br />
<br />
-Pjrell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I played DAoC too when that came out but honestly WoW seems like a lot more fun. In one week I already grouped with more strangers than I ever did in DAoC.<br />
<br />
Newbie levels in WoW dont compete with newbie levels in EQ. They compete with endgame EQ. And then you can add on the tradeskills which are much better implemented than in EQ or DAoC or any other similar game I tried.<br />
<br />
And so what if I can only have fun in WoW for 1 year? 2 years? Does that mean I still have to keep paying for EQ all that time? I think not.<br />
<br />
EQ deserves to be hit really hard by the WoW launch. Class balance? Bug-free expansions? Fleshed-out tasksystem? 2-way communication with class representatives? Reasonable content for casual players? Hell no! Not from SOE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">CoH = repetitive and boring after 25+.  Hell, it is before then, but you don't notice it.   :p <br />
<br />
Just find a club or something to join (you said you're in college) to pass the time 'til WoW.  Or read.  Or anything but EQ.  For the love of god, don't contribute more money to this zombie of a game.  EQ has been dead for a while, someone just forgot to tell the player base.   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Ummm, Lathyrnia, I'm going to assume you're a guy.  Now unless you're at Bob Jones Bible College or BYU you have the opportunity to interact with these people called<br />
<br />
(Does finger quotation thing)<br />
<br />
&quot;girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now you may have seen one or more of these &quot;girls&quot; wandering about campus or even in one of your classes. They probably smell different than you do and they have bumps in strange places.<br />
<br />
Well heck, let's call it like we see it - they're really curvey and you get a strange feeling between your belly button and knees when they stand too close.<br />
<br />
Now, previously you may have only had this feeling when you looted UBer_Pixel_01 off of MOBS_Corpse.  Trust me on this - you need to proceed with a bit more caution with &quot;girls&quot; on campus than the female toons in EQ.<br />
<br />
For starters, they may react a LOT differently if you inspect them.  Lifting their skirt or spying on them while they shower is NOT conducive to you remaining out of the local jail.  <br />
<br />
Additionally, between their belly button and neck they have these things called &quot;breasts.&quot;  When you &quot;con&quot; them, make sure you look them in the eyes and not at these &quot;breasts.&quot; <br />
<br />
Note - both of the above pieces of advice are ESPECIALLY true if you meet a &quot;girl&quot; who is quite content for you to treat her like the dancers in Neriak.  You may catch something that even Radiant Cure won't fix.<br />
<br />
Once you have gotten past the awkwardness of introducing yourself to these &quot;girls&quot; (and use your real name not your EQ name), you will need to talk about something.<br />
<br />
Given that you're 20-something, your major accomplishments in life are converting Oxygen to Carbon Dioxide and graduating high school. <br />
<br />
DON'T PANIC!<br />
<br />
She's in the same boat.<br />
<br />
Now listen to me carefully. This is very important.<br />
<br />
Do NOT, under any circumstances, attempt to impress her with tales of your derring-do on the Planet Norrath.  I know, I know, you were King_uber_shiznit with your merry guild as you whacked named MOBs left and right.<br />
<br />
She will leave the area faster than a Burrito mixed with a 6-pack and washed down with an Ex-Lax chocolate chaser leaves your lower intestine.<br />
<br />
Talk about the weather, politics, your parents, HER parents, your pet (REAL LIFE, not Summoned Skeleton, Elemental thing, Wolf), school, class, the big game coming up, anything OTHER than EQ.<br />
<br />
Note - if otoh you WANT her to go away, just start off with this gem:<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi CHeryl, my name is Bob, but when I play EQ online, my 65 Shaman's name is Lathyrnia.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trust me big guy you might as well say that you're a Hatian Transvestite who is into needle-sharing.<br />
<br />
So let's wrap it up here:<br />
<br />
1) Look for &quot;girls&quot;<br />
2) Talk to them by looking in their eyes and not their hooters.<br />
3) Never, ever let her know you played EQ.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>nigub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">EQ is pretty easy to lvl too nowadays if you focus on leveling.  Twink gear and gifts/buffs from other players can rocket you to 1-30 in a couple of days and 50+ in a couple of weeks.  Far less if you got friends already and got no real life/full time employment....   If too easy still one  can always play with lesser gear or choose a crappy build, refuse rezes as 'unrealistic' and go true hardcore and delete your toon upon death.</div></div><hr />
