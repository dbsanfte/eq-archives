<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Now normallly I would post this question at station but Ive been banned there permenetly...I cant imagine why but I have..soo..here is my question...Its not really an SK question, but since its my SK and my shamans alt here goes..Bash or Slam..What is the big difference...Inst it the same skill..Dont you level up in that skill at the same rate and at the same time?  Since Ive only played my shaman up to this point IM currious..Also, while Im at it..Why does a lvl 41's Sk's Invis..IE Gather shadows work so much better then my 62 Shamans??  It allways shocks me at how fast invis fails on the shaman...Anyways let me know soonest.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Slam is a racial trait only large races get, bash is c lass dependant and requires a shield be equipped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Right, I understand that part,what Im currious about is which is better, or rather which works more effectivly..my ogre sk rocks, but seems to do more damage with bash then slam?  Does that even sound right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not sure, because our slam is capped at 1. I haven't played a large race melee to see if it goes up for them. I also though slam required a shield to be equipped.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tenien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As I recall, Bash/Slam work off the same skill for large races.  So classes with the bash skill, i.e. SKs, can gain skill and bash without a shield equipped.  Large race shaman cannot train the bash skill, so damage max is 1 and it doesn't land very often.  Large races need shoulders that are tagged magic to use slam/bash when shield not equipped for most targets IIRC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">slam is better as you dont need a shield to use it, but can  increase bash skill and hence damage you do if you get bash skill, however with a change they did the shield you use, i think possible better ac, does more damage using bash skill. therefore bash is better as a skill than just slam, but if you have bash/slam then you get the best of both worlds as they both use the same skill.<br />
<br />
did that make sense?</div></div><hr />

Just for future help. Good place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If my memory serves, Slam and its damage and its base to hit is based off your Bash skill (assuming your a race that gets Slam). By default, big races have a Slam skill of 1, which means that you wont hit very often and for a max of 1 point. If you have access to Bash as a class skill (SK, Warriors for us big types) then you can Slam, work your Bash Skill and will hit more often. Now, you wont do near as much damage as a Shield bash would. Evidently, Slam is basically a shoulder smack, I remember that back in the day when I was wearing my Uber Leet Banded Shoulders that I tried to slam a ghoule and got the message that it was immune to the attack...</div></div><hr />
