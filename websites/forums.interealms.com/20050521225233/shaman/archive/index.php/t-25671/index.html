first off there will be allot of typoes in this guide since it was<br />
written in notepad and my english spelling is awful :/ <br />
<br />
also i am not sure this is the right forum to put this in so please move it if needed<br />

<br />
1. intro<br />
greetings this guide is about how to vox using 2 chars<br />
before you start flamming this guide as BS you should take into account<br />
that i have 74 dragon kills under my belt so i know what i am taking about!<br />
later on when it is done i will post a updated version where a guide to kill naggy<br />
when he is in normal mode and when he is dual wielding<br />
<br />
the reason i am posting it on this board is because you need a high lvl shaman<br />
to pull it off<br />
<br />
2 things needed<br />
2.1 tech<br />
to pull this off 2 comps are needed and one of them have to be able to zone <br />
form PF to EF and back in under 20 secs when you dont take the time to cast<br />
gate into account<br />
<br />
if this is done by one person which is preferred and easiest then the 2 comps<br />
need to be really close to each other so you can see and use both at the same time<br />
<br />
ohh and ofcouse you need 2 accounts <br />
<br />
2.2 chars<br />
2.2.1 shaman<br />
the main char needed for this is a high lvl shaman 65+ with a fair number of aas <br />
and fair gear ... it does not need to be elemental or higher to do it ... <br />
highend bazaar pre GoD will do it ... to get an idea about gear check this mangelo<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=727020<br />
my old shaman <br />
<br />
the aas which is a must is<br />
Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery<br />
Cannibalization<br />
<br />
the only spell which is a must is Quiescence ... i havent tested the higher lvl HoTs<br />
but Quiescence will do the job so using it as base for the guide<br />
<br />
having a high skill in alchemy is also needed unless you have some1 who can<br />
combine potions for you or you just learn fast <br />
<br />
2.2.2 monk<br />
the main dragon fighter and puller for this is a monk ... must be lvl 52 when you attack<br />
however if you do not have a highlvl guild to work on getting the monk flagged for T3<br />
then it is a good idea to get the monk up to lvl 55 so ornate leather can be quested<br />
and then delvl down to 52 after the BP and gloves have been quested<br />
the 2 items will still work after you have delvled down from 55 for some reason<br />
<br />
this was the monk i did it with<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=959197<br />
all items but the face item can be bought in the bazaar<br />
the main focus should lie on resists . ac and hps ... hps comming last of the 3<br />
just try to get near the numbers on the magelo and you will be fin<br />
about resist then it is good to have around <br />
200+CR buffed against vox<br />
200+FR buffed against naggy<br />
and 240MR with both ( or just 200 without the BP buff ) <br />
<br />
AAs needed is run3 and regen3<br />
<br />
<br />
2.3 buffs<br />
buff set up for the shaman<br />
for the shaman it is not that important to have it like this<br />
but it gives and idea about how it can look<br />
1) junk<br />
2) junk<br />
3) junk<br />
4) junk / sow <br />
5) acumen<br />
6) agi<br />
7) sta<br />
8) focus<br />
9) V or better<br />
10) kei is good but not needed<br />
<br />
monk set up which must be followed atleast if you want to<br />
use this guide the right way<br />
<br />
1) junk / instant click item ( ornate gloves ) <br />
2) junk buff ( acumen recommended<br />
3) junk buff ( DR recommended )<br />
4) junk buff ( PR recommended <br />
5) sta<br />
6) IoS ( yes the lvl 44 shaman buffs ... not needed if you allready have your sta maxed out )<br />
7) FR / CR ( depending on what dragon you are up against the shaman version will do fine )<br />
8) MR ( still the shaman version will do the trick<br />
9) Spirit of Bih'Li ( personally i used this to get my atk over 1.4k ) <br />
10) shield buffs form the ornate BP <br />
11) haste<br />
12) regen ( must be able to last more than 15min )<br />
13) DS ( from the best shaman made potion DS ) should only be activated right before the fight<br />
14) FA ( which is cast right before the fight ) <br />
15) V or better<br />
 <br />
<br />
2.4 click items<br />
well the most important click item is the ornate gloves or if you have the time the monk epic<br />
since this will keep you form losing your best buffs which will keep you alive<br />
<br />
the other click items you might want to use it things like<br />
Potion of Stinging Wort which works as a 300hp instant heal which also gives you a junk buff<br />
these are not needed and for the last 20 or so kills i dint use a single potion to kill them<br />
but it is a good idea to have 10 or so 10dose potions in a bag if things go bad<br />
(which they do in the start)<br />
and last the DS potion shamans can make with alchemy<br />
<br />
<br />
3 vox<br />
3.1 intro to vox<br />
<br />
the dragon that raids fear ... well in a duo she is the easiest of the 2 ... now you might say<br />
that i am forgetting that she can CH her self ... well i am not forgetting it but vox is unable<br />
to cast anything when she does not have any mana left ... this fight normaly takes around 10min<br />
and in the end vox does not have any mana left for CHing ... however unlike naggy vox does not<br />
run at low hps ( well it happened to me once so i will give it about 3% chance )<br />
vox have a lower dps than naggy but allot more hp or ac since it takes abit longer to kill her with<br />
the same set up and i never used logges to check which of the 2 made a diff<br />
<br />
3.2 moving and clearing to vox<br />
<br />
map <br />
http://www.jestersinnorrath.co.uk/GalleryImageFullSize.asp?lUserID=389&amp;lImageID=28<br />
<br />
looking at the map you come in at point A from everfrost. normally i use this spot to buff up / rebuff<br />
now make a pet if you dont have one buff it ( fa, haste, regen and focus ) and give it 2 1hand weps  <br />
suspend the pet if you have suspend minion2. invis up and move both chars to point B. just run for<br />
 it and ignor any goblins that might aggro. kill them when you get to point B<br />
if you do not have suspend minion just run and kill the few extra goblins at point B<br />
<br />
Point B is where the giant grounds start. the thing to remember with the giants is that <br />
you have to be in melee range before you can cast anything that will stick (unresistable spell will stick)<br />
moving from point B to C you have to clear about 4 giants and 1 giant spider if you do it right.<br />
move might add if your are not carefull. on the first try it might be an idea to clear the giants<br />
in the room south west of point C to make sure they will not add later on when pulling<br />
<br />
the best thing to do about the giants is just to slow them. use epic and bane <br />
( they have high dr / pr resists ) and your pet to kill them. and just canni your mana up <br />
while fighting them <br />
have the shaman do the tanking and the monk just hitting them from behind along with the pet<br />
<br />
when you get to point C bind the shaman ( atleast until you have tried it a few times )<br />
the reason for the bind is to make sure you dont have to run back from the ent if you make a bad<br />
pull and get banished out of the zone<br />
<br />
the main pull spot is at point D. it is here the shaman will wait while the monk pulls<br />
the shaman needs to be located so it can see around the corner but still be behind the it<br />
meaning you can move to the corner and have half the screen filled with the wall and the other<br />
seeing down the corridor<br />
<br />
the main pull tactic is the monk tags and then runs like hell to point C and wait for the FD<br />
call from the shaman<br />
<br />
the mobs will be charging down the corridor from point E to point D. the FD needs to happen<br />
when one or a few of the mobs have turned the corner so the shaman can see them the monk FDs<br />
and the shaman then tags them. then just slow them and kill them and then repeat<br />
 until the lair is cleared<br />
<br />
there is about 3 icecy terror mobs located before the entrance to the lair but dont be foolled<br />
by the fact that they are outside ... the giants including vox will chain aggro <br />
<br />
if a FD fails have the monk run strait up to the lair again and keep trying to FD the mobs off<br />
if the monk it dying you can allways just jump down one of the trap doors in the floor this will<br />
give you a few more secs to live in and get a FD off if you use the ones west and north of point E<br />
<br />
when the lair have been cleared of everything but vox ( about 5 to 6 giants and 1 icy terror )<br />
move up to point E. rebind the shaman near the wall. mem gate<br />
rebuff every shaman buff on the monk and then med / canni to full mana. <br />
when ready drink the DS potion. click off the 4th junk buff<br />
and replace it with a Q. then click the stone door and run into the lair with the monk<br />
start the resist diciplin. aggro vox so she will follow you. then run back near the door<br />
and try and fight close to that spot since you will be in casting range of the shaman<br />
<br />
while fighting only use mend and stonestance if you get into a bad run and potions<br />
if you have used them allready. though the hole fight chain hit a hotkey with<br />
the ornate glove buff so it is allways activ and filling the 1st buff slot<br />
personally i keyed the gloves to the numpad number 0 and used my left hand to hit<br />
it all the time while shifting my right between the 2 mouses <br />
<br />
about 30 secs after the monk have entered the lair recast the Q on the monk<br />
get banished out of the zone. as soon as you are able gate back to point E.<br />
then as soon as you are back at point recast the Q and repeast this action until vox<br />
have been slain <br />
<br />
4 final goal<br />
the main goal of this should be to get in and out again in under 45min <br />
and in total to kill both dragon in under 1.5 hours from where you enter either PF or solA<br />
while not using a single heal potion and only doing this as a single person controlling 2 chars <br />

<br />
not really ... since i botted the monk ... also what monk in their right mind would delvl their monk from 60+ to 52 and keep it there ... and then lvl up a shaman to 65?</div></div><hr />

Are you sure about that? I was under the impression if a character had BoT or Tactics flag the character could get ornate armor at level 46.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not much of a bet since his plan specified leveling the monk to 55 getting ornate and deleveling again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, he said &quot;if your guild cannot flag you for Tier 3,&quot; so that just meant that at 55 you can get into the zone without all the prior flags.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ughbash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Access to bot/hoh or CoD will allow the dwarf to talk to you so you can get ornate.  CoD can be acceseed at 55 (why level 55 chars can talk to him) or by killing Grummus or alt quest.  So it could be done without deleveling.  Many of the people who solo vox/naggy have some gear from elemental planes (like the range item and haste cloak from fire).  Many even have time flag for the charm even if they can't zone into time until 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I did all this same stuff with a meagerly equipped paladin without all the deleveling and ornate.  Shrunken goblin skull earring is all you really need.<br />
<br />
It was with a friend of mine druid who liked to box his paladin.  Yeah so its not the same since there was a druid there too.  To be honest, all my time was spent zoning, so I couldn't tell you if the druid was doing anything during the fight, although I suspect he dropped his DS on the paladin.<br />
<br />
I think altogether we killed vox and naggy 5 each times before I decided it was just too boring with no return.<br />
<br />
FYI Breath of Trushar won't hold on level 52, so you are pretty much stuck using Q.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">With rez stick and Red Dragon Tooth off the lists, I can't think of anything but epics to make them worth the bother (oh, and personal accomplishment or bazaar fodder I suppose)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Forgot about the bags.  Those would be of use for a monk definately, and personally I think it'd be less hassel to spend the 5K or so to get generic 100% wr bags on the shaman.  To each his own though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Is it confirmed that rez stick doesn't drop?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>chees</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Is it confirmed that rez stick doesn't drop?<br />
in the months i chain killed vox i never saw it so yes i belive that it does not drop anymore<br />
<br />
and why kill them ? ... well it is a guide about how to farm them ... it is all about bazaar fodder and giving away what ever items people in your guild need ... and to point out you dont need to be in a hardcore raiding guild to get the items needed to take them out ... and yes i could solo them with the monk ... but there would be no profit in that since it would take allot of heal potions which are not cheap ... it is all about being efficient <br />
<br />
indeed it is doable with a druid since the DS they have really make a huge diff when fighting them <br />
<br />
Shrunken goblin skull earring is a nice instant buff clicky but compared to the extra haste / ac / atk from the epic buff ( same as the ornate gloves ) it pushed me up over 1.4k atk and pretty much max haste</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Rez stick does drop, but the sell to recharge trick was nerfed to hell and back and they made it so only clerics can click, so... Might as well not drop, i guess :p</div></div><hr />

Hi Iwishi if u read the this :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hi Iwishi if u read the this :P<br />
<br />
for one solo fight a shaman is not needed ... to chain kill it is <br />
<br />
and if naggy is dual wielding you would have a serious hard time even with a shaman backing you up unless you use the right tactic</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Two technical notes - <br />
1. If you begin to cast a heal, and FD the monk, you are no longer on that agro list and don't get banished... at least I never did. <br />
2. T-Staff stuns work for interrupting spells.<br />
<br />
Another thought.<br />
Still gotta ask yourself if this is an exploit or not... that is why I stopped doing it so long ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>chees</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">a note to the first tech note ... you need to move away from both dragons before you are able to FD so it sticks ... atleast when i FDed near their feet they just ignored it and banished my shaman <br />
<br />
and yes in teori it could be considered a exploit but then again any form of kiting could also be considered a exploit</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">...and yes in teori it could be considered a exploit but then again any form of kiting could also be considered a exploit<br />
Hmmmm, kiting is an exploit?  Please explain, I gotta hear this. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
The old world Dragons were made to banish players of high level for reasons of farming.  This method clearly bypasses that simple attempt to prevent farming with little risk.  I think that would make it an exploit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>chees</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hmmmm, kiting is an exploit?  Please explain, I gotta hear this. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
i just said that it could be considered a exploit ... basicly in kiting you use the terrain and a way to prevent you own death you while you killed it  ( fear / snare / sow etc. ) <br />
<br />
i basicly did the same ... i prevented the death of my monk by buffing my him ( a heal over time is considered a buff ) ... ok i did chain buff him and used the terrain ( wall ) to do it safely<br />
<br />
it is all in a kinda of a grey area ... where you could go either way ... but after SoE started breaking their own set in stone rules my morals kinda went down ... <br />
<br />
which is also why i decided to post the guide ... how ever i am not sure if i should post the section about duoing naggy when he is dual wielding since you are using their own coding against them and in my own opinion a exploit ... but even though it is a exploit it is very hard to do and takes a 30min+ fight</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">In what way did the wall make you safe?  <br />
<br />
Also, a minor point of course, but you don't need the monk to pull giants in Vox lair.  Its a rather fun excercise to figure out how to clear the giants with just the shaman and the pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>TorukFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">wow way to make doing Vox w/ 52+ so much harder.<br />
<br />
Best way ive found to do it get a 45+ melee and any 60+ mage.  Park your pets by the first set of stairs.  Mage and Shaman buff the melee and sit in the room.   Melee pulls Naggy to pets and starts to attack.  At 40% start CotH.  Melee is ported to mage and healed and HoT'd w/ Q or better run back in.  So on and so on.  Pets get agro from AE and you dont get banished.  Pets hold agro when melee is coth'd.  pets wont do damage but take damage.  Usually takes 10-25 coths to kill him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
that is one way to do it toruk ... i would call that allot harder than a simple 8 to 10min standard fight ... and your tactic takes 3 ppl ( less profit ) <br />
<br />
also just to point out the 2 pets does not hold aggro all aggro is cleared when the melee is CoTHed <br />
however the pets keep the dragon in combat mode which prevents it from regening back to full hps fast which i personally consider a exploit ( i did use a simmilar way to take down naggy when he was dual wielding though )<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
and ronax the wall at the ent enabled me to be in casting range while being out of aggro range</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>TorukFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">&quot;and ronax the wall at the ent enabled me to be in casting range while being out of aggro range&quot;<br />
<br />
huh? ronax the wall?<br />
<br />
You mean you have Extended Range?<br />
<br />
Also im on FV so i can bind myself by naggy's lair or it would make it 100x easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">and ronax the wall at the ent enabled me to be in casting range while being out of aggro range <br />
<br />
Not sure if you had to be out of aggro range due to using FD or not, but wanted to point out that once Vox is engaged, you can go right up next to her and she wont give a crap.  Heck you could even drop the healing ward near your partner without getting banished.  Even being in range of the AE and getting hit with it won't make her banish you.  Only dropping a heal or attempting to directly cast on her will cause banishment, once someone has her engaged.</div></div><hr />

indeed that is true the one taking just need the rigth amount of aggro ... personally it was too hard for me to also focus on running the shaman into the lair and bind him there while also keeping the monk Qed</div></div><hr />

I killed kelorek dar the other day and got 2 haste cloaks. And kelorek can be duo'd by 65s/70s easily with no banishment crap. I've heard of people getting 3 haste cloaks to drop. Don't worry about these banishing dragons, kill the easier ones.</div></div><hr />
