<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hangurin Strongbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heyas...I'm a 66 shaman with most 65 and earlier spells (no 66 yet =/ ) and I seem to be stagnating as to what I can solo for decent xp.  Murks in NC take forever and all my mana (tried root/rot and agro kite with pet).  I know I need better gear, but as we all know, plat don't grow on trees.  Any advice I could get would be welcome.  Magelo is listed below.<br />

<br />
Thanks again.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Fergot to add that I have all expansions, just limited as to my playtime with college and such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ribeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I recommend spending some time in DoN...at least enough to buy your lvl 61 spell Spirit of Leopard.  This will greatly help your ability to solo...<br />
<br />
Also DoN has some nice spots to solo xp...like stillmoon and lavaspinners...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tsuyoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For soloing look up the posts in these forums for Droga, Veksar, Harbinger's Spire (1st floor), Bloodfields and PoM.  These will provide decent xp, plat and drops.  Nothing exceptional though.<br />
<br />
You can also do the pigpen in PoTactics.  Get skilled at dropping the piglet to finish out any 65 spells that you need.  The bulwark is also decent tribute.  XP will be good here.<br />
<br />
For just straight XP look up the posts for rotting golems in the PoValor.<br />
<br />
In your shoes I'd focus on getting xp and plat at the same time.  If you have someone you can trust to make spells for you go for the hobbits on the wall in PoM to get the Remove Greater Curse spell component.  I just sold an RGC spell for 44k.  Use the plat to get bazaar upgrades.  You can get to 4k unbuffed hp and mana in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Grouping will get you xp much faster and the potential for better drops.  If you group do DoN or OoW.  The tier 1 OoW armor is nice at your level and you'll get important focuses from them.  You may also want to jump on the fabled mobs since they are here.  If you can find a group there are many upgrades available from the Fabled mobs.  And they pop so frequently that you can expect a few upgrades a night.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">well, I go to college and work, and I typically play late-evening to late-night/early-morning.<br />
<br />
keep an eye on your gear. if you don't have HP on it, get something else.<br />
<br />
I realize that upgrades aren't cheap, but camping gear isn't out of the question. aim to get groups in WoS, (MPG is much better) start getting spell runes, eventually you will have all your spells for a specific level, or, all the spells you want for a specific levels, the runes themselves will go for a pretty penny.<br />
<br />
any of the magnetized armor will sell for a few thousand quickly in the bazaar. and do quick DoN missions if you can. the gear you can get from the merchants isn't half-bad, and will prove to be major upgrades for you. if you'd rather go for other gear, the crystals sell for a very pretty penny, and can line your pockets nicely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>notch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">for xp you can solo pov golems . your still within 5 lvls of good xp. I aggro kite them but.. you could root rot them.. I find true spirit cant hold the aggro very well to tank them. <br />
For cash poj jail. an hour there per night will net you some nice cash. 50% of mobs will still be dkblue.. but the xp isnt that great.<br />
<br />
You are missing focus items big time!<br />
doing missions with a gruop (yes I KNOW you said solo) will let you buy focus augs! <br />
<br />
Imagine casting your best dot.. having it last 2-6 ticks longer , costing 10% less mana, and doing 10-20% more dammage per tick per cast. <br />
Focus items = solo waaaaaay easier.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
for an easy +5 to stats augment.. head up to the priest of discord by the library in pok. say &quot;I wish to go&quot; then you will be ported. run just over the hill with the zone wall on your right. stop at the first tree and sit down make dogdog.. and kill the one unkun that pops there. 20 minutes later you might have Unkun somethingorother? pop.. he can drop the aug I speak of. boring camp.. but it was an upgrade for me. and I didnt need anyone else to help me!<br />
<br />
Some fairly inexpensive upgrades for you might be <br />
the fabled JBB! try your best to get a couple of people down there to seb crypt while the birthday thing is going on. ft2 and winters roar. a nice free upgrade for you. the crypt keeper can spawn there too .. he drops shoulders that are better then yours. again also free. the heirophant drops the fabled versoin of your cloak. ft2 and better hp/mana. free!  <br />
<br />
 cherry blossom belt +8 to stam and 50hp/mana = few k<br />
silken gloves of the ikaav +3 sta and 60hp/60mana = few k<br />
Or you could stay in poj for a few hours and farm enough to get a some bazu gear (bp has 100 hp/90 mana, legs have 95/85) goes for around 20kish and I would wager you could get that much in 10-15 hours if your slow. not to mention getting a few aas or blues. turn in the parchents for mage spells (they have a lot) and thier air pet usually nets me 1500 easy.<br />
<br />
Tattered cloak of the fallen has a nice focus and ft2  and 100+ hp/mana but they go for like 85k on my server.  <br />
if you stay in pov.. dont vendor the metallic liquids put them on a trader for 500 per.. when you wake up they will be gone most the time.<br />
<br />
Last but not least.. you can go to higher content OOW zones and /ooc for tells for rotting items. some times you can get lucky. it is very boring and ppl might laugh at you.. but I  got my soul imbued ring that way. lots of gruops there dont have a shammy and you can buff them/throw a heal here and there for faction hits..while you wait patiently..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Herger_Athach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think it's the Ukun Gutfeaster that spawns at the tree there in DS. He conned db to me at 65, and mostly drops the Swampwalkers Veil and Perfect Marked Ukun Hide (I think that's what it is--for Epic 1.5). Last night he dropped the aug, which is +5 to all stats. Very nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There is another spawn for named Ukun, in Dranik's Scar.  That named also drops the Hide.  Anyone of a level to care about the hide can keep both spawns clear with 15+ minutes to sit around chattnig.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah.  Far west side of zone.... then south.... also drops the resist aug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hangurin Strongbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">OK.  got the +5 to all stats aug to drop after 8 hours camping it.  Will try some of the other suggestions this afternoon once I get back from class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dermador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i camped this 5+ stats aug for more then 20 hours... but it didn´t drop...<br />
<br />
i think go crazy...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">5? I was there for damn ever, even after I got my Perfect Ukun Skins, doing faction when LFG or when not enough time to group. Still no aug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">this aug really isn't all that great any more, neither is the sister aug &quot;Eye of the Dragorn&quot; that gives +5 to all resists.<br />
<br />
take a look at the DoN merchant, augs with +14 to all stats and augs with +12 to all resists...<br />
<br />
you'll spend about the same amount of time in DoN to get the really nice augs rather than waiting for the DS spawn to roll around..</div></div><hr />

But then I couldn't have said... &quot;I did it.&quot;<br />
<br />
We know how important that is.......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ohaern Halveric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hi folks , long time lurker random rare poster....Hangurin , your topic &quot;speaks &quot; to me ..Especially as i am a soloist by choice and nature .<br />
<br />
    I've done my leveling , both regular xp and aa xp 95% solo . Several nice suggestions in this thread tho I as a  &quot;control&quot;  freak am not a fan of the  panther / leapord spells as they  bust root. But thats just me, they ARE great dps additions to our spell suite.<br />
<br />
  You stated that you have all the expansions , most 65 and earlier spells, but didnt mention  wether or not you have Qiesence (sp error i know) if you have that , you are all set . <br />
<br />
    Personally I have never tried solo xp  in PoV,PoI,PoJ, BoT ,or PoT - I tend to avoid zones that actually have other players in them, and those most certainly will, I went instead to Ykesha zones, Droga and PoM for my  xp, with a dash of Cazic Thule thrown in for good measure. The choices i made might not be the &quot; best&quot; for xp per mob, but  i was able to do several at once for nice consistant xp gain . Check out  Torgiran Mines , Hates Fury and  Nadox. With the spells we have available to us at 65  and 66 you can  do some nifty lill xp jaunts there. <br />
<br />
    My suggestion would be hit torgiran mines first, the center area  where the large bridge is , all mobs are  pure melee type, ( until you go past, then you get some int caster type luggalds, and some sk type trolls ) nice thing  'bout pure melee mobs- we are  completely set up to make them rue the day we decided they need to die for our xp pleasure.   <br />
<br />
      Dogdot is more then  capable to tank these whilst you canna dance. This camp spot gives you  alot of room to work, all mobs being solo pulls, and  a few nice safepoints to log in and out and not have to worry about getting bumrushed while you are getting set up, can be done totally self buffed, so no need to rely on kei or virtue ( note im not saying they arent great things)  but  you can live and level nicely here logging in and out with no need to go elsewhere for buffluvin until you  want to / have to sell off loots to vendors. <br />
<br />
    The platinum skull ring vendors  for 33pp, the effigy of innoruuk  70ish pp ( ithink) , worn belt buckle  33 pp and drop frequently. I'd pull a troll, get him melting with dots, slowed, then sic dogdot on him with a Q for safety, and start the next troll in my rotation..after a few shifts getting used to the  spawn / area i began pulling 2/3 at once , locking them down with a  ultor /saryn /root combo melting - then a dogdot for good measure ( note- i dont give dogdot proccing weops as they bust root, and i am a total control freak- i want them mobs WHERE i put 'em until *I* bust that root to reposition them . Sic the dogdot on em in turn and go thru them like sh*it  thru a goose. It might not be the fastest xp gain per mob, and will slow down once you  get  higher..but its a good way to get used to multiple mobs at once ( no they do not summon here - also a bonus) and make some decent plat. <br />
<br />
 my magelo is in my sig, nothing on me was gained  with more then 6 ppl, most solo or with a cash stash earned from  my xp grinds, nothing phenomenal on me, but it works, and when i do group  ( WoS / NC / RcoD ) I feel that i am able to fill almost any role required of me fairly well { slower , dps, CC, back up healer }( exception being main healer- i just dont have the mind set nor spell tools to do it- go ahead flame me i know someone  out there is  chomping at the bit to do so ) . Good luck in your endeavors Hangurin , slowed and steady wins the race *chuckle*</div></div><hr />
