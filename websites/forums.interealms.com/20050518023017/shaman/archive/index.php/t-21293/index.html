<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Got stuck in the flag in NRO LDoN camp yesterday.<br />
Used /rewind and out i popped no problem.<br />
<br />
Now the point of this post is.........<br />
<br />
Sony why the **** did you take this command out in the 1st place you dumb ****ers.<br />
<br />
Oh thats right people could maybe exploit it.<br />
<br />
Well whats more important to you a few arsehats exploiting some retarded coding on your part or a good % of the EQ population getting stuck in scenery then waiting hours for 1 of your lazy arse GMs (This means GMs no disrespect to guides meant here) to log on to read his fat pile of petitions.<br />
<br />
Ok maybe people exploiting /rewind may somehow make some fat pp out of it which they can then sell to scumbag Yantis.<br />
Thats not my problem thats yours.<br />
YOU take Yantis etc to court and get him that way dont make us suffer for it.<br />
<br />
Or maybe the exploiters may just make some free exp out of it.<br />
OMG no people getting free exp its not exactly that hard to get exp anyway.<br />
<br />
Or maybe they use their fat pp they made to buy some stuff in the Bazaar for which they need a lot of pp because YOU yes YOU screwed up our economy in the 1st place by leaving in some dumb retarded coding.<br />
<br />

Sorry I know this is just a rant but sometimes some of the idiotic things Sony do makes me want to rant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Aside from the tone ;) i fully agree.<br />
<br />
It always bugged and annoyed me to no end, that SOE choose to 'punish' 400.000 subscribers, because 40 or 400 tards may be able to exploit it.<br />
<br />
If you are really so concerned about the exploitibility (that's not a word, or?) of a new feature, just frigging trace it for a few weeks, look up the most extreme numbers of usages and IMMEDIATELY ban any found cheaters - no questions asked.<br />
<br />
But hey, that would probably cost some time and ressources ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Gate or Gate potions are your friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Makelike</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If I remember correctly the original &quot;rewind&quot; was automatic and left people continuously bouncing off of objects or steps.<br />
<br />
Gate potions are great till you get stuck ducked then your ****ed. So glad they fixed the auto-duck problem now that one was really annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Gate or Gate potions are your friend.<br />
<br />
When stuck ive ussually got away with /q working.<br />
Most of the time ive not been able to gate as ive not been able to stand to cast a spell or sit to camp :(.<br />
In case you actually didnt bother to read my rant the whole point of it was that yes people are getting stuck.Yes SoE found out a simple command to get unstuck and then they removed this command because a few idiots may exploit it.<br />
<br />
The original /rewind command was exactly the same as it is now but then they removed it and put in the crappy auto rewind that ****ed so many people.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rubitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would rather ask em why their programing and testing is so poor that they need this command in the first place?<br />
<br />
makes sense on test but to need something like this on regular servers is just pathetic...</div></div><hr />
