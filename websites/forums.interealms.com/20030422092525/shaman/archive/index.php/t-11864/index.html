<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">At level 51, the massive increase in the experience required to level makes upgrading equipment to avoid death quite important, and relatively trivial compared to the time it takes to level. <br />
<br />
I think I am wearing average non-twinked equipment for my level (see below), and would like to make some improvements. <br />
<br />
I spent a lot of time and money on getting crafting up for the 5th shawl, and on alchemy, so my treasury is limited.<br />
<br />
What worthwhile shaman equipment can be obtained solo at level 51, and in experience groups at level 51? <br />
<br />
What inexpensive equipment upgrades should I consider purchasing? The metal linked crown and leaf scale gloves were awesome bargains, each 100 plat or less. My guild has about 1 dozen active great players in the level 49-56 range, and one level 60 cleric.<br />
<br />
I currently have the following items equipped:<br />
<br />
|-Left ear: Imbued Golden Ivory Earring  [20595]<br />
|-Head: Metal Linked Crown  [9587]<br />
|-Face: Arctic Wyvern Mask  [24813]<br />
|-Right ear: Imbued Golden Ivory Earring  [20595]<br />
|-Neck: Sabertooth Amulet  [14756]<br />
|-Shoulder: Silk Coldain Prayer Shawl  [1179]<br />
|-Arms: Imbued Northman Ring Sleeves  [21405]<br />
|-Back: Kunzar Cloak  [1617]<br />
|-Left wrist: Jarsath Scale Wrist Guards  [3254]<br />
|-Right wrist: Coldain Military Wristguard  [30168]<br />
|-Range: Spear of Foresight  [6757]<br />
|-Hands: Leaf Scale Gloves  [12083]<br />
|-Primary: Pine Shaft Pike  [8101]<br />
|-Secondary: Sarnak Battle Shield  [9205]<br />
|-Left finger: Velium Fire Wedding Ring  [30339]<br />
|-Right finger: Velium Fire Wedding Ring  [30339]<br />
|-Chest: Barbed Ringmail  [25331]<br />
|-Legs: Kromrif Military Leggings  [30167]<br />
|-Feet: Black Fur Boots  [1678]<br />
|-Waist: Crystalline Belt  [25613]<br />
<br />
I also occasionally use: <br />
Blight, Hammer of Scourge, an Imbued Ivory Collar, a Drakescale Belt, and a Moonstone Ring.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your advice.<br />
