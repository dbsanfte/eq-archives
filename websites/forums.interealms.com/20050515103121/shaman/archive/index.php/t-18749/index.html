<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>iso2202</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just recently dinged 65 (and got epic =D), but another problem has dawned, that is that my cheapest spell is somewhere around 20k, and im flat out broke.... i know that i really cant hope on getting ALL of them soon, so the main ones im targeting are Fot7 and Ferine Avater, not Q cuz i have Torpor atm and its workin fine. So ive been tryin to find a camp that doesnt require a month of camping to make 35k,  Sadly Giants are always camped (both in rath and BW) so i've tried farming in veksar for spell money, i try camping shops solo but the split is to hard, and i dont like workin with other people cuz that means even if the belt drops ill only have a 50% chance of winning and people ive grouped wit have a nasty habit of getting guild OTMs 30 seconds after they loot...i was just wondering if anyone could give me some advice on how to camp the shops (soulscream belt) or mabye another camp...or if im just wasting time on something ment for necros and should try a different zone...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, the trouble with the Shop camp solo is, as you have said, breaking the spawn. The mobs there summon, so it makes root parking for CC a limited choice, and a pacify puller or mezzer or the ability to handle 2-3 mobs solo is darn near a requirement.<br />
I leveled from 58-61 and around 8ish AA in Shop and other veksar camps; there are very few that a shaman can do solo, if only for a lack of DPS. At best, your looking at your Epic, Anathema, Bane and Dog-Dog doing all your DPS and that gets mana hungrey. Personally I can and have done the bottom floor of shop; this was with KEI and a virtue and my gear was a bit lower level than what I have now (not that I am uber by any stretch of the imagination) and it tough. I would suggest a few other camps instead for you:<br />
Behemoth- the iksar behemoth golem drops a caster/priest bracer with ID 4, and it fetches a similar price to the Soulscream, its his really really rare dop though.<br />
Heirophant Vradik, pops in the area just past the fountain from shop, pops in the second alcove (3rd?) as your facing the stage area in that room, he drops the Dented Kunzar Warhelm, a nice plate class helm that fetches 4kish on Karana. All easy pulls.<br />
Trooper Muruk-drops the Darkguard Chestplate (used to be a really decent BP till LDON's Architect one started to flood the markey), hes near the grandmaster area just past the Highborn camp and the area is easily single pullable.<br />
There are a few other camps that are soloable, but to be perfectly honest your looking at long camps with very few (plat wise) rewards. <br />
You really are better off snagging a few friends and forming a group and farming shop together; drops there are streaky, you can get 2 in a hour or not see one in 3-4 days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">VP really helps in breaking this camp, but I did it without.<br />
The mobs in the shops are highly resistant to our dots, although,  the JBB works pretty well. <br />
The hardest spot is the 3 spawn in center where the shop keeper spawns. The trick is to only pull 2 and have your pet tank one and you the other. If you inch your way in, you'll only pull 2. <br />
Ive done it with torpor and it's do-able. It's how I got my 65 spells<br />
<br />
It's been a few months since I did it so the drop rate may have changed, but I was getting at least one a night if not 2. The shop keeper frequently would spawn back to back, sometimes 3. <br />
<br />
Pulling the mobs up the stairs (blacksmith) isn't worth it IMO, I'd go for the behemoth instead, at least he can be dotted.<br />
<br />
rememeber, you only have to break it once. I'm sure you can accomplish it if you put your mind to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">FYI, Quiescence is hands down our best 65 spell, even if you already have torpor.<br />
<br />
You also might want to look into farming some named mobs in Droga.  There's a few guides around, and if you can get some drops, there is a bit of nice cash to be made.  Also, try to get the alternate tactics quest done, you can get runes off named mobs there, as long as awesome exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I second that on Droga, or even Nurga. The only problems there is they run at low health.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">you could always go to BoT and get runes (thats what theyre called isnt it? been too long) with pickup groups /shrug.. doesnt give money to the greedy people, and youve made a bit of xp while youre at it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Bring a knight along (for IVU) if you want to farm Veksar, unless you have Bane it's just too difficult to do any meaningful damage to the undead. Shop probably isn't your best bet for a money camp there, if you can bring a few people along head in deeper and do nobles/highborn for gauntlets or head to the sewers. Solo, I think I'd hit Droga or ChardokB if you can handle the training chardok to get to the zone line. Droga is probably best place to solo for decent money drops.<br />
<br />
As someone else has stated, doesn't matter whether you have Torpor or not, get Q as your first 65 spell, the rest are gravy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>iso2202</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">TY for all da feed back, me thinks im gonna read up on Droga cuz unfortuneatly im still 500 points away from Bane, so I should prolly go somewhere where my Poison DoTs are effective...thou after what i read im wish i bought Q instead of torpor &amp; a horse when i had 40k =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have grown very fond of Droga personally.  Tho I prefer to take a group a guildies down there as it's a good place where at 65 I get decent AA xp while I can group with a 50ish lvl guildie who will get good xp as well.  The cash split is generally decent and the large amount of named mobs you can camp for is nice.  Solo the Runri camp might be the best bet.  He is a single spawn and there is a safe spot in the next room where you can setup without worrying about aggro.  Most of the other named spawns would be multiple pulls, usually of casters, which can be very annoying.  The dagger Runri drops sells for 2-3k on Vazaelle, the haste belt around 20k IIRC.  The gobs in that area have around 10k hp or so (maybe it's more) but it usually took 1 Utlor and 2 Blood of Saryrn's, plus dogdog to kill the placeholder.  I don't have great gear, only about 3200hp self buffed so I always got a virtue and KEI if possible if I was heading down to solo.  Usually I just have to say in guild chat &quot;i'm going down to Droga, anyone want to come&quot; and I end up with at least a 4 person group.  I've kinda gotten most of the guild hooked on it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You don't need a knight along.  You can just make yourself some ITU potions to go.  I always have one on me for just such occasions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You don't need a knight along.  You can just make yourself some ITU potions to go.  I always have one on me for just such occasions.<br />
<br />
Unless you're gonna camp golems you do need a melee partner to hunt efficiently in Veksar, ime. At least I did (pre-Bane), haven't been back since then. Might as well make it a knight so you don't have to waste any IVU potions. But yeah, you don't need a knight along I just think paladins and SKs make excellent partners for Veksar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>khazmun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">65 shaman in my guild regularly solos the shop without much trouble.  The way he breaks the spawns is he will set up in the corner by the stairs up to blacksmith.  From there you can inch around the corner til you see the PH for the named, root him and the mob in the middle will come solo.  Take care of him then kill the PH.  Not very difficult as long as you are able to keep the one rooted and out of the way because they won't summon until you do some damage to them.  The ldon spell Odium will stick on veksar mobs, I think its in the neighborhood of 500 MM points or so.  Not a amazingly damaging dot but its better than nothing. <br />
Other camps to check into in veksar are the chef, which drops Gomdurig and the kylong waist item which both sell pretty well, and the mob that drops the darkmail pauldrons, his name escapes me at the moment.  Both of these PHs are easy single pulls and you can fight them with no fear of adds if you pay attention to your positioning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Myself at 65, Veksar is the VERY best and easiest zone I have found to farm, and this is coming from a casual raiding guild (we can take terris, but fail on Manaetic Behemoth).<br />
<br />
With KEI and virtue and self I buff to about 5200 hp and around 1070 ac and the only camps in veksar that I either simply cannot do or have troubles with are the Sewers (necklace of dark rituals, kylong darkmail boots and coif and a couple other drops here).  Hardest part I have with sewers is keeping all 3 mobs parked and the mana to burn all 3 down back to back.  I do not do the highborns either, too many hp and hit a bit too rough.  Same goes for the highborn commanders and such (being smacked for upper 400's repeatedly sucks a bit).  and then the other spot I can't really do effectively is Remains of Sythrax.  Problem there is mana issues, I'll go oom (even with cani's) before he drops solo.<br />
<br />
Chef is easy to do same with the dogs/kennel (same room as chef, 1/36 chance for loot on dogs, random drop), monks, church and a ton others are very simple to do as a shaman.  Necro guildmate (350+AA) can run through all of shop and blacksmith and I can take over and kill about 2-3 mobs less than him.<br />
<br />
The *only* other problem I have in veksar is the occasional Fear that lands (most often resist with 100MR).  Got feared in shop and had 4 on me.  Told my cleric to gate to save herself...and I managed to kill all 4 without stopping...Pet tanked (i jumped in now and then).<br />
<br />
When I go down, dogdog has no mage weapons and nothing aside of Focus, replen, SLW, Boar, Wrulon, Ancestral Guard (OMG!  AG has a freaking use!), sometimes FA, and anything else I didn't mention (he's better buffed than ME! aside of kei/virtue).  You can either kill with pet tanking..keep Q and Tnargs up to heal dogdog, pull with slow, then debuff (i know, I'm a deviant), root mob, pet dogdog take aggro, drop inbane around 85-90% health, Q dogdog when needed and then I use Velium strike.  Since you don't have it, use the next lower Ice Nuke (forget the name offhand).<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
Go ahead and tank for dogdog (i love my Delightful orb for that 320 cold proc), and just Q yourself, toss in bane/Anathema/Odium or whichever MR dot you have, and the occasional ice nuke.  ANd don't get feared! heh.<br />

<br />
Good luck with getting your 65's.  I know I went through hell buying mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Veksar is ok but Droga yields far more salable loot, Kingly Boots 16k Copper Hammer 20k Bloodsworn 8k and so on, I would usually pick up at least these three items in anyone one 2-3 hour session.<br />
More often than not I would have hand off to various alts to get more.<br />
<br />
I was making on average 30k a night in there, which is good when you only have 3-4 nights a week to play.<br />
<br />
Trouble on Brell is the market for these items has plumeted, dunno why but lately every man and his dog is selling these items, but I'm happy I bought 2 ornate bracers and legs, so thats all I wanted.<br />
<br />
Hope the market is more stable on your server.<br />
<br />
BTW I would camp shop in Veksar when Droga was full I'm a 65 Shaman and I could do it easily, someone put a great guide in the 'hunting grounds' section ( dont have time to look) it tells you which mob to root for root pulls solo.<br />
<br />
Basically root the closest of the three in the shop and only the middle one will come. There is more to it but that would ruin your fun took me 3 tries to perfect it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I solo in Veksar all the time. I am only level 64 with very ordinary gear and a patchy spell book. Soloing is easy in Veksar. Money is good. I have been able to buy torpor, and 2 or 3 other spells recently (yes, I soloed without torpor too) and a few small gear upgrades<br />
<br />
I do not solo the shops - far too tough for a ghetto shaman such as I. Nevertheless, although the soulscream belt is the cash-cow item of the zone, you can make plenty of steady plat in easier safer places...<br />
<br />
The Theatre is the easiest (yawn) spot. Bascially, when you hit the golem area, instead of turning right to get to the shops, go straight over to the next area and then diagonally right to get to the theate.<br />
<br />
The good thing about the theatre is that there are 3 named all pop within a very small area. Each named or PH can be single pulled easily, and there are no wandering mobs.<br />
<br />
The loot from the 3 named is not spectacular:<br />
1. Dented Kunzar Helm 2.5k &amp; Moss covered leggings 2.5k<br />
2. Narathius (piercer) 1k &amp; Mantle of Ill Omen 3k<br />
3. Ribbon of Empathy 4k and Bow of Gloaming 1k<br />
sure - not big coin, but steady safe money.<br />
<br />
If the theatre is camped, it is also possible (although harder) to camp the 3 named on the way down from the start of the undead to the golem area. The first 2 (PH's Phantom and Duke) are very easy, can be single pulled easily, and are cake - the guy after the swim is harder - I am not able to single pull him (but I'm not very good), but it is still possible to keep all 3 clear. from memory, loot includes:<br />
Earring of Darkfaith<br />
Glowing Bath Token &amp; Shiny Pantaloons<br />
Ring (forget name)...bleurgh cant remember rest.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the point is, that you don't need to go for the high profile high resale loot - by camping multiple easy named, you can make good safe steady plat</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Just a small point but the area you are talking about Weyalan is not the theatre.   The theatre is up the ramp that is right next to the Behemoth spawn, and all the mobs in there see through IVU so you have to work your way in.   It's a very good camp if you know which spawn to kill.   I think the camp you are talking about is the church or something.<br />
<br />
Anyway, Veksar is not a great place to solo if you dont have Bane of Anathama yet.  I used to solo alot here with just my Ice nukes, dog and epic, but it takes forever and is boring as hell.  now that I have both curse spells soloing here is cake ... yet still incredibly boring.   I have camped Chef and I think 3 other nameds in the vicinity of chef and let me tell you the spawn rate absolutely sucks.   We're talking 6 hours and no rare spawn at 4 camps.<br />
<br />
Imo go to Droga and check it out, you're likely to get rich faster there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Just to add, I wouldn't even bother buying FA. It's just a pain to hear FA from melees constantly, specially on raids. If you're in a big guild good chances they'll buy it for you and if you're not in a big guild, there's no point in getting it.<br />
<br />
Also BoT can be nice for 65 spells but it all depends on luck. I won 1 rune out of the many many times I've grouped there and seen them drop. (I did get Fot7 with that rune though :))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">FA was the first level 65 spell I bought.  I already had torpor and malo so Q and Malos weren't a big deal for me, and fo7 was way too expensive.  FA I got at what I consider a steal at the time, for only 15k.   I bought it becuase it is such a huge boost for melle, requires no component, and the fact that I group with all melee groups quite a lot so it was worth it to me.<br />
<br />
Now with 65% buff extension (SCRM + EE4)  I can keep FA on about 5 or 6 toons with no problems.  Think about it for a second,  adding 140atk to 5 or 6 rangers/rogues is a huge melee boost for your typical raid,  in ldon if you have 5 melee and you that is an insane dps boost to your group.<br />
<br />
I think FA is worth it ~</div></div><hr />
