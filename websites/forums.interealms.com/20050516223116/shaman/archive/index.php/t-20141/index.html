<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Disclaimer: The following is a separate issue from class balancing, though the two may overlap at times. Please pretend all classes are balanced when reading this.<br />
<br />
A lot of people have complained about the need for warriors and clerics in the GoD single group trials. I believe this is largely because of the zone and encounter design in these trials, namely MOBs with huge melee DPS and medium to low HPs.<br />
Huge melee DPS favors warriors and clerics, and the short fight duration means some other classes' contribution, for example shaman slowing is diminished.<br />
<br />
So far the pattern in GoD is the same - next tier, up melee DPS on the MOBs. There is no changes apart from that at all on the trash and few changes on the nameds, usually in the form of slow mitigation.<br />
<br />
What does that mean?<br />
It means there might as well be a single type of MOB in GoD, with minor changes to HPs and varying melee damage, depending on the tier. This single MOB type favors clerics and warriors.<br />
<br />
What can be done?<br />
Not a whole lot at this point I would think, unless SOE actually wants to spend a lot of time going back through the GoD zones and redesign them (I can hope though).<br />
<br />
What could have been done? What can be done for future zones/expansions?<br />
What would have been great is a more variable MOB design. For example, alongside the current low HPs, high melee DPS MOBs there could be numerous smaller, lesser hitting swarm type MOBs. There could be fewer but very high HPs MOBs with somewhat lesser DPS capabilities. There could be MOBs that do a lot of their damage via procs or AEs. There could be casters casting NPC only damage spells that hit for, say 6K.<br />
<br />
What would that accomplish?<br />
The current MOB type favors clerics and warriors. High HP MOBs favor the DoT classes. Swarm MOBs favor the mez classes and classes with group heals. MOBs with big procs favor the knights (superior warrior mitigation does not kick in and both classes can self heal) and Wizards(Spellshield). MOBs with AEs favor casters and classes with group heals.<br />
<br />
A scenario<br />
Imagine the Tipt trial. Now, imagine as you zone in you had 2 possible paths. One with the current MOB type, one with high HP MOBs (but fewer of them). A group with a cleric and warrior will take left, a group with a Shadowknight, Necromanc,er Druid and Shaman will take the right.<br />
A while later the paths merge and split again. The left side has the Cragbeast as is, the other has a different boss, say a single MOB with an AE slow. A group with solid tanking and healing takes the left, a group that does not rely on melee DPS takes the right.<br />
Each group kills a boss, the paths meet again. The left side now has swarm type MOBs, the right side has MOBs that proc huge DDs. A group with a lot of tanks or pets or lots of group healing takes the left, a group with a Knight and a rune class takes the right.<br />
<br />
Random or fixed (I think I would prefer fixed so you do not run into an all swarm type trial or the like), this would give SOE the opportunity to design challenging trials while not relying on the same 'new tier, up melee DPS by 30%' formua they currently seem to be using. It would allow the DoT classes to actually use their DoTs. It would allow the 'light tank' classes to actually get to offtank. It would allow mages to offtank again. It would allow the clerics to use stuns, group heals and CH, depending on the current MOB type. It would allow Knights to act as tanks while still challenging warriors. It would even allow classes to live with minor to medium class balance issues without immediatly feeling underpowered.<br />
<br />
You could even reuse the same MOB types in raid encounters and people would recognize them from their single group trials. (For example, Pookahs could be the swarms, golems the high HP MOBs, etc.)<br />
<br />
All in all I think I would have enjoyed the expansion a lot more if the trials had been designed that way and people would not wait for hours to find a cleric or three druids so they can go and flag someone.<br />
<br />

When the designers purposely but shaman spells in GoD on an NPC named Hatem, you think there is any reason to hope?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Started farming Kod Taz and Ikkinz last week, and it sucks, i fully agree. SoE imagined the best guild breaker ever ! No more KS, just long lame trials, where you cant flag more than 1 or 2 people at a time because of the class requirement. Dare you wipe, and you are good for 45min sitting waiting for a rogue or necro to come by and help you get your corpse.<br />
<br />
Isnt there some problem here? Arent we supposed to play a game, not against it? Where is the interest in sitting 45 min at zone in? Where is the interest with requiring such group configuration for trials? Where is the fun in fact? Required classes will do it over and over again, while other will go farm ****s somewhere else, whithout most of their warriors and clerics. Very smart indeed. I tried some trials, that require not much skill. Just uber stuff, and burn heal + burn DPS mostly, and sometimes mezzes.<br />
<br />
Murtak, you are too smart to work for SoE, i like your ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Good read Murtak. I lose confidence in sony in alot of ways sometimes. They seem to have a hard time balancing stuff with the straight forward design they have now. I worry the trouble they would have with your good ideas. <br />
<br />
I do get tired sometimes of the same ole same ole. Wonder why all fights seem to have to be fast fast fast and a group with alot of smaller healer doesnt have anything to use that advantage. <br />
<br />
We used to play 2 shaman , pally , sk , bst and ranger. That is trouble with alot of newer stuff. One shaman is now a mage and that helps dps but healing is trouble in higher places. Would of like to see more use for all the heal of times that could be thrown around and the group heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">all fights are like that cause without it, it's too easy.  That's why fights are designed now with just straight dps involved.<br />
<br />
Really, it's not that hard to get back to your corpse once you wipe.  Cleric gets up DA and can make it back fairly easy.  And, I don't know about you guys, but I have yet to really just absolutely wipe where everyone dies other than the first time in them.  Why?  Because the zoneline is about 10 steps away.  Sure, a few of you might die, but usually ifyou bring more than one or two into camp the theme is &quot;run for your lives&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">all fights are like that cause without it, it's too easy.  That's why fights are designed now with just straight dps involved.<br />
So did you even bother to read my post before replying? There is a big difference between &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;lots straight melee DPS&quot;.<br />
A fight can be hard with less DPS if the MOB has 10 times the HPs. A fight can be hard with less melee DPS if the MOB also procs a huge DD or a bit DoT that needs to be cured. A fight can be hard without any DPS if the MOB instead nukes for 6K. A fight can be hard with less DPS if you have 5 MOBs instead of 1.<br />
The variations are endless. On the Coirnav encounter, do the individual MOBs do a lot of DPS? No, clearly they do not. Is the encounter still hard? Sure is.<br />
Does the Emperor of SSra do a lot of melee DPS? No, not really. Is it still a hard MOB to tank for appropriatly geared people? Yep.<br />
<br />
It should be possible to bring similar variety to single group encounters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Have you ever fought a caster mob in ldon or any place for that matter?  They are so much easier than tank mobs because they sit there and waste all their mana casting spells on you that more than likely with our equipment are resisted.  Sure, add a huge proc to their dps.  That still makes more healing needed.  Bring in five mobs instead of 1 and you know have an encounter that's cannot be designed for one group (not including the DD from ikk 1 of course, but that's a different story since they don't come out at once).  Add alot of hps to the mobs, and you now have what is referred to as the luclin curse.  How many people liked to fight the named in vt when you could go afk for 10 min and come back and he's still at 50%.  <br />
<br />
I understand what you are getting at, I'm justsaying that jacking up dps seems to be about the best way to go.  It's why the jack up their dps but keep their hps down enough to make it feasible to kill with one group.  Personally, I think the ikk trials are just about the hardest thing that I've ever done in EQ and about the most satisfying when I finally beat them all for the first time.  Didn't think that I'd ever get through them, especially without being in the groups that my guild would consider to be the &quot;Power&quot; ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I really hate sony impose 2 choice : Big badass dps with low hp ,and weak melee with a ton of HP.<br />
<br />
      No really ,there better choice : special ability. GoD's mob have some ability but they need more ,or some mini scripted event like PoP god fight. They can link some mob ,make group of mob . They should also improve the IA . But well that cost money contrary to their solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Have you ever fought a caster mob in ldon or any place for that matter?  They are so much easier than tank mobs because they sit there and waste all their mana casting spells on you that more than likely with our equipment are resisted.<br />
Hence my proposal of letting them cast different spells. Resists or not, a 2K nuke is silly when MOBs melee for more.<br />
<br />
Sure, add a huge proc to their dps.  That still makes more healing needed.<br />
No, you misunderstood my entire proposal. Lower their melee DPS, then add a proc. That makes it possible to balance MOBs so Knights can tank them and Warriors still do not trivialize them.<br />
As a side effects it would make CHs less reliable (as proc damage spikes) and runing classes more valuable.<br />
<br />
Bring in five mobs instead of 1 and you know have an encounter that's cannot be designed for one group<br />
Yes, it can - reread my proposal. These MOBs would have to have a lesser DPS then the current MOBs.<br />
<br />
Add alot of hps to the mobs, and you now have what is referred to as the luclin curse.  How many people liked to fight the named in vt when you could go afk for 10 min and come back and he's still at 50%.<br />
Even multiplying the HPs by 10 would make them last only 5 minutes. I do not see the harm in getting to actually use my disease DoTs, possibly even twice per fight!<br />
<br />
I understand what you are getting at, I'm justsaying that jacking up dps seems to be about the best way to go.  It's why the jack up their dps but keep their hps down enough to make it feasible to kill with one group.<br />
But this pattern favors a few classes, does not matter to most of them, and nerfs a few classes. Shaman (and some other classes) are going to need constant rebalancing at least every other expansion if this continues.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think the ikk trials are just about the hardest thing that I've ever done in EQ and about the most satisfying when I finally beat them all for the first time.  Didn't think that I'd ever get through them, especially without being in the groups that my guild would consider to be the &quot;Power&quot; ones.<br />
So did you beat them without a Cleric?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I don't think that scenario would really work Murtak since it would be very difficult to balance two paths to be of the same difficulty. One path would allways be seen as the line of least resistance and you would just end with everyone doing that. It would be sort of like the PoJ trials. Supposedly they were designed to be of similar difficulty, with different tactics being appropriate so that groups with different class makeups could do them, but it ended up with everyone doing the exe trial, with the ensuing logjam associated with that in the day.<br />
<br />
Tipt isnt THAT difficult once you have a few runs in it and understand how it works. Of course it helps to have decent gear, but if you look at Kodtaz as a Time level zone, then the difficulty of Tipt is about right. Sort of like having to pass Coirnav and RC ;).<br />
<br />
When designing a &quot;difficult&quot; encounter for a single group I imagine that their options are fairly limited. You have a lot more options when designing content for multiple groups or raids. If you have high dps/lw hp mobs as your gatekeepers, it becomes very unforgiving. You have to play well to succeed since the slightest mistake will cost you. It does have the effect of separating out the skilled from the unskilled, and that is pretty much what you want from a gatekeeper zone. I expect that there are high skill poorly equiped groups who beat the encounter while low skill well equiped groups do not. Having an alternative route with lower dps/higher hp mobs (and probably more of them) would be very difficult to implement as gatekeepers to KodTaz. For the simple reason that the only way to make it &quot;difficult&quot; is to place resource requirement at such a level that poorly equiped (ie folk less advanced in progression) can't do it while those well equiped (ie advanced progression)  could. Then you would end up with VT-like timesink fights. Given the choices, I expect that most people who are capable of getting into KT would choose to do the high dps/low hp route, simply because it would be faster. Those that couldn't handle that route wouldn't be able to handle the other either since they wouldn't have the gear.<br />
<br />
I haven't had a chance to do the later trials after tipt but from the sounds of it there are a few bottlenecks there. Now, I suppose they could design parallel trials that emphasized the attributes of different classes, but I still think that given choices, conventional wisdom will decide that one of them is the best route and pretty much everyone would be funneled through that route. If you had a trial that produced X adds and required 2 or more mezzers, and it was percieved as the easier/faster route, I can pretty much guarentee that everyone would be doing that trial. A few classes would end up bearing most of the burden, much as is the case now.<br />
<br />
BTW, Mobs with big procs wouldn't favor knights over warriors since warriors have a very effective disc to deal with that scenario: Evasive. Warriors would still be far superior in such an encounter.</div></div><hr />

That would definitely not be easy. I think I would even prefer a somewhat unbalanced version to the current implementation though.<br />
<br />
Tipt isnt THAT difficult once you have a few runs in it and understand how it works.<br />
I am not complaining about Tipt difficulty - I am complaining about Tipt unbalance. You can get through it with a bazaar geared group of Cleric / Warrior / Enchanter / any extra healer. We had to take 2 Clerics and a Shaman to keep a time geared Shadowknight alive.<br />
<br />
When designing a &quot;difficult&quot; encounter for a single group I imagine that their options are fairly limited. You have a lot more options when designing content for multiple groups or raids.<br />
I do not think you have more options. It certainly does take more effort to put a vaeriety of content into every zone, which I think is the main reason it is not done. That extra effort seems to be reserved for raids.<br />
<br />
If you have high dps/lw hp mobs as your gatekeepers, it becomes very unforgiving. You have to play well to succeed since the slightest mistake will cost you. It does have the effect of separating out the skilled from the unskilled, and that is pretty much what you want from a gatekeeper zone. I expect that there are high skill poorly equiped groups who beat the encounter while low skill well equiped groups do not.<br />
No, it separates the clericless groups from the ones with a Cleric. You will need an amazing amount of skill and an even greater amount of gear to make up for the lack of a Cleric.<br />
<br />
Having an alternative route with lower dps/higher hp mobs (and probably more of them) . . <br />
No, if anything there should be fewer of them. The total duration for all routes should be similar.<br />
<br />
. . would be very difficult to implement as gatekeepers to KodTaz. For the simple reason that the only way to make it &quot;difficult&quot; is to place resource requirement at such a level that poorly equiped (ie folk less advanced in progression) can't do it while those well equiped (ie advanced progression)  could. Then you would end up with VT-like timesink fights. Given the choices, I expect that most people who are capable of getting into KT would choose to do the high dps/low hp route, simply because it would be faster.<br />
See above - the routes should be similar in duration.<br />
<br />
Those that couldn't handle that route wouldn't be able to handle the other either since they wouldn't have the gear.<br />
I am fine with these trials requiring a certain amount of gear. ToV requires top Kunark gear, Vex Thal requires top Velious gear and so on. I have an issue with these trials favoring a few classes to such a large degree.<br />
<br />
I haven't had a chance to do the later trials after tipt but from the sounds of it there are a few bottlenecks there.<br />
Remember the Tipt boss? Put him on steroids, make him complately unslowable, hello lesser Ikkinz nameds.<br />
<br />
Now, I suppose they could design parallel trials that emphasized the attributes of different classes, but I still think that given choices, conventional wisdom will decide that one of them is the best route and pretty much everyone would be funneled through that route.

While it is certainly impossible to balance these trials completely it should certainly be possible to balance them in such a way that other group combinations then Warrior / Cleric work. Noone minds if the Warrior / Cleric / Enchanter gorup gets through in 90 minutes if the Shadowknight / Druid / Shaman / Necromancer group can also get through, even if it takes them 2 hours or even 2 and a half.<br />
As is, if it is hard for the first group the second group will die.</div></div><hr />

I understand what you are saying, but, these are primarily progression trials, not exp/loot events, and as such they have to present a difficulty barrier that applies to any group that might enter. The only way to accomodate unusual group compositions is to have the zone set the difficulty based on who is in the group, not have separate paths. You can't create content in a single zone that will doable by any group composition because what is reasonable for one setup is trivial for another. Whether you can do a zone like Tipt with a druid/shaman combo as opposed to the cleric setup, I don't know. I suspect that you could, but you would have to be more careful and it would probably take a lot longer. When dealing with the nameds in tipt, I think a lot can be accomplished with melee's immune based damage dealing discs. Unfortunately knights don't get these, so using them to tank minis in the face isn't going to work well, even if they have a cleric and are well equiped. So you would need to use other mellees to do the job. Warriors are clearly the best here, but monks and rangers (not that familiar with rogues) could certainly perform the same function.</div></div><hr />

But that is not the case - these trials, especially the Tipt and Ikkinz trials have a difficulty value that is moderately hard (Tipt) to very hard (Ikkinz) for a Warrior / Cleric combination, extremely hard to borderline impossible for Knight / Cleric and flat out impossible for a Knight / Druid combination.<br />
<br />
The Plane of Justice trials, while skewed towards high DPS groups, did not require any certain class. Even the executioner himself was doable without a Cleric or a Warrior.<br />
<br />
Why is that? Because none of these trials, not even the executioner trial, was a mindless &quot;new expansion, same MOB, more melee DPS&quot; design. You had a crowd to control, things to tank, a time limit - none of this in GoD.<br />
<br />
The only way to accomodate unusual group compositions is to have the zone set the difficulty based on who is in the group, not have separate paths. You can't create content in a single zone that will doable by any group composition because what is reasonable for one setup is trivial for another.<br />
Hence putting in a lot of varied content. Every group combination should find at least one of the paths they have to take hard and challenging.<br />
<br />
If you have 3 paths and 3 bosses on the way to the flag and find one of the 6 very hard, 2 hard, 2 moderately hard and 1 trivial you have had a challenge overall.<br />
<br />
Whether you can do a zone like Tipt with a druid/shaman combo as opposed to the cleric setup, I don't know. I suspect that you could, but you would have to be more careful and it would probably take a lot longer.<br />
If you have a very very well equipped warrior you might. With a Knight I see no way at all of keeping him up on the boss.<br />

<br />
Monks cant taunt, but then they dont have to. The key to using that particular tactic in tipt is that the invul tank has to have a way of handing off agro to the next tank (or they die, which has pretty much the same result ;) ). Monks can do this indirectly using FD. Since they wont be recieving healing during their riposte disc, the healers wont be generating hate. When the first monk FDs, the next tank (who would have been meleeing during the first phase and building agro) would automatically be on top of the agro list. Its a somewhat harder to do with a ranger since they don't have a reliable means of getting agro. They can use spells, but that probably cant be done fast enough. Under normal circumstances you would probably be using a monk/ranger combo here anyway. Of course the way you really want to do this is use a ranger/monk to pull, and then AE taunt of with a warrior, but, it is concievable to do it with other class combos, it would just be riskier. You *might* be able to use a knight as a primary tank in this scenario, using their invul spells, but they would probably require a monk as a lead. I doubt that a ranger would be suitable, unless they sacrificed.</div></div><hr />

Even for other classes that DO have taunt...taunt doesn't always work.  My SK has had his taunt maxed for ages, and sees it fail fairly regularly, sometimes a few times in a row.<br />
<br />
How is a cleric or a druid going to tank some of these monsters for as long as it takes for taunt to lock on?  Even the legendary &quot;snap aggro&quot; of a SK gets there over time, as his snares do their DOT aggro per tick or just get cast over and over again whether they stick or not, or as fear gets cast, greys out, gets cast again, taunt is hit when appropriate, etc.  <br />
<br />
If aggro lock isn't instant, how is anybody else going to survive, especially after the healers are dead? <br />

Even the legendary &quot;snap aggro&quot; of a SK gets there over time, as his snares do their DOT aggro per tick or just get cast over and over again whether they stick or not, or as fear gets cast, greys out, gets cast again, taunt is hit when appropriate, etc.  <br />
<br />
If aggro lock isn't instant, how is anybody else going to survive, especially after the healers are dead? <br />
<br />
And we're talking about mobs that shred time geared SK's and pallys in the first place.<br />
<br />
In the specific encounter we are talking about the healers wont be getting healing agro since they wont be healing. In the case of a monk passing agro, they do that by FDing. If the other tanks have been engaging with the appropiate agro generation, the next invul tank will automatically have agro. For warriors its simple, they use AE taunt, which allways works (unless you have a bad z axis). Ideally you would want run it through a monk, followed by a ranger, followed by a warrior. It's a simple matter of controlling the agro order and passing it down the tank line as invul discs wear off. It's difficult and it takes skill, but done properly it is extremely successfull. It's all about YOU being in control of the fight, or not being in control, as the case may be ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">It's called riposte<br />
Monk damage, even with riposte, will not pull aggro of a chainnuking wizard, a shadowknight in damage dealing mode or a dotting shaman. Monks have no taunt skill and no taunt spells. At best they have taunting procs on their weapons.<br />
Sure, you can give the monk a headstart and he will probably hold aggro but these riposte disciplines do not last forever.<br />
<br />
You will need to go all out on damage and a monk cannot outtaunt full damage mode on<br />
- wizards<br />
- necromancers<br />
- shaman<br />
- shadowknights<br />
and is at best dubious at outtaunting<br />
- magicians<br />
- beastlords<br />
- druids<br />
- monks<br />
- rogues<br />
<br />
that leaves<br />
- rangers<br />
- clerics<br />
- paladins<br />
- warriors<br />
- enchanters<br />
<br />
So the only DPS class a monk can reliably taunt off is a ranger. You might get away with riposte tanking, especially if you can finish the boss with the first tank (read: charm DPS) but reyling on monk aggro is sketchy at best.<br />

FD can fail. Usually you cannot afford to waste damage by having one of your damage dealers dead.<br />

If you already have a warrior why would you want to use ripsote tanking instead of defensive tanking which works just fine?<br />
Riposte tanking is what you suggested to use in case one did not have a warrior.<br />

It also takes luck, lots of it. Oh, and a group makeup that is just as extreme, if not more so, then the warrior + 2 healer makeup.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't take luck at all. It takes not sucking. FD can fail on monks but usually it doesn't. Regarding your coments about risposte discs, I think you are completely missing the point of using these discs. Remember that at least when first engaged many of these mobs are unslowed or hasted. The dps from a riposte disc is huge under these circumstances. For example, parsing done with warrior furious have shown numbers in the 700-1000 dps range on unslowed mobs. I'm not sure what a monks output is, its likely lower, but it will still be far in excess of what most other dps classes are capable of. And since the monk won't be taking damage during this phase it's free dps, together with the dps from other members of the group. It's not unheard of for tanks to take zero damage in killing the tipt names. My warrior has MTed the maternal in tipt 7 or 8 times, for example, and has been hit exactly 3 times. These discs are that powerfull. That's with pookas doing their thing of course, but even in Inikkinz where you don't have that advantage you can still take off a significant chunk of the mobs hp through smart use of discs and agro control.<br />

Furious is commonly used as a prequel to defensive since it allows the warrior to build a huge hate platform without being damaged. In the old days when discs were linked you couldn't do this, but after the melee balancing, discs were separated into 4 timer groups which can be used independently. Basically the 4 groups are (1) defensive discs (2) offensive discs; (3) invul discs; and (4) utility discs. (4) is rarely used but (1) and (3) are basic tools for modern warriors. Generally in the course of an encounter you lead off with furious (our riposte disc) to build agro and to allow time for debuffs and the chain to set on you. The moment that fades you hit your defensive disc. Usually that would be defensive, but sometimes evasive or stonewall might be used. During all of this a tank would likely pop off a few incites, so at that point their endurance pool would be mostly drained. But, if your end pool is large enough, you can hit your offensive disc as soon as the defensive one falls. If your warriors aren't doing this, they need to take some basic tanking lessons ;) [I suspect they are, they just aren't telling you about it  :D ]</div></div><hr />
