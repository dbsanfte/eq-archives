<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Loradenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am going to start playing EQ again after about a 16 month break.  I used to have a level 65 shaman and level 50 monk.  I'm looking for a good duo to 2 box that can do it all, heals, tank, DPS, utility, etc.  Also classes that are wanted in raids and groups, but the combo can also duo if neccessary.<br />
Remember that I will be starting both characters at level 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">what did u do with ur other chars? i know this is off topic.. and also u could try a tank or a cleric.. i have a thread sort of bout this here (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=22519) but a little bit diff.. and some people have said whats good</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">but actually if that doesnt help ya.. (i still havent picked one out).. then yeah it would be cool for more partners listed here</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Druid + Enchanter:  Heals, Ports, Group Mana Regen, HP Buffs, CC, Haste, Slow, Snare.  <br />
<br />
Shaman + SK: Heals, Self Mana Regen, HP Buffs, CC, Tanking not involving a charmed pet, Snare, Slow, Haste.<br />
<br />
Cleric + Paladin: Massive HP Buffs, Healing Power, focus on undead to accentuate DPS.<br />
<br />
Off the top of my head.  I imagine you could pick any two of Necro, Bard, and Wizard for a pretty decent outdoor kiting duo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">oh.. heh im sorry i thought u meant with a shaman lor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kellenial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm sure there will be some disagreement with me on this, but here goes.<br />
<br />
Nobody knows your play style and what works for you better than you. The best duo will be the one that best suits your personal style of playing. If kiting's your thing, tailor the duo to that; on the other hand, some find kiting to be boring. If you like battling undead, paladin/cleric. If you like root rotting, pick ones that do that well. I've seen mage/necro and rogue/necro fear kite well. My wife and I started 5 years ago as paladin/enchanter which, while not a great duo group then, has some benefits now, if either of us still played them. We currently play rogue/shaman combo.<br />
<br />
Again, to me the &quot;best duo&quot; would be more accentuated by your playstyle and less dependent on the pros and cons of the classes involved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This is subject must be the most common in the history of these boards.<br />
<br />
I like shaman/pally (out of personal preference), but there are so many many many other combos that are even better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinin Raine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Shaman &amp; SK</div></div><hr />

The first 2 are search strings, one searching &quot;Partner&quot; the second searching &quot;duo&quot;<br />
<br />
The third is from The Medicine Cabinet which probably has some of the same threads as either of the first 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Beastlord/Druid and Shaman/Shadowknight are the two melee/healer duos that can do anything at any level.  Definitely the two power duos of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">what is your play style?<br />
<br />
Do you want to do lots of ldons?<br />
Bard/Cleric is a log on for instant group spam.<br />
<br />
Want to go places and kill things?<br />
SK/Sham is very self sufficient.<br />
<br />
Want to be wanted in a guild?<br />
Cleric/Necro or Cleric/Wizzy.<br />
<br />
Its a toss up between mage (nuke but have to watch pet occasionally) and wizzy (just nuke every x seconds) that allows you to still be productive whilst attending to the precise timing requirements of a cheal chain.<br />
<br />
Want to be a bad arse?<br />
Chanter/Druid is great for charm kiting. Snare and evac make charm kiting much safer.<br />
<br />
Chanter druid is also great for trade skilling, go anywhere, track and stupendous charm dps for farming greenies.<br />
<br />
Then again, i had a lot of fun running two mages for a while. Send in the pets, when one dies just cast another.<br />
<br />
Very decent dps.<br />
<br />
Chanter is a good two box participant cause they can mezz. and running away is difficult when your trying to control two chars.<br />
<br />
So in summary:<br />
LDONS: Bard/Cleric<br />
Duoing: Sham and SK or Pally or Warr. (the tanking gap between knights and warrs is so great now that warrs while lacking in utility are a far superior damage taker)<br />
Guild: cleric/Nuker<br />
Tradeskills AA whore: Chanter/druid.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'd do a shm/pal combo.  It's just for the tank factor... and the rezzes.<br />
<br />
-Fin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Halamdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Shammy (if u must choose shammy ) + <br />
<br />
SK ( due to FD pull , FD pet pull and snare + Fairly good tank + corpse summon if **** hit the fan )<br />
<br />
Best xp and leveling combo IMO = druid + ench <br />
<br />
Best wannable combo for raid  = cleric + wizzy<br />
<br />
IMO, anyone who want to duo box char and play Bard is ..........<br />
<br />
Playing bard on its own is a pain, without macroing programme, if u choose Bard + shammy combo .. , it will be fun , :P ( and tell me if u wrist is still Ok after say 3 months later )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">old content, SK/Shaman.<br />
<br />
once you get Time/GoD stuff on you, War/Cleric.<br />
<br />
have a friend that has two boxed the Junk Beast (PoI) with his cleric and one of his guildies' uber warriors. crazy.<br />
<br />
lots of ways to go. certain areas, situations, or mobs are very easy for certain combinations. examples...druid/enchanter duoing fire tower in BoT. junk beast being done by the war/cleric. sham/sk duo on tenador (sp?) in skyfire. wiz/necro can be crazy. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
personal favorite is sham/sk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shambler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">What I see as the main needs for a non caster duo (which are easir imo) are a healer, someone that can cast slow, DPS and moderate tanking. So shaman + any melle or tank class<br />
or<br />
Priest + Beast<br />
<br />
Shaman + Warrior (hitpoint benifit)<br />
Shaman + Paladin  (Rez)<br />
Shaman + SK        (FD, snare)<br />
Shaman + Beastlord (pet and Mana regen) What I have atm, but I am thinking about getting a warrior or monk for my shaman and a druid for my beast.<br />
Shaman + Ranger  (snare, harmony, Range atack capable)<br />
Shaman + Monk    (FD, monk lul)<br />
<br />
Druid + Beastlord<br />
Cleric + Beastlord<br />
<br />
A bard would make a great partner.. but hell I don't think I could 2 box one without cheating.</div></div><hr />
