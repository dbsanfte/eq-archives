<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok guys, my bard is very close to epic, all he's missing is UDB and trak. I have a group of RL buddies that would be willing to help me get it, but I need to know if you think it's doable. My main concern with attempting trak is all the adds. Here would be the group makeup:<br />
<br />
Warrior, 250ish AAs, 9k HP w/ virtue/fos<br />
Me (see magelo)<br />
Cleric, 65, no AAs, 3500 mana pool, epic<br />
Necro, 200ish AAs, decent gear(some time)<br />
Mage, 100ish AAs, crappy gear<br />
Druid, 150ish AAs, half elemental gear<br />
<br />
I figure that we could straight up tank trak at his spawn point, and when the warrior gets banished, I can step in to tank while the mage CoHs the warrior back. I'm not really worried about trak's dps, I think the problem would be with all the adds. I don't know how we can handle all of them at once. I've thought about having the druid pull him down to the banish point, but I don't know how he'll get past the locked door and all the juggs on the way back without dying..<br />
<br />
You guys have any suggestions? I do have a 65 chanter with 250ish AAs that I can 2 box, but I don't know how well I can play both the chanter and the shaman when I'm the backup tank.. I don't have any other tanks that can help me, so that's out of the question</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The spawned version of Trak is way easier to do.  You go there when the real Trak is NOT up (UDB is up).  You can clear the trash in his room easily.  Then spawn Trak.  There are no adds.  He will be alone and unbuffed.  Proceed to waste him.<br />
<br />
If the warrior is banished, have him sit and Trak should summon him back immediately.  Have him sit everytime he is banished.  Nuke him down as quick as possible.  With that group, Trak should be dead in less than 30 sec.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Should be doable. Not sure about dead in 30 seconds, thats 1k dps for a 32k hp dragon, and I don't see any rogues, wizzies or rangers in that group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Necro mage and druid is good dps. Should be fine. As Larns says, you spawn Trak so clear the adds first and they wont be an issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hail,<br />
<br />
Your group should easily decimate the UDB Trak.<br />
Mage, Necro, Druid all on DPS.  You Malos and then just DoT away.<br />
Cast Blood of Nadox after each AE.  If you use Spirit call be sure to circle the dogs or ensure push won't knock him somewhere you haven't cleared (or over the ledge).<br />
Necro can burst 1k in dps on their own once the spells are in.  So can we with BA4 and our DoTs, but it takes too much time to land them all for a fight like this.  I think 30 seconds is probably close for a kill time with that group.  You might want to chain rain instead if you have FoMM.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">1kdps?  What dots do you land to do 6000/tick?  I must be missing a spell or something. ;)<br />
<br />
But anyway, you should be able to handle the spawned Trak...  Will just likely take more than 30 secs, imho. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Everyone in that group could just hit random keys and you would still evaporate poor Trak :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">That's the UDB trak you guys are talkin about... unfortunately, real trak must die ahead of that, and no one ever takes the time to kill him anymore..<br />
<br />
I know that we could waste the UDB trak, that's not a problem. The problem comes on the first trak with all the adds =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hail, <br />
<br />
You are right Kami.  I meant 1k+ per tick. =P  Not enough caffeine this morning. :D <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Doh, sorry - kind of skimmed right over that part. :\<br />
<br />
From my limited experience with the real Trak, I'd say it'd be quite a fight.  Seems like it's probably doable if you can at least keep adds to a minimum and get them slowed/parked asap.  As I recall, Trak takes quite a while to return to spawn point, so maybe if necro can aggro and fd or something, that might work.  Not sure how likely he is to get fd off though.<br />
<br />
Edit: No worries, Frekkels...  I'm still waking up myself. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">http://www.salo.bz/ragbert/pulling-trakanon.html<br />
<br />
Another thing you can do is train Trak and his friends away from the lair.  Have that person die or fd or get banished when Trak gets to the tunnel.  The rest of the group runs into the empty lair and start picking out frogs / juggs as they come back and the ones that didnt get trained away.  It will take Trak about 5 or so min to return so you have alot of time to prepare before he gets back.  You can take him solo when he's back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My main concern with attempting trak is all the adds. <br />
<br />
What adds?<br />
<br />
Step 1) Have your mage cast sense summoned.  That will get you Tolapumj's pet from the prep room.  Use Vision to hop to the pet, then Vision again to bind your view to Trakanon.  You need to watch him, but if you know where he is and where the protector is anyone can pull the lair.<br />
<br />
Step 2) When Trakanon moves to the &quot;cubby&quot; in his lair is when you'll do all your pulling.  Wait for him to move and the protector and wandering jugg to path all the way to the left.  Have your necro pull tolapumj from range, juggs don't assist him.  Don't let him gate.<br />
<br />
Step 3)  Grab the 3 juggs at Tolapumj's spawn point when trak prot and wanderer are in the right spots.<br />
<br />
Step 4) Grab the wandering jugg or the protector, whichever's convenient, when trak's back in his cubby.<br />
<br />
Step 5) Get the leftover.<br />
<br />
Step 6) You now have a mostly empty lair with a dragon in it, go kill him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">larns and trev, great ideas. I didn't know that trak wandered his lair, thought he was a static. I would say that larns's idea will be better for me, though, it sounds safer.<br />
<br />
Thanks everyone for the advice</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Magneuss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">We did the real trak bout a week or so ago.  Was a bit less than 2 groups, prolly bout 10 of us.  Was WAY overkill.  All 65's, none elemental, mostly VT geared.  <br />
<br />
We sent in our monk, as the rest of us stayed way back.  Let trak banish him, and he FD'd.  Ranger got out the ole' track, and we moved to the banish point.  That is where we set up camp.  Monk ran back up to trak, got banished, this time NO FD.  This makes trak come to you.  VERY important that you have cleared all mobs between you and trak.  Easily done with your line-up you have listed. <br />
<br />
We had 1 add right before trak arrived, so I was engaged with the shroom solo, had bane/blood on em, with me and dogdog tanking.  Mushroom was near death whilst trak had arrived, engaged, and became dead.  Shroom followed suit shortly.  I think we had 1 mage, and  a hodge podge of ranger's/ monks, cleric, BST, Warrior, and me, 65 shaman.  <br />
<br />
Like I said, it was the real trak, and we were WAY overkill, so I think you will have no real problems taking him down.  The key will be getting him alone.  Once you do this, the rest will be cake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I wouldnt recommend fighting him outside his lair unless you have a huge amt of dps.  If he gets off a gate, you may need to run back and start summoning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">alrighty, we've lost our mage.. he sold his account =( so I been trying to think of a way to get around banish. I know that it's possible to pull trak to his banish point, but there are issues with that(we can't clear all the way there, and a locked door)<br />
<br />
So, I been trying to think of a way to get around the banish. If I'm not mistaken, you cannot banish pets. So if I have a lvl 65 necro using his level 65 pet that has virtue and FoS, is it possible that the pet can tank trak for the full 32k hp? Full buffed, I think that the pet would have about 6500hp. We would have low dps, but that could possibly avoid the banishes. Your thoughts?<br />
<br />
Using the warrior to tank is still an option, but I'm afraid he won't get summoned back after he gets banished.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">the necromancer can pull trakanon to the banish spot (in the shroom tunnels a bit above the juggs).<br />
after that any random three elemental+ geared characters run by epileptic lemurs could finish the job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Magneuss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Don't get too caught up in the fact that he's a named dragon that people have lot's of horror stories about.  In all reality, he's a puss.  Hit's for roughly 200, has a couple of pseudo nasty spells, but for the most part, cake.  <br />
<br />
Question, if you are planning this event, and you state you have no key for the locked door, what are your plans?  If your gonna use someone to LP it, then clear up to him, quickly run back and let your group back out, let LP person run back and have trak banish him.  Your group should be set up in this spot.  You will be surprised how fast you will take him down with a full group of 65's.  Even if they are only equipped with bazaar gear, it's still very do-able.  Hell, if nothing else, experiment with tactic's, and find out what works best for your crew.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">We got him over the weekend finally! My bard is now epic yahoo!<br />
<br />
The first time we took him down, it was big-time overkill, but it was fun. I was 2 boxing warrior/shaman, we had a cleric, a necro, a druid 2boxing a chanter, and another warrior(time geared) 2 boxing a druid.<br />
<br />
We had the chanter take the banish and we DPSed trak down. the time warrior got banished at 30%. We finished off trak easy and the chanter was able to live and keep the warrior up with runes at the banish point. Got a mana robe on that run, and DW BP.<br />
<br />
Next night we gathered again with a much smaller force.. had me 2 boxnig warrior/shaman again, druid 2 boxing chanter again, and cleric was there. There was another guild that was wanting to KS it so we had to move quickly(we had camped there the night before so we were ready) We were extremely low on dps but we thought we might have been able to do it.. we were wrong. We did not have enough dps to kill him before he banished our warrior, and we got him to 50% before everyone got banished. No one was dead at this point, so we figured we'd run back up and kill him again(he was regenning slow). We started running back up and the druid got summoned and agroed more mobs. He summoned us 1 at a time and we got creamed.<br />
<br />
2 nights later we went back down with a necro, the same druid, same cleric, another druid that volunteered, and me 3 boxing shaman/warrior/necro.<br />
<br />
My necro took the banish and FDd immediately and we DPSed him down hard, no one else got banished before he died.<br />
<br />
dropped us a mrylokar BP that time around, and my bard got his epic piece =)<br />
<br />
Wasn't able to slow him, that sucker is insanely MR and poison/disease resistant. Fire/cold lands fine on him though =)<br />
hits for 650s max, most of the time in the 200s or missing. His AE and proc are where it's at... 1200DD and dot AE, and his proc is a random lifetap up to 1500dmg.</div></div><hr />
