<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I would like to start a topic on how we can fix cripple. I was thinking about how we can make cripple a effective tool in the shaman arsenal instead of the stale useless, havent mem'd since i last killed Vindi 2 years ago, spell.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, i think we are ont he right track with a lot of the spells. Directed damage mitigation and the stuff in OoW. So therefore it only makes sense to add a componet like this to the cripple line. Actualty im thinking more a long us getting a new cripple spell or even 2 and scaling the effectiveness of this from 70 down.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So anyway, the componet i was thinking of is riposite. Why not add a direct debuff to this in cripple. Possibly a negitive 20% to riposite and like 20% to dodge at 66%.<br />
<br />
<br />
i dunno im tired so maybe this is a crap idea nd im sure the % are off, but im just starting a talking point.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Druids already get atk debuffs for lowering damage output. we get slows as our method of doing that. I'd like to see a debuff to apply to stuff that makes melee more effective against it. Maybe something like:<br />
<br />
Decrease chance to avoid melee by 15%.<br />
Decrease mitigation by 15%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cronikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">How about reducing number of attacks, rather than frequency (so as to differentiate it from slow) - ie quadding down to tripling?<br />
<br />
Also, how about reducing its slow mitigation?<br />
<br />
I know .. too much, right? ; )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">both good ideas in my book.<br />
<br />
waiting to see if anyone else has more ideas befroe we refine/put numbers together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Change Cripple from a static -50 or whatever to a percentage debuff.  If Cripple reduces stats by 25%, then a mob with 100 Str would lose 25.<br />
<br />
Makes the spell scalable.  Or, make is a percentage like Slow.  The higher your level, the greater the percentage removed.  Up to a max of course.<br />
<br />
Adding other types of debuffs such as -% Dodge, Riposte and other skills would be good too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The only problems with debuffs on monsters are that they scale with the proprtion of monsters in Dev's eyes.<br />
<br />
A Moss snake slowed by us might do 1 dps compared to its normal blazing 4 dps. <br />
<br />
But Bob the destroyer of worlds 1000 dps is dropped to 250 dps after slowed. <br />
<br />
Any single debuff will have to take that into account. so percentages will probably never be used. So as time goes on rote flat debuffs only get weaker.<br />
<br />
Or in other words a cripple that takes 75 Str away is a minor deal when the monsters have 355 str now.  But before it would truly cripple a gnoll pup or something.<br />
<br />
The devs seem to forget that a Debuff that is encounter changing is zero percent different than a wizard who blows large chunks out of a mob and is encounter changeing as well.<br />
<br />
We might slow a mobs damage output down by 75%  But when the monster dies 75% faster because of a wizards contribution he is doing the exact same thing we are and in a much more flashy and group pleaseing manner. <br />
<br />
<br />
We need the ability to debuff that is group pleasing and encounter changing. Exactly like a wizards crit nuke for a quarter of a mobs hitpoints are. <br />
<br />
Something like a Dot we put on them that has the crippleling effect of all nukes doing More damage. for the malos line. So that we cast Malos line and it does 50 a tick damage - 75 to all resists and + 5% to all landed nukes. <br />
<br />
And a meele line that does 50 a tick Lowers the mobs damage  by say 50 per hit. and makes all meeles hitting it hit for 5% more max. While taking its defensive stuff out of the way 5% of the time. And reporting it to the group. <br />
<br />
Bob the destroyer of worlds tries to block But you brush it aside..<br />
<br />
The second thing is they need to set it up so if others have the spell already on the mob it has a cumutive effect. Just like a damn wizards nuke stacks to make it dead faster. <br />
<br />
If someone has 10 wizards on a raid and they blow the monster to kingdom come a minute into the fight noone says that is encounter changing just good tactics. But if 10 shaman could band together slow a monster to the point it does zero meele damage a minute into the fight but it doesnt die till 2 minutes it it would be decried as way overpowering and nerfed into uselessness.<br />
<br />
And that my friends is the crap we face from developers. They think it is okay to shorten a fight to 45 seconds due to DPS because that is fun. But refuse to allow a shaman to negate the threat of a fight 45 seconds in because it is overpowering. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You could achieve the same point as cripple is intended to by giving shamans a group buff that mitigates damage 5% or so. That's the general direction I would go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think if we are going to convince them to actually turn Cripple (whatever the name of the new one is) into something worth casting, we need to find things that are geniunely &quot;crippling&quot; to a mob, which means they AREN'T things that affect what WE do, but that affect what IT does. Somebody suggested reducing quadding to tripling--that's a good approach, conceptually; the mob's muscles are tightened up by the spell, making him less flexible and so unable to do those quad-swings any more. Other ideas would be things like disabling Enrage or Flurry, reducing his ability to mitigate damage through Riposte or Dodge, etc.<br />
<br />
Now, how we turn any of that into numbers, I have no idea.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">to me cripple shoul d actually &quot;cripple&quot; a mob, so mob does less max hit, isnt as agile, so if mobs hits for 1k damage when crippled it should hit for say 850 damage. and tank can hit it for max more often, doesnt dodge,parry riposte so much cause it cant.<br />
<br />
then criple would be worth it. and it would be noticeable.. i leave the dev to come up how to do that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Make cripple -2 DI or something and i would be estatic.  For those that don't know what DI is :) it's the damage interval for calculating how much damage a mob actually does.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually I'd think Combat Effects -X (say 10 or 20 or whatever) would be nice.<br />
<br />
I'd like it to be work more against spikey damage, procs/fluriess, than anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Needs to DIRECTLY give a reduction to:<br />
<br />
1.  Special attacks like enrage, flurry, rampage etc.<br />
<br />
2.  Ability to proc (combat effects).<br />
<br />
3.  Overall attack value.<br />
<br />
4.  Ability to mitigate/avoid incoming damage.</div></div><hr />
