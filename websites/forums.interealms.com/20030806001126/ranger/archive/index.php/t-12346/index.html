<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">They lowered the NPC level Harmony can effect. I don't know about you, but, isn't this just going to a bit far? I mean, how could someone possibly abuse Harmony?!<br />
<br />
I swear I saw this below the Planes of Power goes live skit (Which YES I DO HAVE A COPY! WOO!) <br />
<br />
The only thing that now bugs me about Planes of Power is someone who had it before me today told me the Plane of KNowledge is useable at level 1. That pisses me off, and I refuse to use it as an alt unless they are sufficient level where I don't care (20+). I think the long runs at those lowest levels are more fun than almost anything except close calls in combat. They add a certain bit of fear and adrenaline, and they make you pay more attention. Now some level 1 Kid and just pop from Gfay to Qeynos, yay. This is saying as if the Nexus didn't ALREADY cut out the two more dangerous zones for travel there (Kithicor and Highpass). So now they toss away all the zones together, but this is fun! Bull****. That's not fun, and yeah, I know, I'm cursing, and I don't mean to really use such profanity, but, I'm so angry I'm half seeing red over it and at a loss for other words except to say  those. I know, I know. It's trashy, but, right now, I don't care. I might later.</div></div><hr />
