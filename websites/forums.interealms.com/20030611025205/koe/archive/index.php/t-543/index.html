<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Adelrune Argenti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am in need of the wizard spell Abscond. It is a trade in spell for wizards but being the unlucky wizard that I am, I have been unable to get it in the turn ins.  I did however get 4 copies of Tears of Solusek in a row which at least helps out any other wizards who need this level 55 spell (Fanadile has dibs on one).  Anyways, if you see an Abscond anywhere, please think of me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Listed here are many of the wizard trade in spells.  I suggest you email whats-his-face and nab all the wizard trade in spells and hand them all in till you get the one you want, then all the left over ones that you already have hand back.  <br />
<br />
These wizard hand in spells are as common as all &lt;explicit&gt;  so don't feel bad about, o and the lvl 51 Stun spell that you can get as well is the no. 1 Wizard Stun spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Adelrune Argenti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Been there, done that. Thanks though. I got 6 trade in spells from the guild. I ended up with 4 copies of Tears of Solusek, one stun spell and one Atols shackles.</div></div><hr />
