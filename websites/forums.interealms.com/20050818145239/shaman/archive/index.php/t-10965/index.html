<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm just curious what everyone predicts it will be like.  I myself am hoping its based on a system of where you have a map window you can pop-up on screen that will log where you have been and once you travel to a zone, a map of that zone will become available in the window.  And as you explore the zone the map will get filled in.<br />
<br />
However, this is more like a dream idea of what it could be, since I know it will probably be vastly different :)<br />
<br />
Share your ideas! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">While that would be nice I have a feeling it might be much simpiler and a lot less useful like a zone connection map as opposed to in zone maps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, that would be much kicking of ass if it were a covered up map, that reveals itself as you explore the zone, like in many RTS games and dungeon crawling RPGs...<br />
<br />
Just a dream...</div></div><hr />

...looks like it's up to you to make the map. :\  Thankfully, as this thread points out, someone has apparently already converted ShowEQ maps to this thing, so some pre-made maps should be available.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Depends on what you mean by new.  Personally I'd describe this as the same old stuff with a new set of textures, and a new set of models for mobs.  Basically the same old stuff repackaged.<br />
<br />
What I think EQ desperately needs is multiple-copied dungeons.  Three times last week we went to Sebilis (at off peak hours) and couldn't get a camp, even now after PoP.  But apparently its beyond Sony's capability to adopt technology thats at least 2 years old now.<br />
<br />
My group is levels 55-60, so LoY is in theory targetted at me and my friends.  Strange then that it doesn't target what we actually want.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Until it comes out and is detailed, you have ruined it as much as the armor tint was by the window that came out.  I.e. it wasn't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Looks interesting.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dross</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Anyone catch the reference to special parchments for mapmaking certain zones?  Sounds like boss mob loot to me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Sounds kind of lame actually, in order to make a map you have to run your character around every single wall and mark off line segments ... another time sink anyone?<br />
<br />
Seems to me that automatic mapping is a better way to go, such that walls in vicinity of your character (or possibly anything in line of sight) should be automatically mapped and then saved when you leave the zone...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">i like it it , reminds me of the old days when RPG we more in depth . a RPG  IS a time sink , thats the pointof it . Some thing about you have to accept and even like.<br />
<br />
I agree farming VP key is TOO much of a time sink , but somethign like this ...  just reminds me of the old days in D&amp;D and other old games. But perhaps im just from another generation of RPG players , we didnt have it so easy back in those days. We had to map up hill in bolth directions on 20 sided loaded dice the the GM cursed with a spell ...<br />
<br />
well soemthign like that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Urnti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">We had to map up hill in bolth directions on 20 sided loaded dice the the GM cursed with a spell ...  <br />
<br />
ROFL! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kome_battle_shm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">this new cartography system sounds like a test for a next coming game.<br />
no use of this system in Eq with zones/limited area, plus after four years this game is out and tons of infos on the net.<br />
<br />
i predict that it'll break my current UI .. <br />
<br />
good point</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Looking at the loy website I am disappointed in the new map system. It looks crap, the only concession I can give it is it fits in the style of roleplaying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>lenardo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">First off if your UI uses equi.xml equi_animations a custom group window  a custom window selector or a custom inventory<br />
<br />
it'll be busted <br />
<br />
in my ui, the only thing that broke was the group window and it was an easy fix.(i had to add the group search button)<br />
<br />
<br />
now the mapper<br />
<br />
the detail we wil lbe able to put in will be significant, but think about it, some people LOVE doing maps and new good maps for the mapper will come out<br />
<br />
if you feel lazy hit eq-toolbox.com for the converted seq(showeq) map files. they work wonderfully and will probably be used for ALOT of peoples map base</div></div><hr />
