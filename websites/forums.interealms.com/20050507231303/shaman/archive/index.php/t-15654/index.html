<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rotun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When shaman solo, do they stop meleeing at some point and just use DoTs, dog, and nukes to bring down mobs?  The reason why I ask is because I am considering buying a horse/lizard, but to do that I would need to sell my Rune Etched Icewurm Fang and my Silver Chitin Handwraps.  Is this a good idea?  I usually group and the mount would be very useful for that, but I don't want to degrade my solo abilities either.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any advice.<br />
<br />
BTW, here is my magelo.  I am just about to ding 34.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, eventually we stop meleeing, but if you have SCHW and REIF you should be able to get another 10-15 levels out of them.  Maybe a bit less if you get a JBB, horse+JBB &gt;&gt; melee.<br />
<br />
In NO CASE would I get rid of them before you max your Defense skill at 200.  You need to be in there meleeing to do that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you enjoy solo, i would say keep the REIF and SCHW.. fast weapon that proc often when using our &quot;rage&quot; line of spells... also very usefull to interrupt caster type mobs when meleeing.<br />
(used mine up to my late 50, when I replaced it with my spear of fate)<br />
<br />
on the over hand, having a horsey is very cool when you have to buff your group.<br />
<br />
but imho you will lose something selling the REIF for a horse. try to save more. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I had a JBB when I hit 45.  The final mob I killed before I dinged out of level 44 was the last time I ever melee'd anything, ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rakji</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I melee stuff at 65 all the time. Its not always for exp though, but any green/lblue farming, and even camping say 4d in Seb for loot goes easier in teh face still, atleast for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would second the all-melee-skills maxed suggestion.  Shamans can cap defense and all melee (except H2H) at level 39, so try to have all yours capped by 44-45 and then sell your soul to get a JBB (clickable at 45).  After that, you will only need to melee for farming or whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I completely disagree.<br />
<br />
I never did crap with melee, and never had a problem maxing defense.  I capped 1HB somewhere in the 50's (won a tash stick, had a ball), piercing just before getting epic, bout 50 points left on 2hb now that I'm 65 with 109 or so AA...  It's fun to cap melee skills, I'll give you that, but there's no requirement (nor benefit, in some cases) to cap them early on.  <br />
<br />
I would say - try to solo without meleeing for a few mobs next time.  If the result is acceptible to you, sell the melee gear for the horse.  If you're miserable when you're not in there mixing it up... keep doing what's making things fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My opinion is that it's worthwhile to attack until you get a horse.  When you have the horse, you get much more mana efficiency by having attack off to get the med bonus than you do from meleeing.  Whether or not you're TANKING is a completely different story.  That depends on a lot of factors, including if you have any of the Heals over Time, what level of Dogdog you have, and which DoTs you have, not to mention what you're fighting.  Even on PoP mobs, some I'll root-dot, some I'll let Fido tank, and some I'll tank (though not melee) depending on circumstances.<br />
<br />
I'd say go ahead and get the mount.  KEI I can do with or without, but when I don't have my lizard, I FEEL it.<br />
<br />
Disclaimer: unless you're fighting inside all the time.  But I find that unlikely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">To this day i melee everything not in PoP, basicly if im tanking it, im hitting it to, its just plain fun. No im sure if you wanna crunch numbers you can tell me how much my DPS is lacking cause of this, but give me a good weapon and nice haste  ( im at 90% self haste ) and ill have a blast for a long time in seb or even veksar or HoB or whatever. Just wish my melee was a hair better, hell all i want is a vash = to cleric and that would increase my DPS and make bash valuable instead of the crap it is now. I dont get it, shaman are large primal races to begin with ( frogs dont count ), its just a natural thing you would think... but anyway...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Keep in mind too that when you turn 34 and get your pet, you will kill things much quicker if you tank it, buff and alpha your pet, and position your pet from behind so there are no parries, dodges, etc. Find a safe spot, single pull, if you ever get into trouble, just root it step back and heal, maybe throw a dot on or two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">before I returned to the game I played a rogue (started him a week or 2 after beta), thus I've got quite a hunger for melee - all the time (my magelo reflects this).<br />
<br />
Having said that I'm always in the hunt for the _most_ efficient way to kill a mob and at level 42 its still to tank it in the face. Although now I am contemplating the trade-offs between dropping the mob faster by using the dots and saving some time versus saving the mana and spending a little more time tanking it.<br />
<br />
I would recommend getting defense maxed out first before retiring to 24/7 rot 'n dot.<br />
<br />
Just with quickness the REIF becomes a 12/13-14 weapon with a 81 pt proc. You've to to work at getting STR up to 150+ (only really a challenge at earlier levels for iksar/va shir/frog shamans) though to be semi efficient (aka land the majority of your hits). At level 49 you can do away with that though (much better str buffs).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rotun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thanks for all the advice.<br />
<br />
I just dinged 34 last night while grouped in ME.  I had my spells with me so the first thing I did was summon a dog.  I was pleasantly surprised that a buffed and hasted alpha dog turned out some nice damage and made a noticeable difference.  He was also able to tank goranga adds quite well.<br />
<br />
For now, I think I will keep the REIF/SCHW and switch between soloing (to keep melee/defence skills up) and grouping.  Once I hit low 40s, I will probably sell the REIF/SCHW and get a mount and maybe a JBB too if I round up some more plat.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for all your input.</div></div><hr />

Sorry if I'm confused...but you were killing goranga's in ME at 34? and your 34 pet was tanking and handling adds? I went to solo there at 53, was definitely doable then, if not for all the morons training things left and right, but they were high blues, even some whites and yellows in the mix......maybe its because im not too familiar with the zone, but there are other gorangas of lower level? I just seriously doubt 34 pet can tank level 50+ mobs, when my level 49 pet was getting chewed up fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">He probably meant in DSP at the ME zoneline.  Gorangas there too, and that fits the level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OK, maybe so, like I said, I had never hunted there before then, not too familiar with the zone, and knew there were a lot of high level mobs that see through invis around.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Oh yea, forgot about those gorangas hehe :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oops!   :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Yes, I meant I was in DSP with a group near the ME zoneline killing the goranga there.  They are level 30-ish mobs.</div></div><hr />
