<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bearbone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here is the problem.  I haven't played EQ in a few months.  I then buy the trilogy and upload it and have the worst problems ever.  I crash between 5 minutes and 1 hour everytime I am on.  I mean totally booted out of the game.  Now when I log on it is so dark I can't see where I am going even with my troll darkvision. My gamma and brightness is cranked even game gamma setting in my Voodoo 5 card tweek.  And it only happens once I get past the login part of EQ.  It is so frustrating.  Please help if anyone has had this problem.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sounds to me like you have old drivers loaded possibly.<br />
Go to Sony's site and print out their instructions for the order in which drivers to update first.  FOLLOW the directions.<br />
<br />
You must load new sound, video card, &amp; DirectX drivers in the right order, or it will be all hosed up.<br />
<br />
That's my best guess of your problem from the description you gave.  I'm by no means an expert though.  Good luck to you!<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />
