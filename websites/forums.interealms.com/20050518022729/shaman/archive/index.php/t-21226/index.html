You know, it was the SOE team that asked the necros what the dealy-o was.  They said the necros were being too quiet.  If you look at the eqclasses necro forums, yea there might be some complaints but compared to this forum, there is a completely different mindset.  Plus for the most part they were able to come up with a nice unified set of problems the necro had without suggestions, just like Brenlo asked for, in a very short amount of time.<br />
<br />
Here = completely negative/whiney/complainy/threats of leavingy.  There = enjoy the game.<br />
(Monklybusiness also = completely negative/whiney/complainy/threats of leavingy)<br />
<br />
Here I get depressed.  Necro boards I go to to not be so depressed.<br />
<br />
Sad, isn't it?  One would think the necro boards is the last place one would find mature people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Has nothing to do with mature, it has everything to do with frustration and being fed up. necro's havent been left behind as long as we have, they dont face the same issues and dont also face the added frustration of trying to talk calm and cool and being ignored.<br />
<br />
Let me tell ya, i can bring up more then 1 post on this forum and on the EQ site where we were asked to talk in a unified and calm mannar and when we gave them what they asked, it was ignored. We are not considered a important class to fix to them and the lack of communication and adjustments that we all know we need and have spent our real life hours for no money parsing, debating and correcting, its become intolerable for many people. <br />
<br />
<br />
I think you need to take a look around and realize that there isnt threats of leaving around here, that people have tried so hard and been pushed back so far that they ARE leaving.<br />
<br />
A wise man once said, that if someone tells your your wrong, remain strong in your path, if 1000 people tell you that you are wrong, its time to take a look at what your doing.<br />
<br />

just my 2 cents though, could be wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pardon? Necro's were left behind, starting in Kunark straight through to Luclin. How fun was it to be a necro in Velious when practically every boss target was nearly immune to the main DOTs a necro used, when the main role of a necro was using DOTs, yet two necros could not use the same DOT, when often the ONLY role in a raid was to give our mana to players that could actually use their mana in a meaningful way. <br />
<br />
The list of nerfs suffered by necro's is longer then any single class in the history of EQ. <br />
<br />
As of late, necros have been more or less fixed. DOT stacking, pet enhancements (non agro, ect), upgrades to our damage output, reversal of the DOT damage reduction while kiting, FD shakes all agro after 1.75 minutes, ect. Each of these changes have benefited several classes, but the necromancer has enjoyed the cumlative total of all of these changes.<br />
<br />
I feel the same about my shaman now as I did about my necromancer during Luclin. A general atrophy of the class. It is not that shaman are worse then they were, it is that every other class has taken five steps forward, while shaman have only taken one step forward. Believe me, the necromancer community understands, because we were there once.<br />

So you were left behind from kunark all the way to luclin, were you mister necro man? ALL casting classes were left behind (save for clerics) from Kunark to Luclin. Luclin = Focus effects. That propelled the casting class to outdamaging, out soloing, and out grouping the melee's that they complained oh so rightfully about.<br />
<br />
Shamen, on the other hand, are still left behind. We still cannot provide DPS, we still cannot provite healing, and we still are easily replaced by 2 other classes that can slow nearly just as well, but can fill in for our weaknesses PLUS added utility.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Shamad before ya attack Ancagalon reread his post, hes saying he understands what we are going through and sympathizes, and that he also plays a shaman. Seriuosly I don't think shaman were that bad off until PoP, we were able to solo better than most until the short fight came into vogue and we have always been needed for our buffs/slows until now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">He understands our complaints which is a good thing. The only thing that I don't like reading from Necros are complaints about DoTs. Let me say that you don't know how good you have it.<br />
<br />
On a weekly Time clearing a Shaman casting his DoTs will encounter a resist rate of 60+% on each and every God providing 30% damage of a Necro and 100% aggro with no meaning of handling aggro. <br />
<br />
I am dead serious and not exaggerating to make a point on this. Shamans ability to do damage has been crippled since the Kunark expansion due to resists mainly and aggro secondly, while healing and cast times on ALL our spells have been designed around Slow.<br />
<br />
Whenever a Necro suffers due to resists the Shaman does so tenfold. Just trying to give you the Shaman picture of that aspect, so please don't take this the wrong way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It will be interesting to see what happens now that it is clear that the top guilds like Afterlife are not going to keep on playing. 2 of the latest 3 expansions where afterall &gt;90% high-end content. And LDoN was a very easy way for them to make something that had things for both normal and uber players.<br />
<br />
Im not sure SOE has got what it takes to turn the boat around since a lot of casual players will also be leaving for WoW and maybe CoH before they get around to fixing issues that have been in the game for years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ancagalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The only thing that I don't like reading from Necros are complaints about DoTs. Let me say that you don't know how good you have it.<br />
<br />
To be fair though, DOTs are pretty much ALL a necro is these days. And, as DOTs are all a necro is, I don't think it is unreasonable to be critical of the short fallings of DOTs. If DOTs suck, then necro's suck, as a necro really has nothing to fall back on. One could argue a necromancer has somewhat beefy pet, but honestly, in POP and GOD, a pet is just a melee-based, mana-free DOT. <br />
<br />
Necro's boast a hell of a lot of utility in undead areas, but the number of fully undead areas in the higher end game can pretty much be counted on one hand. You can't have a necro as the only slower/mezer in a mixed live+undead area, or the live mobs don't get slowed/mezed. And, if you have to pack along a chanter/shaman to slow/mez live mobs, no reason for the necro to perform that role at all.<br />
<br />
Yes, my necromancer is my primary character, my shaman is my alt, but do my damnest to make sure I play my shaman as well as I am able. <br />
<br />
When I play my shaman, I feel the problem with lack of healing muscle, I just do not understand why I should feel inadequate in healing compared to a similarly geared/AA'ed druid. Whenever I see the red message flash that the target has mitigated or is immune to slow, my teeth start to grind together. As far as DOTs go with my shaman, it is a ways down on my list of things that get my blood pressure up.<br />
<br />
Specifically referring to DOTs, most of the things necromancers are asking for benefit shaman as well. <br />
<br />
1) DOT agro is disproportional. How can a wizard crit for several thousand damage AT ONCE and cause less agro then a single poison based DOT, that does less damage even if the DOT goes the full duration? The agro caused by poison counters has to go.<br />
<br />
2) Fight durations, short of boss mobs, are getting so short, by the time DOTs safely on, they don't have a chance to run to full duration. <br />
<br />
3) DOTs are supposed to be mana efficient because they take time to do full damage. Nukes are supposed to be mana in-efficient because they do full damage instantly. But, the comparative efficiency between a well geared/AA'ed nuke vs. a well geared/AA'ed DOT is getting quite close. <br />
<br />
The DOT changes necro's are asking for that would not apply to shaman are a reduction to the 24 second recast time on Horror. Necro's are also asking for a cold based version of Funeral Pyre. <br />
<br />
Every class in the game has short fallings, it is fair for characters of that class ask for those short fallings to be fixed (well, except druids, who feel it is their god given right to be the best at nuking AND healing, while having no negative balances in place). Some classes really need some loving at the moment, shaman being one of them. My thinking however is the healing/buffing/debuffing/slowing issues are paramount for shaman, and the fact that shaman DOTs are not effective becomes an even more glaring problem due to the fact the other cylinders are not firing.<br />
<br />
My appologies for the length of this post.<br />

<br />
I think its more that shaman issues are systemic in nature.<br />
<br />
One of the most common necro complaints, for instance, was that some lame 50-ish spells still require an essense emerald to cast.  Thats a fairly easy problem to fix.  Ditto for many of the other necro issues.  Making significant tweaks to healing/slowing, however, has a lot more potential balancing and other issues.<br />
<br />
However, one issue that affects both classes is the reletive uselessness of DoTs in short-duration fights, and I doubt that anything is really gonna happen on that front; its just too much work.<br />
<br />
So, the necros will get their easy fixes, much like we got a few bones tossed to us, and that will be it.</div></div><hr />

That was a consequence of being stupidly overpowered at one point.<br />
<br />
Remember the humorous story about a crew of adventurers in VP?  The necros disbands to solo in VP while everyone else got smoked.  It was based on reality.  <br />
<br />
Necros needed each and every one of those nerfs.  And they remain a diverse and powerful class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ancagalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">That was a consequence of being stupidly overpowered at one point...   ...Necros needed each and every one of those nerfs.<br />
<br />
Is that not similar reasons that prevented shaman from getting meaningful upgrades? The perception that slow was stupidly overpowered at one point? Other classes witnessing shaman soloing some of the lesser Velious named dragons back in the days when that was the stuff of legend? Was the Velious shaman not stupidly overpowered in the eyes of a warrior that would have gotten his ass handed to him trying to solo a cobalt drake, much less a named dragon?<br />
<br />
Necros were nerfed/held back during Velious and Luclin due to the perception that they were godly in the original release. Is the fact that a necro could rape Lower Guk justification that they should be useless in Velious? No. When your guild is hunting Velious, who gives a flying f*** about Lower Guk, that is old news.<br />
<br />
Shaman have been held back due to the perception that slow is godly. Is the fact that a shaman could use slow to grind down a lesser named dragon in Velious justification that they should be useless in GOD? No. When your guild is hunting GOD, who gives a flying f*** about Velious, that is old news.<br />
<br />
My point is necro/shaman have/are suffered a similar injustice. They were dragged down because they used to be powerful. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">A necro friend of mine, who is not particularly well geared or AA'd - like mostly Velious gear  and a little bit of Ssra / VT gear, and probably 80AA solos things that not only am I, with better gear and similar AA unable get close to being able to solo , but that many groups would be unable to kill. Yes, soloing is a whole different kettle of fish, but we are talking about soloing mobs that drop loot that sells easily for 20k - 30k. Soloing for a shaman is, in general, about proving that you can, or because you cant get a decent group, so soloing is slow but beter then nothing, and we cannot, in general, solo mobs that drop big ticket cash loot. Soloing for a necro is still a pretty viable way to get huge amounts of plat for buying pritty shint tings.<br />
<br />
I also believe that the old days of necros trying but being unable to get a grp are long gone - and that particular problem was more about non-necros misconceptions, than about any particular flaws or weaknesses in the necro's usefullness in a grp environment. These days people understand what a useful all round class Necros are, rather than assuming that because they see necros soloing a lot, that soloing is all they are good for.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, I am sufficiently happy playing a shaman even though I know that we are seriously underpowered, that I do not really mind if Necros get all the changes that they ask for, and we get nothing, but I seriously believe that they have less cause to cry for change than do shaman.</div></div><hr />

On paper it's nice, in reality it's the most resisted DoT line we have. Which is sad considering that mobs do not have that high a MR anymore nowadays.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I see your point Ancalagon, but the difference is I never perceived necros as getting nerfed to uselessness.

<br />
They had to be nerfed because they were stupidly overpowered.  SOE did the right thing with them, and I never perceived the nerfs as going too far, nor did I perceive gameplay leaving necros behind.  <br />
<br />
So, while I see the point you are making, I disagree about this aspect of similarity between necros and shaman that you are drawing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">That list may look enormous at the first glance but it seemed pretty reasonable to me. A lot of the points are convinience issues that do not affect class balance and wanted upgrades to existing spell lines.<br />
<br />
Increase the debuff slot limit. SUGGESTION: possibly split the spell buff bar into 2 different bars, one for buffs and one for debuffs.I think we can all agree with this. Having your spells not land because of limited slots is not fun at all.<br />
<br />
Give us an upgrade to Mind Wrack, Crippling Claudication and/or a new single target reverse-leech heal over time. Also, an upgrade to our heart flutter line and/or a change to our scent of terris line would be great. I think giving necros a scent of terris type debuff (with a resist adj) without the fire debuff component (to stack with druid's) would really add to the class.I do not know if necromancers need any of this but I do not see any problem with them getting upgrades to old discontinued spell lines. It would probably not help in the new content though, seeing as this adresses DoTs and debuffs only.<br />
<br />
Remove the peridot cost from pets.Convinience issue. I do not see any problem with this.<br />
<br />
Look into the resist adjustments on our dots (Night Fire and Horror especially).Note that these are the DoTs which have resist adjustments only slightly better then shaman DoTs :D . Compared to the rest of the DoTs necromancers have available though this is a reasonable request.<br />
<br />
Add a new ancient nuke that does approx 1450 or so dmg.Assuming they mean a new GoD ancient this is a reasoable request, seeing as necromancer damage is just as crippled as our's in GoD.<br />
<br />
Allowed summoned pets to zone with the masterProbably not doable with the current engine. Other then that I can only agree to this.<br />
<br />
Reduce DoT resists for mobsThis one looks a little silly to me. Why not just change resist adjustments instead? Not that the widely used necromancer DoTs have any problems landing on anything that is not flat out immune . . . <br />
<br />
Add an improved version of Shadowbond for higher level necromancersGoing from memory here . . that is HoT that drains HPs from the caster? Go right ahead I say. It does not affect balance in GoD one bit, but I remember that spell line being fun back in Guk.<br />
<br />
New pet models for pets at higher levelsI have those turned off anyways :P . If it does not take programmers away from more important things, sure.<br />
<br />
New lich illusionsSee above.<br />
<br />
SUGGESTION: Group lich spell: -hp from necro = +mana for group per tickThis one would need careful tuning as it is potentially very very powerful. Fits the necromancer style though and might partly make up for their superiority in mana regeneration decreasing similar to ours.<br />
<br />
SUGGESTION: Necro Mana Drain spell: -mana from necro = +mana for group per tickI have trouble believing anyone seriously asked for any form of twitch. This one must have come from a cleric in disguise.<br />
<br />
SUGGESTION: New reverse lifetap over time: 24 sec duration (like Shadowbond) 400-500 a tick.  Basically give back all the health of Saryrns Kiss in 24 secs.I am not sure what, if anything makes this different from the shadowbond upgrade requested above.<br />
<br />
Upgrade Screaming Terror to effect mobs above level 55A big screaming no to this one. An upgrade to screaming terror that affects higher level MOBs for more mana, higher recast time or the likes, maybe. But to just let necromancers mez for less mana then enchanters is just wrong.<br />
<br />
Reduce the cost of AA points to better compliment what the AA skill doesFully agreed. Especially GoD AAs. This affects all classes and it should be looked into.<br />
<br />
Include a total of the DoT damage done to a mob at the end of the combatEh? Someone wants to show off? Well, if that does not take more then three minutes to code let them have it I say.<br />
<br />
Add a cold based DoT for necromancer useI disagree here. Necromancers already get DoTs for all other resists, they do not need the last one also. Now, if they just want something to do on poison, fire and magic resistant MOBs I am all for upgrading disease DoTs.<br />
<br />
Increase DoT crit percentage for necros to better balance against other classes nukesAgreed, same for all DoT classes.<br />
<br />
Add a MR line for charm purposes specifically for Word of TerrisMaybe after charm has been fixed to not outdamage the rest of the group . . . as is I would not advocate to tinker with an overpowered and arguably broken ability before it gets fixed.<br />
<br />
Reduce recast time for HorrorAgreed, same for Bane.<br />
<br />
Reduce agro caused by DoTs especially when one critsAGREED<br />
<br />
Remove EE component from everything but RezI kinda recall those other spells being somewhat overpowered without the EEs and completely useless with them. A middle ground seems more reasonable.<br />
<br />
Add magic debuff to “scent of darkness” spell lineThat line already has stacking issues. A resist modifier seems like it would be alot more useful.<br />
<br />
Increase lvel of mobs the undead mez AA will affectI only recall that particular AA being unbelievably bad but not the particulars. I am all for making useless AAs useful though.<br />
<br />
Add a message when FD fails to workSeems reasonable.<br />
<br />
Fix the refresh on FD so that when the spell gem is clear it can be cast again at that timeAgreed, and while you are at it do the same for every spell with a cast time of under 4 seconds please. I get fail messages when casting Trushar (3 sec cast time) right after cannibalisation for example.<br />
<br />
Add higher level Fear spellIt sure is sad to see an entire spell line for several classes to just vanish with PoP. But seeing as even negating more then half of a MOBs damage output seems to set of alarms somewhere in the SOE headquarters I can not see it happen. Necromancers might get some spell line that heals the entire MOBs damage output while the necromancer is running away though, or maybe a stun that makes the MOB run, or some sort of charm or mez - these seem to not trigger said alarms.<br />
<br />
Add higher level Cessation of Cor spellI fail to see why necromancers need more high aggro DoTs. Maybe for pet kiting? Not that it would overpower them, so *shrug*.<br />
<br />
Increase Mind Wrack max to 500Uh, can anyone tell me what &quot;max&quot; is meant here?<br />
<br />
A componant free 93% rez AA similar to call to corpse with one use every 72 minutesSave a couple EEs for a couple AAs? Seems fine. Not a balance issue.<br />
<br />
Overall that list looks pretty good to me. Only a few of the points are balance issues anyways.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  The other spells are: <br />
<br />
 a 1100 poitn lifetap... they have far larger lifetap spells with no component needed already.  This would not matter at all.<br />
<br />
  A 1000 point mana gain (cast spell, instantly get mana, like the wizzie gather mana spell).  The recast time is something like 600 seconds, so works out to FT10 at the cost of a spellgem.  Unless they are the one mystical caster class with an excess of spell gem slots, they would rarely bother with the spell.<br />

<br />
Necro's and mages have long had a battle going on, since the days before Kunark.<br />
<br />
For a long time, necro's were WAAAYY to overpowered.  I remember the first time I saw a level 50 necromancer solo the PoD (this is before kunark).<br />
<br />
It seems that after a couple of expansions, necro's and druids were *everywhere* because they were so overpowered.  Druids didn't really get nerfed so much as ignored in other expansions.. necromancers however, recieved one nerf after another.<br />
<br />
I think we're seeing the impact of those nerfs now.  A couple of there suggestions I can approve of.. but alot are just plain silly.<br />
<br />
For example, zonable pets.  Back before BST came out, they had planned to make BST pets zonable. Necro's and mages threw a FIT.  I mean, we put up so much ruckus, they took it away...  Now, like a year or two later, necro's want what they complained about?  O.o<br />
<br />
I dunno, my shaman is only 55, but I like necro's.  More often than not, a necro is the only form of CC I have in my groups.  I consider them a very versitle class.</div></div><hr />

Erm no. Touch of Mujaki is their best lifetap and does 850. A big no on removing the EE for Trucidation from me. Give them a better nuke, but not a 1100 lifetap.<br />
<br />

Sorry, but no again. 1k instant mana with a single cast of a 3 second spell(2 seconds with haste) is like having Canni V with a 6 minute reuse time(and no HP loss). <br />
<br />
A big NO on this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Ancagalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I never perceived necros as getting nerfed to uselessness. <br />
<br />
Your perception is flat out incorrect. <br />
<br />
I remember encounters in Velious where I actually resorted to using Chilling Embrace (600 damage DOT over 1.5 minutes) when I was level 60, as pretty much nothing else will land. <br />
<br />
I remember begging nearby mages and wizzies to cast an Eye of Zomm to tap, because I could not get my lifetaps to land, and I needed to stay in Lich form so I could twitch the healers (these encounters were the reason necro's had such a hard on for Holgresh Elder Beads). <br />
<br />
I remember Verant deciding to throw necro's a bone, and give us a disease based lifetap, and put it as an extremenly rare drop in Chardok, where no one went. For the longest time, I could count the number of necros that had that spell on a single hand, and I would have fingers left over. I did not actually get a copy of Gang Touch of Zum until after SOE made it researchable.<br />
<br />
I remember organizing the team of necro's in my guild, one necro to cast a DOT that would actually land, and each of the other necros to be assigned a cleric/wizard to twitch. Nothing like feeling useful when your ONLY role in a raid was to pass your mana at a 3:1 ratio to another player.<br />
<br />
I remember when pets were only allowed on a handful of specific situations. Before pet hold and before the agro changes for pets, more often then not, pets were a liability.<br />
<br />
I remember looking longingly at our undead only nukes and utility spells, which were for the most part useless outside of the Tower of Frozen Shadow, and on a couple critters in Dragon Necropolis.<br />
<br />
I remember our nuke line of spells Ignite/Chill Bones, which we could usually use one or the other to do damage, but raid leaders did not permit them being used because they had a skeleton illusion, which almost always caused the melees to be out of range for a round or two while they repositioned.<br />
<br />
I remember my guild preferring to use rogues/bards/monks for corpse recovery after a wipe out, because they did not need to spend a coffin to do it.<br />
<br />
For a time, raiding necros were about as useful as perky tits on a nun. But damn, we sure could kick ass in Lower Guk!!! <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">If you thought you were useless in Velious, there's really not much I can say about that.  <br />
<br />
I disagree of course.  My preception is simply based on grouping with necros, one guy in particular.  From my spot on the earth, you are wrong, because he was extremely effective, and it wasn't being a mana whore.  <br />
<br />
Lots of necros did suck, because they tried to overpower a raid since they were so accustomed to be overpowered generally.  Necros clearly were less powerful than they had been at that point, and they needed to be!  It was crazy.  So lots of necros felt &quot;useless&quot; because they weren't stupidly overpowered in comparison to other classes as they had been.  That's a human reaction, one the paladins are experiencing now, but it doesn't mean that necros were actually useless or gimped.  Far from it.  <br />
<br />
The class remained effective, diverse and powerful - always at least as much as any other class, and expectations beyond that are unreasonable.  <br />
<br />
That's not to say some specific complaints weren't valid, like some you articulate.  But it's far different to claim the case was gimped or useless because that's flat out not true.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No one has ever discounted a necro's role in a simple group. In a basic XP'ing group situation, necro's always have been a solid performer. Classes with versitility always do very well in simple groups. But Velious was not about grouping. Velious was about raiding. And, being a necro in a raiding guild in Velious, it was hard times. <br />
<br />
Comparing apples to apples here, Shaman have always been, and continue to be strong in a simple group. XP'ing in the planes? It is hard beat a shaman to anchor a group. But, shaman are not complaining about XP groups are they? They are concerned that their role in the high-end game has evaporated.<br />
<br />
Did you play a raiding necro during Velious Gart? Did you spend a lot of time on the necro message boards, getting an understanding of what necros faced during Velious? I am guessing no to both of those questions, so how are you able to speak intelligently about what necros did or did not have at the time?<br />
<br />
I did play a raiding necro during Velious. I did spend a lot of time on the necro message boards and listening and contributing to the outcry of the necro community. Also, I do play a shaman. I spend a lot of time listening to the outcry on these message boards. You may dismiss the fact that my shaman is merely an alt but whether you believe it or not, I have strived to understand not only my shaman's role in the current game, but the history of the shaman class. <br />
<br />
Both classes have experienced a period of &quot;bottoming out&quot;. Necros several expansions back, and since have rebounded. Shaman currently suffering through the low. The only real difference is the speed of the curve. Necro's nose dive was rather acute and severe, while shaman have had a longer period to atrophy.<br />
