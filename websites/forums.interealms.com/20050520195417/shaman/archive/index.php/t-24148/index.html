<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Through Interealms or EQshaman.<br />
<br />
Just wondering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grobbles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">it has always been in my favourites :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The link from EQShaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>mojoejojo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I always just go through eqshaman.  The EQShaman site is pretty worthless, at least from what I've seen of it, but maybe things are updated and I just dont see it, since the front page hasnt changed in eons.  It is easy to just bring it up tho, and click the link to the crucible forums.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jalelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I type the URL into the address bar for both the Crucible and Ranger's Glade.  I guess I'm not in to these new-fangled devices like bookmarks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kalander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Interrealms....i changed it when yantis bought eqshaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I found this place from a link from the pre-Yantis EQShaman.  Once I found the Crucible, I just never felt the need to go anywhere else for shaman info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Interealms.<br />
<br />
How did people originally find out about the site ?<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i just use bookmarks.. i could never remember that there's one &quot;R&quot; in interealms, not two<br />
<br />
and how i got here? grizlor told me how to get to the serverwide channel after finding out i was a drooman :p after that i think someone was talking about the forums in the channel and i googled it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">That sig is golden.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think I originally found it way back when I started, in '99...  Allakhazam's was one of the few general game info sites I came across, and found a link to the Crucible for Shaman info.<br />
<br />
This was after I decided, from the limited info on the web &amp; before the game arrived, that I would play a Barbarian Shaman of Karana.  :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I found this place from a link from the pre-Yantis EQShaman.  Once I found the Crucible, I just never felt the need to go anywhere else for shaman info.<br />
<br />
Exactly what happened with me, didn't even know eqshaman was still around. First found the link on there to crucible in my early 40's and been coming here ever since.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I found a link to here on either alla or eqshaman - pretty sure it was eqshamn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Aemon Talishan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I came here when it was the Shaman's Spirit (i think) site, run by Max, on the recommendation of a friend.  Then it was hosted at incabrain, then Sunmoon took over when that owner decided to give it up.  This site has been my link to others, not the other way around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">i always go through eqshaman link...found it by doing typing &quot;eq shaman&quot; in a search engine, and have just kept going through eqshaman out of habit</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Had a Shaman on TM tell me about this site. I go through Interealms as there are times (I have a Ranger alt) I want to check something out over there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Moglyzok Moogleman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I knew every class had a website and my bro told me shaman one, so I came here and starting posting, Word of Mouth I suppose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Interealms ... this is the first I ever heard of eqshaman</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Exeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I originally found the site from the links page of the official eq site.  Since then I've always come to it from the bookmark I made the first time I visited.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Fellow Shaman ( Oogah - but first owner long gone now like so many great Shaman's of the past ) shared this site with me.    Since then, I normally click into here after first checking Mobhunter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Same way I've found all the many class boards I read regularly - asked around and did some digging.  There's a link on PoN that's rather handy in that regard too: http://p202.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm21.showMessage?topicID=449.topic</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>kanelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">been coming here for a long time, but got the link from eqshaman the first time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Hehe Kanelan post staring me in the face with exactly what i was going to say. Got here the first time through eqshaman. <br />
<br />
I linked here directly into my favorites once i finally realized that site wasnt really connected to this one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Porgy Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">From either casters realm or alla's in '00 I think I just went to the forums, and book marked them since which ever site led me here was quite useless.  MAybe it was even from eqtactics... I think that was a site a long time ago that went pay...<br />

<br />
I guess I don't use either, but I heard about the Crucible a long time ago from a shammy buddy that no longer plays.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Wolfborn01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I seem to recall that my shaman was a bit advanced.<br />
<br />
While I was playing with someone else in game they sent me the link to the crucible. Made some suggestion, and that was it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Specter Aldonova</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Personally, I came to The Crucible through a link in Belgar's Ultimate Guide to Alchemy.....  Which no longer exists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Was linked on my local server board, and mentioned numerous times by a shaman friend as the BEST spot to find out about shaman related issues, gear, spells, and quests. <br />
<br />
He was right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Budana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I first came here by way of eq shaman long before yantis took it over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Been coming here since before it was even on interealms.  Early kunark I think?  Think I got the link from Everlore or Allakhazam's or something like that, but who can remember that far back? :p  Since then, it's just always been bookmarked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">It's been so long I have forgotten how I found it.  Might have been pointed here by a RL shaman friend of mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I was pointed here by another shaman from my server.  (by the way, you probably dont remember it, but thanks Twoflower, for taking the time to talk to a leve 25 shaman about the Crucible :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">It was a long time ago, I think I was either refered by a fellow player, or looked it up and found a link on Alla's or some such site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Through EQShaman.<br />
<br />
I started trolling the boards in 2002.  I like to think that all the advice people have posted these last few years made me into a better shaman.  I felt it was time to give a little back to the community with my experiences.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">interealms -<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I think I found it through a search and through the Interealms door.  <br />
<br />
Original account here was 7-24-99 under just Sionnach.  I had about 200 posts when I took break and also changed ISP and forgot to change info. I had to reregister under this name.  The post count must have been lost in a crash since it lists plain old Sionnach with Zero posts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Meia_Hexendoktor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">my guild page has a link to all the class forums :)</div></div><hr />
