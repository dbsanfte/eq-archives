<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shaben</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Question going out to Tribunal Worshipping Barbies - can someone who's done the Crown of Deceit (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2275) quest tell me if it's possible to get high enough faction to do this quest without being turned into an imp (or some such)? <br />
<br />
I fancy being able to turn into a wood elf every now and then!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, we can do it with no faction modifiers at all, but being turned imp or something of the like cuts down on factioning time. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shaben</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok - thankye!<br />
<br />
Shaben</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kintai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Warmly is a high enough faction for the old froglok in uguk.<br />
<br />
But, it takes forever and a day.....<br />
<br />
stay at SH, have a SU pally or an AE taunt war pull , or, DS yourself with a potion and pull every undead frog ya see to the SH.  <br />
<br />
Ass/Sup/Cav area, 3 floors and inbetween to SH as one train<br />
Lord / magus / hallway to SH as another<br />
then clear frenzy<br />
then clear gargoyles and the 5 frogs up top near the ledge<br />
rinse, repeat many, many, many mana bar draining times<br />
<br />
count to 12000 (frogs), the slaves near SH are on Uguk faction, so you can check it without zoning.  <br />
<br />
illu frog, illu imp only hurt me when i had it cast, actually dropped my faction</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">With the new changes to faction this patch, Imp may not help anymore, but Frog or Wood Elf may.<br />
<br />
    You really should try to faction in OS, get some exp while you are wasting your time.<br />
<br />
  I had tried to do the quest at warmly, and it didn't work, I had JUST gotten warmly, so that means somewhere during warmly you cross the point to be capable.    If you just get ally there is no guesswork, and you can afford the faction hits of killing the PH for Old Frog instead of waiting on respawns.</div></div><hr />
