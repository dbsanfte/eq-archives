Whats so special you might ask? It's clickable from the inventory :) <br />
<br />
Just a fun little toy I found while slumming in the warrens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">ooooooo... Nice! I seem to recall having read of it before, but didn't realize it was clickable from inventory. Nice to know. Thanks. :) I may have to go try to get one of those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dia Shan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">we cant equip it obviously, <br />
but we can click from inventory?<br />
Didnt know it could be done if it can.<br />
<br />
is it possible for another class to perhaps quest for our clicky sow boots?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Any way to recharge 'em?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Karnn Sathir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Someone mentiond in the serverwide BST channel that he picked one up in the bazaar everytime he went soloing, so I asume it is not rechargeable. Someone must be farming the King in the Warrens on his server, cause I haven't seen it in the bazaar on my server as of yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Draw1more</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">We can click from inventory, I got one a long time ago.   Got resisted a lot though and it not that slow of a snare, but it still a good little toy.  Not sure if it can be recharged though...<br />

No. The boots are only activatable by Shaman, much like the Mage focus items can now only be activated by Mages. Others can (and have) done the quest up to that part just to get the boots only to be disappointed.</div></div><hr />

Eh? What happened? I still have my mage broom and I thought I used it within the last few weeks. Maybe a bit longer.</div></div><hr />
