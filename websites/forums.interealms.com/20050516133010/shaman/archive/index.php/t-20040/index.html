<br />
What is the best race for a SK partner? Ive read disscusions that people like DE for mana but they are looking at it as a main single charcater. Ogre seems good for No stun, HP, etc even though he has low mana his casting isnt as important as if he were a single character. The casting is more for support of the DUO. Snare, Fear, pet, lifetapss, etc<br />
<br />
The shaman of course would be doing the majority of doting, debuffing, buffing, etc<br />
<br />
What do you guys think?</div></div><hr />

Go there, should have some answers for ya. If not I suggest ogre, troll or iksar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have a troll shaman, and a troll shadowknight.<br />
<br />
The simple, and single reason I chose a troll shadowknight was because he could have the same faction and zone access without issue as my shaman and I could take the two anywhere together without any faction issues.<br />
<br />
I did a LOT of thinking about the different races, but in the end, the only real difference between the races is what they look like.<br />
<br />
If you want raw starting int - you could also go with a gnome... but at the higher end game, mana is a function of INT and +mana items.  Starting INT means little to nothing.  Any class with equal INT will have the same mana per level, regardless of race and after a while, int items aren't that hard to find...<br />
<br />
Ogres are nice for unstunnable and that was a tough call for me, especially considering that with karsan there as a 65 shaman for constant PL'ing heals, the troll regen was useless and an ogre would level slightly faster than a troll, plus have better starting stats (including INT).<br />
<br />
I chose a troll strictly for aesthetics since I had a troll shaman.  However, in my honest opinion for raw munchkin-power if you're wanting the best min/max you can get - I'd say go with an ogre if you have a constant shaman on hand to PL.  Ogres are unstunnable from the front in melee, have great starting str/sta, so they max out faster, and have decent INT if you dump all your starting points into INT.<br />
<br />
Total mana pool only matters if you find yourself running out all the time... but again, with the same INT - any race will have the same mana.  It just might take Ogres another +20 INT in items to reach a dark-elf or gnome.  However, that's more than offset by starting STA.  Another option would be to get AGI just high enough to break 75 AGI and dump the rest into INT for the AGI vs. AC breakpoint.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What is the best race for a SK partner? <br />
<br />
No race has any astonishing overall advantage.  All of them have different minor useful advantages.<br />
<br />
I have an Ogre SK that I like a lot.  He's big and beefy, which is what I wanted.  I put all the starting points into stamina that I could, so he'd have the best possible total hitpoints from the word go.  <br />
<br />
I've chased hp equipment for him all the way, to improve his ability to take a pounding.  As it turns out, most of the good SK hp stuff has other stats as well, and so he has also come up with respectable AC int and mana.<br />
<br />
Now at level 55, he has slightly better hp than my 65 shaman.  He tanks for me very reliably.  And I'm confident that will continue to improve as he gets his next 10 levels and his aa.<br />
<br />
I still feel like I'm learning the skills of two boxing.  At the moment the SK does the pulling for me in zones like PoN or Griegs, and then he stands there and tanks.  I hit my aggro hotkey, he grabs the aggro and holds it, and does his job as the tougher of my two pets.  Meanwhile, over on the shaman, I send out the heals and the nukes.  <br />
<br />
You've got to decide for yourself, though.  A lot of people like the way that iksars just have that evil look about them.  Some people like gnomes SKs, just because everyone expects a gnome to be a caster.  A DE female SK can manage to look wicked, seductive, and powerful all at the same time.  <br />
<br />
So.  What do you like to look at?  How do you like to play?  <br />
<br />
Good luck :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">WRONG, one race has an amazing advantage that cannot be replaced by equipment, or spells...<br />
<br />
Ogres, cannot be stunned from the front in melee.<br />
I play a swampdorf (Troll) SK, and it is very fun, but at level 65, regen means nothing, so all races are equal in ability/skill, except for Ogre's and their unstunnablility. If you want to play something else for the heck of it, go ahead, but if you want to min/max, play an Ogre, they make the best tanks for this reason alone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Devnull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ogres are easily the 'best' choice for an SK. Frontal Stun immunity is huge, both for holding aggro and for casting under duress. Plus, they're like onions.<br />
<br />
That said, my shadow knight is an Erudite, just 'cause I prefer playing a less common race/class combo. Oh, and they look dead sexy in plate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you want the fastest leveling SK, then go Gnome, Human, Erudite or Dark Elf. Those races have no penalty to earned EXP; Ogres have a small exp penalty and trolls and Iksar have a rather extensive one (regen is why).<br />
If you play your two toons together all the time, never one without the other, and assuming your Shaman is a barb (most common choice) then an Ogre will level at the same pace more or less.<br />
Ogre also offers the no stun from frontal attacks bonus and has the best starting stamina and strength (largely useless if you have a shaman as a partner though really). The problem is that they are as dumb as a box of hammers, thus you have to rely on aggro type weapons or the lower casting cost Clinging Darkness or Terror lines for aggro and you cant chain cast, your mana pool simply wont allow for it unless your talking about heavy duty twinking.<br />
Erudites, Gnomes, Dark Elves all offer very nice mana pools with the expense of some physical skills...again not a huge defecit with a shaman as your partner. Their mana pools for nukes (the spear line is excellent and offers very good return for its cost) and lifetaps (not so mana efficient, but very useful at higher levels) will be dramatically larger than a similarly geared Ogre or Troll but will likely have less base Hp.<br />
Humans and Iksars fall somewhere in the mid ground here, offering a good balance of stats for you. No real defecits or stat pit falls and roughly equal mana pools and hit point pools for same style gear.<br />
Ok enough Min maxing crap.<br />
In the end, it doesnt really matter a lot. Buffs, gear and AA make up for all problems. The ONLY race that has a marginal lead over the others is the Ogre if for only the immunity to stun from the front. To be honest though thats not that huge a deal.<br />
Play what you like and enjoy the look of....to be honest thats all that really matters.<br />
Another thing to look at is possibly look at what type of Cultural armor is available to you at a decent price. The Ogre made stuff is Hellagood and has TONS of hit points and Ac...lots of Sks wear it at 65 and you wont get tons better till your looting ornate, earning LDON armor or going to the elementals.</div></div><hr />

I know the Ogre has a 10% penalty but I figured Id kill stuff faster by not being stuned to make up for some of it. My Dwarf zerker spent alot of time being stned.<br />
<br />
Also what weapon is best for a SK? 1/2hb, 1/2hs, 2h pierce?<br />
<br />
Need to raise one fast so I can actually hit things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ogre all the way.  I put all the points I could into Sta then Int.  Once you get your Mana-tap proc at 53 I believe, having a smaller mana pool means squat.  It works on ANY mob, caster or not.  As for weapons, I would suggest 2hs or 2hb, as 2hders are the only way to get respectable DPS from a Knight class.  War Marshalls bladed staff is the best twink 2hder there is in my opinion, and the reccomended lvls on weapons are broken.  The only thing holding back his Dmg at low lvls will be innate Dmg caps in the game.  I loved 2 boxing 65 Sham and 65 Sk, great utility, decent DPS and never had to LFG.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">WRONG, one race has an amazing advantage that cannot be replaced by equipment, or spells...

<br />
You have overstated your case.<br />
<br />
No stun from in front is a real advantage, no doubt.  If only the mobs would agree never to aggro from behind, it would be even better.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, mana is also an advantage, not to be overlooked:  and other races have much more intelligence.  That makes a real difference in holding aggro, at all levels.  <br />
<br />
At higher levels the nukes and dots of a well-played SK can add up to very significant damage -- if the SK can maintain the output without running out of mana.  So more intelligence will eventually make a real difference in DPS.<br />
<br />
So, if the thing that matters to you most is avoiding stuns, ogre is the clear choice.  If the thing that matters to you most is high dps, you should consider DE and erudite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Sk's really fall into one of three types assuming average gear and non maxxed stats. <br />
Bashers: trolls and ogres make up this class as they have good melee skills but smaller mana pools. Good if all ya wanna do is melee and occasionally use spells.<br />
Casters: Erudite, Dark elf and Gnomes make up this class, physically weak but impressive mana pools they use spells to make up for thier deficiencies. <br />
All around solid Sk's: Humans and iksar make up the middle road, better mana then bashers and better hps than casters these guys do whatever it takes to get the job done. Humans level faster, Iksar have less downtime while soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The Ogre I have at level 5 I split points into stamina and str? Should I have thre it all into int?.If you're only at level 5, I'd stop and reroll.  Putting starting points into str is a mistake.  Ogres are already very strong, your shaman is right there to buff str even more.  Sta = hp, int = mana.  If you want a damage absorbing tank, put everything into sta you can, the rest into int; if you want to build a SK that will put out lots of deadly DPS at high levels, put more points into int.<br />
<br />
Also what weapon is best for a SK? 1/2hb, 1/2hs, 2h pierce?My SK is maxed in all five weapon skills.  No reason not to.  At some point your SK is going to get a very nice No Drop weapon that has 100+ hp and a vicious damage dealing ratio.  You don't know what class of weapon that is going to be.  It would be a sad thing if you got some godpower weapon and couldn't do anything with it because your skill in that type of weapon is 4 or 5 points.  <br />
<br />
Check the bazaar.  You can buy decent training weapons for your SK for all five skills for under 1000 plat total.<br />
<br />
Need to raise one fast so I can actually hit things.Your level 1 SK will have several hundred hp once you've got him twinked and buffed.  Go to a zone where your SK will be looking at yellow and low red mobs.  <br />
<br />
Make hotkey:  Heal SK<br />
<br />
line 1 :: /pause 3, /target (insert your SK's name here)<br />
line 2 :: /pause 50, /cast 1 (whichever gem you have for chloroblast)<br />
line 3 :: /assist<br />
<br />
The effect of this hotkey is:  it switches your shaman's target to your SK, heals him, and then switches back to his target for root or cripple for aggro.<br />
<br />
Put a DS on your shaman with a potion.  Have your shaman pull the mobs with a low level cripple (not slow).  Now root the mob right next to your shaman.  <br />
<br />
Switch to your SK.  The mob will be beating on your shaman, the only effect is that the mob is dying from the DS.  Start meleeing with your SK, whiff whiff whiff whiff hit whiff whiff whiff ...  work on getting the spacing right, so that your SK is at max melee range, and keep practicing weapon skills, whiff whiff whiff whiff hit whiff whiff whiff.<br />
<br />
If root breaks and mob flees, switch back to shaman, reroot, move shaman into range, move SK into range, continue.<br />
<br />
Mob dies.  Almost all damage has been done by the Damage Shield on shaman:  no credit for anyone.  Shaman has done no damage:  no credit for him.  SK has done a smidge of damage:  You gained experience!<br />
<br />
Your SK will take some hits when you get the spacing or aggro wrong, probably even die a few times while you are getting the hang of it.  Pretty quick you'll be able to switch, hit the Heal SK hotkey, and switch back, pretty seamlessly.  Then your SK is going to fly up many levels very quickly.<br />
<br />
The keys are:  keep the aggro on the shaman by rooting it very close, let the DS do the work, switch zones when the mobs turn blue.<br />
<br />
Welcome to level 30 this weekend.  <br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">1)  20 points of int means jack as far as mana pool goes.  <br />
<br />
2)  The only time mana pool is going to be an issue is if the sk is going to be soloing (which in this case he would not) and even then it doesn't matter much.<br />
<br />
3)  Ogre SKs and Erudite SKs use the same spells for aggro, the most important of which is Clinging Darkness at a whopping 15 mana per cast.<br />
<br />
4)  Rate of mana regeneration is much more important than gross mana pool, and all the races get mana back at the same rate.<br />
<br />
<br />
The only reason to choose one race over another is looks or frontal stun immunity.  It isn't any more complicated than that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">No race has any more or less mana than any other race so long as the intelligence of the two is the same.<br />
<br />
E.G.  the mana pool for a Lvl 18 Erudite SK with 130 INT is EXACTLY the same as the mana pool for a lvl 18 Ogre SK with 130 INT.<br />
<br />
Provided the INT (and +mana gear) is the same, they'll both have the same mana, same spells, and same abilities ... except the ogre can also see in the dark, slam/bash regardless of weapon/shield, AND is unstunnable from the front - all for a nominal exp difference.<br />
<br />
Likewise for HP - provided their STA (and +HP gear) is the same, both the Erudite and the Ogre will have EXACTLY the same AC and Hit Points at the same level.<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter if the stats are maxxed or not - they all max at the same numbers for everyone at the same time... as long as the stats are equal - the associated attributes are also equal REGARDLESS of race.<br />
<br />
BUT -- it does feel nice being able to back yourself into a corner with 12 froggies whacking on you in Seb / Guk and channel that FD without worrying if one of those 12 frogs will stun and interrupt you.<br />
<br />
The bottom line for all this ... I've NEVER personally heard anyone who made an Ogre SK ever complain that they made an ogre. I've heard lots of folks who've made other races say they wish they'd been ogres though.<br />
<br />
For an Ogre SK though, they still start out with tons of STR/STA to put you that much closer to maxing it - and as a shaman, you can't ever buff INT.  I'd dump the starting points into INT, then grab gear as needed and never look back - that will put your mana on par with the smaller races anyway, and you'll still be far ahead of them in melee stats.<br />
<br />
I'd also recommend Rallos Zek as the SK diety for an Ogre, just because in my opinion the Rallosian Ogre cultural armor edges out the Cazic diety cultural.</div></div><hr />

Sure.<br />

But take whatever you use to get the Ogre to 130, and put it on the Erudite instead.  Because his starting stats were so much higher, he won't have 130, will he?  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
As to INT, everyone needs mana, and SK's can get low like anyone else.  20 INT does indeed matter, especially if you're an ogre, because you start with very low INT.  And much of the equipment you pick up at low levels will have very little INT.  When you're younger, too, you don't get full points of mana for each point of INT or WIS; that only stabilizes 10 for 1 at level 50.  An item with 10 INT gives 100 mana at 50, but at 30 it only gives 3/5 = 60 mana.  So the INT you DO get, you don't really get until you've been around the block a few times.  So yes, you need INT.<br />
<br />
I read and talked to a lot of people in the game about how to make my SK, and the feedback was pretty universal that ogre shamans should just dump all their beginning points right into INT.  I forget if I could put more than 20, but basically if I had any extra, it must have bone into either of the two things ogres are really bad at(besides INT) -- AGI or DEX, just so he stayed above 75.  But it was INT all the way. <br />
<br />
Ogre's high STR/STA are a blessing when young.  With buffs, even an extremely low level SK ogre can be max STR if not STA if he has good gear.<br />
<br />
You might try to get a DEX buff off your shaman(or HOS) or someone else if you're not with your shaman every chance you get though.  Until you get pretty good equipment, your DEX will be VERY low, like your AGI, and that will make gaining skill increases in offense and in all your weapons very slow indeed compared to those who have high DEX.  It would be one thing if SK's dual-wielded, but they don't.  A SK can't put a 1hb in one hand and a 1hs in the other and raise both at the same time.  A monk even without high dex would have a much easier time raising offense and weapons skills; SK's in comparison swing only one weapon.  Do yourself a favor and don't forget to get that buffed as often as you can -- nobody likes to &quot;grind&quot; skills on a weapon you might not even like when you could be using your favorite weapon instead.<br />
<br />
As to deity, two considerations.  As a 250 smith, I know the ogre cultural inside out, and the rallos zek ogre cultural is outdone by the human made version, fierce heraldic.  Except, I think for the arms.  Ogre made arms are very good.<br />
<br />
I made my ogre fulvous darkscale, the cultural that cazic-worshipping SK's can wear.  Bright yellow but you can dye it of course; doesn't look bad though, and the color blends in well with ornate, if that matters to anyone.  Anyway, you can equip it at level one and wear it till you're 65, and beyond.  It has more hitpoints than ornate, at least the hands, arms, boots, and wrists do(that's the ornate my SK now wears, for the focuses, but loses HP with each piece he puts on).  Not so the BP of course.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, cazic deity will let you wear armor that is exceedingly good(more INT than rallos plate and very competitive hitpoints and other stats), and that any ogre smith can make for you.  But there is also the value, if anyone still cares anymore, of having cazic faction so you can do the Greenmist quest easier.  You need to be able to get into iksar city for that, and they all worship cazic.  You will have to do less work to get the right faction levels to get a greenmist if you start as a cazic rather than Rallos deity.<br />
<br />
Be aware though, that your cazic toon will be more hated than a rallos toon.  It will be harder to find vendors to buy for, quests to do, and the quests you try will take much more faction work, etc.  That really doesn't matter much in the game anymore, though, to most people.  Overall, I'd recommend cazic over rallos.<br />
<br />
If you powerlevel, I'd use a druid.  They PL very fast up to about 40(can go beyond though, just harder), and are usually the gold standard of PL'ing up to that level.  The nice thing about druid powerleveling is it keeps your defense maxed, which a low-agility ogre finds hard to learn anyway, and needs as much help as he can get on.  If you PL the &quot;drink a potion and let the high-ranking toon get beat on&quot; strategy, you will indeed level very fast, but you will almost immediately fall far behind in your defense skill.  Each point of defense, for a shaman, is worth 2.5 AC -- forget if it works the same for an SK or not.  Five levels of defense per level, so you lose potentially 12.5 AC per level by not getting hit enough.  This can quickly become catastrophic in its own way, as the mobs you eventually start facing are designed to be hitting someone with appropriate defense and the AC that comes with it.  You can fall behind as much as 50 AC surprisingly quickly with powerleveling if you're not careful.<br />
<br />
Some shamans who level by rooting and never get hit have the same problem.  They crumple like wimps when they get hit.  This breeds the famous skittish shaman, who try to wait till the mob is at 50% health before slowing, run like hell when the going gets rough, and generally find every excuse in the book to suck and disappoint their groupmates.  Anyway, it's bad enough to be a shaman who can't take a hit -- a lot of people don't know better and actually kind of expect it!  But a tank who crumples every time he's hit?  Uh oh, incoming suckage reputation!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The Ogre I have at level 5 I split points into stamina and str? Should I have thre it all into int?<br />
<br />
I know the Ogre has a 10% penalty but I figured Id kill stuff faster by not being stuned to make up for some of it. My Dwarf zerker spent alot of time being stned.<br />
<br />
Also what weapon is best for a SK? 1/2hb, 1/2hs, 2h pierce?<br />
<br />
Need to raise one fast so I can actually hit things.<br />
You should really put all your points into Int, its what most Sk's reccomend for trolls and ogres; your stamina and str as an ogre are already very high so more there (specifically str, which really in the end only lets you carry more and gives marginal adds to Atk) will serve limited use. A low int (especially if not twinking or twinking on a limited budget) will give you a very limited mana pool, and increase your fizzle rate for every day play once spell skills are maxed; the higher your int the higher your mana pool and while SK dont get a ton of utilty spells (some good self only stuff though) they do have nice nukes, snares etc.<br />
As to which weapons to work on, work them all; you cant hit crap at low levels anyway, even at the mid 50s with max weapon skills your hit rate is only near 68-75% situationally. Most Sk prefer 2handers for obvious reasons (no dual wield, lower atk due to lower skill caps). <br />
The Sk is the highest DPS of the two knight classes, but dont mistake that for them being a DPS class, situationally (full burn, screw the aggro, wack them with HT discipline etc) they are a top end DPS class, but on average they are well behind rogues and rangers, ranking about equal with a warrior.<br />
Work all your skills that you can, it really wont be that hard unless your on a PL road that moves you super fast, you may find one or 2 lagging behind as you approach level 40, but in the 40s you get no skill ups till level 51, so it really isnt a problem to work the lagging skills in those levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>hdaana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">i have an ogre sk alt. havent broken down to 2 box yet. but i chose ogre for the reason that the new ogre models rock. if they had been out when my shaman was made she would be an ogre too. also i picked ogre cause i wanted to me more of a melee SK than a caster sk. i already cast tons with the shaman. but like most things anymore with race, just pick the one you like best. thats whats gonna make you happy in the long run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Some good points.  I still maintain that 60 mana at lvl 1 or 300 mana at lvl 65 is inconsequential, but I suppose that's a matter of taste.  I had totally forgotten about fizzle rate being affected by Int, though.  That's a valid consideration, especially since hybrids appear to have a substantially higher fizzle rate than do the pure casters.<br />
<br />
One other stat option, depending on how min/max you want to get, is to make an ogre and put as much as you can into Sta with an eye towards eventually maxing Sta before buffs.  That would make skilling up a bit more of a PITA, but if you max pre-buff Sta, you just freed up a buff slot.  As it is now at 65 I have a much much bigger problem with running out of buff slots than I do with skilling up, fizzles or mana considerations.  Not for everyone, I know, but worth considering.<br />

About armor, Fierce Heraldic is indeed better stats than Ogre cultural, but it's War/BRD only.  One of the non-RZ sets of Darkscale has a bit more sta on some pieces than the other two sets (+10 vs +5 on some pieces), but overall they are about the same, and they're all the best buyable armor choice for fat SKs that I know of that's obtainable by normal humans (I charge 5k a sheet for cultural, making legs 15k vs Ornate plate legs at 200k+ essentially for 15 more hp and a useless effect).</div></div><hr />
