<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caelum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Needless to say, I hit 65, and then...burned out with constant slowing/canning action.<br />
<br />
I want to take a break, so, I'm making an alt.  Being a caster, I figured I would hit the other end of the spectrum and make myself a melee.<br />
<br />
However I can't decide which one to make.<br />
<br />
Warriors are good, get the disciplines later on.  Can use just about every weapon and the best armor.  But, no utility spells to back them up.  Not even simple invis to get to tough places where your group is waiting.<br />
<br />
Rangers are great for DPS, plus some nice utility spells.  Not to mention what they can do with a bow later on *drool*.  Problem is they don't get the AC/HP that a warrior gets.  However I can swap out some chain gear through shared banking for ghetto twinkage.<br />
<br />
Paladins are nice support melees, can help keep a group healed and can even res to a limited degree.  Lay on Hands is a lifesaver at that too.  However same problem as Clerics when it comes to utility spells.<br />
<br />
Shadowknights are nice for messing up a mob.  Nice with the DPS, snare (Darkness line), and Feign Death is a saver at times.  Of course if you need to patch heal a group member, should have been a Paladin.<br />
<br />
So I figured I would ask my fellow shaman and see what they have to say.  Have any of you tried an alt and found one you really liked, and think a fellow shaman would like in general?  Should I just roll a 4 sided die?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Any reason you left out Rogues or perhaps Monk (i know, i know)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaeydee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My first character was a warrior.  They are entirely too dependant upon others and their armor.<br />
<br />
Personally, I went with a monk.  I don't know what it is about a monk, but most shaman I know have a monk alt.  I've solo'd my monk to 41 with the help of shaman potions, and my shaman basically duo'd the entire epic (which is doable at level 41, just can't use the clicky).  I know 41 isn't much, but I rarely get to play her since when I'm on its generally to raid.<br />
<br />
Monks are melee, but not so dependant upon others so much.  Thats what I like about them.  Sure buffs help a monk...but if ya get in a sticky situation...FD!  Or when you are low on life, FD and mend, then let your fungi take ya back up to full health.  Granted its not the most efficient way to do things.<br />
<br />
I would suggest maybe going to test and /testbuffing each class that you are thinking about and see which fits you the best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gawkmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">How about a Beastlord. You get some of the utility spells of the class you already know well with the ability to stand toe to toe and melee yourself silly, all the while playing with a pet that can easily step up and tank for you when your arms get tired :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I enjoy my warrior for a change of pace. And being Shaman we can make pretty much any potion for our non-casting alts that they may need. It's just real nice not to have to worry about saving money for spells or trying to find them when you could be doing something else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Rangers can do fun stuff (and they get sow - very hard to live w/o after years of shaman life).  Plus they can solo a good bit, especially later on with a good bow.<br />
<br />
Aside from that, I'd probably go with sk or paladin.  Straight up melee is just far too boring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I played a Rogue for about 10 months, loved it. Damage aside, being able to sneak/hide through places where invis does not work was probably why I enjoyed the class so much. The damage was fun to watch and even though I know assassinate is pretty much eye candy, it is funny when it happens. <br />
<br />
The downside is that there was simply nothing I could do when casters started to get eaten. No taunt, no /shield, no spells...even with poisons, there wasn't much I could do to help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you are worried about utility and getting around than go ranger or sk. Never have to ask for an invis and never have a mob run from you. If you are really worried about being to fragile than Sk sounds like someting you should try. <br />
<br />
  My ranger doesnt fall over dead the second she has to tank an add but she wont be confused with a plate class. I have tanked in tier one pop without to much extra healing and certain things in tier 2 without defensive aa's. But my friends sk course tanks all of it better especially with his higher taps and taps over time. The archery can be fun long as in a group that cares about mob placement. Always fun to pop trueshot on a named only to have it pushed into a wall and not be able to hit. <br />
<br />
  Anywhoo babble aside if you want a change from a shaman pally probably wont do it enough you will still be watching people healths and backup healing and buffing to a point. Rangers buff some if a few other classes arent around and sk's just tap group or single taps. IF you dont want to watch healths and are worried about utility than sk or ranger sound like might be your thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">SK or Ranger is probably the way to go from what you described. A Ranger will be the most familiar to you as far as play style is concerned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think the exact opposite of a shaman is a rogue.  No buffs and zero utility other than scouting and corpse dragging in many zones.  They can't affect the outcome of the fight at all, except to do amazing DPS if the rest of the group cooperates on mob placement.  Solo really isn't a viable option.  No casting, medding, canni, or any mana worry - ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If your burned out try something not computer related!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grimdreg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If your burned out try something not computer related!  :)<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree with Cabe here.  I've been pretty burned out on EQ so I decided to take a break for a while and play Final Fantasy XI.  It was fun for a few hours, my monk was getting pretty good at hitting those wiley huge hornets and tunnel worms when I realized, this is almost exactly the same as Everquest.  Now I don't feel like logging into either game. (thanks for that little nugget of realization brain!)  Maybe sit down and read a book or two, or if you've got a console, give that a swing.  I hear Kill-Switch is pretty entertaining....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My main alt is a rogue. my secondary alt is a ranger, my tertiary alt is a monk. I love em all.<br />
<br />
My RL friend is a warrior, and personally I don't know how he stands it. Entirely dependant on buffs and heals.<br />
<br />
I've seen shadowknights and pallys in action, but can't really bare to level another character up. imo, a SK would be much more fun to play at post 60 than a pally would be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have a ranger and monk, both above 55.  At one point in time they both took turns as my &quot;mains&quot;.  Shaman was my most recent alt, and now he's my main and I wish I had found the shaman class earlier.<br />
<br />
Anyway, rangers are very strong right now.  Great damage and great utility.  Monks aren't very strong right now.  Little to no utility and their slight DPS advantage isn't enough to make up for their lack of utility.  That said, I still enjoy my monk, mainly for conceptual reasons.  Martial arts and minimalism is a neat thing to play around with.  :P<br />
<br />
But if I had the time and ambition to play a melee alt right now, I'd have to go rogue.  There is nothing more absolute than just pure DPS.<br />
<br />
Most groups these days consist of a big healer, a big tank, a slower, buffer/backup-healer/crowd-control toon, and 2 DPS, or some variation of that.  It's good safe xp.  Able to handle a lot.<br />
<br />
One time though, I got a group in PoV that consisted of me (shaman), a SK, rogue, BST, mage and AM3 ranger.  All of them fairly &quot;well-endowed&quot;.  It looked like raid-spam, and spell-spam.  I was the only healer and main slower, but it didn't matter --- the mobs were dropping jaw-droppingly fast, and I didn't need to be a uber-healer.  The mobs weren't alive long enough to do any serious damage.  We cleared the *entire* cave in PoV with one group and were waiting for mobs to spawn.  If we pulled an add, a caster would kite one 'til the first was dead.<br />
<br />
My guild is starting learn the ropes of raiding (we're a family guild who hasn't raided much), and we have a great group of supporting classes.... clerics, chanters, shamans, druids, etc...  we have a few good tanks.  We're lacking in DPS classes, and it shows on the big fights.  Sometimes our plan is good and well-executed --- we just don't kill it fast enough, and what started off as a fight well-in-hand soon becomes an OOM and ping-pong fest.<br />
<br />
I'm so impressed with rogue damage at 65... I'd love to have one of my own guided missles to aim at the back of a mob.  Despite not having as much utility as other classes or being able to whip out something special when the fit hits the shan, I still feel comfortable knowing a rogue is present and making those mobs die faster.<br />
<br />
If I wasn't restricted to a melee alt, I'd consider either a rogue or a mage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I played a ogre sk up to 35 thinking I would trade out my ranger for a plate tank, but found I didn't really like the class alot. Not much utility, tanks well but spells seemed to require alot of mana and weren't as useful as rangers. Most Sk spells are cast in battle where as a ranger can easily buff and med while the casters med up. Ranger snare is more reliable than sk snare due to the longer duration, and rangers can use it to build agro on mezzed mobs without a dot breaking mezz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I play a rogue and shaman and they are indeed the difference in night and day.<br />
<br />
As a shaman, I feel empowered and that I can get a group out of almost any bad situation, ultra powerful, able to affect outcomes, makes a weak group strong and a strong group stronger, not much damage potential if you are healer.  If we fail or something goes wrong, I have to question myself as to what I could have done better.<br />
<br />
As a rogue I am totally powerless to save anyone but myself.  No buffs, no tells for buffs, just pure and simple melee damage.  With the SoS AA ability I can litereally go anywhere, almost without fear, its exciting to be the only one in a zone wandering around in the deepest depths that many only dream about and many will never see.  If we as a group fail, there is really not much to contemplate about what I could have done, I really cant do anything to save anyone, I have no utility except through procs on weapons.<br />
<br />
Playing them on separate accounts together make both classes even more fun.<br />
<br />
Cant really speak to SK or Rangers except that I group with both a lot and both seem like really fun melee classes with loads of utility.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I ran a ranger and warrior up to 40th lvl recently, then decided to go with the ranger. Good warrior gear is actually pretty cheap these days but what made up my mind was the lack of uitility. I just felt too helpless with the warrior when it hit the fan while the ranger has a lot more options. I'll take their flexibility over the warrior hitpoints, it just fits my style better. Up to 50, he tanks well enough, I actually had better ac than a warrior in a recent LDoN group! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Play a bard. There are not alot of them around and if you can play one well you can always make a group go 'WOW! I love playing my bard and impressing the poo out of everyone. Check out www.eqdiva.com and read on their forums. I love my bard because I am excellent in groups and I kick the crap out of my shaman soloing (swarm kiting = 10 dead mobs in 15 min). A well play bard has no downtime and are pretty uber imo. Better than being a melee that has to LFG all the time to get anything done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gooch Gooch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I agree, gnome paladins rock.  yeah you start out with crap str/sta but guess what?  In this world of sweet gear, it doesn't matter unless you are just starting the game out.  A level 1 with 1khp isn't extremely difficult to attain anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Way back when I made an Ogre Warrior of RZ on the offchance that at some point when I had money, Rorgg would become a smith and make him cultural armor.  Well, lo and behold, the day finally came and by that time, cultural was a heck of a lot better than it was way back then.<br />
<br />
I have to say, a warrior with a full set of cultural at 45 and a couple solid weapons is pretty much a badass.  I've actually soloed most of the way to 45 (thanks, Lots o' Bandages!), though good dark blue pickins are getting slim now.<br />
<br />
I actually had a Paladin at 33 when this warrior was 23, but the Warrior was just so much better at tanking, which is really all the pally did anyway, that I just stuck with the warrior.<br />
<br />
Granted, when it's time to pull in a dungeon, I may be wishing I'd gone the other way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I have a rogue 52 atm, I really like playing the rogue, a lot of abilities coming at low level and really nice DPS<br />
Yes a shaman can do DPS, but rogue makes it better :) and everyone can see it. It isn't like dots or nukes that some turn off<br />
My RL bro made a war, he rerolled for a mage because a war that isn't MT of a guild has hard time getting equipment</div></div><hr />
