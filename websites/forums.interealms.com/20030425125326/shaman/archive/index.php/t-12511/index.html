<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fangface</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have recently upgraded a good number of my item slots and progressed down my Epic path to a decent point, I think.  I am currently trying to figure out what is a decent chest item, that I can either camp or buy for a reasonable price.  I don't have a guild, but do have a sibling with a 65 druid and 65 pally for a friend.  We do plat farm in Seb ususally once a week, earning on average 4-5k each for a few hours work.  So, I'm not currently rich due to buying loads of items, but I can probably scrounge up 20k in short time.  i should mention Tae Ew Chain Tunics are still over priced on Venril Sathir server, which I play on, 30k still and Polished Tin are around 6k.<br />
