<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>dennman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">woohoo just got a ST key the other day. Since i took a 9 months break so I am not too knowledgeable with it. any good shaman drops there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rebasik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">well.. the spell primal avatar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Priceless/primal spears and brawlsticks depending on whats rotting/what melee are after. Scales that can be turned in for a range of different items but you need to hand your key in also so they tend to get banked and filed under 'worry about MQing that in the far future'.<br />
<br />
Thats about it if you're on a post sleeper server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The scale and the spell Primal Avatar are the only real good shaman items. Scale can be turned in for an Essence Lens (along with your key, so you probably won't be doing that if you just got a key).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>dennman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ok are priceless/primal weapons that good for a shaman? i mean when i melee i usually miss so often then even with avatar i dont think i could do more damage than jbb. i guess if i could get one it would be a fun toy. oh i guess it may help if the mob has high CR. thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ralahast-BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">priceless/primal weapons are very excellent for the stats they provide as well, +10 saves vs. all , + stats, + HP and Mana, and the primal spears look awesome :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jendain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">primal 2hb looks more interesting in fact, if you ask me.<br />
<br />
it's the good old kickass velious 2hb spiked bat graphics<br />
<br />
45/44 owns hard<br />
8 to all stats/resists<br />
75 hp/mana</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A toy, in other words.  I suppose against a resistant mob, it's better than meditating sometimes, though even there you're probably better off finding someone to heal somewhere.<br />
<br />
Gotta love the look, though.</div></div><hr />
