<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Badz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am level 50 shaman on TP server.  I have a second account and generally 2-box.  I have a 52 warrior, 36 sk and 30 magician on the second account.  My shaman is my main and I will bot the other.  <br />
<br />
Playing style is I like to visit/hunt new lands/dungeons more than XP grind.  I prefer grouping when I can.  I dont belong to a guild anymore and after being in 4 I dont think I can take another.<br />
<br />
My question I have is which of the 3 characters on the other account would I be most successful with (warrior, sk, magician)?  I think magician because he provides another pet, nukes and summoned stuff for pet plus they both can gate out of dungeons.  This warrior was my first character and I have bit of loyalty to him.  Sk provides pet and better agro control.<br />
<br />
I have gotten to the point that I want to play just my shaman with a partner now that I have played around with the other classes that interested me.  Thank you for your opinions!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would personally go for the SK.  While the magicain is able to do wonderfull things in a duo the shaman is designed to augment a melee class, not a caster class.<br />
<br />
Melee will be much more usefull in the long run.  Go SK, as he can provide the instant agro that a warrior cannot hope to generate. The ability to single pull just about anything that the SK brings is also very valuable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would have to second that on the SK. My wife has a 65 mage and there's only so much that the pet can tank. <br />
<br />
SK is a god for tanking/agro control and even more so in the dungoen setting /love snare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Warrior : of the three, has the least overall usefulness in a Duo sitiation. Complete lack of utility. All he really provides is Damage and a Taunt button. Two small advantages : is already a suitable level for XP hunting with the shaman, and since warriors are pretty 1-dimensional it will take less concentration to play it as your 2nd character.<br />
<br />
SK : Fair amount of utility. Easier single pulls, excelent agro generation. Lowest damage output of the 3. Can (sorta) group with the Shaman for XP right now, but will either be dead weight for a while (hunting mobs suitable for the shaman) or will halt the shaman's progress (hunting mobs suitable for the SK). Fairly easy for a shaman to power level to suitable level.<br />
<br />
Mage : Biggest potential damage output of the 3. Loads of utility eventually (not a whole lot right now but the mage needs more levels anyway). Can't group with the Shaman currently (needs to be 33 to group with a 50), and is a little bit harder to PL than a melee (basically, you act like the pet is the one you are PLing).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok, I'm going to throw out an entirely different idea.  I 2 boxed a sk with my shaman for most of 2002, mainly because it wasn't very easy to get groups and I wanted to try it. I quit eq for 6 months in Nov 2002 because I was burned out, missed having fun groups, etc.  I don't care what folks say, 2 boxing in dungeons is hard, stressful and dangerous if you are pressing the envelope.<br />
<br />
Now if you are a glutton for punishment feel free to 2 box, but I found with the advent of POP that shaman were in demand, could get groups, were interesting again, experienced quickly, and my goodness it was a heck of a lot easier than 2 boxing.<br />
<br />
Also, by stripping my sk (money sink) I was able to buy all my spells and upgrade my armour enough to where I wasn't getting smacked around too badly (lol).<br />
<br />
I started back in the game in April at level 60 with 6 aa's and now I have 125 aa's at 65.  I log on and folks send me tells to join um in this place and that place - life is good.  I also joined a good guild which has enhanced my playing time and I recommend that to most folks.  Just take some time and find a guild that is alligned with your goals for EQ (what ever they may be).<br />
<br />
I always thought that I would be bored playing the shammy all the time, but at least for me it has been fun and rewarding and its nice to be in a guild &quot;community of sorts&quot;.  The game is much more rewarding, at least to me, if all your buddies are doing well also.   My 2c and I'm just giving my experience as something to think about, I'm certainly not suggesting that one way is better than another.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hamenu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Mage is the best choice of the three, but one of the least played classes in game, so many peeps don't seem to understand their advantages.<br />

<br />
This is the primary advantage of a magician. The tank/pet is disposable, and the mage doesn't require lots of gear to have great DPS, just a stack of malachite. A horse is nice if you'll be two boxing, but not required. Melee's are expensive to keep upgrading, casters tend to gain power for less cost. Mages get great DPS just by acquiring a pet spell, and a basic nuke or two.<br />
<br />
2nd advantage is the magician can gate, and eventually CoH, so travel is much easier.<br />
<br />
3rd Advantage is you don't have to worry much about mob positioning, just send the pet, and alternate nukes/heals/dots between the shammy and magician. If you get adds, root them, and the mage can cast rains and PBAE. Shammy pet makes a nice companion to the mage pet on unrooted mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bilgoba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've duoed with all 3 and all of them would work.  Me and a mage friend used to make &quot;leet exp&quot; before PoP came out killing mobs in Akheva</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">IMO SK &gt; Mage &gt; Warrior. People take a large hit to play a troll and the reason is SNARE is really nice. The sk gives you snare wheras the mage gives you a root pet (and no root spell).. The sk can fd pull and give you mana/hps back. Both can take well (some prefer sk to warrior) in xp groups which you like.. the only time a warrior is superior to the other two is if you want to take out a named or if you are raiding and he is going to mt.. <br />
<br />
Raiding wise mages are decent but you need to pay attention to them, warriors are a no go for 2 boxing, doubt someone will like an alt mting (or that the alt will have good enough gear) but the sk can fd if you are just busy, does good dps when you have time, and has HT which is really nice no matter what level.. <br />
<br />
the mage duoing tactic in pop is to have the mage pet tank while both of you heal, imo that's just too boring..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">SK all the way.  I like them so much my alt is a 55sk.  They rock.  The agro they generate is simply amazing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tuuk Basdeoghail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">go with the warr. I hydra a shaman/warr myself. and it works perfect.<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
Since i'm controlling *both* chars, i know *exactly* when the spells about to go off. I watch the &quot;casting&quot; bar... and just as the spell goes off, I hit the taunt button on the warrior.<br />
<br />
There's an impression out there that warriors cannot hold aggro. This is complete nonsense. What's happening, is warriors hit the taunt button ever time it pops up. That's bad, and get's casters killed. You have to learn *when* to hit the taunt button.<br />
<br />
Another reason for the warrior. &quot;/disc Defensive&quot; owns. When you're by yourself, this will give you lots and lots of time to get the mob slowed and situated before worrying about heals. At L62, my warriors defensive disc timer was like, 6 minutes or somthing. When popped, it would last the whole fight, plus a little extra. Mobs that generally hit for 400+ hit me for about 80 when the disc was up.<br />
<br />
Since your pretty much set to start playing immediatly when you hydra like that, you can start trolling for all the classes that get left out of groups, but are just *perfect* for your situation. I invite as many necro's, wizzy's, and mages that i can. Everyone wants all the shammy's and cleric's out there. And totally overlook the sheer hell casters can unleash.<br />
<br />
Warr + shammy + 4 casters? Mobs go down so fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I gave my 62 sham to a friend to take a break, ended up making a twink sk to duo with him.  We have tons of fun doing dungeon crawls and duoing stuff only a few months ago took groups or raids to do.  My Sk is only lvl 55 atm and moderately well equipped.  The Warrior being more DPS then a SK is debateable, however I must admit /disc defensive would open up some possiblilties, but our real exciting fights last far longer than the Disc would.  Since SK can split pulls a war couldnt, I would lean towards lvling the SK some more.  Snare is a huge asset too.  In summary though, instead of worrying too much, play whichever you enjoy more or is less of a headache.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tuuk Basdeoghail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">you have some good point Gus. I guess i don't worry too much about dps/snaring because my 3rd hydra is a wizzy. <br />
<br />
I tend to think of DPS in melee terms. With spells, and post-pop weapons, an SK can most definitly out damage a warrior. Most tanks i play with that aren't in elemental guilds tend to run about with windblades, so the duel wielding thing doesn't factor in much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>dikkakor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I 2 box as well with a shaman / mage (see the sig) and I was always being hammered on to help with groups. i just started really duoing last night as most of my RL pals had logged early and found myself all alone in DL (yes i know DL ,blech - we had just finished in KC so SHOOSH) well I get both pets up, buff dog, haste both pets (mage burnout II also) make summoned swords for both regen myself and start pulling with slow. Well turns out that I ended up chain pulling to myself for about 1 hr and made great xp in that short time. <br />
<br />
<br />
Pull with slow, send pet on INC, keep DS/regen up on scooby, keep both hasted. Maybe one nuke from mage and I was chain pulling to my pet park spot. I couldn't believe how easy it was. Made half a level for the mage last night.. too easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you like to visit new places and go to dungeons, then the SK is your best choice.  Snaring helps prevent trains, not snaring just reduces time pulling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'll go with the consensus and say for general utility, the SK wins.  Brings pull, tank, and snare in a nice package along with some very very nice HP/Mana regen at higher levels.<br />
<br />
There's a big but here: A second-account mage with CoH could prove immensely valuable to your guild in certain situations if you can leave it parked places.  This may not be a factor now, but keep it in the back of your head.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The simplicity of a warrior is really nice when 2 boxing. I pull with the shaman, point the warrior at it, kick, auto attack ( taunt if needed ), and then continue canni'ing on the shaman, repositioning the warrior when required. My warrior snares just fine, with a 500pp item from sebillis. Silken whip of ensnaring. Even at level 51, he's almost as good a tank as I am with LR4 and 100 less AC. <br />
<br />
Point is , for 2 boxing a shaman has to be really buzy to be effective. Warrior is damn simple to operate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'm getting ready to start a 3rd char, and I'll be going SK.  I recently PL'd a rogue to level 48 (in just under 48 hours total play time, might I add), so I'm counting on the SK's added aggro ability to help my trio along.  Plus, I've played a warrior to 55 before creating my shaman, so I'm looking for something different.  <br />
<br />
I'll let you know how well it works in a week or so  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hi, how ya doing?<br />
<br />
i am a 58 Shaman, i duo with my 56 SK, and i retired my 62 warrior. my best friend is a 56 mage.<br />
<br />
as  a straight Duo. go with the Shadowknight first. Aggro control is SOO important. using first snare then his spears/dots, even before the mob arrives means he has aggro, period. you can then land slow, malo, dot, epic, and the mob stays on the SK. period. someone cried that SK don't have the DPS of a warr? my SK is using my retired warr's windblade. with the atk buff's of the SK, he is doing the same damage if not more than my warrior.<br />
<br />
the warrior is the worst class of the 3 to duo with. SK=DPS, SK&gt; aggro, SK has snare....why bring a warrior? <br />
<br />
the mage is not a bad option either. the mage will out DPS the SK. the pet's (yours and his), combined with mage able to alpha the dog, isn't bad, but you can't drop all your spells if needed without getting aggro.<br />
<br />
there's 2 reasons why my warrior is retired. and poor duo compared to the SK is one of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>zolexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">[QUOTE='Badz']Playing style is I like to visit/hunt new lands/dungeons more than XP grind. QUOTE]<br />
<br />
For visiting new stuff for the 1st time, experimenting, etc, I'd most definately say go with the SK.  Of the 3 mentioned he will be your best bet for scouting.  Sk can invis, FD (huge plus), and in the event of a big fubar summon corpses.  As mentioned above, the SK can split mobs for singles that a warrior couldn't.  For dungeon setting there is that ever popular snare.  <br />
<br />
I may be a bit biased because my main is an SK.  But I love the shaman/SK duo.  My 2nd PC's been broke for quite some time, so right now the only time I get to dual-box then is when visiting a friend, and that's only if he brother isn't home either.  But I did get to this past weekend and I was very suprised at the ease and utility of the 2 classes combined. (Had not dual-box'd them since the shaman was 49 and the SK 51)<br />
<br />
I would say since your warrior is currently on a par level with the shaman to try him out.  See how that goes.  If you find yourself wishing for a bit more utility in your tank then work on the SK.<br />
<br />
The only thing that would draw me back from trying the mage for dungeon crawling is that if you have to invis roam/scout, then you have no tank (other than self) until the mage has a chance to summon ol' Gebober.  Plus the reliance on mana in this group would be very heavy, making for more downtime when mage runs oom.  An SK is still very effective when oom/lom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kujoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I would opt for the Shadowknight.  I am a bit biased because I two box a shaman and SK.  The Sk can snare, FD split and they get a pet.  If you are looking to try another character from scratch, I'd recommend a necromancer.  Necro/Shaman combo is pretty much unstoppable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Bandicoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I 2 box a level 61 shaman with a level 60 monk and am powlerleveling a  50 mage as a second shaman partner.<br />
<br />
I find the monk much easier to handle than the mage. The mage tends to die when the **** hits the fan. This may be because he is fighting slightly out of his depth ads usually go staright for him due to level aggro.<br />
<br />
Anyway I would go for the SK for same reasons as the above posters. ALSO, the fact remains your reaction time just isn't as good with 2 chars as with one so it really helps if your 2nd character can take a few hits if they get aggro. Mages tend to die very quickly...<br />
<br />
Having said that, I really like the mage class and enjoy playing it! They are cheap to run, have very good nukes and their pets are great!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Reysa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I 2-box a 57 shaman and a 65 mage. The mage was my only char until PoP came out, after which I had trouble soloing anywhere that would provide interesting fights.<br />
<br />
If you can get a bunch of AAs with the magician it will provide a great partner. I have Suspend Minion 2, so for a tough situation I can summon a pet in 4 seconds, which is fully buffed and equiped. That's handy. So are the auxilliary pet AAs like Host of Elements and Servant of Ro. The summoned belt plus weapons adds 600 HP to the pet, bringing my favorite (Air) to about 4500 HP. I wish there was some AA to help pets tank better (like LR5 for pet, hehe) but without that the pet does quite well on anything I plan to duo. It can't tank *everything* but it can handle pretty much everything I think *I* can handle 2-boxing.<br />
<br />
My biggest problem is crowd control. Snare would be nice, but root should work in theory. The trouble I have is switching chars and hitting the right keys at the right times. I only have one comp, and rely on EQW to make it all work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">My two boxing combo is a 57 war right now.  The warrior was groomed to one thing and one thing only - to be my meat shield. Ogre, RZ worshipper to wear fierce heraldic,  Max HP, and nothing else matters. Aggro problems? Just root and put the warrior next to the mob.  Get him an ankle smasher for snare proc, and he will rule.  With stuff that makes live exiting at 60+ you are going to be busy with your shaman, you want a simple character to two-box. All you do with your warrior is watch HP, and if his HP go down to fast hit that defensive hotkey.  <br />
Onother advantage is that you can go very simple in equipment, no need to balance int/mana/AC/HP for as for your SK.<br />
If you go mage, the mage will be your main DPS, and your shaman mainly becomes your support character.  As a shaman main that always went against my playstile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I would go with SK with a Mage a close second. The advantage a SK is in dungeons where snare and FD are huge benefits. Facing summoning/Gating mobs can get ugly and Shadow Knights have tools to help in these situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I've always had better luck with a mage duo. An SK can't equip your pet to become a killing machine of invincible doom, and, for the vast majority of the game, they can't do damage for crap.<br />
<br />
But I'm one of those people who think offense &gt; defense. I would rather have a group full of burnination and mass stabbin' than your usual Tank / Cleric / Enchanter &quot;safety group&quot;. <br />
<br />
If i DO find myself needing a tank, I'll take a Paladin. They hold aggro better than SK (Their level 9 stun has the taunt ability that Disease Cloud used to for SK), and bring far more utility.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Mage Mage Mage Mage<br />
<br />
Myself and my friend, both 62 at the time (shaman and mage) were duoing in PoV inner at one point (he was without epic) amazing experience. We could also do GW's before i got torpor, inner acrylia named, we got Zelnithiak in UP to 5% (FIVE PERCENT!) together. Mage pet is is easily sustained better than a warrior, and the pure DPS of magi put them above an SK in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Astraa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Although I love Mages (boyfriend played a Mage before switching to Monk) I'd definately go with an SK, I lately pled an SK, and atm 3box Shaman - Necro - SK much fun =P<br />
Not starting a huge arguement here, but SKs help out a lot over Mages when it comes to adds, even though granted Shaman can handle the adds with root, and Necro can keep a couple mezzed, while 3boxing it is easier to have them hitting the SK (not taking much damage mind you) keeps the stress down a tad, also keeps your heart from racing and forgetting which keyboard is which *coughs* not that I'd do that =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Since I've got True Spirit, I've just fallen in love with the higher level mage summoned items for pets.    I head out to the Bazaar before each major hunt and grab a couple of belts, muzzles, and those proccing swords (or fists).<br />
<br />
We all know the swords work, because they proc.  I know that the belts work as well because my Incomplete CH does more on him when he has a belt/girdle.    I'm assuming the Muzzles work for item haste.<br />
<br />
Anyhow... my point is... while the SK may offer some really unique (to this combo) abilities such as snare and FD... the mage also has a lot of bells and whistles to help out.   While having great dps from a pet, DSs, and nukes... they also enhance your dps from your pet (and make him tougher).<br />
<br />
I'm thinking of PLing a mage, just so I won't have to buy this stuff or bug mages anymore :)</div></div><hr />
