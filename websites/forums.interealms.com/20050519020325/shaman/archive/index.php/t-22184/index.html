<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've seen posts on this issue before... but given all I've seen debated, and the data being brought forth (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=22161), does it make sense to remove dps reducing debuffs from EQ entirely?  <br />
<br />
I mean, as far as I can tell, the vast majority of class balancing issues, as well as game tuning issues, revolve around debuffs that affect mob dps.  I'm at the point where I think....<br />
<br />
-----------------<br />
<br />
They should have just left debuffs that reduced mob dps out of the game. There isn't any way to balance classes and at the same time balance encounters by having ANY dps debuffs in the game.<br />
<br />
Buffs that increase player dps, either through physical or mental enhancement, or debuffs that increase the damage that a mob receives, via reduced resists or reduced AC, etc.. are fine. These type of spells do not alter the mob dps and therefore allow the encounter to be tuned to an acceptable difficulty level.<br />
<br />
At this point in the game, I'd be in complete favor of completely removing any debuffs the reduce mob dps. Namely slow, cripple, etc..<br />
<br />
My vision of the shaman would therefore become:<br />
<br />
Shaman prime roles:<br />
<br />
1. Increase the damage a mob receives:<br />
----a) Buffing the player<br />
..........i. melee buffs: attack, str, dex, strikethrough, etc..<br />
..........ii. caster buffs: focus type effects (mental strength, chance to crit, etc..)<br />
----b) Weakening defense<br />
..........i. help melee hit: reducing AC, agility, etc..<br />
..........ii. help casters hit: reducing resists<br />
<br />
2. Damaging the mob:<br />
----a) Dots: Need a complete overhaul.<br />
..........i. Aggro: Dots should be less aggro than nukes. period.<br />
..........ii. Duration: Suggestion 1) Dots burn mana as they tick, and can run forever if you can keep mana up. Suggestion 2) Dots &quot;splurt&quot; backwards. 800, 500, 200, 100 etc..<br />
----b) Rains/AE: Let this be our &quot;specialty&quot;.<br />
..........i. Reduce the resist rate<br />
..........ii. Increase Variety<br />
__________1) Reintroduce our fire line as a single target 3 wave &quot;nuke&quot; type rain. Highest resist rate, similar to our poison now.<br />
__________2) Buff our poison line. Give it -50pr, increase dmg. 4 target like now.<br />
__________3) Reintroduce disease cloud. True AE, but lower damage, however easiest to land.<br />
----c) Nukes: Bah, let the druids have them<br />
<br />
3. Complimentary healers:<br />
----a) Heal over time<br />
..........i. Largest single target heal over time of any priest.<br />
..........ii. Group Quiessence<br />
----b) Wave healing<br />
..........i. AE Heal in a rain form<br />
..........ii. Single target rain heal.<br />
----c) Weakest direct heals of any priest.<br />
<br />
They can take our slow, cripple, disease dots, and ice nukes and toss them away imo.<br />
<br />
So then we'd have this for priests:<br />
<br />
Cleric: Best fast direct healers and CH, best hp buffs<br />
<br />
Druid: Second best direct healers and CH, best nukes, second best HP buffs<br />
<br />
Shaman: Weakest direct heals but best HoTs to compliment either a cleric or druid, not the best direct damage but more versatile with AE, ability to stack dots on longer battle means we outdamage druids over time, third best hp buffs, but dps increasing player buffs.<br />
<br />
Ok.. hehe. I typed a bit more than I intended. But jeez, I'm so tired of trying to &quot;balance&quot; the game with an obvious flaw in it. The only way that I see classes becoming more balanced, and retaining the fun diversity in the shaman line, is to remove all dps reducing debuffs from the game. It'd be a complete fix to soe's mess, but its probably way too complicated for them to pull off. So I&quot;m not holding my breath lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kellenial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have a feeling that to remove slow from the game would cause people to completely reevaluate the way they approach mobs (in terms of strategy). In addition, the &quot;general&quot; consensus on a shaman's role (not necessarily by the shaman, but the rest of EQers) would change dramatically. <br />
<br />
What little niche we find ourselves in now would need to be carved out anew. While slow is not the only thing we bring to the table, it more than most anything else is what we are associated with. Therefore, the general perception might be:<br />
               no more slow = no more role for shaman in group<br />
<br />
Thus we would have to start anew in demonstrating what we CAN do. Besides, I think such a dramatic change as removing slow from the game won't happen after having it in game for as long as it has been. I'm guessing in EQ2, they will learn from it and most likely not put slow into the game. But, for better or worse, I'm guessing the slow line of spells will stay in this incarnation of EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">the problem with removing slow, is at the moment shaman are seen as slowers and buffers wanted to those who havent woken up to how weak we are getting. remove slow and no matter what you do to our healing ability we'll just end up as third rate healers, not even wanted by the groups we're wanted for at the moment</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have a RL friend of mine that plays a cleric in a mid sized raid guild on karana. He really dislikes his role in the game, but hates the thoughts of having to start PLing an alt to 65 then to grind out 50ish AA to even be semi close to where he is at in the game exp wise, and gear wise it would still be lacking. Anyway, he has said from mid Luclin (when people really started to hit the 20 min long fights and CH chains that consisted of oodles of clerics) that SOE should dump CH, Slow and start from scratch. He says that now its even more needed, but that its too late and that it would cause an even greater backlash than it would be designed to fix.<br />
Think about it, patch on Monday the 28th and they take out all sorts of CHs and all forms of Slow. How big a stink do you think that would raise EVEN if they altered content and combat to take this into consideration? As my wife says it would be pandalerium.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Take slow out of the game and Shaman will be a buff bot. Slow is the reason we get groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">actually at the end of the day it isnt slow that break the game/encounters . its the fact that cleric heal far to good and benifit from slow. basically if everything took longer, small hits, smaller heals and longer fights then slow would be easier to work around, it would still be a big effect , but you can work around it. (orignal eq) when there wasnt that much difference between cleric and shaman except level you got heals, slow helped but wasnt needed.<br />
<br />
the problem is the design of the game, things hit harder heals have to be bigger which makes slow even more powerfuland needed (kunark), which made us gods. <br />
<br />
increase mobs dps and pc heals makes slow even more powerful if fights lasted long enough. etc etc etc <br />
<br />
negating slow is easy make  fights short reduces the effect of slow.<br />
<br />
its not so much that slow broke the game , more that other classes skills with slow broke it, slow by itself isnt game breaking. slow with a big heal is, slow with mez is etc.  the game designers lack of thought is what broke the game. <br />
you could make things un mezzable unrootable but slowable and make them impossible to split?  thats a challenge? even slowed? (it double the dps of encounter, though there is a few ways to counter) no?<br />
there are many ways to combat  a problem SOE desingers just didnt 1 test correctly  2 think about much it seems, 3 do anything it seems correctly or with consideration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Until slow is removed from the game, it's extremely unlikely that anything notable will be done to increase a shaman's group desireability.   <br />
<br />
Slow probably wasn't a good idea to include in the game in the first place, but combined with complete heals and then letting so many classes have slow made slow into a spell the designers do not know what to do with besides nerf via mitigation and immunity or by designing mobs so that slow's value is crippled.  <br />
<br />
The designers painted themselves into a corner and then tried to rescue themselves by bad design.  Not smart, and they just got themselves in deeper.<br />
<br />
As it stands now, they have really no way to get out of it except by accepting and enforcing the virtual death of the shaman class outside raid situations.<br />
<br />
Removing slow is likely the only thing that could fix the game and make shamans a strong class, but that won't happen, so we'll have to be content to be by far one of the weakest classes around until the end of the game.<br />
<br />
Esssentially, the developers have nothing to offer us, and that's just what they intend to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They wont remove slow. Fullstop<br />
The backlash caused would cause a huge majority of their customers (this isnt just a game you know...) to quit and the amount of bad publicity from it would stop newcomers coming to either Everquest or Everquest 2. Imagine if the entire world sudenly destroyed all traces of Tobacco. Sure it'd be good for people, but the backlash from the smokers would be horrendus. People learn to rely on things, nomatter how bad it is for them in the long run. Bad Analagy but the thought behind it is sound</div></div><hr />

<br />
Would they need to retune beastlords at all?  I could have swore that they didn't get a castable slow till level 65, but I could be wrong.  They could get thier slow taken away and still be a perfectly balanced and playable class.  Even if slow wasn't removed from EQ entirely I think that beastlords would still be prefectly balanced and playable without a castable slow.<br />
<br />
Enchanters might need a little adjusting if slow were removed, but they're not that bad off as is with thier other abilities like mez, charm, the best mind buffs and hastes in the game.<br />
<br />
If you remove slow from a shaman though, you're left with not much more than a druid, except not able to heal, buff, or damage as well, or snare, or port.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">removing slow would affect beastlords, it might not be as bad as shaman, but beastlord pet would likely need to have better defense or hp to make up the dps that they would take with no slow, smaller at the lower levels but increase dramatically at the higher, same with the beastlord themselves. though compared to what you need to do to shaman it is small.<br />
enc would be affected too, though i think less than the other classes.<br />
<br />
i think the fact that if you took slow out of the game, and did nothing to shaman, shaman would become completely undesireable just shows how broken shaman class is. i believe we are the only class that if you took slow away would be completely undesireable , which for me  .. well it`s undesireable:)<br />
<br />
ps might want to start a post like that on eq live to see what they say. i cant post there any more:(  but would be interesting what they would say. Q. if slow was completely removed from EQ , what would be the only class completely broken and unwanted (with no changes)? (aka has no secondary ablities worth anything in group?)<br />
somin like that:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My impression is that slow has been effectively removed from the game anyway by (1) short fight duration and (2) mitigation (including slow immunity).<br />
<br />
I believe that there are few encounters past elemental planes where slow makes any difference at all, regardless of what class casts it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">As we currently stand if they removed slow with doingnothing else shamans would no longer be a playable race, we couldn't heal fast enough nor would dog dog live long enough to solo. We wouldn't even be able to solo green mobs, let alone a dark blue. Face it, if it wasn't for slow we wouldn't be able to function other than buff bot and tag along and hid in shadows for exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">My impression is that slow has been effectively removed from the game anyway by (1) short fight duration and (2) mitigation (including slow immunity).<br />
<br />
Correct.  Slow's value has been mitigated:), and we haven't gotten anything in return.  The argument is, sure, slow is mitigated in a few places, but the vast majority of content is still slowable.  <br />
<br />
So, I say to that, fine, remove slow altogether and then give us better player buffs, better healing, and better dps.  Likewise, I'd say that enchanters and beastlords would need some tweaking also.<br />
<br />
Would they need to retune beastlords at all? I could have swore that they didn't get a castable slow till level 65<br />
<br />
Beastlords have lower level slow's also.  (My beast is lvl 33 atm.. when he's 65 with about 100 AA's, he's replacing my shaman if nothing changes for us).<br />
<br />
Take slow out of the game and Shaman will be a buff bot. Slow is the reason we get groups<br />
<br />
Try to get a group in the new content where slow doesn't matter so much.  Thats the issue.  Sure, older content, shaman are still fine.  I'm talking about the future, which seems to be shorter fights, mitigation and immunity to slow.  If SOE continues to not upgrade our healing, dps, and player buffs to be meaningful in this new content, using slow as an excuse, well then, take slow away.  They'll have no excuse anymore.<br />
<br />
They would have to retune every slowable mob, and completely retune shaman<br />
<br />
I agree they'd have to retune every class that currently has slow.  But I'm not so sure they'd have to retune the mobs.  With the way gear is now, most of that older content (that was 100% fully slowable) is a joke.  I watched a cleric solo an unslowed BoT giant yesterday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Of course slow will never be taken out.  Every time it's talked about, some people hit the panic button and freak out.  Sometimes it's kind of fun to watch the spasms.<br />
<br />
But since slow won't be taken out of the game, we will never be properly adjusted to the game from here on out.  If you're expecting meaningful adjustments to the shaman class for the remainder of the game, forget it.<br />
<br />
The reason being, we have slow.  <br />
<br />
The developer's crutch, not ours.  It's not supporting us, but them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I think healing should be taken out of the game really, its overpowering, and without it, fights could be more interesting...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Where's the panic button Blarg? I need it NOW! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Actually, I don't think the problem is that DPS-reducing debuffs are in the game, I think they are just too powerful.<br />
<br />
Shaman can reduce DPS on a fully-slowable mob by 75%.  That's an immense percentage, and it basically REQUIRED SOE to come up with a way of mitigating it.  Hypothetically, if our max slow was 25%, but was fast-casting, low resist and low aggro, we'd be much easier to balance into the game.  25% is enough to be very worthwhile, especially if it lands faster and more reliably, but it's not so imbalancing that we cannot be given more healing ability or more significant buffs.<br />
<br />
But I really don't think it's going to change at this point.  Too much history behind it now.  At least we can enjoy 75% slowing the old world content when we can't get a GoD group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So basically all shamans should just play a different class because ours is irrecoverably screwed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">That's exactly what Abashi happily and glibly told us.  Just reroll!<br />
<br />
Straight from the horse's mouth.  Or some part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">So basically all shamans should just play a different class because ours is irrecoverably screwed?<br />
<br />
Basically, if you think the class is totally unplayable now, then yes.  From what I've heard the developers say (mostly third hand of course, via posts here, posts on their site, and feedback from the summit and Fan Faires) they do not seem open to significant changes in the class due to the power of our slow and our stat buffs, but I do not believe they will reduce the power of our slow, so where does that leave us?<br />
<br />
We might see some minor improvements, like less slow mitigation, somewhat better heals, more room for stat buffs to be useful, maybe even a combined fast-casting malo/slow if we're really lucky.<br />
<br />
I sure hope I'm wrong, but that's the way I see it right now.  If I was desperately unhappy with the class as it stands today I'd be switching.  Fortunately for me, my guild is not yet in GoD content and I am not running into the worst of the problem.  Getting beyond this point, yeah, slow mitigation, weak healing, and very weak burst DPS is gonna be a big issue.</div></div><hr />
