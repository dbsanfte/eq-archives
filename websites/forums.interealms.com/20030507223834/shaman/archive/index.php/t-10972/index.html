<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I was lucky enough to win the roll for this ranged slot item and didn't even know the value of what I won lol<br />
<br />
Well I am a 45 shammy and found out that this item sells around 3.5Kpp on my server. <br />
<br />
What I want to know is if it's worth selling or should I keep it for used later? Currently I am using a Slime Coated spear in range and total buffed HP is 1538 with AC around 829 and Wis at 149.<br />
<br />
I don't have the best of equipment and using the Giant Beard for face slot lol and 45 hp ring. Saving up for a REIF that sells for 4 to 7K on my server bleh.<br />
<br />
So is this item worth holding on to or should I try to get the pp and upgrade other slots?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any advice.<br />

<br />
You can gain a lot more in those slots for the cash than the Idol has to offer.</div></div><hr />
