<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MasenkoHa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering if i could solo quest each piece of the scaled mystic armor for my up and coming shaman twink.  Even the gems. All i want to buy is the banded armor.  Are there any better quest armors for an iksar shaman that i can get very cheap or quest on my own? Also, are there any guides out there for each piece of the scaled mystic armor? Frankly, Allakhazam sucks in the quests department.  Any help would be much apreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For some reason I think I used Allak's guides to do the quests.  They're basically simple collection quests.    The questgivers are in the small house to the right of the temple of terror, and give very specific recipes for each part.<br />
<br />
I believe I solo'd most of the parts for this in my 20's to 40's. The froglok repairer planks are practically a myth, and the frenzied gnawer whip drops in a 'bedroom' in the upper areas of Kaesora (don't believe those who say it drops nearer the spiders)<br />
<br />
While the items to DO this quest are nodrop, the armor itself is droppable/sellable.  Most of the quest items are not hard to get, and those that would be pretty scary for a young shaman can often be looted off of the kills of higher-level people without risk if you ask nicely.<br />
<br />
I used most of my scaled mystic stuff until i got Hate/SS/kael pieces to replace them.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I used the Champions of Cabilis (http://www.championsofcabilis.com/) guild site, under Quests, Scaled Mystic Armor. Start in the low 20s, but some pieces like the frog plank and the frenzied gnawer tail couldn't get until low 40s. Gems, you buy from the jewelry gem vendor.<br />

The key phrase to get the quest NPCs, the Furscales, to talk to you is &quot;Oxyn sent me&quot;.</div></div><hr />
