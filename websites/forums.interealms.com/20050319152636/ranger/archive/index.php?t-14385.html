I personally think that eq2 will be a friendlier roleplaying environment, and i sort of hope they end up having the game less appealling to powerhungry people with no RL. personally i dont really mind people in game who have not RL, its just the way they are, its the powerhungry part that makes me dislike them. ill even settle for vice-versa.<br />

p.s. (please excuse the getting off subject.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
From the little I have gleaned off the web and Sony's web site it sounds like EQ2 will be like EQ1 was when it started... HARD.<br />
<br />
This will surely discourage alot of the current EQ1 player base from giving it a go.  Which should therefore see roleplayers making up a greater proportion of the playing population.</div></div><hr />

I often think of the wonderful times at EQ1's launch.  The day I finally was able to dual wield my Combine longsword and minotaur axe was a proud one, let me tell you!  Or experiencing the terror of Crushbone for the first time, when DVinn was on a rampage. . .no one was strong enough to stop him!<br />
<br />
And, of course, RP was abundant with my guild, and friends.  I'm greatly looking forward to all of that again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not looking forward to the initial bugs and glitches that we will face. I know that they'lll eventually get fixed patch by patch. But part of me wishes I could just wait and join 6 months after the release to avoid all of it.<br />
<br />
But i couldn't do that. The begginging is the best part of the adventure. When it's all new and exciting.</div></div><hr />
