<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>darkfox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been playing for a while and have bumped into a few Guilds that I started seeing interests in actually joining, but always seem to get a cold shoulder when ask about how to join, or I ask for their website and am given some URL that no longer works. Now I sit in mind with 2 guilds in mind (based off the websites I did get, and only 1 has good information). Is this as hard on other servers (to find a guild that is)?  I am a shy type so it is hard for me to jut into a conversation with someone who may just be waiting on a friend :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>darkfox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Does your guild have a website?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lathyrnia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Y'know, I am sure we do, but i'm not actually sure where it is.  Let me get back to you on that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Guildmagic is a good place to look for guild information.<br />
<br />
It also depends, what are you looking for in a guild?<br />
<br />
If you're looking for a family guild, I recommend my old guild, Viatores Norrathe, their website:<br />
<br />
http://www.eq-viatores.org/<br />
<br />
I am also very proud of my current guild, Sanctuary of the Silver Moon:<br />
<br />
http://www.sanctuary.fm/index.php<br />
<br />
But you are best finding a guild with members around your level. If you join a high level guild at 32, you'll find that nobody can group with you, and that everyone is off doing things you can't do (because of low level aggro).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>darkfox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">SotSM was one of the Guilds I was actually looking into, went to their website and looked all about.  For me a Guild is all about having a group of friends that you can always give a shout out to for information and help with quests, I just do not want to bump into a Guild that requires more work than play (i.e. you must attend raids 2-3 times a week etc). I am here to have fun and meet people not be told what to do just because I am in one, then it becomes more of a job than a game. Thanks for the info Harvyst... who knows I may see you soon :)</div></div><hr />
