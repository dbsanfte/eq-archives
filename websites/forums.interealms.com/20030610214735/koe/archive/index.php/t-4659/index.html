<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have played a Bard up to lvl 32 and now a Beastlord to 20 so far and have heard many different things about dual wielding. Mainly what weapons work good in primary and secondary. I came across this article http://pub78.ezboard.com/feqbeastlordfrm1.showMessage?topicID=141.topic  and am curious what you dual wielders think. Keep in mind that Beastlords don't get double attack so 2handed weapons are kinda useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">IMHO, after messing with both a bard and a warrior for some time, go fast, faster, fast as you possibly can while keeping a 10 or so damage class.<br />
<br />
Why?  I don't care what the potential damage (i.e. dmg ratio) on a weapon is, you are going to miss 40% of the time.  Those are zero damage rounds.  Swing fast, up your number of attacks per minute, and your gross damage output will rise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'll agree with Fall to a point:<br />
<br />
more attacks means more aggro, thus for a warrior, speed if godliness. For Wulf I use the fastest weaps I can get my hands on, so I can maintain aggro. The off-hand you can sacrifice a little speed for damage, but in essence what Fal is saying is what I have borne out with the damage generator thingie: a 9-19 will out out damage a 14-27 for me. Couple this with the taunt value of speed and there is only one way for a warrior to go.<br />
<br />
For Bards, Rangers and Rogues, you want to be a little more careful, unless you want to wear aggro all the time (hence the root of all the dead ranger jibes/comments: they have access to some of the fastest weapons in the game). Also, as taunt isn't as big of a requirement for these classes, you may want to pay some attention to the stat bonuses on the weapons. As a warrior the only stat I REALLY pay attention to is AC. Others are nice but not as crucial, day-to-day.<br />
<br />
I know Rizz was talking about this in /gu the other dayand mentioned the ratio of dam/del and a general rule, especially at lower levels, is that lower is better. But again, as borne out by parsing logs and damage simulators, weapon delay also impacts based on the number of attacks per min...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chmee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">For some general information about how damage works check out this link.<br />
<br />
Damage prediction guide (http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathtomesofknowledge.showMessage?topicID=13.topic)<br />
<br />
Note that this is from a while back, and some changes have been made to the game since then, so this may not be as accurate as it once was, but it gives a good general feeling for how things work.<br />
<br />
Generally speaking, you want a fast weapon in your main hand.  This is because the main hand gets a flat bonus no matter what its ratio is (at level 60 it is 11).  The person who started the thread Bem linked to is misleading in calling this a strength bonus.   From everything I have read strength has nothing to do with the prime hand bonus, it is based purely off your level.   You can't completely ignore ratio in your prime hand, but speed does make a big difference.  This is why the moss covered twig, with a terrible ratio of 3/10 was at the time the most damaging main hand weapon in the game, because it was so fast.  Note that since the bonus is level based it is less important at lower levels (in fact I don't think it comes into effect at all till 20-25 or so).<br />
<br />
In your off-hand, you don't get a bonus so you just want the best ratio you can get.  A possible exception to this is if you are tanking in which case you may want a faster weapon since fast weapons tend to taunt more.<br />
<br />
Usually the most damaging weapon selection at the high end of the game are duel wield combos.  There are a few 2 hand weapons (particularly monk weapons) that do pretty well but generally duel wield yields more damage.  This is at the high level though when the duel wield skill is pretty high.  At lower levels a two hander might not be as bad of a choice if your duel wield skill means you rarely swing with the off hand.  Two handers are also useful when you want to stay lower agro.<br />
<br />
I have to disagree with Fallanthas about the faster weapon being better because of misses.  If I have a weapon that hits 100 times a minute for an average of 1 point with a miss ratio of 40 percent I will do 60 points of damage on average.  If I have  a weapon with the same damage to delay ratio but swinging slower, say 10 times a minute doing an average of 10 points a hit then with a 40 percent miss ratio it will also do 60 points of damage.  The reason you want speed in main hand is just because of the flat bonus added to the damage (or if you are trying to taunt more).  Faster weapons will mean you have a smoother curve of damage where the slower ones will be a bit more streaky, but in the end average damage would be the same (without the bonus).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Agreed, Chmee, but with the quirky random number generator VI uses, average damage may not come into play unless you are in a three minute battle.<br />
<br />
I've stopped using the centi longswords on my warrior.  At 14/27 they should yield quite a bit more damage than a pair of 9/19 lammies, but that hasn't held up.  Fact is, I do a lot LESS damage with them.  IMHO it's because of the longer wait on a reset between those misses.  Also, higher damage, higher delay weapons seem to hit for one or two points of damage just as often as faster combos.<br />
<br />
The only way I would use a weapon with a better ratio over a faster weapon ( again, within reason ), is if I were a secondary tank with no other way to lower my aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sinsemsinfutura</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My personal Judgement.<br />
<br />
If you have your low STR, go with the fastest delay weapon.<br />
If you have have high STR and +ATK buffs, I will go best ratio weapon up to 25 dly.<br />
<br />
My personal reason why.<br />
<br />
9/20<br />
If you have low STR and your average dmg per hit is like 25 dmg, hitting for 10 dmg is very close to your average hit. Also you will miss alot more. So you dmg for second will be lower.<br />
<br />
13/25<br />
How ever, you have high STR and ATK buffs, your average hit will be around 60 dmg. You will miss less. so your dmg per second will be higher. And this will add more taunt.  <br />
<br />
But of course I would like to make a parse to back up my claims</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fanadile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Honestly for my monk I do much much much more dmg with better ratio in my primary hand vs fast dly.  My 12/22 hammer out damages a 9/18 jace mace by a lot.  I hardly notice the dly difference and hit much much harder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kilrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes the faster the weapon in primary generally is the better choice. One small example (even though palys aren't a duel wielding class) is the broken 1H slash that dropped in Sky for a couple of months off the Pixie boss mob. It was paly only with the Godly stats of 2/6... yes 2/6... talk about spam! This thing by FAR out damaged any other weapon in the game. It laid almost twice as much damage as the paly epic. Of course after a short while VI fixed it as it was obviously broken and it became a 2/16 quest item.<br />
<br />
As for other stats AC is definately important and I agree with Wulf there. However do not neglect sta and hps. Kilrain has unbuffed sta of 194 now and several items that add hps. I would sacrifice a small amount of ac for a plus 100 hp item anyday. Currently I sit someplace close to 2960hps unbuffed, and can get up to 5Khps when fully buffed. Those extra hps are very valuable. AC however is still king.</div></div><hr />
