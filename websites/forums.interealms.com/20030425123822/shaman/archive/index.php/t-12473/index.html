<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kermeet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all,<br />
I'm trying to figure out what items I should work towards next and wanted some second opinions.  I'm huntin in Kael a little now in order to get the REIF as a weapon upgrade and the Thurg Chain Legs if they happen to finally drop.  Besides those two, what else should I be aiming for?  Both my belt and my vambraces are weak, but I wanted some clear direction as to which items I should look at.  Budget can be up to around 25kpp, as I expect to be able to make that in the next 4 or 5 levels.  <br />
The equipment should last at least through to 61 or if possible longer.  I intend to hit 60, get AA enough for canni 5, and then either get more aa, or level to 61 and then get more aa.<br />

Any chance to get specific recomendations for a decent pair of vambraces and a belt?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When looking at your gear I would recommend losing some wis... perhaps bringing wis down to about 200 because mana/wis ratio is halved when wis is over 200.  Recommend the following items for lowering wis and increasing hps/resists.  Remember this is just my opinion :p.. and we know what they say about opinions.<br />
<br />
Neck:  Ribbon Choker, Large Smoothmetal Torque<br />
<br />
Finger:  Circle Toe Bones, Coral Ring<br />
<br />
Arms:   Cursed Armplates or Deteriorated Arm links<br />
<br />
Wrist:  Barbed Rubicite Bracer<br />

Back:  Justice Cape<br />

Belt:   Chitnous Belt, Spider Fur<br />

All purchasable in the Baz at a reasonable price.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">And another note, since u r getting REIF it sounds like you will be doing some meleeing so you may want to consider the &quot;Silvery Belt of Contention&quot; for the haste.  I'm using one and love it.<br />

If we assume that I'm not going to melee much once I hit 55 and that I almost always duo or have a 4 to 6 person group, ie: never solo, what would the upgrades look like?  What should I get for a primary/secondary combo if I'm not meleeing?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice so far, I'm looking into some of the items as I write this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jikuliz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Tracking wolf collar, Hardened grey flesh arms, coral ring/shadel bandit ring are a couple more affordable upgrades.</div></div><hr />
