Na, you're wrong.  It drops from the Hoodad Shaman in Acrylia Caverns.  Its definitely a Luclin item.</div></div><hr />

HAVE YOU EVER MET SOMEONE LIKE THIS? A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A NECRO !!!!! <br />
<br />
So there I was.....minding my own business in The Overthere, when all of a <br />
sudden I see the message: &quot;d00d sow <br />
plz&quot;. <br />
<br />
Of course, my natural instinct was not to answer, since I thought the <br />
clueless newb (hereafter referred to politely as <br />
&quot;the petitioner&quot;) must have been poorly informed at best. <br />
<br />
Boy was I ever wrong. <br />
<br />
I switch out of 1st person into an external camera, and what did my wandering <br />
eyes behold? Only myself and the <br />
petitioner. <br />
<br />
So I says to myself....&quot;Self? You need to edumacate this fella!&quot; <br />
<br />
(Keep in mind what the overall setting looked like: There I was, in skeleton <br />
form, carrying a scythe, FLOATING IN <br />
MIDAIR IN A MEDITATING POSITION, with a LARGE dark-brown skeleton named <br />
&quot;Gibober&quot; standing behind me. <br />
Ummm....No, skippy, I'm not a druid or a shaman.) <br />
<br />
I say &quot;Wish I could, bro, but I don't have SoW. I'm a Necromancer.&quot; <br />
<br />
The Petitioner says, &quot;$#*&amp;@#$ **** , sow me already! it's for a cr&quot; <br />
<br />
Feeling as if my feathers had been ruffled a bit, I do a &quot;/who all dumbass&quot; <br />
(um..pardon..I meant &quot;/who all petitioner&quot;) <br />
<br />
This is where I discovered the &quot;/who all&quot; bug. Certainly it must have been a <br />
bug, right? There's NO WAY IN CREATION <br />
the dumbas...err...petitioner could have been a level 31 Dark Elf Wizard, <br />
right???? RIGHT????? /em begins to cry like a <br />
little girl. <br />
<br />
Well, needless to say, I couldn't have been any more shocked than if my pet <br />
began dancing an Irish Jig. I quickly <br />
begin the arduous task of maintaining my composure, while deciding how best <br />
to deal with this tricky situation. <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;Necromancer's can't cast SoW&quot;. <br />
<br />
Petitioner says, &quot;Bull@#$%! you cast a spell while you were running and you <br />
sped up! i couldn't catch you until you <br />
sat down! if you're not going to sow me just say so you dont have to be a <br />
**** about it a$$hole&quot; <br />
<br />
Yes I know....he didn't use any punctuation in that last sentence. <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;I have JBoots.&quot; <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;what are they&quot; <br />
<br />
Before I have a chance to pick my chin up off the floor.... <br />
<br />
Petitioner asks, &quot;can you buff my hps my hp sux&quot; <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;I can't buff you, dude. I'm a necromancer. I only have one buff that <br />
you would probably want.&quot; <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;yeah the one you won't give me **** &quot; <br />
<br />
Ok. Time to have fun with the hopelessly clueless. <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;Why do you need a sow?&quot; <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;i need to get to burned woods to hunt. sumbody said its perfect for <br />
my level&quot; <br />
<br />
Yep. That's what he said......&quot;burned woods&quot;. <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;man are you ever in the wrong place.&quot; <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;?&quot; <br />
<br />
Apparently he found the &quot;question mark&quot; key conveniently located nearby other <br />
various and sundry communication <br />
facilitators. <br />
<br />
I didn't answer him. <br />
<br />
He repeats, &quot;??&quot; <br />
<br />
Found it twice...good for him. <br />
<br />
He repeats, &quot;???&quot; <br />
<br />
Having an IQ greater than plantlife, I sensed a pattern forming. <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;You are NO WHERE near Burned Woods.&quot; <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;my friend told me it was in kunark&quot; <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;Yeah, the operative word there is 'WAS'. There was a major patch a <br />
couple of months ago after a bunch of <br />
complaints were filed about 'static content'.&quot; <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;?&quot; <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;!&quot; <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;?&quot; <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;,&quot; <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;***&quot; <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;no, already have some.&quot; <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;????&quot; <br />
<br />
I don't respond. <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;so where the @#$% is burned woods&quot; <br />
<br />
He lost the question mark button again. Probably popped off when he was <br />
sniffing his feet. <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;Well, THIS week it's south of Freeport. It changes with every patch, <br />
since they began randomizing zone <br />
locations.&quot; <br />
<br />
My guild is hysterical at this point. And I haven't even told them the ENTIRE <br />
story yet. Just snippets. <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;@#$% i just got off the boat&quot; <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;You don't need the boat.&quot; <br />
<br />
He says &quot;why&quot; <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;You're a wizard!&quot; <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;how you know that&quot; <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;I did a /wh...nevermind....the important thing is you have <br />
teleportation spells.&quot; <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;oh yeah the green ones&quot; <br />
<br />
I nod. <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;Yep. The 'green ones'. Pretty nice how you have them grouped by <br />
color.&quot; <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;thx&quot; <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;How'd you think about doing it that way?&quot; <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;they were all @#$%## up when i got this char&quot; <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;Sit down and mem the spell 'Fay Gate'.&quot; <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;why&quot; <br />
<br />
Question mark key is on the ground in front of your chair, guy. Mixed in with <br />
your collection of boogers. <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;It's going to put you within spitting distance of Burned Woods.&quot; <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;how do you know&quot; <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;All patch messages come with a zone connection map.&quot; <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;oh&quot; <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;Ok. You have it memmed now?&quot; <br />
<br />
He had just stood up after what I assumed was meditating/looking at his spell <br />
book. <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;yeah&quot; <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;Ok. Cast the spell and let me know when you get there.&quot; <br />
<br />
Dumba...errr....Petitioner begins to cast a spell. <br />
<br />
A LONG time goes by.....ok, maybe 5 minutes <br />
I still haven't heard from him. <br />
<br />
Getting curious: <br />
<br />
I tell petitioner, &quot;Are you there yet?&quot; <br />
<br />
No reply. No reply at all. [Yes, I'm a Genesis fan... ] <br />
<br />
Obviously he's there, or my tell wouldn't have gone through. <br />
<br />
I tell petitioner, &quot;Hit the 'r' key to reply to me.&quot; <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;i'm here now where do i go.&quot; <br />
<br />
Right idea....wrong punctuation mark. Oh well. &quot;C&quot; for effort. <br />
<br />
I tell petitioner, &quot;Ok, do you see a hotkey on the screen that says 'Sense <br />
Heading'?&quot; <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;no&quot; <br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;Hit the arrow buttons one by one until you see one.&quot; <br />
<br />
It was a guess, but an educated one. <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;found it&quot; <br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;Click on it.&quot; <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;north&quot; <br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;Ok, you need to head east along the path. Keep going until the path <br />
turns north. When it forks to the right, <br />
take the right fork.&quot; <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;ok&quot; <br />
<br />
Who knows, maybe the guy who sold his account on Ebay worked his Felwithe <br />
faction up. <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;sumbody told me i shouldnt be here cause i'm a dark elf&quot; <br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;They were roleplaying.&quot; <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;oh hehe @#$%@#$ morons ;P&quot; <br />
<br />
Priceless. Utterly priceless, I tell you. <br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;Where are you?&quot; <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;i see something now. looks like a castle&quot; <br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;Run into the castle as fast as you can. The guards might give you <br />
some trouble, just keep running.&quot; <br />
<br />
Yeah...damned conscience started kicking in. <br />
<br />
A fairly long period of time passes. Not sure how long, but longer than I was <br />
expecting. <br />
<br />
I tell petitioner, &quot;What happened?&quot; <br />
<br />
As if I didn't know.... <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;my spells are gone!&quot; <br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;What happened?&quot; <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;i died why&quot; <br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;Oh man! Did I tell you to run east or west?&quot; <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;east ***???&quot; <br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;Yikes. My bad. You should have run west.&quot; <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;?&quot; <br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;So where are you now?&quot; <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;how can i tell&quot; <br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;Look right after you see 'Loading please wait'. It should tell you <br />
'You have entered [zone]'.&quot; <br />
<br />
He replies &quot;it doesnt say [zone] there.&quot; <br />
<br />
After smacking my head against my monitor.... <br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;What does it say in place of [zone]?&quot;. <br />
<br />
Get this.... <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;Burning Woods&quot; <br />
<br />
I nearly fell out of my chair! I couldn't have PLANNED it that way! <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;is that the same as burned woods&quot; <br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;No, but you're close. Start running south so you can get your <br />
corpse back.&quot; <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;i have to get my corpse back?????&quot; <br />
<br />
/ignore petitioner <br />
<br />
<br />
Moral of the story: EBay...Just Say No! <br />
<br />
Out of sheer curiosity, I took him off ignore later to find out what <br />
happened. <br />
<br />
I tell petitioner, &quot;How's it going?&quot; <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;***? where you been&quot; <br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;been afk, sorry.&quot; <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;got my corpse back. some dude rezzed me.&quot; <br />
<br />
My conscience somewhat eased... <br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;Really? Cool! Where are you now?&quot; <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;iceclad ocean&quot; <br />
<br />
I scratch my head a few times. <br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;Why Velious?&quot; <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;the guy that rezzed me told me burned woods was in western <br />
wastes this week&quot; <br />
<br />
I don't recall exactly how long it took me to stop laughing. I stopped <br />
breathing shortly before my dog dialed 911. <br />
<br />
He replied, &quot;@#$%&amp;* wouldnt sow me either. what is that sh#$ gold?&quot; <br />
<br />
That's what finally killed me. I'm writing this from the afterlife. <br />

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br />
found this as a follow up <br />
<br />
------------ <br />
&quot;This is the follow up story from the cleric who rezzed him near Felwithe. Friend of mine digged it up, probably on the same necro side. &quot; <br />
<br />
quote <br />
Here comes some idiot Dark Elf running past me, running straight down <br />
the road that is going to lead him to Felwithe. I scratch my head, and <br />
being the nosey sort of Dwarf that I am...I send him a tell. <br />
<br />
I tell the DE, &quot;Wait&quot; <br />
<br />
DE tells me, &quot;?&quot; <br />
<br />
I sigh into my ale as I take another longt draught off of it before <br />
running up to him and saying, &quot;Ye really don't wanna go messin around <br />
over there with them High Elves' They look like pansies, but they aint.&quot; <br />
<br />
The DE stands there with a vacant look on his face for a few minutes <br />
before just running away. Do a /who on the DE and find out he's 31st <br />
level. Ok, so maybe he knows what he's doing. I've seen Ogres in North <br />
Freeport, after all. I go back to drinking my ale. <br />
<br />
Out of curiosity, I send him another tell a few minutes later. <br />
<br />
I tell the DE, &quot;Not gettin' into any trouble over there are ye?&quot; <br />
<br />
DE tells me, &quot;**** !@#$% roleplayer&quot; <br />
<br />
I sigh into my ale again, finishing it off. Ah, tis the season of the <br />
twit. I stand up and head towards Felwithe to resupply my ale. <br />
<br />
Just as I get to the gates of the ugliest city on Norrath, what do I <br />
find but a dead dark elf and a pair of guards snickering and cleaning <br />
their weapons. Now this is priceless. <br />
<br />
I do a /who on the poor soul and see he is in Burning Woods. Being the <br />
sucker that I am, I feel compelled to rez the twit...after all, I am a <br />
!@#$% roleplayer and I roleplay a !@#$% cleric...albeit a !@#$% grumpy <br />
one. <br />
<br />
I sit down to mem Reviviscene and while I am waiting for it to refresh I <br />
send the DE a tell. <br />
<br />
I tell the DE, &quot;Would ye like a rez?&quot; <br />
<br />
DE tells me, &quot;no i want a !@#$% sow dumbas i have to run south to get my <br />
corpse back so dont be a **** and just sow me plz&quot; <br />
<br />
I look around for an ale but unfortunatly Brell hates me at this moment <br />
in time, so I simply reply. &quot;If I rez ya, ye wont need to run south to <br />
yer body. You will appear at yer body. I am not standing near you, I am <br />
standing near yer corpse.&quot; <br />
<br />
DE tells me, &quot;d00d rez plz&quot; <br />
<br />
As I sigh I look at my Holy Symbol of Brell and sigh &quot;I'm gonna get a <br />
stout named after me right?&quot; and I tell the DE &quot;Consent me so I can rez <br />
ya&quot; but I get no reply. No reply at all. So I say it again &quot;Consent me <br />
so I can rez ya&quot; <br />
<br />
DE tells me, &quot;ok you can rez me&quot; <br />
<br />
I sit down again at this point. I have no ale and this is gonna take <br />
awhile. I tell the DE, &quot;Type /consent and my name&quot; Being a smart dwarf I <br />
tell the DE, &quot;/consent Cleric_01&quot; and say again &quot;Just like that&quot; before <br />
he can make my head hurt more. <br />
<br />
Sure enough, I recieve consent to drag his corpse. So I stand up and get <br />
ready to drag the corpse when suddenly I am denied permission to drag <br />
his corpse. I begin to think like him and I think &quot;***?&quot; So I tell the <br />
DE, &quot;No...just type it once. One more time. That's it. Dont type it <br />
again&quot; thinking that as soon as I get this over with, I can go buy more <br />
ale and my head will stop hurting. <br />
<br />
I recieve consent and I quickly drag it towards the zone since this is <br />
the direction the guy was going anyway. I get the body by the zone and <br />
cast Rez on it, comforted by the fact that I am one heal away from being <br />
done with this guy. <br />
<br />
The naked DE appears in front of me and I stand up to cast my final <br />
spell of this exchange when he says to me &quot;your that !@#%% roleplayer&quot; <br />
and then a moment later, almost as an afterthought &quot;thx&quot; <br />
<br />
Compelled at this point, I ask &quot;Why were you running into Felwithe when <br />
you are KoS?&quot; <br />
<br />
DE says, &quot;I was going to burned woods&quot; <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;Burning Woods?&quot; <br />
<br />
DE says, &quot;no dumbass i go there when i die i want to hunt burned woods&quot; <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;Who told you to go hunting in Burned Woods, inside Felwithe?&quot; <br />
<br />
DE says, &quot;some **** who wouldnt sow me&quot; and then &quot;will you sow me plz, <br />
its for a CR&quot; <br />
<br />
I stand there drooling on myself for a moment, trying to catch up. I <br />
havent had an ale in a good 20 minutes at this point, so I am starting <br />
to see spots. <br />
<br />
DE says, &quot;dont be a **** just sow me before they move the zone again&quot; <br />
<br />
I stare at the lad and ask &quot;Move Burned Woods? Again?&quot; <br />
<br />
DE says, &quot;yea&quot; <br />
<br />
I finally snap and say, &quot;They aren't going to move it again. Once they <br />
moved it to Western Wastes, with all the snow, it stopped burning.&quot; <br />
<br />
DE says, &quot;i saw a burning tree&quot; <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;Exactly my point. Now if they would only move Burning Woods <br />
there it would stop too and people wouldn't go there when they die.&quot; <br />
<br />
DE says, &quot;can you sow me, its for CR&quot; <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;sow doesnt work in IC until you get past EW and then it will <br />
work for CR's only until you get to WW, then ask the first person you <br />
see for sow there.&quot; I add as an afterthought &quot;Sometimes they look like <br />
flying blue things but they can sow&quot; <br />
<br />
DE says, &quot;***???&quot; <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;Allow me to use smaller words. You do not need a sow yet. Do <br />
what I say and you'll get there right away.&quot; and then &quot;Sit down and mem <br />
the spell Bind Affinity&quot; <br />
<br />
DE is silent for a bit and finally says &quot;its red&quot; as he is standing up <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;I am glad they covered Colors this week. Now target yourself and <br />
cast this spell. &quot; He just stands there for a minute, so I add &quot;it will <br />
r0ck&quot; and he begins to cast the spell, binding himself behind the guards <br />
at Felwithe. I feel somewhat better already, maybe I dont need ale. <br />
<br />
DE says, &quot;it said bound&quot; and begins to giggle <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;Now sit down and mem the spell Iceclad Gate. This will r0ck even <br />
more.&quot; <br />
<br />
DE says, &quot;this one is green&quot; <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;You're damn good at those colors man&quot; <br />
<br />
DE says, &quot;thx&quot; <br />
<br />
When the DE stands up I say &quot;This is going to take you to Iceclad Ocean. <br />
It's an ocean so that's why they moved Burned Woods there....to put it <br />
out.&quot; <br />
<br />
DE says, &quot;what about sow&quot; <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;Remember that sow wont work until you are on a CR in WW. In fact <br />
you actually run faster in snow if you set the RUN button to WALK. Do <br />
that now.&quot; <br />
<br />
DE says, &quot;ok&quot; <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;Now cast Iceclad Gate....the Green one. Remember to run straight <br />
out of where you appear and dont stop swimming until you hit Burned <br />
Woods.&quot; <br />
<br />
DE begins to cast a spell and I zone in to get my ale....remembering <br />
that the Ignore list cures most headaches that ale cant and feeling <br />
somewhat better about going back to Sebilis. <br />

I think it drops from the rare Toadkiller Dog, in Burned Woods. <br />
<br />
<br />
For some reason, the name Toadkiller Dog seems vaguely familiar, but I can't remember where I've heard it.</div></div><hr />
