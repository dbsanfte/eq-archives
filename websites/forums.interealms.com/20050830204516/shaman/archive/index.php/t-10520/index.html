<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sunbur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok here is what I've been noticing over the past month or so... I seem to be having more resists on non-PoP mobs that I slowed before I dinged 61.  I'm talking anything from Ixiblat Fir (which I slowed with no problems at 56 but got resisted not just 1 battle but 3 separate battles at 61!) to ToV (slowed with relatively little problems at 59 but can't slow without a bard slow first now) to even Gantru Raldukans in UP (slowed with no problems at all from 58 to 60 but now I get at least 3 resists if not more).  At first I thought I was just having a bad day but this is now becoming a regular thing.  There are a couple other shaman that I've talked to who have noticed they are having more resists.  Even a 61 chanter in the alliance I am in made a comment about having more resists than she ever has had before.  <br />
<br />
I just got Malo Friday night (thank you TMA!) so I haven't really had a chance to test it out too much casting that before slowing.  Until recently I seldom had a chanter or a bard around for any form of tash so that isn't a factor in this.  <br />
<br />
So I bring this to the shaman community.  Is there anyone else 61+ who still goes to non-PoP zones who has noticed this?  Or are there some of us on TM who are going insane? LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We were back in ToV tonight and I noticed less trouble slowing than ever before, though I'm up at 65.  You're probably just getting unlucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It is your imagination.  Your spells most definately land easier as you level up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>reaper23</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I dont seem to have that much of a problem slowing was in UP 2 weekends ago and malo pulled Rald slowed while that wonderfull mob pathing works and me and a 57 rogue duoed him to death. Sometimes i get the resist but usually sicks after a recast otherwise they get a malo for thier sins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have had a much easier time slowing since I hit 63, but I have not been to UP or done Ixsplat in ages.  Mobs in Ssra, VP, SSeru, and ME have been easier to slow by far.</div></div><hr />
