<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fedayeen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In short,<br />
GameSpot now wants us to pay to get their service, <br />
Annyone got a great alternative to online Computer Games Previews/Reviews?<br />
GameSpy only have so much...<br />
<br />
Thanx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm one of the oldtimers who still subscribe to mags like PCGamer and Computer Gaming World (CGW) but of course they are a bit late compared to the Internet.<br />
<br />
If I want a quick review before buying a game I always do a Google groups search with the game name or hit the comp.sys.ibm.pc.games hierarchy of   groups.<br />
<br />
You learn to filter the chaff and get to know the trolls by reading the groups often. Before todays fancy Internet, Usenet was THE source for this type of information and there are still many active communities there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jenoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">www.isonews.com :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Its really not much at all to subscribe considering the quality of the articles on offer at gamespot, I did for the video reviews alone.<br />
<br />
I guess the days of everything is free are over , get over it, pay up and enjoy the rewards.<br />
<br />
Edit : That appears to be a link to pirate CD rips but I cant be sure (firewall wont let me browse there), if so remove it please mods.</div></div><hr />
