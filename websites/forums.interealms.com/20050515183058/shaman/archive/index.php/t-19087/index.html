<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Secondary Forte will be an AA that enables casters to pick a second Specialization and allowing them to raise it past 50. Now since I didn't make it into the beta, I am not positive on how this AA works, but wanted you(beta testers) to consider one thing.<br />
<br />
Everyone knows the &quot;quest&quot; in the Temple of Solusek that allows you to reset your Spec. Please make sure that you are given the same possibility after buying this AA. It would be a mistake to not be able to reset your second Spec with this quest or any other way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fenril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The quest will work as...<br />
<br />
All your specs are reset to ... 49 and not 50 ;) until they changed it since I made it a loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong time ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That's how it works(Don't remember whether it's 49 or 50). I am more worried about what happens after you did the quest. <br />
Will you be able to choose the 2 Specs by raising the first 2 to 51? Or will Secondary Forte not work(wouldn't be the first time new things break game mechanics)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Perelandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">NDA's still apply, so people in the beta shouldn't be telling you this.<br />
<br />
However, I will tell you there is no need for concern over this - it isn't an issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Where did I ask for any information about this? I am well aware of the NDA. Anyway. thanks for clarifying things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm not sure which Specialize I would go to after Alteration.... I guess either Evocation or Conjuration... tough call.  Probly Conj.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">NDA's still apply, so people in the beta shouldn't be telling you this.<br />
<br />

<br />
He didnt ask for info on it just for people to make sure that there is a way to controll which skill becomes your second.<br />
<br />
Has for no need for concern you have far more faith in SOE. Then what I do to not implament something that is broke or not working &quot;has intended&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Any idea if your second specialization will be able to reach the same level as your first ?  Or will it be capped at a lower level?<br />
<br />
If this info can't be given out due to NDA, I understand.  Figure maybe someone heard about that and could say aye/nay.<br />
