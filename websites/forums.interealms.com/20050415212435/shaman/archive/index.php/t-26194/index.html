<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>OmakayVoS</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The enchanters have asked for a change to their Tacvi class weapon.... and it looks like something will happen.<br />
<br />
Their gripe is a bit more valid than ours.... however the issue is the same.  It will rot because the effect is virtually useless.<br />
<br />
The developer that has responded to the enchanter post has requested ideas for an alternative effect.....  Here is their response:<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll go ahead and change it to Euphoria, however, I'm not really sure if having a clickie-mez (now that I've thought it over) is as valuable as having a clickie nuke or heal, by looking at the other classes' clickies. If you guys have better suggestions on what you'd like to see on the hammer please suggest them. I was thinking of something like a self-buff that increased the core strength of an enchanter's crowd control abilities (probably not charm though) that isn't overpowering, but has more lasting effect.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wondering if anyone wants to take up the case for Shaman?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Trezl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Chanter's issue was that necro/mage/wiz all get nukes which are always useful, while Boggle was worthless since it wouldn't work on higher level mobs...<br />

Our click is exactly in line with druid and cleric.  I don't think there is any issue with that.<br />
<br />
Now, my SK is sad because its just a proc.  I like clickies like on the epic 1.5/2.0.  They have much longer use than just procs since there will always be better weapons for melee purposes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Grimbear, I dont think anyone thinks that the item is fine.  It is truely rot material for any Shaman in that zone.  What others are saying is that the effect is in line with the clicks on the class weapons in Tacvi for the healing classes ... Clerics and Druids get less than 2000 heals on their weapons.  However, this doesnt mean that the items couldnt use a change.<br />
<br />
Basic issue is that a 1300 heal... even if mana-free click every 3.5 mins .... is not a useful effect. Considering that anyone who loots this item is fighting in high level zones where a single swing is more than this heal, the only reason to loot the item is for the stats. (Which honestly are only marginally better than Epic 1.5 without even considering the click on the epic.)<br />
<br />
However I was struck with the solution presented by the developer.. &quot;I was thinking of something like a self-buff that increased the core strength of an enchanter's crowd control abilities (probably not charm though) that isn't overpowering, but has more lasting effect&quot;<br />
<br />
This made me think of the OoW quest BP effect which lowers resists rates.... http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=6387<br />
<br />
If they are in the mood to change things, I think the time might be ripe to suggest a useful change for the Shaman weapon as well.... such as an effect similar to the OoW quest BP....  That would actually make me consider looting this drop.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Honestly my main gripe as a shaman are buffs.<br />
I have 9 slots usually:<br />
malos, nihil, canni, champion, panther,heal,hot,nuke,dot.<br />
<br />
What that means is if I want to buff, I either unmem my nuke or panther, the rest are just too long of a recast refresh to load. but as of now, if someone dies I like to cast: wunshi, fort, sense,might, so every time someone dies it is agony. mem 2 new spells, wait for refresh, cast, mem 2 new spells, wait for refresh cast, mem 2 new spells. doh someone died...<br />
<br />
Why not make the clicky champion? It'll save me a buff slot since I always have it loaded. It will not change our power factor at all since champions goes from 1 min recast to 3.5min recast, but it sure will make life a lot nicer and the item definetly worth hoping to get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Acknowledgnig that the recast is very different, it's still odd that the Tacvi weapon clicks a smaller heal than a Veeshan's Peak drop (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=30406).<br />
<br />
Ignoring flavor, I think click Wave of Marr would be sexy.  Ignoring power, click Assiduous Vision is something neat I've wanted for a long time.  Ignoring reality, I'd love a 30sec cast 30min recast Succor.<br />
<br />
But I don't think any of that is going to happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Solemneyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I don care what effect goes on it - all i know is that as of right now TA and epic are both more worth carrying than the tacvi drop. If it drops for us someday and goes dirt cheap maybe for a fun toy - otherwise *shrug* let her rot. Its just nothing to get excited about compared to the much easier to acquire epic 1.5. anyone that can get the tacvi drop can get epic 1.5 done and really... i would prefer to equip the epic. Having TA means this is just bag space I don't have for a weak heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My wet dream would be to make this a clicky nihils stick to replace Time's Antithesis. Don't tell my girlfriend, though. She'll think I'm weird.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I do agree that the weapon kinda sucks.  I would like to see the heal upgraded to the better kraggs... however..<br />
<br />
I tend to use this weapon alot.  It's not equipped of course, but used in an inventory slot (next to the 1.5 of course).  Now, the heal itself is a bit weak and overall I barely notice it when I'm using it, however, it's still a free clicky heal that can be used often.  When I'm grouped, I'm always using this, saves me casting actual spells and is quicker casting as well.  I don't use it to save someone, more or less just to fill someone up.  <br />
<br />
I would say, if they are looking at changing it to another type of heal, change it so Kraggs.  However, if to change it they would need to make it so that you have to equip it, or increase the reuse timer on it, then it's not worth it.</div></div><hr />

I second this notion..  Would be nice not to have to cast Malos every single time I want to realiably slow it......</div></div><hr />

The click doesn't even give you a full heal from a canny 5.  I'd like a clicky balance, but to keep with the heals thats fine how about a clicky yoppas or Wilsliks. a 1300 heal is a joke &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think anyone uses those weapons, regardless of the class or what click effect is on it.<br />
<br />
If you people won't use the Epic 1.5/2.0 at all over a TA, why would you even care about the Tacvi weapon?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">If it were Nihil, I'd carry that fishy trident over my Time's Awesomeness.  If it kept clicking from inventory, I'd wield epic and be SUPER happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I'm mixed about this. I don't yet have the weapon but I could see how a quick casting clicky would be handy. It's mana free and ignores normal spell refresh which are useful things to have even on a small heal. It is kinda ironic that the weaker weapon ends up with the better heal on it altho the reuse time is much longer.<br />
<br />
Personally I still wield my TA and use it constantly so don't see myself equiping this weapon when I eventually get it. It will end up like the epic as something I use as a clicky. With bandoler you can switch it in fast enough to be useful as an emergency heal.<br />
<br />
The simple solution would seem to be just to make it a slow clicky so it can replace TA. Problem is I'm not sure I'd still replace TA even if they did that. One of TA's great features is the fact that it has no recast time on it. So you can chain click if you get resisted or have multiple mobs to slow etc. A recast time on the slow which the weapon would almost assuredly have would kill that. Especially if it remained the 3minutes 30 seconds reuse that it currently is. Unfortunately with almost any sort of recast is going to make the weapon not a replacement for TA and if it's not a replacement for TA then another clicky slow isn't gonna be any use.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately with the new ability to add recast time to clickies I don't think we're every gonna see a replacement for TA. As such the clicky heal is as good as anything else for the weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I'd rather they just made the TA clickable from inventory.  Then we might actually equip something with better stats. <br />
<br />
As it is.. are shaman going to be using a TA 5 expansions from now?  Sure seems like it.  Thats just plain wrong hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Then we might actually equip something with better stats.<br />
Honeslty with the new Bandolier feature, TA is PRACTICALLY clickable from inventory. Dont even need a slot. I keep TA, Epic, Sharkspine, Swarm Orb, and my Spiritstone all in a bag, and use Bandolier to fast-swap. Only inventory slot I need to hot-key now is Primary, and 2 clicks of hot keys is all I need to have the clickies of Epic, TA, Shrink, or gate to Nek, or my best DPS weapon if I choose to melee. Hell I bet it wouldnt be hard to write a macro to do it ALL in one click. Start with Epic, click one button and your macro: swaps to TA, casts TA, swaps back to Epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">After clicking on Aruman's Magelo I am impressed but also happy that I quit at the same time. I hope it will be a while before the gap between people of equal level in WoW increases to that size.<br />

But hats off to Aruman - I know it took a long time to get there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Put Balance on the tacvi weapon and remove the recast and it is all good ... that is the ONLY thing that will make me replace the TA.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>FafnerMorell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">As many have said, I can't see replacing my TA (which I use at the start of every mob) with a marginal heal.

<br />
Balance (with no re-cast) would make this a clear upgrade (and help out those shaman whose guilds no longer to go PoTime).<br />
<br />
Malos is a cool idea. Or Champion. Or make the TA clickable from inventory (and make a lot of epic wielders happy).</div></div><hr />

Yeah, its function works, but you still lose the stats when its equipped, which is what I'm driving at.  You also lose the focus effect on our epic.  Lord knows what super cool 500hp primary with uber focus X I'll want to have always equipped 4 expansions from now.  Swapping out to use TA will just become more and more painful.</div></div><hr />

I dont know if there is a way to click an item with a text macro. I assume you can have your Primary slot on your hot-key pallette, and short-cut that. Unkg has another thread going on this topic. If I figure it out, I will respond there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think instead of a change to the tacvi weapon, a change needs to be made to the TA. make it inventory clickable.  I love my TA, but i would also love to grab up something to replace it from a more recent expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">The Tacvi weapon effect is pretty close to the AA emergency heal ideas posted here some time ago. I am still advocating such an emergency ability, thus I like the effect with the exception of the following points:<br />
<br />
1. The cast time is too slow(needs to be 0.5-0.75 seconds)<br />
<br />
2. It doesn't scale with the caster's power<br />
<br />
3. 'Balance'(or a balancing tool) must never come from items, or even worse, artifacts like this</div></div><hr />
