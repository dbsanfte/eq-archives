<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Setantha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all.<br />
Well..when servers come back up I am about 3 kills away from dinging 15. I was thinking about going to Luclin, specifically Paludal Caverns, when I level..having heard the experience is great there. I have never been to Luclin before so any advice is appreciated. Where / what to hunt? Quests? Any Faction I should look out for / not destroy? Is 15 high enough to solo there?<br />
<br />
I have pretty decent equipment for my level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well you've picked the right zone to hunt in at your lvl.  I tried solo'ing there at lvl 15, but most everything I conned was red or yellow.  <br />
<br />
The Patog fiends are a bit lower lvl than the bandits so try to get a partner for those until lvl 16 or 17.  Once you get those lvls, solo'ing will be much easier.  The fiends have a nasty dot they hit you with, but since we have cure disease, it's easily curable.  Takes 3 casts of the lower lvl one.<br />
<br />
Once you hit around 21 to 22, start solo'ing the bandit camps.   Just make sure another group is there pulling.  If no one else is there to help thin the camp out, when you go to pull, you could possibly get up to 4 bandits along with the one you pulled :)<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mikshal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I tryed the bandit camp after 19 lv (but with my monk) and little group is the best chance to get fast xp. <br />
I see much refuse any1 lower that 17 level there.<br />
hope can help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lorace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bandits and Patog fiends are pretty much the hardest things in there.  If you want to solo, you can find some areas with single pull bugs, mushrooms, and maybe phlerg fiends, but expect adds in most of them from time to time. <br />
<br />
One problem is that coming in from SH end, you'd need to get an invis to get to some of these areas.  Paludal is built with the easiest areas nearest Shar Vahl, and the hardest areas near Shadow Haven.  <br />
<br />
The shik'nar area is even doable within a few levels, but again, you'd need invis to get there.  Best bet may be to find a partner.  The xp here is the best in the game.  The respawn rate is very very quick, so even if you can find 2 or 3 single pulls in an area, they respawn so fast that it might be plenty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you want a small challenge, go after some of the nasty fish in the underground lakes. Besides for my newborn kitty, I found the two lakes to be excellent palces to build up on your Swimming skills. The smaller lake by the newbie zone inside of the PC only has one fish mob to worry about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The Patogs are probaly your best bet. I think the Shik'Nar further in are roughly the same level as well. <br />
<br />
The Patog's aren't hard but they're a pain and they proc a disease that is really annoying. It lowers your Sta/HP, is a DoT and lasts for 28 minutes or so. You can cure it but it takes a few casts. Which is why I prefer the Shik'Nar. Bad thing is, you have to get past the Patog's to get to them :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Azhdarkhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Spawn rate in Paludal is roughly 8 minutes, so you can happily hunt a small area without running out of prey.<br />
<br />
Recently, some RL friends of mine and I started a couple of groups worth of gnomes, halflings and dwarfs to play one night a week, and have been hunting in Paludal 3 weeks running now, for about 2 hours per night.  We've been averaging about 2 levels per night (missed getting 18th last session by one blue bubble.)<br />
<br />
Your best bet is to get to the Shar Vahl side and work your way back - the mobs escalate very smoothly in level moving from either Shadeweaver's Thicket or Hollowshade Moor entrances towards the Shadowhaven entrance.  Move in until you find the right size critters for your level and lay waste ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ralahast-BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Paludal Caverns &gt; Everthing for lvls 19-25 soloing. I was fairly twinked and could take care of a whole camp (16 some bandits) on my own. It was pretty difficult from 19-24 but once 24 with regen and your new dot, just root, dot 2 or 3 of em canni down, reapply dot and watch the XP roll in. 19-24 took about 3.5 hours total, duoing mostly with a mage friend of mine (he used air pet). I would advise starting to solo around 18 or so (if another group present) otherwise try and get in a group... kills are fast and even between 6 ppl the XP is great.</div></div><hr />
