<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>doedel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yesterday i tried GoD the sewers trial where you have to first hail an NPC and then have to kill 9 stonemits to spawn a big one.<br />
<br />
Problem: When we arrived at the stonemite room there werent any. In the hallway before there were lots of them. Whenever we killed on of theses, two minutes later a new one spawned in the big room and ran to a place in the hallway.<br />
<br />
We tried this over and hour, killing lots of mites in the hallway and also in the big room. But the big one didnt spawn.<br />
<br />
Did we something wrong? Or is that trial bugged? Did anybody else this trial after the last patch?<br />
<br />
thanks for any input on this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">the one that spawned was a roamer that you prob killed before, which is why it spawned near the stonemite room and then ran out.  If the stonemites are up, you will notice them.  They are 9 in the big room, in rows of three.  <br />
<br />
What I think that you did was get your expedition from Gamesh, who is the npc that can give you any of the four different sewers events.  However, if you do it this way, you cannot do the stonemite event because that is part of the progression.  If you want to be able to get to the stonemites and have them up, you must do the trial by getting it from the High Priest in Barindu.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Glek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We ran in to this yesterday to...but the reason they didnt spawn was because i talked to the guy that gives exp expeditoins instead of the high priest who gives the trial expeditions. We left expedition talked to the right guy went back in and had no problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>doedel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Update: Tried it again today. This time we had the room with 9 Stonemites and were able to spawn and kill the boss.<br />
<br />
I am pretty much convinced that on my first try the wrong NPC was used to get the mission.<br />
<br />
So as of today i am finally proud owner of a GoD Sewer Trial flag...<br />
<br />
With the exception of the golems and the 9 stonemites and the boss mob no other mobs did mitigate slow. I think before the last patch they all mitigated.</div></div><hr />
