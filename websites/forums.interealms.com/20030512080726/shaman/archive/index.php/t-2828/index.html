I think the subject explains it all, but I'm just curious to see what your best solo accomplishments (in terms of NPC killing) have been. <br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

Soloed an OT cliff golem today that was kinda challenging considering their pain in the ass MR :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tevash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At 58...I was in the grey at the back of the temple..well adventually a named revenant popped...revenant sszataszszgasgag or something like that...anyhow...if youve hunted in the grey you know landing poison/disease is nearly impossible (on the snakes at least). So i slowed and tanked it...and clicked the JBB endless times (no epic) since i didnt have torpor..and still dont, all i could do was Chroloblast myself...so end of fight..snake wont stop chasing me cuz im low on health..cannibalizing for one final root/jbb blast..ended fight with 124 hitpoints and no mana. The revanants are easy kills..but not being able to dot them..and not having epic or torpor makes it a lot harder..they are lvl 55 btw...anyone else have such a lovely experience with these guys or do i just suck that bad? ^_^<br />
<br />
BTW...dinged 60 couple weeks ago on Tarew Marr...and I still dont have torpor so if you can help me out send a tell =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Timog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Probably soloing golems in the Hole. Not really that impressive, but that's the only summoning mob I can solo. Tried to kill a tower guard next to thurg, got one malosini'd and separated from the other one, but only got it to 20% before being killed.<br />
<br />
edit-- I was 54 when I first soloed a golem in the hole, was barely 57 when I tried the tower guard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloobonious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heard of Shamans soloing Stomples (PoM) and Lodizal.<br />
<br />
I'm sure there are other mobs even more powerful soloed by Shamans with massive, NToV/Ssra-buffed AC caps, although I have yet to hear about them. Given time, practice, and the ability to single pull, I'm sure some of these Shamans could solo powerful NPC's, such as Drakes in ToV! (Good luck slowing without Tash/OOS, though :p)<br />
<br />
My personal bests? Wandering stuff in the Umbral Plains, Korakaz in Kael, Top asslings/Glonks/Grinks in the AiW PoM loop, and the Frostgiant Overseer in WL. I am limited by my gear. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">54 Shammy with Epic swapping with Hammer of scourge for dot.<br />
No Jbb. Self-buffed with a melange of Hate, Wyvern, nasthar, and a ss bracer...oh and an iksar BP.<br />
<br />
Killed: mostly crap.<br />
<br />
Killed Faerie of Dispair today in a 20 minute fight.  Wandering Wurm, Killed a few Mature Wurms. Got a few spells..:)<br />
<br />
Sure..these don't seem all that awesome compared to what y'all are talking about..but I JUST squeaked these out!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Duffe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">soloed a seb juggernaut after a succesful trak raid. roamer comes half way back through traks lair and is far enough away to get single.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I soloed a Frost Giant and 2 Drakkel Dire Wolves at 40. Just me and Cujo took em out ! Hey, its a start so don't laugh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">at level 45 I killed Proon. and I was pretty damn proud since I only had like 780ac :P<br />
<br />
best solo kill to date? Probably the ilis knight I killed while the rest of my group was trying to multitank adds passing through jail in our chanterless king group ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>TalgurenXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I solo'd Broog Bloodbeard in RM at level 60 with epic and bane.  It was a pretty trivial fight, but something I never thought I would do when I was hunting there in my 40s.<br />
<br />
-Talguren</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Smasherr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i tested myself a few times this week.<br />
<br />
Killed one of those 4 arm mobs in ME near akhieva zone.  long fight..they are clerics.:(<br />
<br />
Killed Goranga hunters/shamans/spiritseer's in ME aswell......now just want to try the chief.<br />
<br />
Almost downed yeldema....got her to 30 percent....till..an add decided to stop in to say hi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tevash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well finally got torpor..so that changed things. Best solo kills to date: Dragon Constructs in DN, 4 arm guys in ME, Random mobs in CT..mostly warders/warriors/raptors, well still limited by my gear, im proud of what i can solo thouhg, i dont even have over 1k ac =).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Amanita</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">But I am only level 52.  Can solo a lot of the 55s in ME using a horse and JBB, but no epic.  Basic technique is to pull with slow, root, pet attack, dot, get in melee range when pet gets low, JBB, &amp; heal.  Tried a mob in UP and got it to about 60% before I got killed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>haze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Named Vampyre guy in Tene Mtns, kept gating and receiving his complimentry 3k heal,  fight lasted 17mins.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">my best solo kill was prolly the time i had 3 ulthorks on me, there were alot of misses but me and my pet were almost toast, but somehow i managed 2 good root spelles and a bit of distance for my dots, it was very good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hmm... Soloing the entrance of Umbral can be challenging (humungous amount of HP on the MOBs, summoning, some casters, can have nasty resists too). Same with the big iksar monk construct in the Grey (Sun revenants? Hit consistently hard, with lot of HP and mild to high MR). Or the shissar guard in the antechamber of the temple<br />
<br />
I also used to solo part of the AiW area in PoM, but that was before I got torpor. With Torpor, that whole area would be fairly simple to solo, including Stomple. But I haven't returned there since.<br />
<br />
Dragon Construct in DN are pretty much a crap shot on whether or not you get slow to stick or not. If it does, it's just a question of dealing with the damage they do to you while you kill them. If it doesn't, you're toast.<br />
<br />
But again, that's just with some Wolf Caller, some PoM armor, an Epic and no nToV or ST equipment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>hamani101</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">probebly yelimada or who ever that ****up of a dragon in WW is, almost soloed prot but we wont go in to that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sowfor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Dont solo big mobs too often.. stuff in cazic is fun, but the most fun was soloing An Amygdalan Warrior in fear at level 56 while we were doing a CR.</div></div><hr />
