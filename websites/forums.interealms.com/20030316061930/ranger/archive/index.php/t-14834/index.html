<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aethien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey, folks - no PoP here, and currently in Everfrost, so travel is a hassle:  Does the Ranger trainer in Surefall Glade train Wood Elves in Hide? Just hit 25, and really (!) need those extra 25 skill points... If not, does the Ranger trainer in Shadowhaven do it?  I know that not all trainers train the same thing. Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Reminic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think i remember training in Surefall once or twice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've never trained at that one; but I didn't know that different ranger trainers train different things.<br />
<br />
I built Hide up when taking boat rides, no idea if it still works though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aethien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks folks - mystery solved, at one level, at least:  Turns out that you apparently don't need to train in Hide if you get it as a Racial ability. I thought it was like Slam/Bash or something, I guess. But last night I got a skillup in Hide (51!), so I guess I don't need to visit a trainer until Disarm/Riposte, whatever. <br />
<br />
As far as different trainers training different things -- my Dwarf Rogue was adventuring on Kunark (before Luclin), and hit 22 and wanted to train Instill Doubt, I think it was. (Back when I thought that ID was going to be my ticket to soloability...) I went to the Rogue trainer and FV, and discovered that they didn't offer training in ID.  Had to hoof it back to Kaladim for that...<br />
<br />
Just thought that it might be the same case for Ranger trainers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>blakkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Seem incomplete... <br />
<br />
As a half elf I have trained in: <br />
<br />
Surefall<br />
Kelethin<br />
Kithicor<br />
Rivervale <br />
&amp;<br />
Shadowhaven -- using sneak.<br />
<br />
you don't need super faction to train they just have to be apprehensive or higher (seen this with wife's monk).</div></div><hr />
