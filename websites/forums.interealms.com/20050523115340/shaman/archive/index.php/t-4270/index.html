<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm looking for a bit of advice or feedback.    Background ... I've just left a small guild that I was the only Shaman.   We didn't do any real raiding to speak of in the high end.  Kael and alike but nothing major.   And if I was on a high end raid always had lvl 60 Shaman's with spells that handle the buffing or slowing.   I'm 57 about to hit 58 (dang yellow or less) with all my spells to my level with OK gear.   AND I've been out of the game for 3 months after burning out a bit.<br />
<br />
So tonight I spend some time with a guild to check things out doing raiding in UP's.    We did the spirit mobs ... and I was the only Shaman ... and was doing Slowing ... plus trying to buff 3-4 groups as well.  <br />
<br />
Problem was ... without my higher group buffs (Dex, STR) and of course without Focus ... it was almost impossible to balance slowing and buffing for me.    I'm trying to figure out what balance I should be doing at this next level.   And really if the role of a Shaman is a Buffer first ... or slower.   Does everything fall into place once you get Grp Focus ... plus the other Grp buffs along with Cann VI (for mana balance).   This is the first time I've felt like I wasn't able to do my job.   Sure I was slowing every mob pulled ... but was losing track of who needed my single buffs.   To tell ya the true it was a headache trying to balance Acumen, Speed, Buffs, Sin'ding mobs ... AND slowing.   Maybe I'm just not practiced enough.    And really I'm wondering what other Shaman do in things when in situations like this.    <br />
<br />
I sure as heck didn't want to come across as a whinner ... but it was really a bitch to keep up.   Will getting the higher level spells make the differance?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You buff Acumen? Stop that right away. Also if yer the only one on haste forget about it. Make them get an enchanter. You need to keep buffs to the essentials if not for nothing else than yer sanity. Buffing 24/7 is a sure way to burn out fast. Buff the essentials then have some fun. Don't sweat keeping every single person buffed with every single buff, yer debuffs are more critical.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Buffing and Slowing don't mix, there's no balance there....  As you buff, they stop pulling, till yer done, plain and simple.  When on large raids, I'll keep one slot open during pulls to rebuff folks, but that's it.  On one or two group raids, they STOP the action while I make em tough!  We got too many spells to cast and the aggro you get through slowing and then sitting down to med is too much....<br />
<br />
As far as hasting, I got no problem with it, as long as I'm grouping.  In a raid, I'll NEVER hit anyone with celerity, as that's really not my job.  <br />
<br />
Acumen is worthless as an attack buff if you take care of STA, which I'm sure you do.  I only cast it on myself to get the long-lasting ultravision.<br />
<br />
Oh, and yer in the doldrum levels for the Shammy.  Once you break through to 59 and 60, life gets MUCH better for da bears!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Khura's Focusing and Talisman of the Brute make life easy.  Agi and Acumen aren't needed and are rarely cast.<br />
<br />
It IS tough trying to do everything when you're in those levels before 60.  I was the same way, cast all the buffs I could on everyone, malosini everything and slow it.  I can't believe I put up with that.  Knowing what I now know, and with spells like Harnessing of Spirit, my advice would be to not really give a damn.  Harness is just fine for doing stuff in UP.  Gsta people and you're done.  Let the Magician's Malosini stuff, theirs usually lands MUCH easier for some reason that makes me want to physically hurt someone at VI.  Let the Enchanters haste people.  Let the Druids cast regens.  And make a point of being grouped with a Cleric who understands you might need heals when a mob is pulled.<br />
<br />
Nothing angered me more when I was a lower level Shaman than when I was doing the job of 5 people.  Shamans CAN do a lot, but you know, I'm not busting my ass (and stopped busting my ass) because people want to slack.  Hitting Cannibalize 3 1500 times an hour also wasn't my idea of fun, Cann4 is a nice change.  The upper end abilities that are available for Shaman really do make you appreciate them.  Cann4, Torpor, Cann5...fun fun.  I don't mind playing a Shaman at all with those.  If you asked me to play a 58 Shaman for anything..I'd probably tell you no.  :p<br />
<br />
Level up as fast as you can without burning yourself out.  A 60 Shaman with spells + aa abilities makes a 59 Shaman look like a bad joke.  And a 59 Shaman is a nice thing to have around, but a 60 Shaman is just..wow.<br />
<br />
Good luck.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Uloff Bonecracker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've always been a bit of what my guild would call &quot;a buff nazi&quot;. I used to hate to buff when I was lower levels but these days at 60 with group focus, can 4/5, torpor and Talismen of the Brute I can handle buffing 3 or 4 groups with zero downtime. (2 more alt lvls till MGB wooooo!) <br />
<br />
As for advice for you now generally all I did at your level was RH the puller and the MT, celerity the MT, heal the group and slow the mobs cos that's about all the mana I could have to keep up with the constant pulls. I did however buff up only for big fights. /shrug  Some shaman like to buff and some dont... Just for the love of whatever god you follow dont be one of those shaman that doesnt like to slow *shiver*<br />
<br />
IMHO Slow &gt; buffs - if you're having problems allocating your mana just remember that and you'll do fine.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah, I agree,  just wait till you see 60.  Malo and Focus (both versions) alone make a tremendous difference in the buff/debuff game.  Not to mention the huge mana regen abilities you get from Torpor and Cann4/5.  Not gonna lie to you, Malo and Torpor are hard to find, but when you do get them, you'll see a world of difference.<br />
<br />
As for now, just continue doing what you are doing.  A 57 shaman is a force to be reckoned with, and not every group you will be in will have another lvl 60 shaman.  You have Malosini and Turgur's -- two very powerful spells.<br />
Even your buffs are the best in respect to your level.  Harnessing of Spirit is good until Focus, and it takes care of DEX, STR, and HPs.  Add Cat and Brute, and you got a nice buff line-up.<br />
Acumen, as Litche said, has very limited use so you can put that by the wayside.  Cripple is another spell with questionable use.<br />
<br />
So until 60, Cann3 + Regrow will carry you fine.  Likewise, HoS and the two Talismans (as well as Celerity and Shroud of Spirits if no enchanters or clerics are available) will satisfy any tank.<br />
<br />
Don't worry, you aren't doing anything wrong :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Also, remember that at level 57 your guild starts noticing that they can't do ANYTHING without a happy shammy on board.  It'll be hard for you to stick that Malosini/Turgur's till yer 60 and have Malo/Malosini/Turgur's.  Keep that Insideous decay/Plague of insects up in case you have trouble landing the big slow and you'll also find life easier.<br />
<br />
Oh, and remember, yer not getting Malo/Torpor/Tigger's/Focus for yourself...  If you can't afford them/find them, then yer guild's gonna have to help you.  Those are spells to help ALL the guild, not just for your health.  That's just like the help the whole guild gives Chanters and Clerics for their respective epics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I do group buffs (focus sta) for everyone and then any single buffs that the important melees (primary and secondary tank, pulling monks) ask for.  If it is before the raid starts and we're just waiting, I'll buff everyone with everything they ask for.<br />
<br />
Once the raid has started, though, slowing comes first.  Having a mob attack at 25% of its normal rate is infinitely more useful than casting hos on a level 51 ranger with two centi LS's (argh).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">IMO the importance of your duties in the situation you described would be:<br />
Slows &gt; HoS &gt; Haste (if required) &gt; group stamina buffs &gt; malosini &gt; group regens &gt; acumen for the blind &gt; group agility.<br />
<br />
FYI it is acceptible to tell the raid to stop pulling if they want buffs.<br />
Either that, or deligate an enchanter to do slowing duties until you finish up on buffing, so you can take over once again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Personally, I never use a haste spell during raids,ever. We have far too much on our plate to worry about. As far as acumen, its been said, dont use it during raids. Also, if you are the only shaman doing all tihs( as I was for a long time) make a list of the tanks in the raid party starting with their names in alpha order. Start buffin them in order, and time it. Have your tanks line up, yes line up in front of you when you start buffing. Once buffing is done, then switch role to debuffer/slower. Make it clear to your guild that when they nickle and dime your mana for single buffs through out the raid, it hurts the guild as a whole as it is a huge watse of raid time. Also, have a dedicated necro standing right next to you pumping you mana as you buff, and have a mage making mod rods for you to right click and a cleric to use a heal over time on ya when you use said mod rods. Hopefully that should cut some of your buff time down a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Here's a few tips from a super slow leveller, so I've had to cope without group buffs for a long time :)<br />
<br />
Before the raid starts, tell all the melee classes to send you a tell to &quot;get on the buff list&quot;. They never do, so make your own list using /who.<br />
<br />
Prioritise buffs. Usually &quot;real&quot; tanks (ie warriors, pallies, SKs) are a higher priority than rangers, rogues. If a ranger's getting hit and having HoS is going to make a difference, then your raid is already wiped.<br />
<br />
Dedicate a hot key bank or two to your buff list. I use the first 8 slots to target people, slot for canni and slot 10 for the buff I'm casting.<br />
<br />
Make a hot key for each person on the buff list - this hot key will read &quot;/target soandso&quot;. Put the high priority buffes on one bank, and the low priority on another.<br />
<br />
Stagger your buffs. Most important is probably HoS, so cast that first. Cast it on yourself as a timer, and then a minute later start working though the buff list. Because you have the targeting keys, canni and the buff spell on one bank, it's dead easy to target, cast buff, canni once or twice, and move on to the next target.<br />
<br />
10 minutes later ask for a short delay in the pulls so you can do Stamina. 10 minutes later do Agi if you want to.<br />
<br />
One of the most important ways of coping, I think, is to prioritise who you buff. A reasonable ranger will say &quot;Fine, I don't NEED HoS, I'll buff my own Strength&quot;. Of course if you can, buff everyone, but my guideline is as many as I can buff with a full bar of mana, which is usually about 8-10 casts of HoS (with some cannibalising mixed in). But make a hot key for every melee class in the raid, because the raid leader might decide to switch who's MA or something, or perhaps a cleric shouts &quot;quick heal soandso I am OOM&quot; at a crucial time. You can just flick to your target hotkey bank and heal the person straight away without messing around trying to target them with the mouse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Oh yes, what Coltrane said reminded me - never be afraid to ask for mod rods. You can cannibalise, but mod rods give that instant hit. Especially the 3 charge version - using these can speed up the buffing seesion a lot.<br />
<br />
And when you're the only shaman on a raid, it feels GOOD to be needed, but it's also a pain if the entire raid has to stop for you when you are OOM. Harsh reality is that the raid won't stop while a mage meds up after feeding you rods.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My first experience of &quot;higher&quot; level raiding was roaming in HoT.. only 53 and sometimes the only shaman at that time.<br />
This is good exp as we where rezing and buffing on the fly to move before respawns (we now can clear hot, do west and come back for respawn.. lol). I prefer this as there is not 9hour wait as people decide that they will arrive later for the gather-buff-n-kill mobs.<br />
<br />
If you find yourself the only shammy:<br />
<br />
1) Prioritise your mana.. answer the question - are you slower?<br />
2) Announce to the whole raid what your priorities are - is buffing limited to MT, 2MT, puller then others when mana allows?<br />
3) Enforce point (2) - otherwise you'll be OOM continually... when it's needed most.<br />
4) If your not slowing (too low a level) then either an enchanter or ranger can slow - leaving you to focus on shm HP buffs. Yes it's hard without shm slow but a ranger procced slow is better than no slow.<br />
5) You'll get used to the continuous spam of requests and organising through them.. chat window history is a godsend :)<br />
<br />
If your in with a set of shammies then this changes :)<br />
<br />
1) Organise - get the shm's to know who is doing what. Malo/slow/Focus/etc..<br />
2) Know the mobs your killing - if it's a dispelling mob think about dispell order.. you want the HP buffs such as aego to be one of the last to be dispelled.. <br />
2) Communicate - tell the people who is doing buffs, and request that group leaders ONLY ask for them if they're group buffs. Also if it's a dispeller frequently yell out the buff orders.. no one else will but everyone will wonder why they died because aego was dispelled first and they got lure based AEd for 500..<br />
3) Group spells rule :) /target /cast /done :)<br />
4) don't be affraid to use HoS ... it's normally the stats that the non-tanks are after in non-AE encounters.<br />
<br />
Don't be afraid to make the point that your short of mana to your cleric when buffing... he has celestial healing.. that when coupled with mod rods/cana is a perfect way to regen that mana.<br />
<br />
In the highest level of the game is all about regen and DPS.. Shammies can help clerics even more - a CH chain with clerics using mod rod 2 and torpor is awsome.. I often act as mod rod scavenger.. so the clerics can concentrate on healing not looking at the ground..<br />
Shammies can help wizzies MB - mod rod and torpor.<br />
Shammies can help necros... mod rod an torpor..<br />
<br />
Sorry but nothing is going to help a ranger... just make a hot key :) hehe :p<br />
<br />
And to the person who said that playing a 58 shammie is bad... there are some good things.. level 60s con yellow :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>nomanaz_VZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Another thing you can do to help buff on raids, is to heal the shaman who is cannibalizing due to khura's focusing taking 40% of his mana ;)  I know that is not nearly as efficient as him using torpor, but it still allows the shaman to jus canni/buff continuously.  This doesnt seem like alot of help, but at least it makes you feel useful :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">No matter which method you choose, I think the most important thing to remember is that it's more important to have 5-10 slows in you than it is to have full buffs on the entire raid.  NEVER EVER let yourself get down below half mana if there's the slightest chance you could get mobs.<br />
<br />
Our chanters live because I can slow every mob that they mezz, as soon as (or before) they mezz them.  Our clerics have mana because of the bear.  And how many here have heard &quot;OMG, I can't believe we lived through that,&quot; and known without a doubt you all would've been paste without the slows?<br />
<br />
I only let the chanters slow if we're doing something really cheezy and simple.  They're just too fragile for that.<br />
<br />
I go with &quot;you'll have buffs as I can do them, it's all timed, be patient&quot; - as my mana goes above 60.  You don't have to be a nazi about this for long.  Once your people get used to it, THEY will prod the mages to pump out the mod rods for you.  I don't tell the raid to stop for buffs - it forces people to be more efficient.  The MT and TM always have what they need, the rest is gravy.<br />
<br />
Nobody asks for acumen in raids.  I guess we've trained em too well.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Once you get 58, Canni IV helps a LOT. demand the hybrids heal you during buffing stage while you eat yourself, thats what I do ;)<br />
<br />
You can save quite a bit of mana by using:<br />
<br />
Talisman of the rhino<br />
Talisman of the brute<br />
<br />
on groups, and<br />
<br />
Talisman of Kragg<br />
<br />
only on the MA/SA and the pullers.<br />
<br />
throw a celerity on the MA if you're the only one with haste. Haste other melee at your discression.<br />
<br />
Dex - Worthless<br />
AGI - Ditto<br />
Acumen - Good for the puller, my monk jumps a lot when pulling. Or for nightblind folks.. *shrug* just click velious bracer :)<br />
<br />
then just stick to slows, get a mage to do malosini for you, that will save you a lot of mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Some will probably dissagree with me, but haste is the most important buff in the game for a melle.  I hate buffing haste, it sucks to raid without enchanters, but its essential.  It helps tanks taunt, it helps damage output.  Haste before any other buff.  I would slow before I hasted, but I would haste before I casted dex/str/agi/sta/cha.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree that haste is a fairly important buff.  Having played a rogue as my main for so long, the difference between having just item haste and having max haste is enormous.  Although if it comes down to it, I think that it is much more important to have the mob slowed over buffs.  With my rogue I often had to go with the bare minimum of buffs on the raids I was on.  Don't worry about buffing much beyond the main tank, secondary tank and the puller.  Most people won't be to heart broken if they don't get buffed, not to mention there should be other classes able to buff on raids.  Oh yeah, don't waste your mana giving casters strength and such... they always ask for it :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Haggus of Saryrn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I don't always agree that slowing is THAT important.  Haste the melees so that they can kill faster.<br />
<br />
In many experience groups and some raids, the mobs die to quickly to justify the cost of slowing.  You cast slow on a mob, it dies quickly, you don't get any more benefit from the spell.  If you cast haste on the melees and it lasts for several mobs.<br />
<br />
In large raid situations, where mobs take longer to kill is when slowing a mob would take priority over hasting the melees when no other shaman/enc is available imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I am in a similar position as the only shaman in a guild with no regular enchanter.  Take advantage of any epic bards you may have.   Put as many melees as you can with them to take advantage of mana free haste, and haste cap exceeding haste.  Don't waste your mana hasting epic monks if you have a lot of people to do.  It's only like a 10% boost to their haste.<br />
<br />
My priorities in your position would probably be:<br />
slow/debuffing - haste - HoS (then later grp focus) - Stamina.<br />
<br />
Anything else you add is gravy.  Buffing AGI is very very minimal returns.  Tell them to ask the rangers for feet like a cat if they think they need it that bad.  Same with SoW and see invis, vision buffs - pass that off.  Beat it into them about 100+ sta and no ill effects from no sta besides no jumping.  If they whine about it tell them to ask the clerics/druid/etc for extinguish fatigue or whatever.<br />
<br />
Do whatever you can do get Talisman of the Brute.  Group stamina is a really helpful buff.  Make sure your guild has grp focus waiting for you to ding 60.  :)<br />
<br />
When you are low on mana, canni like crazy.  Ask for heals, rangers are good canni healers.  Celestial healing/elixir from clerics, natures recovery from druids, bandaids from monks and melees.  A lot of people got their bandaiding skill up practicing on me.  :)<br />
<br />
good luck to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Buffing and slowing is our jobs.  we have awesome buffs but as only shaman on a big raid you will start to pull your hair out :)  First off as a 57 shaman get talisman of the brute asap, that spell is a godsend for the rest of your career as a buffing shaman.  Feel free to tell people no after they ask for a buff.  agility should be the last buff you cast (if at all).  as everyone said priortizie who u buff.  and yes group buffs are awesome. only haveing to cast 5 times instead of 25 times saves time and grey hairs.<br />
<br />
Also start now in training your guild.  Pullers need to know your mana and if you are ready. if you are not make sure they know.... we almost had a wipe in Wtov cause i was only shaman and 20m when the monk pulled 2-3 mobs.  and as everyone says slow &gt; buffs. and pray you have a chanter so dont have to cast 9 second celerity.  <br />
<br />
on the gloom side as the only shaman, 60 w/ canni5 in a heavy raiding guild just telling you it wont get a lot better, u may have more mana always, so be able to slow and buff but melees never learn that asking for buffs right as mobs are being pulled sucks.  so learn to work with the melees and teach them the way you work so that get along well.  and good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Thanks all for the advice and understanding.  After reading your comments plus thinking about it for the day ... I'm not so stressed out.  <br />
<br />
I was slowing every pulled mob along with buffing.  Plus on major pulls Sin'd, Slowed, and Crippled ... and then drop few JB's and Epic on cast call.   All the while watching HP on tanks for quick Chloroblast.   I've been using a nice little trick a Uber Cleric told me once ... when on raids create a Assist Mob hotkey.   Then you know what person it's targeting ... then it's easier to cast Chloroblast or heals as the damage pours in ... esp if it's a Ranger or Enc as you know they are about to die without a quick heal.  <br />
<br />
I've got all my spells up to 57 other than some of the SoL ones like grp regrowth and curse line.   So I was casting Grp STA on everyone I could ... heck that's a easy one ... and can't wait for rest of the Grp spells.   <br />
<br />
What I wasn't doing was casting HoS ... I've been using Kragg, STR, DEX for my regular grouping stuff cause it's easy to keep up on it timing off myself for a 6 party group.    Using HoS would solve some of the problem ... it just sucks that it doesn't stack anymore ... BAH ;).   <br />
<br />
But most importantly I was slowing ... first and foremost ... everything got slow cast on it by me.   High end stuff ... waiting for Tash ... then I Sin'd and Slow the dang thing.   If for any reason other than a slowed mob means the fight's winable.   NonSlowed mob is a trainwreck waiting to happen.   Maybe it was just getting to know everyone and them figuring out that I'm not level 60 ( No Focus ).    I'll learn to using HoS again ... and move on to getting to 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Don't complain too much about HoS not stacking. The benefit from higher Str and Dex is minimal, and now you only have 1 spell to cast rather than 3 :)</div></div><hr />

But I used it for a couple months to bring all the guild ranja's etc to 255 Dex  :)  And I also used it and lesser STR/DEX spells to PL my melee dr00d  :)</div></div><hr />

I don't always agree that slowing is THAT important.  Haste the melees so that they can kill faster.<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree that haste is one, if not the, most important buffs.<br />
<br />
Haste is extremely important to counteract the taunt of slow on situations where you need to get slow off quick too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">here is what I ususlly do :<br />
<br />
Group focus/Group stama/Group agi  for pre-raid buff and rebuff<br />
click my bp stama buff and single focus buff to who just rez<br />
<br />
since I don't have malo yet, but there are alway other shaman there to malo it, so I mem malosini and slow all time, also cripple for long fight; when mob die too fast, I ususlly just try cast Malosini to  MA's target and slow/malosini the add . <br />
<br />
depend on fight, we need throw small heal here and there from time to time, expecial AE,rampage mob, I found try refuse my torpor after fight and click his BP forever to heal himself -:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Make sure the guild knows that you are in need of Malo and Torpor for SURE and have need of group focus and focus and all that other stuff.  If they all know this and want to see you help them out more at raids, they'll get on the stick and find the spells for you or hunt the mobs that drop them.  <br />
<br />
In my guild, shortly before I joined, there was a newly 60 shaman without Malo.  Given he was a gimp in that he liked velks and aaxp so much he never even bothered to get his epic until he had 60 and 9 AAxp points!  But he was an avid raider and needed Malo, so the guild launched &quot;Operation Malo.&quot;  They killed kunark dragons up the wazoo for a week, having ranger/druid twinks camped out to let them know when stuff popped then rushing over to kill it.  He got his copy of Malo, and a copy of Torpor as well!  <br />
<br />
Point is, if you need a spell that is gonna help the guild, don't be embarassed to ask the guild for help.  Hell, Operation Malo netted a bunch of lewt and spells for other classes as well as epic quest items for warriors, pallys, and bards.   <br />
<br />
Other than that, good advice has been given already on how to deal with raids and raid responsibilities.  Keep the raid moving and keep buffs to the essentials.  Those are the priorities.  <br />
Haste is a priority as well generally.   Get mod rods and have a cleric CH you for mana.</div></div><hr />
