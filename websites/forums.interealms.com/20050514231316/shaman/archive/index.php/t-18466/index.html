<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After all those posts fromHenora's topic (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=18448), I really think that we need to do a sticky of what we ALL want to be given to us and do other posts when we want to add something to sticky post.<br />
This way, we could have 1 list that ALL shamans want and give SoE an idea of what they should work on for next upgrades.<br />
<br />
So please, let's start to stick a thread with nothing in it for the moment, and here we go for polls/debate on other topics, 50+% of the polls ( over let's say 1 or 2 weeks to let people think about it ) will mean that it has been approved by the community and can go in the sticky thread.<br />
<br />
It is time to show that we want some improvements, and to my mind, it is the best way to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hehe, no offense, but if you really want a list of what we ALL want, I can give it to you:<br />
<br />
1)<br />
<br />
The end. ;)  I think it's the problem of playing such a versatile class - you'll never get everyone to agree on one specific direction for the class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">so don't even try to get new abilities and let sony decide for us</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nah, we can come up with ideas...  I'm just saying you'll be hard pressed to find one that everyone agrees with.  Just settle for ones quite a few people like, not that everyone likes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">actually yes.  it is to hard to come up with a serious list of upgrades.  <br />
<br />
some people want totally unrealistic things.  some people think we are not broke, but overpowered.  some people are comfortably entrenched in a group/guild where their spot is not in any jeopardy.  and lots of folks are lvl 65 with all the spells and aa, just working on time gear, where no upgrade would be greatly useful.  then there are the select shaman who seem to hate buffing anyway.<br />
<br />
then of course there are the people that are clueless.  you can add me to that category.<br />
<br />
give all shaman bash, with skill increases (even in bear form).  take away the throwing skill for it (almost every shaman i have seen does not throw, and uses the slot for a better item)  increase our melee skill caps.<br />
<br />
increase our spell drop rate.<br />
<br />
that would go to helping shaman without infringing on any class, and not make us overpowered.<br />
<br />
but like i said, i am clueless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Point is moot.<br />
<br />
Rule 1: Sony will only give out what they want.  <br />
Rule 2: No amount of postings, type of postings, stickying of postings, consolidation of postings, cross postings, or anything else a player or group of players can do with a message board will change Rule 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm of the opinion that we're a fairly balanced class.  What I would like is for SOE to take a good look at beastlords and make whatever changes are needed to bring that class in line with others in terms of power and considering that they're supposedly a hybrid class, not a true caster with phenomenal damage output and a wide assortment of excellent and powerful utility spells and buffs...  and incidentally, the ability to slow just about as well as us but with a lower cast time and less fear of resists.  This would take time out of SOE's busy expansion-releasing schedule though, and as BST abilities are not something a great deal of people are aware of or are clamoring over, Sony will never bother.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">In the 3 years that I've been reading here I can't think of even one instance where the Shaman population, en masse, could agree with even a &quot;top 5&quot; to add to the class. <br />
<br />
As was said above, a persons in-game status often dictates what they see/don't see as the short comings of their class. It isn't a Shaman only phenomena, more just the nature of people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Oh what the hey, I'll take a SWAG at it:<br />
<br />
 ALCHEMY <br />
<br />
For the Tradeskillers and those contemplating it:<br />
<br />
While the Shaman community appreciates the drop in prices, could we please tweak Alchemy just a smidge:<br />
<br />
1) Flesh it out to 200 skill. That would include some super-duper potions at possibly super-duper prices. Hey, it's win-win, remove some plat, make some Shaman happy.<br />
<br />
2) Allow Barbarian, Troll, Ogre and Vah Shir to forage certain alchemy components. Itemize these components so they sell for crapola to the vendors. Also itemize said Shaman so they aren't foraging items on the Druid and Ranger tables. <br />
<br />
Are you trying to tell me that Shaman DON'T have a clue about what flowers / petals / grubs / shrubs and weeds to pull and or mix together?<br />
<br />
C'mon - * I * do and I'm a city boy with a modicum of Army training. But I DID read FM 21-76 (Survival) just as the Shaman would get OJT from the old farts in their respective areas.<br />
<br />
 SPELLS <br />
<br />
1) Can we remove the component portion please? Yes I'm out of touch, but if you give people a spell and they NEVER cast it well then....?<br />
<br />
2) A 75% slow. We all know it's going to be mitigated anyway, and frankly Beast Lords are encroaching a bit too much on Shaman turf. <br />
<br />
3) Hmm, don't like that idea? What about a 3rd slow line based on Poison? <br />
<br />
4) Buffs. Look really, we know that at one time buffs were supposed to be the be-all to end all to this class. Yet like Milli Vanilli we found out that they were fake. They didn't really do a whole heck of a lot. (They're like Congress in that regard). <br />
<br />
But we're willing to compromise. Really. It's like being married. She wants to go to her parents for Christmas and you want to go to Hawaii. So you compromise and go to her parents.<br />
<br />
But I digress.<br />
<br />
Take a look at stacking and buffs in general. Please. I'm tired.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">2) A 75% slow. We all know it's going to be mitigated anyway, and frankly Beast Lords are encroaching a bit too much on Shaman turf.<br />
<br />
You mean like Turgur's?  Or did you mean a 75% disease slow or one with a smaller cast/recast time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">First of all you have to believe that SoE gives a **** about what we want. After having been a user of this board for several years it is still difficult for me to name a lot evidence that they even read and much less understand what it is that is being talked about here.<br />
<br />
But if I had to play along with the idea that they actually do care I would suggest they first fix bugs that have been in the game for ages. One of the most annoying ones is the one where you see a buff starting to fade and then happen to refresh it just a split second before it fades. Which results in the buff fading even if you just refreshed it. Very annoying and especially annoying with buffs with long recast.<br />
<br />
If they have time left after fixing the bugs then I wouldnt mind a few new spells. To me the most shaman-like spells we had has always been slows and dots.<br />
<br />
Its highly unlikely we will get a higher percentage slow but what about stackable slows from several shamans. They would ofcourse have to be lower percentage with a max number of stacked spells but maybe harder to resist or faster to cast or lower aggro? Or what about a very hard to resist slow that starts out low but gets progressively higher over time until it reaches a maxlimit? Kinda like the dot on our epic.<br />
<br />
And what about a cot(curse over time hehe)? One that lowers maybe resistances 2 points every tick for 10 ticks but when the curse fades the resists return to normal.<br />
<br />
Most of all though I would just like some content to keep a relatively casual gamer like myself busy until WoW arrives :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">What one person thinks about what shamans need as an upgrade, will completely differ from the next person. Person 1 may favour a meer extension of spells, only following the lines of spells we have now, while person 2 may favour a near completely innovative spell lineup. So serious ideas is kinda hard to define.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Upgrade to tigirs with a neg to resist check please.<br />
<br />
New single/Group quiesence of at least 600 a tic. OMG.. against 1000+ hitting, slow mitigating mobs, so overpowered!<br />
<br />
Group ferine, with additional melee bonus. <br />
<br />
Real buffs with Strikethrough/combat effects/etc mod or some time level mod that stacks with other time mods. If some crappy melee cant max his stats, boo friggin hoo. I wont cast daiku 2 on people, get some gear gimps.<br />
<br />
Cold based slow. Adds magic counters.<br />
<br />
Significant healing capabilities. IF our slow will continue to be nerfed through mitigation, up our healing powers.<br />
<br />
Quick detrimental aa. Faster spells are good<br />
<br />
A reason to melee.<br />
<br />
Screw alchemy foraging. Seriously, dump, what 5k into the skill to max it? If you CAN forage herbs, they will MAKE you forage herbs.  In general, screw alchemy. Unless they make some super ds potions for pling my Berserker.<br />
<br />
Oh, and more rabid bear related aa's. Rapid rabid rapidity refreshment or whatever lame crap we are going to get just isnt enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">As a raiding ele shaman I see a couple spots for improvement...but not that much imo<br />
<br />
1) We need equal healing powers to druids...period...tnargs with max healing AA is barely even passable as useful in the eles. We need a bigger heal thats not a 10sec pos 1950 Heal that never gets used...EVER..in a raiding situation<br />
<br />
2)  An additional type buff to help new melee changes would be worth it imo.  Would increase our &quot;wantability&quot; in a raiding or grping situation.  <br />
<br />
3) We really need some DD upgrades...my non AA 950 cold DD just suks ass...I dont want to be a mage druid or wizard ...but dang..throw a dog some bones so that we have an option of maybe doing some dmg without having to stack 10dots.<br />
<br />
IMO shaman are one of the best if not THE best balanced classes in EQ.  Any changes would need to be minimal and should be just tweaks on things we can already do (healing and DD nuking)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Seriously, dump, what 5k into the skill [alchemy]to max it? <br />
<br />
ahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahha<br />
<br />
no, seriously<br />

ahahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahah</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">ahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahha<br />

no, seriously<br />

Dude, we ARE doing the same alchemy here? like 10pp per attempt on grow potions? I was bored, and went from 100 to 180 on the things in a sitting on like 3k or so... got a skillup about every 4th/5th combine...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">180-200 is the real plat sink, with combines starting at 70pp and not selling at all to vendors or players.  The 70pp ones trivial at.. was it 187?  191?  It goes up from there..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">180-200 is the real plat sink, with combines starting at 70pp and not selling at all to vendors or players.  The 70pp ones trivial at.. was it 187?  191?  It goes up from there..<br />
<br />
<br />
Err, I guess you can do that. Or skill on heat awareness potions for 160 a try. Or be smart like me and use Hawk Eye potions (triv 191, cost &lt; 20pp) and Mystic infusions (triv over 200, cost &lt; 30pp)... you know, whatever floats yer boat.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">We need a bigger heal thats not a 10sec pos 1950 Heal that never gets used...EVER..in a raiding situation<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We tend to set up shammy CH chains on reparm and fennin and the like with that 10 sec POS, it isn't much, but it certainly helps more than our DPS.  On that note, it is rather weak, but if it covers up damage long enough for a real CH to hit that's all we could possibly hope it will do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Razzaziah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Wouldn't change much:<br />
- Add: Quick Damage (2-3 and 3-4 seconds for our 2 post 65 nukes)<br />
- Add: Two Attempt slow.  1 cast attempts 75% and a 40%<br />
- Add: +2/5/10/15 damage to base melee attack when using berserker line<br />
- Change: Make virulant paralysis interrupt spell casting<br />
- Change: Torpor line stack with Cleric Heal line (either fully or partially)<br />
<br />
You can argue for other things, would love to be able to avoid a few melee hits similar to int caster spells, or a rune spell.</div></div><hr />
