<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tat2demon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I cant seem to find a list of all the alternate flag quests. Can anyone point me in the right direction? Also I know that for planar progression you need to go through all the script. Now lets say I do the HoH or CoD alternate flag, would I still need to kill AD and Grummus to actually progress through the planes?<br />

<br />
Yep, you must kill AD and grummus if you want to be elemental flagged.  The alternate quests just allow you to enter the zone for xp purposes.  You can do the script in HOH or CoD, but you must get backflagged before progressing.<br />
<br />
For example, I went on a successful raid of AD prior to doing the POJ Trials.  I received the character flag for hailing the Planar Projection after AD died, but was unable to zone into HoH (also, I didn't get an AA point or an upgrade to my plane charm) until I went back and was successful in the trials.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You can skip AD, but to do so, you must get in with a raid where at least 85% of the people have killed AD, since AD (and completion of the 3 HoH trials) is required for access to HoHb otherwise.<br />
<br />
I've also seen cases where a person without the AD flag got into HoHb and then got booted to PoK 3 mins later. Its just not worth the hassle. Kill AD, then you dont need to worry about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This is a short summary, from memory, of what you need so you might want to search Allakhazam's for details and to see where I've forgotten steps.<br />
<br />
CoD - collect the four skins from named larvae (Harrion, Sengian, Scaevian, Gengian, though that last one doesn't sound right) in PoD and hand them to Grimror Plaguebringer<br />
<br />
Torment - (1) Sac from Terror Matriarch in PoN, (2) Nettling Wraith Stinger from PoN, (3) Clockwork Venom from regular spiders in PoI, (4) Bile from Rythrak/Resnak in PoD, (4) amiable to Creatures of Justice, attained by killing prisoners in the wing near the PoJ trials, (5) Orcish language to 100<br />
<br />
HoH - (1) Mephit heart from Agony Mephit in PoN, (2) Block of Perillium from random MOBs in PoI, (3) Spider brain from Luminii Crawler or Lucid Arachnae in PoV. Involves a camp in PoJ as well once you have all the parts, and 3000pp if you aren't a skilled blacksmith.<br />
<br />
Tactics - four corners (top left, top right, bottom right, bottom left) of a medallion from the Diaku Raiders in PoS desert. Need to identify to know which parts you have. Also requires Askr the Lost faction (kill giants in PoS or BoT).<br />
<br />
CoD is the easiest and you can probably solo or at the worst duo for it. Tactics is also easy to obtain from a difficulty standpoint, but the raiders/parts are extremely rare so expect to spend some time in PoS. HoH isn't too bad; reaching the Mephits is probably the toughest part of it. Torment is the toughest of them because of the Terror Matriarch. She's a 3-day spawn and hits pretty hard. Also the rat bile camp can be hellish if you're unlucky.<br />
<br />
From what I've seen, all the parts can be multi-quested, though be sure with Torment and Tactics that anyone doing a turn-in has the appropriate faction. CoD results in a No Drop instant-click buff item with Resist Disease so you might want to make sure the person to do the last turn-in to Grimror would benefit from the item.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Crypt of Decay, Torment, Halls of Honor no longer require a flag if you're high enough level. Alternate entry for Tactics is still useful.</div></div><hr />
