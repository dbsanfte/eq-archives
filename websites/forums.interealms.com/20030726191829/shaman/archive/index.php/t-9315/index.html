<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Edarb Everbuzz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just wanted to say that lvl 54 has been the worst of my EQ life.  I have tried Burning Woods and Seb.  This lvl is taking forever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I know what you mean. I'm stuck here too. Even in PoP the exp sucks(for me atleast). I plan to go to HHK again for one more level doing nobles isabella and bards. Then I'll go to PoP and maybe do aa's for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Meener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yup.<br />
<br />
Stuck in 53 for a while now.  Can't get a pickup group in the planes, old zones give hardly any experience, and soloing is now worthless for exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">solo is not worthless for exp.  u must be in the wrong zones.<br />
<br />
HHK at 53 or the hole ent is how to beat it.<br />
<br />
sebilis grps are bad for exp  cos rember in a grp the highest lvl gets the bigest % of exp-  most seb grps have 3 folk in the grp over 55   ergo sum  the exp suks<br />
<br />
<br />
you could try duoing with lvl 53  sk in POJ entrance(welleixt :P) however this can be tricky  cos u have to learn to pull it right, so u need a sk u know or have seen in action.<br />
<br />
btw if u want some fun  to break the nauseum of lvling,  grab a 50 tank and go inside Felwithe to kill the guards.  Its fun and can be tough, but breaks up the grinding !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you are not worried about Katta faction I soloed through 54 in Twilight Sea , killing quest NPCs at the docks and 2 Katta Guards at the top of the stairs leading to Katta.  Basically, there are 2 docks on an island with 3 NPCs each, another dock across the water near Katta entrance with 2 NPCs, and 2 Katta guards at top of stairs........ that's a 10 mob rotation with a 20 minutes respawn time.  All mobs were dark blue to me at 54, then went light blue at 55, so they must be level 40 mobs.  Not many hps, single pulls, all non-casters.... no loot. Largest they hit for is max 90s.<br />
<br />
Took me approximately 7 clearings (70 mobs) or 2.5 - 3 hours per YELLOW.  Not too shabby in my opinion.<br />

P.S. I have JBB and horsey so obviously that makes life easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fenora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Scarlet desert got me thru 53 pretty fast, hit a brick wall when I dinged 54 tho. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">How to fly to 55.<br />
<br />
At 53 get a KEI and head to CoM. Go to the gazeebos and mop up. I flew through that level. Still doable at 54 but not nearly as sweet as an xp flow as 53.<br />
<br />
At 54 I grouped a lot in PoI and PoN. PoD is even better xp but also much more dangerous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kardyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree on 53 but I'm like 3 blue from 54. I've been switching from the elementals in the Hole and gorillas and sarnaks in BW. In the hole, its been like 6 elementals per blue.<br />
<br />
I also grouped in PoD the XP rocks but is VERY Dangerous. The rats can hit up to 248.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Edarb Everbuzz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Dinged 55 and got remove curse in same night.  Remove curse sux does not even remove malisement.  Where to hunt now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">uh, malisement is not a curse.  I am not aware of any curses that a player can scribe/cast.<br />
<br />
to remove malisement ya need dispel magic - if it is in the top buff slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Blindness might be a curse.  MoBs in UP can cast curse</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fenora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ok, did find a nice spot in Scarlet Desert for 54. Park on the wall just east of the main Bloodtribe cave (the one the ravine leads to) and there is a plethera of dark blues. With kei and non stop pulling, made over 4 blue per extended kei. =)<br />
<br />
And as far as remove curse goes, only place that I've ever wanted to have it is in SD, the lil alien guys (vas ren, grol baku, etc) and the revenants cast/proc curses like slow and remove curse is the only thing that will take care of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I got 55 doing HHK, saw how the xp dropped off once I reached 55, and asked around about solo xp rates elsewhere.  I didn't get encouraging news.<br />
<br />
I ended up having a guild necro sacrificing me down to 54 again so I could use the high rate of XP in HHK to get AA.  I'm not sure how many AA I'll grab before moving on (probably to PoP) - at least Run3 and Regen3... but how much I can stand the HHK thing will probably determine the duration more than anything else...  I'm getting an AA per KEI (two and a half hours), make around 600 pp per KEI (HHK is a loot-rich camp) and am in virtually no danger.<br />
<br />
Now I need a HHK-like spot to go from 55-60.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Talsondar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Did the last 2 and a half yellow of 54 at BW Giant Fort.  Was doing about 2 - 2 1/2 blues/hour, so not too bad at all.  When Giant fort was overcamped I just stepped away and pulled random blue mobs from around the fort.  With Horse/KEI/JBB it was non stop killing.<br />
<br />
Also made nearly 4k pp in that time as well.  ALOT of great vendor fodder from Giants, Gems/Vests/Floops/weapons etc...  All in all 54 turned out to be not to bad at all...<br />
<br />
BTW, New Luminary..=)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I did the same thing with the last half of 54, didnt take overly long...and I made about 4-5k pp while doing it.<br />
<br />
55 has been very easy so far also, seems everyone wants you in a group as soon as you hit 55.  Got over 75% in 6 hours in a seb group, along with some mad loot/spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sarnian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yeah 54 and 55 were pretty bad. I got through a majority of 54 in the PoD courtyard camps.  The mobs are a lot higher level but they are easy to slow and give the best xp anywhere in the tier one planes.  During times in which i could not find a group i soloed in PoJ zone out.  Mob there dont have that many hps and are easy fodder.  The only problem is the adds you might face<br />
<br />
If you are really bored and want somewhat of a challenge there is also maidens eye.  At that level most of the zone should be blue.  Gorangas are blue to red at that level and most are doable at 54.  Watch out for the hunters though, they have insane hps, hit for 160 or so and cast druid spells.  I tried soloing one at 56 and  by the end of the fight i had used 3 banes, 2 ebolts, 11 jbb blasts... my pet got eaten and i was at about 30 manna and health.  I would also stay away from the ankhevans for similar reasons.  However the spectral wolves the skeletons, umbrerous toilers and the bats are all easy targets</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Getan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Getan did 53 in Scarlet Desert. The xp is slow but steady. The gave up on Scarlet Desert after narrowly excaping a double Bloodtribe pull. Bloodtribe Shamans are a pain.<br />
<br />
Getan is now 75% done 54 and has been soloing at in Torgiran Mines. Everything is dark blue to him at the Dulak zone line and it seems to be 1% xp per two kills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Definitely look into zoneout of PoJustice.  If you can dodge adds and trains it's a great place.  At 54 I got a yellow in about 2 hours.  You learn which mobs to dodge in order to save mana.  Don't be afraid because most mobs are casters, they usually have only one power spell like HT or CH, which are usually only cast once.  Just add a resist magic buff to your usual regimen and you're good to go.</div></div><hr />
