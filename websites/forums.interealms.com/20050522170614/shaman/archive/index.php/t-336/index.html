<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What type of internet connections does everyone use?<br />
<br />
I had dial-up, too slow, and can't use multiple computers efficiently. I got cablemodem now, and it sucks - bad company supplying it, down all the time, tech support has no working knowledge of their system, .... DSL is not available in my area yet.<br />
<br />
Anyone use the satalite internet connections? If so, how is it for EQ? I read their web sites, and they warn against it for gaming that requires split second timing like shoot 'em games in their example, and cite less than 1 second delay in commands. Does satalite internet connections cause enough lag to make EQ too slow?<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the advice, now to figure out what to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have cable modem also, and I like it when it works to its capabilities, but it's very frustrating when it has problems.  I'm still trying to get everything worked out as I haven't had it for too long now but the speed is quite an improvement over dial up, but it still has flaws.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I use DSL.  <br />
<br />
My parents live out in the sticks, they evaluated satellite internet.  I checked it out when I was visiting.  Downloading stuff, surfing the web... that was all nice and fast.  <br />
<br />
EQ, on the other hand, was really fairly unplayable for me.  :(<br />
<br />
The latency was too high.  Have you ever tried opening a door in super high lag?  You click it and it doesn't open for a while?  It was like that for me all the time, about a one second delay on everything.   This was like a year and a half ago though... my parents decided against it, as it was some 89 bucks a month at the time.  I could be much improved by now.  I think their provider was DirectTV, but it could have been DISHnet or one of the other ones... they change carriers often for some reason.<br />
<br />
Best of luck<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>FloppyDisks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Neither cable nor DSL is available in my area so I still use Dialup.  I'm surprised that you said dialup is laggy.<br />
<br />
It must be your ISP, phone lines, or perhaps your modem.  I run two computers on one dialup line and my brother and I play all the time.  It's nearly impossible to tell the difference then say when only one of us is online.  Even raids are fine for us.<br />
<br />
I use Prodigy and my modem is a USR Gaming Modem.  It's no longer made but get a PCI modem that has an &quot;On Board DSP&quot; and it's pretty much the same thing.  Also try Windows XP for your OS.<br />
<br />
I have used EQ on cable though, and the only real difference is on say the ringwar where we've 95+ people.  Even that though is nitpicking since both connections are total lag fests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Using university connection atm, but it's been horridly unstable.  The network admins are having issues keeping bandwidth regulated and trying to do all kinds of fancy stuff.  For about 3 weeks I'd have a 4-8 second delay on EVERYTHING i did.  Opening doors, casting spells (imagine a 3 second cast time spell with an additional 8 seconds on it &gt;&lt;).<br />
Sounds about what someone described above on satellite, and it has been horrid.  Hopefully problems end soon.<br />
<br />
Have used family cable connection (RoadRunner) at home.  Runs pretty well, rarely any lag or other issues with it.  I'd recommend cable if you're getting anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Yuuki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I use cable (through AT&amp;T) and have never had a problem with the connection or lag even running 3 or 4 computers off it. <br />
<br />
I haven't tried satalite but from what I understand your upstream is through a standard telephone modem, so anything you are sending to the EQ servers will not be any different from dial-up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Satelite internet used to be upstream through telephone lines, but now you can actually get 2 way satelite internet.  I have heard that it isn't great for gaming, but it is wonderful for downloading large files.<br />
<br />
I have used cable and it ran pretty good, then i switched to dsl and it runs about the same.  For a while i was using my universities network, and that was like a dream come true.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I use cable from the Uk , it still only provides a marginal ping benefit over dial up (which hardly matters with eq) but improved the stability substantially. <br />
<br />
Note Antonius Bayle has a much nicer ping, pity all my chars are on veeshan !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Brog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My cable is a local company that is getting some of their markets bought out by Comcast (The Toledo and southern edge of Michigan parts). I assume they will be buying mine out soon.<br />
<br />
The other problem with my cable modem is the cable company refuses to remove the one-way blocks on every home with cable, so I only download through cable, and have to dial in for uploads. This really is not a problem, except that Ameritech has it set to disconnect after 5 to 6 (Random time) hours of online connection :(.<br />
<br />
They been saying for a year that they were going to remove this block, but I'm still waiting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rikkardo Montalban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">As for 2-way sattelite internet, it has to stink for gaming, or anything that requires a low latency (Low ping).   The sattelite is in orbit roughly 22,000 miles up in space.  The speed of light is only :p 186,000 miles per second so your signal has to travel roughly 44,000 miles just to get from your house to the sattelite and back down to earth again. <br />
44,000 miles  divided by 186,000 mi/second = roughly .23 seconds.  Double that for a return signal and you have .46 seconds.   This is the minimum time it takes for a ping.  This does not take into account any sort of latency for equipment, routers on the ground, from the sattelite ISP's equipment, etc etc.  All this means is that the rough minimum ping for sattlelite communications is at least 460ms ping (I get 200-300 over my crummy dialup at home in EQ) but does not include any sort of latency for the ISP's equipment.  Realistically, it should be about 500-600 pings.  Sattelite is wonderful for surfing the web, downloads, etc, but you'd be better having a dialup connection for any gaming if this is your only options.  I'm not going into any debate on which is better, Cable or DSL, they both work great, and you will hear equally bad horror stories about both.  I play on multiple DS-3's at work but thanks to our LAN, my pings in EQ slurrrpp... (Now, quake3 and Tribes2 is a completely different story for some reason.... :D )<br />
<br />
I apologize for my math, I am using approximations but the concept is sound (I hope, its been a long night in seb :p ).  The speed of light is only so fast, and you are communicating by means of  something over 22,000 miles in the heavens.<br />
<br />
Hope this gives some objective information on what to expect from sattlelite internet. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">512 DSL here (only because my fiancee wouldn't let me have the 1.5.....yet ;)  )<br />
<br />
Got 3 comps hooked on a LAN, with room for a fourth.  I have VERY few problems, and those that I do have are either server based, or could be remedied by using the 1.5.<br />
<br />
I've played EQ on DSL, Cable, and on 2 different kinds of dialup.  DSL works for me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Phern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Sprint/Earthlink DSL 512/128. I have had few problems. Most are  attributable to temporary ISP problems or Serverwide EQ problems. Most raids I can keep SoL textures on.<br />
<br />
I'm moving in the near future and my only requirement for the new house is high speed Internet access. There is no way I'm going back to dial-up if I can avoid it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">RoadRunner.  Works pretty well where I am.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">DSL - had some problems with original installation, with moving later, and then with WinXP (had to buy a new modem) ... going great now.  SWBell.net is the ISP and DSL provider.<br />
<br />
DSL Tools shows that my download speed is usually right around 1.1 gig, and upload speed stays around 168 k.  Works  great with EQ - patches download nicely.</div></div><hr />
