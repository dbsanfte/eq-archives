<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kameg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am looking to get my Rogue Alt, his mask of Deception. Can a 49 Shaman with average Equipment (No JBB) Successfully hold the Assasin camp or should I bring a few friends.  <br />
Also Other than the Sea Furies (which are always camped) And the Spirocs (equally crowded) What is a good suggestion for decent solo exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Straif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes you can do it, just hope for not too many wizards.  Make some IU potions and head down to check it out.  I was able to get from dead zone all the way there and back solo, one night when no one was there.  Im level 45 and I dont have very great equipment.</div></div><hr />
