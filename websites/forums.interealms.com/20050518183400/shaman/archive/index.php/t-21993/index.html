<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Recently I've bought a new PC which is a huge upgrade to my last one which died last tuesday. This new one seems to be crashing quite randomly and restarting and crashing while playing EQ (the messege where it asks you to send the data of the crash to SoE then boots you to the desktop), i've reinstalled all the drivers and made sure they're up to date, checked for viruses and am activley using a firewall (zonealarm from zonelabs.com). <br />
<br />
Any advice as to what to do would be greatly appreciated, heres my computer spec: <br />
<br />
3200 Mhz 64 bit AMD Athlon processor <br />
1024 MB DDR RAM <br />
Raedon 9600 SE AGP 128 MB <br />
Creative 5.1 Sound Blaster Live! <br />
Direct X 9.0a <br />
120 gig HD<br />
<br />
Windows XP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">its not the computer.<br />
<br />
its DX 9<br />
<br />
install the new dx 9 over, there is a program to uninstall it i forgot what its called, but, installing dx9 again will fix your woes.</div></div><hr />

EQ has problems with Some firewalls you may want to check that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I use Zone Alarm and have no problems with it.<br />
<br />
I think KuthMcdonough is right you should be using Direct X9b not 9a.<br />
<br />
Also you might want to update your graphics drivers with the new Catalyst software.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have had some issues with Radeon 9600 pro, wich includes crash on start up and random freezing (usually in PoK).<br />
<br />
It was a while it happened the last time, maybe because i have latest drivers just installed...<br />
<br />
Hope you get it to work.</div></div><hr />
