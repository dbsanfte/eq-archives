<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>EQShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi.<br />
<br />
We all know about EQShaman.com, and that it hasn't been updated since Velious.<br />
<br />
Well I've been given the oppertunity to revive this website, and would like to take the oppertunity, with help from any interested community members.<br />
<br />
<br />
Im aiming for something similar to the also-recent www.EQMages.com ,with some fairly decent scripts and the same kind of useability.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, if anyone wants to help its very welcome, and if anyone has any general guides/hunting guides/quest guides/farming guides or hints they want to submit that would be fantastic - or if people just give us permission to use their guides that have been posted here.<br />
<br />
<br />
Will keep you all informed of the sites progress.</div></div><hr />

I believe its same person who owns these forums?<br />
<br />
Unsure though, it isn't me if thats what you mean. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PHP is the way to go, definately. Take a look at www.EQMages.com - aiming for that kind of content architecture and functionality, with extras, of course. :)<br />
<br />
Revamp hasn't started yet, starting today probably, will keep you all informed on progress front.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As I understand EQshaman.com is actually owned by Yantis.<br />
If this is correct I personally dont think anyone from this forum should contribute to the new site etc.<br />
Dont have a problem with the ad on this forum but to actually actively have anything to do with something that is the property of Yantis I think would be wrong.<br />

fact is, you cant get on EQshaman on ANY level as long as we have that banner on the top right. Your a hipocrite if you do. Period.<br />
<br />
You can protest it all you want, you can claim to be against for sure, but by posting here you make yourself null and viod for any defense about how EQshaman is owned by IGE so you wont post there.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
I just wanted to set up a Shaman equivalent of (the non-forum side of) sites like www.EQMages.com and www.EQDiva.com <br />
<br />
Setting up one around EQShaman.com has some serious benefits:<br />
<br />
1)Its quite a well known site with some existing traffic. Whats the point in going to the trouble if nobody will use it?<br />
<br />
2)EQShaman.com is number 1 in google for EverQuest Shaman. Again, it will get used. The domain is also linked to from a lot of EQ sites still, and is easy to remember.<br />
<br />
3)Its already got SOME stuff to work with, much easier to work with that than to start from scratch.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now lets look at the alternative:<br />
<br />
1)A site goes up, has a lot of work put in, for a couple of weeks it gets used, then fades into obscurity and the traffic dissapears. This also means nobody contributing content. So a lot less updates.<br />
<br />
2)The site would have to be hosted somewhere. This either means me or someone else fronting a cost we can't afford, or free webspace. Obviously free webspace isnt really an option.<br />
<br />
3)The site would have to request donations (which it wouldn't get, being only a rather local content site) or advertise much more heavily than that tiny banner on the front page to pay bandwidth costs. (The same banner as these forums carry I believe?)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hopefully you wont hold the host against the site... PS: I am no Yantis employee or anything, just been given the oppertunity to revive EQShaman.com</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>illitian icerage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Just having a link to the forums would be sufficient I believe.<br />
<br />
Or a link to the Medicine Cabinet.<br />
<br />
Seriously though, these forums have answered everything that a young Shaman (or even a veteran Shaman) would ask.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Absolutely no links from the Crucible to EQShaman. If a thread author would like their work posted there, that is their choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>illitian icerage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">No Glori that's not what I meant.<br />
<br />
What I meant is links from eqshaman.com to the Crucible forums/Medicine Cabinet.<br />
<br />
Hell, have a &quot;Search the Crucible&quot; link that leads to the search button (if there is a seperate page for that?) I think would be enough.<br />
<br />
The number of posts and alotted information on these Forums could, and in my mind, should, not be put on a website without their consent. It was only a misunderstanding of what I said.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2) EQShaman.com wont feature forums. These are the shaman forums. It will feature hunting info, farming info, possibly quests in the style of EQMages.com where you see guides by level and rating etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Way to aim low. Theres no way you could fail to make a site like eqmages. EQdiva looks a little better although its just as plain, but it also looks like they used a php-nuke clone to set up their site. So your aiming for a crappy site that looks like it was designed by a high school student taking web authoring classes from a teacher who teaches 4 periods of math and 2 computer related courses. Or a cooky cutter site whos biggest challenge in creation was the author trying to figure out how to decompress his tar file on a linux host. Well eqdiva has a windows based host it looks like so maybe not =p<br />
<br />
Just make sure there's lots of banners and pop ups $</div></div><hr />

And after a good 2-3 weeks you can find all that back in one of those nice guides Yantis sells.<br />
<br />
No thank you. I pass on this one.<br />
If I need Quest info or if I want to post quest info I will go the the Safehouse, At least they are Yantis free.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess you misunderstood me as well.<br />
<br />
I didn't say a link to some new Shaman forums, but just a link to these [Crucible] forums.<br />
<br />
There is not a single thing that I have wanted to know that I haven't been able to find out from this forum. That was my point, and I'm not asking for anything special.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Mmm, I think Yantis is on a beach somewhere drinking umbrella drinks and cavorting with the native women.

Well EQshaman IS owned by him so you do in some way have something to do with him. While the offer to you maynot have been made stright from his mouth. His hand is in there someplace most likely throug an employee of his.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">EQShaman, I know you're probably thinking we're all a bunch of pricks for being so hostile to this idea. But the thing is...most people tie www.eqshaman.com to Yantis in one way or another. Right about now I'd wager that calling someone Yantis on this forum is a little worse than calling them a worthless piece of **** who bought their character straight off playerauctions and represents all that we hate in the world. Only a little though...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">chill out guys.. :)<br />
<br />
ok eqshaman.com is no longer a &quot;free of adv&quot; site.. worst, it's owned by someone with a &quot;bad&quot; reputation... but one thing to remember is that there was always a link to the &quot;crucible&quot; there and it's still there, so there is always some hope. :)<br />
<br />
if someone wants to &quot;update&quot; the website, there should be no trouble with that.. just don't go there if you don't like it, don't mention it if you don't want to hear about it.. but at least don't stop him for wanting to do something. damn.. it's only a website! what worst can be done beside increasing the size of the IGE banner, it's already there and there is not much we can do against it :(<br />
<br />
true.. eqshaman is mostly outdated, but I'm pretty sure that all the informations that will be updated there are already known and can be found anywhere on the web.<br />
<br />
want spell info ? http://interealms.com/shaman/spells.htm<br />
want map info? www.eqatlas.com, www.eqmaps.com<br />
want hunting guide info? http://interealms.com/shaman/guides/index.html<br />
want epic guide? http://interealms.com/shaman/epic.htm<br />
want AA guide? http://interealms.com/shaman/guides/aa-chart.html<br />
want PL guide? http://eqpl.net<br />
want tradeskill info? www.eqtraders.com<br />
want item info? www.allakhazam.com<br />
want UI info? http://eqinterface.com<br />
etc... etc...<br />
<br />
so what if someone wants to compile (one more time) what has already been compiled on other sites related to shaman (like this one)? let him do the work if he wants to and see how the same information can be displayed from someone else point of view :)<br />
<br />
i'll even give ya a tip here.. go get a webtool like HTTrack Website Copier (http://www.tucows.com/preview/193804.html), then copy www.eqmages.com on your harddrive, use your html editor, replace &quot;mage&quot; by &quot;shaman&quot; and tadammmmmmm , work done :)<br />
<br />
don't need to thank me for saving you time and effort, ain't we &quot;shaman united&quot; ? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I personally think if you really arn't associated with IGE you should get a contract stating that the information supplied by the player base wont be sold or used to make money, or supply some kind of copywrite agreement to make sure the owners of their walkthoughs and sugggestions can prevent a money whore from using their hard work to get rich. I'm a big supporter of OSS and freedom of information, but I know this would be abused by yantis and ige to make a quick buck.<br />
<br />
Step 1) get community to make pimp shaman site<br />
Step 2) Cast cripple and make it pay to see the really good content and add the good content onto those ripoff guides<br />
step 3) ??<br />
Step 4) profit.<br />
<br />
On a side note, that eqmages website doesn't look good at all in terms of design. You should really concider finding or buying a good designer (i'm sure yantis has the cash. If not, maybe he can dupe some)</div></div><hr />

Problem is your dealing with people that dont fully grasp what it means to be a webmaster. Its all fine and dandy to have theoretical ethics, but there is a point where you have to be logical and decide whats more important.<br />
<br />
Fact is, if its a choice to having that banner there or losing another resource for everquest/shaman then i think its a simple one.  Though i must admit that some of these attitudes and replies are pretty funny when you look up at the top right of this forum and think about it. /shrug</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some people missed the point in referencing www.eqmages.com - I want that functionality. You click hunting and up comes 50 or so hunting guides, you can sort these by level, and see ratings before you click. You click one, it loads up, theres the hunting guide, a zone map, a direct link to the alla quest list for the zone, the alla mob list for the zone. Then theres something to rate the page and to post comments.<br />
<br />
<br />
I can't think of any improvements to this functionality for hunting guides.<br />
<br />
<br />
I use this site for my mage, and having those direct links to zone info, for example, is a really really nice touch that you wouldn't get on forums without someone having to look up 3 links every single time a guide is posted etc.</div></div><hr />

Who really cares.  Content is greater than presentation.  Dress up crap and it's still crap.  A site doesn't need to be laiden with idiotic flash animations and other glitz to be good.  A clear and functional layout with good content is far superior.<br />

yea i'm kinda in the same boat. The stuff in the cabinet and archives pretty much covers most of everquest. For everything else there's allakhazam and lucy. find a new spin on content and sure it could be groovy.</div></div><hr />

Not agreeing with him, just saying that is what he meant.<br />
<br />
I used that site once, and after I found these boards I don't think I went back. Basically you could just cut and paste everything said on here and that could be your site? heh, really what I mean is that most of the info on here regarding aa's, xp spots, spells, gear, guides, everything said, is useful and what helps a shaman out. I personally do not like IGE and all that ****, but thats life. I don't like alot of things, alot of advertising etc. Atleast its not popups..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Haagen, yea, we're just as tied to Yantis/IGE as the first poster because we read forums where IGE advertises. I mean, everyone knows that Sunmoon was absolutely PUSHED into accepting the deal, we were all behind him 100%! Plus, IGE/Yantis owns this place, right? So visiting the boards it is a direct show of our support for them! We're all guilty hypocritical pieces of crap!!11oneoneeleven!<br />

Or not. It's cool Sunmoon is getting something in return for all the work he's put into The Crucible over the years, but he was by NO MEANS pushed into accepting the advertisement. Many were opposed to it, and many more told him is was fine with them even though they dislike IGE. That company owns two things here, jack and ****. They advertise, and they pay Sunmoon a nice little sum of money to do it. Paying to advertise =! OWNING a website (Own is the correct term, much love Junder).<br />
