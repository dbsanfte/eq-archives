<br />
Sweet job Juujuu.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have updated my icons.<br />
Also, spell gems have been modified to match the spell icons!<br />
It's not complete, but I like it much better currently than the icons Verant has given us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Malaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">very nice :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mordaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Juujuu, I tried using yours and they are just really messed up looking. All purplish with odd vertical lines going through them. Is there a particular color bit depth I should be using?</div></div><hr />

Thanks Juujuu!  These icons are great.  I'd post your links, but want to let you do it.<br />
<br />
Pub13 is down atm guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I like it - thanks JuuJuu -<br />
<br />
but I notice that the link works differently in IE and in Netscape ...  <br />
<br />
in IE I see the icons, and have had troble saving the file and getting it to work.<br />
<br />
In Netscape I see gibberish - err, I mean programming language - and have no trouble saving the file and copying it ot the UI directory<br />
<br />
Thanks again</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Walgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Very cool.<br />
<br />
I will actually use the new UI again now.<br />
Was going to stick to the old one as I didn't want to have to learn my spellbook all over again.<br />
<br />
Now I only have to reshuffle due to more spells on the one page than there should be :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You can just leave the bottom spells blank and make it just like it was.<br />
<br />
I love the changes to the interface, you people must have been the kind that kept burning candles instead of that new fangled thing called ELECTRICITY.<br />
<br />
(no offense to Juujuu I think the labeled spell icons are pretty nifty, but I'm kind of getting used to the new ones)</div></div><hr />

EQ is probably keeping your default clean.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I don't know much about uploading and downloading files relating to why those files look so odd in IE and Netscape.  I know that when I view them myself, IE has to load a quicktime plugin just to view the TGA files.  Save the files to your hard drive somewhere, and open them up with photoshop or some other program that can edit tga graphical files.<br />
<br />
I know that the new icons have unique looks to them, and that with getting use to them, what I've done isn't really necessary.  Personally though, after 3 years of being used to the old icons, I don't really want to change to the pansy ass pastal colored new graphics, for the most part.  Some of the graphics I like more like clarity and the hooded skull, but some of them are just so.........well, look at BMB to see what I'm trying to say.  Pink heart!  Sheesh!<br />
<br />
If you check the brell message board I linked, you'll see someone by the name of Thomas King (T King) who's a graphic artist.  He's been doing some kickass icon designs that will hopefully be ready soon.<br />
<br />
As for people with problems with downloading my icons, when i go home today, I'll save my icons to a jpg file so you can see what they all look like, and I'll upload all the files up to my website as a zip file.  Check back in about 40 minutes from now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Found a little bug in your icons. Shrieker Slow thats cast by shrooms in fungus grove shows up as haste when cast on you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">it does that with the new icons as well, although you can see that it's a slow because of the red border, which shows that it's a detrimental spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">That's not a bug in my icons.  That's a bug in Verant's programming.  /bug it.  Another bug I've found is that the fungal regen icon from the stick the shroom king drops is a heal icon instead of a regen icon.  /bug that too.  The bard song Cantana of replenishment I think it's called is a heal icon too.  I don't know if it should be heal or regen, but it doesn't matter either way to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Impetus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Amazing Job!<br />
<br />
FYI: Primal Essence (+20 to melee stats) appears as a Haste icon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>SisterLi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Just because it's new, doesn't mean it is improved. =P<br />
<br />
The main problem with the new icons is that they prictures are too busy - and detail blurs together at high resolutions.<br />
<br />
Take a look at the icons at 1600 X 1200 - Just oddly colored blurs.  <br />
<br />
This is a big problem for the spell casting icons, as those are the ones you need to be able to distinquish and use quickly in a fight.  My understanding is that the size of the spell cast icons appears to be hard coded -- meaning at 1600 X 1200 you nay can change the size of the spell cast icons.  That's not such a big deal for buffs -- although it does make it challenging to figure out if torpor is still up -- but is a huge problem for spell casting.  <br />
<br />
Anyone figured out a way to make the spell cast icons and the spell book bigger at top resolutions?  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Nice job Juujuu in making icons that are distinquishable at a glance.  <br />
