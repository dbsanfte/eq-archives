<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>fudorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With the advent of PoP, LoY, and SoL, a lot of people seem to have forgotten that there are other places to hunt, primarily solo.<br />
<br />
When I can't get a group (and with the glut of people that get slow/sow/heals/buffs, seems to be fairly often) I tend to like to solo in areas that are fairly empty.<br />
<br />
On a run to Old Sebilis for a group, I conned a few of the spectrals in TT along the way.  And amazingly, they were about 75/25 db/lb to a 54 shaman.  These are such easy kills it isn't even funny.  The best xp spots I have found are the 3 ruins right near the zone in from EJ.<br />
<br />
With KEI, the pulling is faster, but I can't say it is any easier.  My technique is pretty much standard.  Summon pet, hit with Spirit quickening (these guys are weak in melee.  major buffs are a waste of mana, for the most part), make sure I have regrowth up, pull with e-bolt, root, hit with epic dot, sit down next to dog, and when I finally get hit with a spell, dog goes in and finishes things.  Could be done faster with 2 e-bolts, or stacked with plague, etc, but again, not enough of a difference to matter, esp if you go in without kei.  About 90% of the spawn are spectral keepers, and they all cast.  The higher db cons can dispell, so be ready for that.<br />
<br />
The other 10% of the spawn are spectral champions and spectral commanders.  Both pure melee, both with relatively weak melee (70-80 doubles).  Pretty much standard kill techniques.  Either root and rot if you feel like sitting, or pull with slow, buff self, and melee using dog for dot.<br />
<br />
Loot isn't great, but is, imo, above par compared to some group situations.  Avg of 4.5pp per drop, plus words, runes, etc, gems along the lines of black pearl, flawless aquamarines, etc (roughly 12-14pp ea), and, supposedly, the occasional spell drop, which I have yet to see.<br />
<br />
Considering the ease of the kill, the loot, and the fact that, 1 or 20, they do not assist each other, this is, imo, a very neglected hunting area for those in their low 50's.  Especially for those of us that do not have LoY, and don't feel like waiting hours to get a group in the planes.</div></div><hr />

I have done this as well.  I spent a couple weeks here with my warrior.  Nice xp, and no one bothers you.  So if you hate those cluttered and overcrowded zones this is a nice alternative.</div></div><hr />

Do you recall respawn time there?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

The respawn time was roughly 20 minutes... maybe a little less.  Just enough time to take out all 3 ruins, re-med to full, and re-start the cycle.</div></div><hr />
