<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lynnara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi everyone.  :)  Snazzy new look to the site... it's good to clear things out once in a while.  <br />
<br />
Was wondering if any PvPers or frequent duelers had any advice regarding the most effective dueling methods for shaman.   I'm considering helping start a &quot;combat ladder&quot; with my guild and allies just to spice things up a bit, but I very rarely duel.  <br />
<br />
My first bout will most likely be against either another shaman (higher level... she'll kick my a$$) or a paladin.<br />
<br />
I am currently lvl 51 barbarian shaman with (unbuffed of course) 750AC and 1105HP (before anyone flames me for having crap stats, please realize I am a recovering wis fiend and have only been working on AC since my high 40s!).  <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance, and happy hunting to all.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Umelia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Some things that will help a great deal. <br />
<br />
1) Invis [Cloudy (Invis) Potion will save a spell gem] the second you go Invisable the loose you in every way If a caster has you targeted....not anymore) get behind and Root &amp; Rot em. <br />
<br />
2) Blind [don't forget to move after you cast]  Melee can't hit. Casters can't cast {refer to #1 here casters can make a hot key or type /cast #}. <br />
<br />
3) Cancle Magic [Pumice Stones will save a spell gem] This is for those pesky self buffers.<br />
<br />
4)Black Fur Boots [If You have em] Make SoW your first buff, when debuffed, Re-click.<br />
<br />
5)Lower level spells [Spirit Strike as a minimum] Quick casting DD's make great spell interuptors {they cast faster thatn the Wiz BooMers} As well as lowering your interuption rate a bit.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll add more if I think of any.<br />

<br />
heh,what are you talking about?of course a caster can cast.and for melee,that's even worse,they can hit you even when you standing behind them.(in range of course)<br />
<br />
try it out !<br />
<br />
i agree on using blind.<br />
if your opponent's MR is low enough to stick it.just send pet and blind from start to end is very good.it used to show the green connection status ,but now it's all gone,total darkness.only sound</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Riokhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yep smart casters make hot keys for their spells. So if you blind them they don't care. They just hit their hot key nuking you butt or whatever else they need to do to kill you.<br />
<br />
And yep keep your distance from a melee as much as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Don't sweat about duelling another shaman higher than you.  I duelled a shaman 2 levels higher than me, and he has his epic while I do not.  It was a close fight, but I managed to win.  Barely.  Soon as I saw he was dead I had to mem Disinfecting Aura and cast ASAP asn I had 2 disease DoTs on me.<br />
<br />
Basically I tried to keep him blinded, get behind him and smack him around while casting Blast of Poison.  I used Blast of Poison cause it is quick casting.  I did not even bother with DoTs in the duel.  Too slow casting.  I did get Malosi on him after the first Blinding Luminance.<br />
<br />
We duelled with no pets.<br />
<br />
So it is not impossible for a lower level shaman to beat a higher level one, but it is tough.  BTW, this was a level 52 vs level 54.</div></div><hr />
