<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">turn OFF bard song effects? I like some of the new effects but I just can't keep them on when a bard is around. Their song effects drive me nuts. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Racknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think the /spelleffects off turns off the bard songs, not sure about it's other spell effects though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
i think if you leave /showspelleffects on and then in the options window (cntrl+O) under 'filters' tab you can turn bard songs off, i usually play with most spell effects off anyways, so im not 100pct sure if that works for you. but give it a try!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have disabled any bard song. I see the spell effects but no text and since i NEVER keep my short duration buff window open then I pretty much can't tell if there is a bard in grp or not i still get afefcted but i don't bother with the twisting spam.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">for some odd reason the only way to turn off bard particals is the text line command of  /showspelleffects off <br />
the setting in the options window turns every thing off but the blue bard crap<br />
<br />
i reinstalled a month ago .. took me a week to figure that out, blue bard crap was driving me crazy on raids</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">how about, is there anyone way to play with the old spell effects?  I like the new ones, and the frame rate is smooth as glass 99% of the time.  However the second something like a dragon AE's my computer basically takes a nose dive.<br />
<br />
The old spell effects where fine though, and I kinda liked them too.  <br />
<br />
Playing with no spell effects isnt an option.</div></div><hr />
