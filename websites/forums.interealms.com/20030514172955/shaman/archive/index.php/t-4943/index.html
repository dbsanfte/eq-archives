<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dross</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, I go on this Hole Raid to meet my new buddy Kirn but there's a development.   There's already a shaman there to do Kirn but he only needs the faction, not the drop!  So, I get there and after laying the smack down on him, I'm able to loot the ring.  Yay!<br />
<br />
Obviously, I did not receive the Truespirit faction that the Kirn turn in provides so my question is this:  What type of faction do I need in order to do the next turn in?   Is it safe for me to just max out true spirit and then follow the steps as stated?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Best way I've found is to repeat the Woe/Envy turn ins in West Karana.  Do this till you max your faction out (about 10 times) and you should be good to go.<br />
<br />
I did every step of my epic, with no MQ'ing involved.  I Pl'd my faction with Woe and Envy to make sure nothing would go wrong... and I messed up anyway.  Some how I attacked Neh'Ashiir.  It was recoverable, and I hold the epic.  (much rejoicing).</div></div><hr />
