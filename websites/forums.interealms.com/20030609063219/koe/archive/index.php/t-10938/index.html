<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Daelen Mindreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Cold light shone through slits high on the walls of the dark, vaulted chamber, dust motes drifted lazily down the beams as leaves flowing down a gurgling brook.  The glow of candle light barely illuminated the the papers in front of the hunched and pale elf as he feverishly scribbled notes, glancing occassionally over his shoulder, an expectant if resigned look of impending doom on his face.<br />
<br />
A tumultuous clanging of bells broke the silence. Bolting from his stool the harried elf looked about shock and panic etched on his face.  A disembodied voice boomed through the fading echoes of the bells &quot;Daerlen, please come to my office.. I need to see you&quot;.<br />
<br />
Shoulders slumped the elf shuffled for the door on the far side of the chamber.  As he approached the door, the thickly muffled sound of bolts being drawn back and chains being undone could be heard through the heavy iron bound door.  It opened with a squeel of little used, and ill maintaned hinges. The guards on either side of the door grinned at each other, sharing a silent joke between them as if they knew what awaited the haggard elf at his destination.<br />
<br />
On and on down the dark passage he trundled, with each passing step the weight of what awaited him in the office at the end of the hall pressed down on him, for surely he was walking to his doom.  He paused at the door, indecision and wariness warring with each other in the expressions on his face.  Slowly he pushed the door open.  Dark oily smoke oozed from the chamber beyond, pungent cloying scents forcing their way into his nostrils and mouth, forcing him to cough and sputter as he entered.<br />
<br />
Gathered around a massive desk at the far side of the room stood his compatriots who earlier had been summoned one by one... Brief surprise registered on his face before he was able to once again don the mask of feigned disinterest that he must wear as armor for he whom he was approaching.<br />
<br />
The man behind the desk silently motioned the elf forward and handed him a sealed envelope as he reached the desk.  Trying not to let his hands shake he accepted the envelope and looked up at the man again wishing ferverently that he had the power to remove himself at once from the room.  &quot;What is this?&quot; Daerlen asked huskily of the man, his voice cracked and rough from disuse.  &quot;Open it&quot; the man rumbled in response.<br />
<br />
With evident trepidation Daerlen coaxed the flap of the envelope open and a small piece of partchment fluttered to the ground. He bent and retrieved the paper and looked at it.<br />
<br />
The words scribed on the  parchment brought a look of puzzlement to the face of the wizard. &quot;Boss what's this about?&quot;, he asked the man behind the desk.<br />
<br />
&quot;You've done it my boy... You and your team have earned the reward contained in the envelope... Take it and go... leave this place and do not come back until tomorrow... Beginning now mandatory overtime, late nights working over broken code, dinner at your desk etc.. all these things have come to an end.... Go now.. earn your rest but I expect you all back tomorrow morning bright and early so temper your celebrations&quot; he said sternly.<br />
<br />
Broad grins erupted on the faces of the men and women gathered around the desk.  Realization that the months of seemingly endless work were over dawned on the face of the haggard elf.. &quot;Lets roll&quot; said the elf as he gathered his strength and strolled out through the door and into the passage beyond.. once again his shoulders squared and head held high...<br />
<br />
Looking up as he walked, the elf winked and said aloud to nobody in particular &quot;See you all soon in Norrath&quot;</div></div><hr />
