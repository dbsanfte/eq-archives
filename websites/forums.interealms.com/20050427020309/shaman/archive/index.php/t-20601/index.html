<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jumgurorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am 3 blues away from 61 and already have 3 x 61 spells, and 3 x 62 spells in the bank.<br />
<br />
My question is that I have not spent that much time in the Planes at all and was curious if anyone could recommend some good zones to spend more time in. I belong to a small but tight-kint guild and all of us have 60+ mains.<br />
<br />
Any ideas at all would be very appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Since you did not mention if you are looking to solo or group as well as not posting your magelo, I will try to recall what I did 60+.<br />
<br />
At 60, I was AA grinding at LC/RC ( left castle, right castle as called on Karana ) in PoD.  I did this so that I could purchase Canni V.  Once I achieved my goal, [ this was when you needed flags for tier 2/ tier 3 ] I looked for a PoJ trials group so that I could xp in PoV.  I usually got a group in inner or outer ( the razor cave ), and I grinded there all the way to 65.  Once I purchased all my 65 spells, I headed to BoT once I was flagged for it.  <br />
<br />
Here is a breakdown of the tier 1, 2, and 3 zones.<br />
<br />
Plane of Nightmare:<br />
  At your level, you could solo the yard trash, hunt the nightstalkers, join a hobgoblin group, a lower exit group, or gargoyles.<br />
<br />
A popular camp is the waterfall.  When you enter PoN, just run left facing the grassy wall, and you will hit the waterfall.  There are a few static spawns here.  Spiders hit hard and fast - I think the birds do as well, so make sure you have decent ac/hp.<br />
<br />
Another popular camp is the hobgoblins.  Facing the grassy wall from GY, you run right along the zone wall - with levi and invis.  There are some mobs that see through invis, so you should be careful.  This will take you to the river, but do not cross it yet.  Run along the edge until you see a mob ahead of you - usually a raven - and a group of rocks I think.  This is your crossing place.  Why?  There are crocs in the river, and you could train yourself or a group ( if they are camping hobgoblins ).  Once you make it across, this is basically your camp spot for hobgoblins.  You should see them to your left when you were crossing the river.  Also, this is the path you take to lower exit, the maze event, as well as The Lair of TT.  Possible the Gargoyles as well - I never camped them, but I know of a few people camping them the 65 in my old guild.<br />
<br />
You might see a lot of druids charming Nightstalkers.  This was popular camp spot on Karana for the xp as well as loot.  They dropped some gems as well as blue diamonds if I recall. <br />
<br />
Plane of Disease:<br />
<br />
The best camp spots in this zone is:<br />
<br />
LC/RC:  this camp is a great place for xp.  I lived here from 55 - 60 when I could get a group.  I was able to gain a level a night per a 3/4 hour session.  Mostly you will be killing bugs here.  They are mostly SKs if I recall, and they will HT, snare, etc you.  Depending on your group's dps, your puller should pull crawlers as well as the two magus' at the castle door.  There is an outcropping that you can make your camp at.  The easiest way is to invis to LC/RC, but there are some mobs that can see through invis - spiders for one.<br />
<br />
Castle:  This place has awesome xp, and this was a popular place for people to solo back in the day.  I grouped here a few times as well.  The castle is where Grummus lives.  Also, this place has decent loot.<br />
<br />
Flies:  This is a decent solo spot.  There is a rock group that you can pull to.  There are a few sets of flies you can pull from.  You might see a druid here charming a rat killing.  The flies on the right of the rocks are 60s - they dispell and a pain in the ass.  The flies straight from the rocks will be blue to you, and the xp is so-so.  There are more flies on a second island, straight and to the left on the rock - if you go to the end of the penisula, you should see the second island with flies.  Be careful here tho, rats tend to hide in the water, and you could have an add or two.  Sometimes you cannot see a fly, and they could add on you as well.<br />
<br />
Plane of Innovation:<br />
<br />
Just kill.  The zone loops into a large circle.  Most likely, you will see a group pulling at zone in.  If not, you can make your camp here - but be aware of trains.  Or, you can just pick left or right and kill around the circle.  Make sure that your party will be with you for a while because it will take a while to complete a circle.<br />
<br />
Plane of Justice:<br />
<br />
At your level, the best place for you is in the basement killing enforcers I would think.<br />
<br />
Tier 2:<br />
<br />
PoS:<br />
  Mainly, this place is a haven for soloers.  Also, you will need to come to this zone if you wish to complete your BoT key.  Please note that you only need to do this if your guild is working on Planar Progression.  There are three different types of giants here: forest, desert, and ocean.  To complete your BoT key, you need the following:  A giant head, a sash( forest ), beard( ocean ), and bone( desert ), as well as two medallions ( must be unique - forest, ocean, and desert has mini and bosses that drop them.  I think the mini drop three, and the bosses drop five. <br />
<br />
PoV:<br />
<br />
Popular with the groups.  There are a few camps in this zone.<br />
<br />
Inner:  this can be a killer camp with the chance of a named boss spawning.<br />
<br />
Outer: killing razors on the path up the the first chamber of cave if I recall correctly.  Inner usually takes the mobs from the path out of the first chamber and all of the &quot;main&quot; inner chamber.<br />
<br />
WW/EW:  West Wall and East Wall are nice places as well.  There are golems, crawlers, and spiders here.  Some of the mobs cannot be snared or rooted, so you have to be on your toes if you get an add.  It is hard to see these mobs at times due to their crystalline coloring.  From the GY, you want to go past the building and run to the water.  You should have levi and invis.  Follow the river until you get to a building, and follow the edge of the building to a door.  The mobs in here should con indifferent to you, but you need to be careful of undead traps.  Four skellies could spawn on your way to this building.  Back to this building, there is a stairway you climb, and there is a ramp you follow to the second half to the building, follow the stairs down, and you should see a large door similar to the one you entered before.  On the side of this building is WW/EW.<br />
<br />
North East Wall/ Dragon Wall:  Continuing from the EW side, you can travel to the zone wall and follow it north until you find a decent spot to camp.  Be careful as you run to this camp - some mobs can see invis.  If you continue following the wall, you will come to the castle in which AD is housed.<br />
<br />
Dragon Wall:  Besides being the home of AD, groups can camp by the door and pull mobs from the surrounding area.<br />
<br />
CoD:<br />
<br />
Most of the time, groups will camp the entrance to the zone.  If you have a strong group, you can fight your way to past the river thingy, up the stairs and to the left to this little room.  If you are familiar with the Carprin Cycle, the room should be familiar to you.  I remember this being a great place for xp, expecially if you have a pally and necro in your group.  Necro charms a mob and Pally undead crits makes this a nice spot.<br />
<br />
There are more camps here, but these are usually the places I have been to.  I think I camped the rats once.<br />
<br />
Torment:<br />
<br />
I never xped in this zone.  The only reason I zone in is to kill Saryrn.<br />
<br />
Tactics:  You need to be flagged for this zone, and this is accomplished from killing the MB in PoInnovation.  For the most part, I only zone into tactics for raids, but there are a few camps here.  The lower arena area is a common spot to xp.  You might see chanters soloing in the arena.<br />
<br />
Tier 3:<br />
<br />
HoH:<br />
<br />
On Karana, there are a few camps here.  GY, H1, H2, SE Upper/Lower, NE Upper/Lower.<br />
<br />
In GY, you will see some people soloing mobs from zone in.<br />
<br />
H1 - Hero 1 - this was a great spot for group / solo xp.  To get to this camp, invis, run straight, make the first left, follow to end, make a left, follow to you get to an intersection, make a left, follow to an intersect, make a left, make a right when you see the temple/shine.  This is Hero 1.<br />
<br />
If you continue to go straight instead of turning to h1, you will hit SE Upper.  This is guarded by some Kitties, so you cannot miss it.  We usually camp in far right corner and pull til we drop.  You can go downstairs, and this will lead to Lower.<br />
<br />
H2 is more of a pain to get to, so if this place is camped, most likely the zone is hopp'n.  The initial route is the same as it was for H1, but once you come to the second intersection, you make a right, and continue to make rights until you see a temple.  There is a camp spot on the grass and pull the temple.  [ I could be wrong with the instructions, been a long time since I camped here ]<br />
<br />
NE Upper/Lower:  Lower has Undead, so I would be careful if you wish to head down there.  This is where RD is if you wish to do the HoH trials.  <br />
<br />
BoT:<br />
<br />
On Karana, there are a few camps here: West, Inner/Outer/Middle North, Inner/Outer East, Inner/Outer/Middle South.  Each wing is a different element.  The named in East, Oreen, drops our class' leg pattern.  The sleeves and bracer drops from Middle South, and the gloves drop off the named bee in West.  Each Boss drops a ring that you can use to enter the towers.  Mobs in each wing drop a gem that you need to add to your ring to grant access.  Typically, I would be very careful camping outer because of trains.  Trains are a common occurance in BoT.  Many people have dubbed it KC 2.0.  Now, if it was not for the loot that drops here, I would have lived in HoH.<br />
<br />
I never came to tier three until I was 65.  The reason for this is simple, it was hard for me to find groups here.  At lower levels, resists of malosinia/slow could be deadly for a group.  People will tell you different, and by all means do what you want, this is what I did personally.<br />
<br />
As for the Towers, there are four towers, and the one that is most interesting for us is Lightning.  The boss here, Thunderclap, drops the tunic pattern as well as the Cap of Drowned Souls.  A very nice cap if I may say so.  Each of these Bosses drops a symbol that you can use to gain access to the Agnarr event.  Mobs in the towers drops gems that you add to your symbol.  The Agnarr ring is one per raid, but the Tower ring/key is one per group.<br />
<br />
Courtyard - I forgot to mention this place.  A lot of people tend to hunt here as well.  I know I duoed here quite a few times.  To get to the courtyard, there are portals in each of the inner camps ( this is were the wing boss spawns ).  These portals lead you to the courtyard.  Once you enter there, you will see an object sticking out of the floor, this is the way to get to Agnarr.  Never, never, never touch this - if you do, you will aggro the room if you do not have the agnarr key.<br />
<br />
I think this should at least give you a taste of the first three tiers.<br />
<br />
Good Luck, and Have fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">nice reply, Korelen.  I started out thinking you were only going to deal with tier 1, and you expounded very well.  Very well done.  I couldn't offer much if any other commentary.  You covered it all well.</div></div><hr />

HoH:<br />

<br />
In GY, you will see some people soloing mobs from zone in.<br />
<br />
H1 - Hero 1 - this was a great spot for group / solo xp.  To get to this camp, invis, run straight, make the first left, follow to end, make a left, follow to you get to an intersection, make a left, follow to an intersect, make a left, make a right when you see the temple/shine.

<br />
BoT:<br />

We were all young once, and I am a firm believer in &quot;sharing the wealth&quot; so to speak.  The main thing is to have fun, so I would try to xp in all the zones you can until you find something you and/or your group enjoys.  Once in a while you will want to mix it up.
