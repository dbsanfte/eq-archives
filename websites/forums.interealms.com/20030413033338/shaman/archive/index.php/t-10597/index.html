<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>iamagator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering if getting to, and killing the swordfish in SG is doable with the following group:  60 Mage w/epic pet, 55 shammy with epic (me), 55 SK (well equiped), 51 wizzie and 52 druid.  I have read several posts on this encounter and they seem to range from soloable at 55 to bring a small raid with you.  Anyone have any personal experience with this.  I have the above group at my disposal Wed. night and am hoping to finally get this darn piece.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kongming</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Eazy, soloable at 58 if you know where it is.  maybe even earlier.  just pull them and do. they don't hit all to hard.  Immune to snare/root btw</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Again, easy, probably soloable. I had a small low 50's group when we did the swordfish - we did the 2 in the lake, and the one up the side, until it dropped one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Korman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Do you think you guys could help me out with some information on SG in general and the mobs that drop the 7th shawl parts in particular?<br />
<br />
I know that I can get to SG through Cobalt Scar.  Is there another way there?  <br />
<br />
Will I be able to get the drops there at lvl 52?  I can probably get a 54 mage, and 57 warrior to go with me.  Is that sufficient force?<br />
<br />
Also, Once I zone in to SG, is the zone-in safe?  Where should I go to find Molkors, and swordfish?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any input.  Verdandi's guide at eqtraders is kind of vague on the SG part; excellent otherwise though!<br />
<br />
I've finally gotten my tradeskills up to par, i think.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>iamagator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the info - got my tooth last night.  Happened to be a 61 druid soloing in there and had charmed a walrus as a pet - he killed the swordfish for me and let me loot.  First one dropped it.  <br />
<br />
Wish me luck on the combines later tonight.</div></div><hr />
