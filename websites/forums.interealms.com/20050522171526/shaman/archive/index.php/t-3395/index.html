<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As has been discussed on this board ad absurdium, all of the shaman races have plusses and minuses. It appears generally agreed that no one race has an overwhelming advantage. <br />
<br />
So...<br />
<br />
Why are like roughly 75% (I'm guessing) of the shamans on most servers barbarians? I can understand why it seems that 90% of the Oracles are barbs, due to the exp penalty driving off folks, but why are even most lowby shamans barbs?<br />
<br />
If the races were truly balanced, one would think that barbs would be 20% of the population, rather than the overwhelming majority.<br />
<br />
One could even argue that the barbs are the worst race... no infravision, no regen, no unstunnability, no safefall, no sneak, no.... well lots of things. I'm not seriously arguing that barbs are really bad, but it is a puzzle to me why they are such the overwhelming majority. <br />
<br />
I guess it struck home when I hit 60 ( yay me! ) this weekend, and was told I was the fourth Iksar shaman on the server - and there are never fewer than 4 barb oracles on at any moment day or night....<br />
<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That's easy. If you haven't played EQ you know nothing about it, let alone the end game. So you pick a character that is good aligned so you won't have to deal with everyone hating you and plus they look cool too. Plus the only other choices at the time when I started was Ogre and Troll. Not knowing jack about regen, stamina advantages, unstunnability, it seemed an easy choice. Everyone was lower level then and the game was newer, no one could really advise someone on what would happen later on plus who knew you would play the game this long?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">At the time, the craze was wisdom and Barbs had the best available wisdom pool.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Most of the high level Barbarians started a shaman when there was no Iksars or Vah Shir. Back then, faction was important and most people didn't want to be KoS to 75% of the cities.<br />
<br />
Now a days,  faction matters a lot less and there are 2 more races to play. I think newer shamans are more often Iksar or Troll these days.</div></div><hr />

Newer shamans are *still* Barbarians.  I can't explain it, but it's the truth.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hrendra An'ei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Here's one from the perspective of someone who may be creating a shaman soon. :)  <br />
<br />
I play a lot of characters; I've tried every class except necro during my EQ lifetime, as it's too close to my main for me to enjoy currently. Shaman was one of the classes that I always wanted to try because I thought they had great potential. I made one, briefly, as a troll. <br />
<br />
However, I couldn't stand it--it seemed to take forever for skills to go up, and growing up in Innothule when I was a much poorer player was much rougher than it should have been. <br />
<br />
Thus, when looking at a new one this time around, I thought, what do I want to create? Barbarian is commonplace--and aside from my high elf cleric, I stay away from common race/class combos as best I can (it's just personal preference).  Ogres and trolls are 1) ugly, which in this game of fashion DOES affect our decisions, 2) bad faction, 3) large races, 4) lower int/wis.... <br />
<br />
A lot of people stop on 1) and don't go further. Vah Shir are &quot;cute&quot;, although I never got into them. Iksar are to me the most tolerable &quot;ugly race&quot; but you're in for a huge uphill faction battle. So..<br />
<br />
Personally, I chose Iksar. But a lot of people don't want to deal with faction. They want to take the ones with the highest starting wisdom. They want ones that can wear all of the class armor (Totemic, JB, are the ones I think of as a non-shaman). They want ones that have a high stamina, for better hp down the road. <br />
<br />
To me, there's one race that combines all of those--Barbarian. It's as safe a choice as high elf cleric, or wood elf druid, or barbarian warrior, or dark elf necromancer. *shrug* There's nothing wrong with ANY of those choices, of course. But I suspect if you take a cross-section of the classes and divide them by race, you'll find that there's a huge congregation of &quot;optimum race per class&quot;.  This isn't a &quot;there's a best type of shaman&quot; comment at all--but there's definitely a &quot;what many people think is the best type&quot; for classes, especially when people like me haven't played one and maybe haven't researched it fully. <br />
<br />
For shamans, barbarian is it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">As for me...  a friend suggested EQ to me, so I checked out web sites on it.  Like the looks, so I ordered a new vid card and EQ.  While I was waiting, I researched what classes I might want to play.... choices boiled down to a gnome enchater/tinkerer, and a barbarian shaman of Karana.  Didn't realize the diety restrictions, heh.  Since my friends were playing a monk &amp; a ranger, I went with the healer class.  Why Barbarian?  Because I preferred it over an Ogre or Troll.  Simple RP preference, I guess.  I didn't bother checking base stats, or worry about endgame playability - I simply preferred the barbarian over the other two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">As has been stated already, many people started their shamans when the only choices were Barb, Troll, and Ogre.  <br />
And since people just wanted to jump into the game and play it without worrying about faction penalties, Barb was the most popular choice.<br />
<br />
And, as snapdragn pointed out, it's a trend that has continued to this day, regardless of how much more we understand about the game.<br />
Faction is nowhere near as important as it has been . . . yet most people starting shamans choose Barbs.<br />
Racial abilities (like regen, infravision, etc.) have long since been discovered and add more flavor/interest in some's eyes (but truthfully have minimal overall impact) . . . yet still people choose Barbs.<br />
People know that Barbs are a dime a dozen (an irrelevant fact IMO, but some people think it seems to matter) . . . yet they are still the most popular choice.<br />
<br />
I cannot really explain why this is, but I can tell you, for me, I chose a Barb because they are what I think of when I picture a shaman.  Well, compared to the choices EQ offers that is.  Technically speaking, when I think of a shaman, I think of a bronzed-skin Native American human in animal hides with trinkets and charms dangling from his clothing.  But since humans could not be shamans in EQ, and since the Native American skin texture does not exist, I chose the closest thing -- Barbarian.<br />
<br />
If I had to do it over again, I'd still choose Barb.  If push came to shove, I might consider trying one of the regenning races to see for myself if it truly makes a difference (even though common sense tells me that, at most, the difference would be minimal).<br />
<br />
/shrug  Anyway, it's just one of those EQ things.  I have no shame or regret choosing Barb and I think they are a perfectly viable choice for the shaman class (just as all the others are).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">One reason, cause Barbs were the only non evil race 3 years ago.  They look better than a troll or oger also.<br />
<br />
Night vision isnt a big deal because we get Serpent Sight really early, followed by Ultravision, and to be honest that extra little regen you got doesnt help much.  Plus, back in the day there was an XP Penalty for Trolls.  <br />
<br />
Think it's bad just being a barb, try being one who didnt put points into Wisdom.<br />
<br />
I have to sacrifice a lot of mana to get AC up because Verant wont let us change our starting stats......   grrrrr</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">EDIT: Bah, I feel like such a noob. I was so busy trying to finish this while getting ready to go home from work that I posted it as a new thread rather than in reply to the post on why people picked Barbarians as their Shaman class. Sorry!<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
I picked a Barbarian Shaman for my partner class for lots of reasons.<br />
<br />
While regen is huge for Shaman, I can fix that with a Fungi and my own heals--and with FT items being easier to get for Paladins almost every day, my own mana is becoming less and less of an issue (35ac FT2 cloak, Earring of the Solstice, Mental Clarity 3 and Body and Mind Rejuvenation for not only an extra point of FT but an additional 500 or so hps at level 60, putting me at FT7 with just AAXP, an earring and a cloak).<br />
<br />
What about night vision you say? Velious quest bracer. 3k for Thurg, 5k for SS and 6-8k for Kael MQs on my server. There are a lot more farming spots available now with Luclin, so money is easier to get, but that depends on your server economy and your usual hunting party. <br />
<br />
I needed a class that could bank and travel to all the same places my Paladin could. That immediately ruled out all classes but Vah Shir and Barbarian. Vah Shir have 20 less STA than a Barbarian, and I wanted my Shaman to have the HPs to take a beating while helping me ghettomezz. I couldn't really care less about WIS. WIS is easy to get, but STA was difficult to get in high quantities. <br />
<br />
Those were my reasons :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Tada!  Merged it :)<br />
<br />
Oh, and I chose Barbarian because that is what my wife wanted to play.  She wanted a Barb Warrior so I figured she would need a caster to help out.  Ah, the old days where no one knew anything and bronze was KING!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Yep.  2 things make Barbarians best:  faction &amp; racks.<br />
<br />

<br />
But they have no penalties either.<br />
<br />
Basically, it's about looks - most people think Barbs look the best, so they play them. Which, incidentally, means that although you may think your iksar/ogre/troll looks good, most people will disagree ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Edara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I made a shammy to group with my ranger main (Bozarkia, you've raided with me several times, I'm Daesun of Wreckers).  The ranger archery skills need insane amounts of points to earn (45 if you take the shortest path possible), and I can only bot friend's accounts for so long before they log on and ask to use their character again!  Daesun is nearly self-sufficient in Fungus Grove, but a bot providing heals, haste and slows is very, very handy to reduce downtime, and also allows me to duo in more interesting locations like Seb, Chardok and HS.<br />
<br />
My shaman is 23 at the moment.  I can't claim that she's not twinked, but I am having a lot of fun with her and intend to take her raiding when she's at an appropriate level.<br />
<br />
I chose Barbarian because I'm familiar with the towns that she's accepted in, and because it amuses me to have a half-elf walking next to a massive barbarian, who looks to be twice as tall.  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">But they have no penalties either.<br />
<br />
Barbarians have an exp penalty (not to mention nightblind). Those are penalties.<br />
<br />
When I started there were no lizards or overgrown kerrans. I had just changed servers (had played a druid to 15th on first server), and was playing a barbarian warrior on E'ci. I grouped with a shaman here or there, and I found out shamans got spirit of wolf at level 9. <br />
<br />
Having played the druid, and knowing how nice this spell was, I decided to try shaman. So I had my brother hold all the patchwork armor I had made, and my sewing kit and cracked staff, and I rerolled as a shaman with the same name. I knew virtually nothing about the class (but in summer of 99, not many people did). I didnt know they even got pets until a few weeks later. All I knew was they got spirit of wolf sooner than druids, they were healers, and had stat buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Tailen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Why a barbie?  Let me count the ways.<br />
<br />
1) Nice balance of Stats<br />
2) Looks the part.  (If only we could get some feathered head dresses...)<br />
3) Great newbie zone.  Easy to get weapons, armor, bags, and coin.  By the time you leave Everfrost your allready looking to buy banded, at only level 6.<br />
4) Blackburrow.  What better place for noobs to learn about a dungeon?  And where is it more fun?<br />
5) Trolls are bum-ooglly, ogers are fat, and iksar are just a pain to travel with.  Kitties have potential though....<br />
6) Its easier to relate to a barbarian, than it is to the so inhuman other shaman races.<br />
7) Body like a greek god and the mystery of what's under the kilt make for a dead sexy combonation.<br />
8) When your a barbarian every day is like St. Paddy's Day.<br />
9) Bandl<br />
10) Frostbite<br />
<br />
11) Pudding ;)<br />
<br />
I think that summs it up nicely.  But mostly I play a barbarian purely because of dumb luck! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">In the begining....<br />
<br />
There were no ports...<br />
There was no SoW...<br />
90% of deaths were from stuff chasing you down. (good faction = less things that want to chase you down)<br />
Bards would charge to take groups of people from FP to Qeynos at bard speed :p <br />
<br />
In these days if difficult travel faction meant you could see more without fear of death.<br />
<br />
The HG SG and Grif where still bad news for all, cause nobody could kill them though :x<br />
<br />
<br />
I picked barb shaman because it was first class to get SoW and I could travel almost anywhere without guards buggin me.<br />
<br />
If I was to start fresh...I would go kitty...just for fun</div></div><hr />

And for you saying starting wis doesnt matter...try having at least semi nice stuff (full kael, vindi bp, epic, NToV shield) and still only having 186 wis unbuffed, wis may not be that big of a difference but its kinda embarrasing IMO and I want my wis to be over 200.</div></div><hr />

Hey, who're you calling ugly? :mad: <br />
In any case, for me, having started playing this game just after Kunark came out, the choice was easy: trolls and ogres were too ugly, and I don't really care for barbarians, so that only left Iksar.  I don't regret it in the least.. it's nice to feel unique.  And besides.. Iksar have tails :D</div></div><hr />

Then one day the servers were down and so I tried out the test server and thought I'll try something different. I picked a Shaman and saw that only a few rases could be them. not knowing any better I picked a Barbarian, though some might say I still don't know any better (I'm looking in your direction Kronenbourg ;)) <br />
<br />
After playing on the test server for a few hours I just knew that I wanted to be a Shaman, so I created another Shaman on my main server again Barbarian with an eyepatch. He's now dropeed that since Luclin and decided to show the world his crazy eye! :D<br />

As to why people pick Barbs? I find that most people when starting a game tend to pick something that looks fun without being too hard.  When your starting out things like bad faction sound as tho they could cause real problems and be a right pain.<br />
<br />
Edit: If there were no old models and only luclin models and I was starting now I would pick Barb or Ogre coz new troll models suck.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I never understood why Barbs were so common, either, except they might be slightly easier to level with better faction and lesser experience penalties...  most people go the easier route.<br />
<br />
I recently started playing EQ again after taking a 6 month hiatus, and having lost my 54 ranger and 50 iksar monk, I decided to start fresh.  Shaman was class I wanted to be, and after some research it wasn't hard for me to choose which race I wanted my shaman to be:<br />
<br />
Troll<br />
<br />
Many reasons (Pro's):<br />
<br />
1) Everyone chooses a barb as a shaman... prob the same people that make druids.  I see probably Iksar shamans second most.  I like being the minority shaman.  Gotta have some uniqueness in this world of cookie-cutter chars.<br />
2) Regen.  I don't care what anyone says; it makes a difference in a class who cann's all their life away, especially in the low- to mid-levels.<br />
3) Infravision.  I can't stand being blind.  Yeah, we can fix that later on, but that's just another buff we gotta constantly have on.<br />
4) Trolls have high STA, which means slightly more hitpoints, which are oh-so precious.<br />
5) Gear.  Between the regenning shamans, Trolls can wear the JBB.  If you choose Innoruuk, you also get the Snare necklace... ( i screwed up and chose Cazic... no idea why...)<br />
6) I LUV the old troll char models.  The new ones I'm getting used to, but the old ones were classic.  Luv the butt-scratching...<br />
7) Roleplaying factors.  Barbs are decent to roleplay, but the nod for me goes to Trolls... their &quot;dum-speak&quot; is fun as hell... compared to the &quot;Hail, How Art Thou on this Fine Eve?&quot;-speak of barbs, pallies and clerics.<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
1) Bad faction.  Not as bad as iksar, but bad.  Also fixable, if you work hard.<br />
2) Exp penalty.  Got an iksar monk to 50, so I'm used to it.  It is noticeable, though, when leveling with friends.  They basically level when i get to the 4th yellow bub.<br />
<br />
I have more respect for 50+ troll shaman 'cause the exp penalty is almost enough to drive you away from the race, and does with most folks.  It takes a lot of work to get the same amount of exp, and it's also harder to deal with faction issues.  'More satisfaction at the end of the day. :D<br />
<br />
Besides, how many more &quot;I'm the sexiest barb on the face of Norrath&quot; insignia's do we gotta see?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Elder Galond</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Hello :) <br />
<br />
The reason for me choosing a Barbarian would be because of my strong Scottish, Welsh and Irish ancestory.<br />
<br />
My last name (McEwan) is my family name and can be traced way way back, so far back its kinda scary.<br />

 Everyone chooses a barb as a shaman... prob the same people that make druids.  Hey now, that was a shot below the belt.  They may be Barb Shammies, but they're our Barbs. :)<br />
<br />
 I like being the minority shaman. Dat would be da Oger.  Trolls are actually the 2nd most popular choice.<br />
<br />
But I'm glad you went Troll.  Us evils could use all da help we can get.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually pre-kunark barbarians were not a common race, warriors, monk and rogues all sucked and the uber tank class was ranger.  (No warrior/rogue = no barbarians.)  There were gobs of DE necros, HAF/WE Druids, and Half Elf Rangers.  <br />
<br />
Shaman in general was a misunderstood unpopular class.  Any shaman of any race was an &quot;uncommon&quot; combo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I still love my face paint to this day, I think the way a race looks is a huge part of why people pick races to play.<br />

Hehe, j/k ;)<br />
<br />
Honestly, in my case, the whole &quot;Rodahn = sexy&quot; thing started as an inside joke that just kinda stuck after some female EQ friends of mine spoke of the errrmm &quot;assets&quot; of a naked Barb male.<br />
I eventually stuck it on my message board profiles and in-game  inspection message just for yuks.<br />
<br />
On another subject, I really like the new Iksar models.  The old ones, by comparison, looked like Weight Watchers experiments gone wrong.  Get some meat on them bones, lizzy boy! ;P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Niall Graycloak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Trolls/Ogres have pretty much nothing to offer in the newbie quest/tradeskill department. (This may change but its true now and was even more true previously) Also the ugly factor/non-human thing is a problem, ogres and trolls not only look ugly - they look silly/stoopid. If the trolls (for example) looked like some sleek black skinned killing machine instead of a fat green clown - there would have been more. Oh yeah and Feerott and Innothule suck as newbie zones. <br />
<br />
Iksar, the faction issues just scare many away. Even with the new continents/moon it does limit where you can safely play with friends.  Not juts in where the iksar can go, but in the fact that an iksar can level to 30th without leaving cabilis environs (a hard place for RL friends/guildies playing other races to stay)<br />
<br />
Vah Shir are too new to be a real sample - if I were starting over it would be as a cat. <br />
<br />
Barbs are just the &quot;easiest&quot; choice that has been around. Great <br />
newbie zone, easy access to early tradeskills and cash - I had patchwork at 4th and banded by 9th. No faction issues, decent looks. Some great tradeskill items - northman armor/shield, imbued ivory jewellery for mid levels + high end Artificers. Can wear/use most every shaman item. =  Hard to beat</div></div><hr />

Oh I have, hehe.  Seen high-lvl trolls with Paw of Opallas as a matter of fact.  Which is perfectly fine, I suppose.  Boost of WIS for races that have lower starting WIS is a smart move, IMO.</div></div><hr />

I've also seen plenty of Ogres wearing a bloodstained tunic. Looks even sillier on them than it does on Barbs. This reminds me, I saw a 59 cleric wearing a bloodstained tunic within the last month.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">THanks for the explanation Boraman.  Shamans were horribly uncommon back when I started mine 3 years ago.  Having just come off from playing a paladin to 15, I thought dex would be a good place to put starting stats, and get wis to about 90 to round him off.  So I have a base 90 wis barbarian.  I realized my mistake at about lvl 12 but by then I thought it was too late.  So I kept playing.  Nowadays it matters very little.  I could have max wis if I so chose.  I dont however, craving balance as I always have.   <br />
<br />
I chose barbarian because I felt sure I was getting away with something.  I took a look at the &quot;evil&quot; classes like necromancer and Shadowknight and saw how overpowered they were compared to other classes.  I saw that only one &quot;good&quot; race was able to play shaman, and that was barbarian, a notoriously &quot;sketchy&quot; race with the factions of other cities.  heck, Qeynos didn't like me at first.  So I thought, &quot;Shaman must be an overpowered class if it's mostly evil.&quot;  So I went barb, sure to be a &quot;good&quot; char with overpowered &quot;evil&quot; abilities.  <br />
<br />
Turns out I wasn't far off with that thinking.  Shamans are very very powerful when played correctly and not gimped by code restrictions vs. mobs.  We've proven that we can solo stuff others can't.  I really don't wanna go into bard exploit soloing right now tho so please nobody bring that up.  We make a damn fine addition to almost any group, and we are the best all around support class in the game.</div></div><hr />

This was the first reason I thought of Barbarian.<br />

The reason for me choosing a Barbarian would be because of my strong Scottish, Welsh and Irish ancestory.  <br />
