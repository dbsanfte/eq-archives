<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In PoK ... in the evil section ... there is a Troll vendor that has books for loan (no drop, lore, no rent).   These books talk about both the Troll Shaman's and SK's.    From my reading ... it appears that there are quests associated with this.    The SK book refers to something located at the bottom of the swamps.   I've tried looking around inside of Grobb ... as well as swimming around in the few water areas but could not find anything.   It's quite possible that Guk may have some new spot that connected to this.<br />
<br />
The Shaman books are even more interesting.   They refer to something hidden inside of Grobb.   This is some type of artifact.   There appears to be a tag line that either Grobb NPC'S or related would response to if spoken outloud.  I created a couple macro's ... and ran around Grobb talking to everything including the frogluk's ... but didn't get anywhere.    <br />
<br />
I'm just curious if anyone else has looked into this or has any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Crug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I had no idea.  It may only be triggered by doing some other quest in the planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I haven't noticed the Grobb or Swamp zones being patched recently - so a hidden area seems unlikely ...<br />
<br />
Sounds interesting though, I'll investigate!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Podunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So far i know there is a quest given by a troll in PoK and he asks for 4 items that you are to find and then take to grobb, i do not however know the trolls name or the items related thus far but one of my guildies is doing it right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I read dem books - says that some big marker/monolith was set in a room in the area that later became the SK guild .... something about the room sinking in to the swamp before the Grobb clan moved in.<br />
<br />
nexttime I go by Grobb, I was gonna see if there is any water in the SK guild.  /shrug</div></div><hr />

[Thu Nov 14 11:50:55 2002] Logging to 'eqlog.txt' is now *ON*.<br />
[Thu Nov 14 11:51:00 2002] It is 3 AM on Sunday, the 15th day of November, of the year 3181.<br />
[Thu Nov 14 11:51:00 2002] Earth Time: Thu Nov 14 11:51:00 2002<br />
[Thu Nov 14 11:51:02 2002] Players on EverQuest:<br />
[Thu Nov 14 11:51:02 2002] ---------------------------<br />
[Thu Nov 14 11:51:02 2002] [51 Mystic] Gummo (Troll)<br />
[Thu Nov 14 11:51:02 2002] There is 1 player in Grobb.<br />
[Thu Nov 14 11:51:07 2002] Your Location is 4.09, -68.17, 4.79<br />
[Thu Nov 14 11:51:09 2002] You say, 'Hail, Basher Nanrum'<br />
[Thu Nov 14 11:51:09 2002] Basher Nanrum says 'A dark day to you, Gummo. New Tanaan has opened its arms to all of Norrath's travelers and scholars alike -- though still I doubt most are worthy of our infinite and unsurpassed knowledge. In any case, we all must uphold the laws of our city, else we become as debased and pathetic as the secular, warring cultures of the material universe. You will find that, despite the medium of our birth or the shadow of faith in our hearts, we are all equally tolerant of each being to approach us. Though I myself am no stranger to the duties of a mentor, I do not think that at this juncture, I would provide any useful assistance to any not of the many clergies associated with the pantheon. If you do indeed serve one of the gods of Nature and Influence, then my services may not prove a waste of our collective time. Search my inventory at your will, and purchase what you wish should you find anything of use to you at this point in your life of service.''<br />
<br />
Notice that Basher Nanrum is NOT a vendor, so I have no clue what he's talking about when he said &quot;Search my inventory at your will&quot;.<br />
<br />
I tried asking him a few questions, but he didn't have anything else to say.<br />
<br />
I also noticed a Lore, No Drop &quot;Bundle of Weapons&quot; for sale on the first vendor you come to when you come into town.  It costs about 5pp with good cha, and it is a permanent fixture in her inventory.<br />
<br />
For some reason I'm thinking the quest text got added to the wrong NPC...<br />
<br />
If this sounds like it's what you're looking for, please keep the rest of us that don't have PoP yet updated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bubub the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The bundle of wepons is used in the shopping list quest in POK, although it is supposed to come from Shadeweavers or something like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bumrush Gudbasher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think the PoK vendor is just background material. I never knew that the Ykesha were a troll tribe!<br />
<br />
Also, anyone else notice that Bregna in the shaman guild in Grobb now asks for Deathfist Belts? Maybe this one has been for a while and I just missed it, but it's new to me. <br />
<br />
The troll Aid up at the top of the library only gives his quest to trolls and maybe one or more other evil races. You need:<br />
<br />
An arachne fang: common drop off spiders in PoD<br />
<br />
Swirling Banshee Essence: probably from banshees deeper in PoN, I found mine off a vendor<br />
<br />
Blood Raven Tailfeather: the blood ravens near PoN zone in drop two types of feather as common drops. Niether of them work. I'm wondering if the drop is messed up.<br />
<br />
Wrulan Claws: I've been told that Wrulan's are cats in Valor. Since I'm not flagged yet, I can't get one.<br />
<br />
Take these four to Bregna in the shaman guild in Grobb to finish. I can't remember if you get flagged hailing the Aid in the library, but it's still a good idea to listen to him. He claims the four items are alchemy components, so this may be the start of planar alchemy for trolls here.<br />
