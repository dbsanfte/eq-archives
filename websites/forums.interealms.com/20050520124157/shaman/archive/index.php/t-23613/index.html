<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">While puttering around at work, I came up with a new zone idea. I am guessing it might work best as a instanced zone. SOE seem to really like to go towards the fast kills, and while I'm bored nothing more fun I like to do then go to an old zone and slaughter a bunch of greenies. A whole lot of light blue type mobs, or mobs with low hp's and don't hit insanly too hard, but a lot of them. In order for this to work a few tweaks would have to be made for them such as.<br />
1. Either mobs are unmezable or have a innate -1hp every 6 seconds to break mez. <br />
2. AE spells would have to be tweaked, something similar to our rain spell effecting only 3 mobs or 4 mobs max at a time. Possibly even our tigirs.<br />
3. Harmony type spells would most certainly have to be out of the question.<br />
<br />
This would require a completly new strategy.The harder zones could be tweaked a bit more easily, adding a few more hit points and making the mobs a bit more harder makes a big difference when you have 6-8 mobs on you. The mobs obviously wouldn't give as much exp, but you'd be killing alot more mobs so it would come up even. <br />
<br />
One problem I would see is lag having 10-15 mobs coming at you would bog down a bit. Perhaps have mobs poof if they don't have anything on them when you kill them.<br />
I'm sure it would need to be tweaked a bit. It would feel nice to rip through mobs sometimes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They do that to a lesser degree in GoD now, with the herders conjuring 1-3 pets before they attack.  Makes battles interesting when you don't have mez around.  Today it was clr+me+4 melee.  The pets don't hit too hard, but they can interrupt heals and so forth, so it was kind of fun dealing with it from time to time.<br />
<br />
I don't think you'd want to go much further than that though.  The game mechanics aren't really setup for mass mob fighting.  You can, but its not efficient. People would be oom etc..</div></div><hr />
