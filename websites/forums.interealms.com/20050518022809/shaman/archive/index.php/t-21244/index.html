<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all, I'm a casual player on the Nameless server looking for a guild that fits my playtime and am hoping some of you can give me some hints on how to do this.  I've been in a couple of guilds, but after joining (usually after getting an invite after grouping with one or more of the members) I find that either their schedule or goals don't match mine.<br />
<br />
What I'm looking for is a casual guild that likes to exp (need to do more LDoN, tired of soloing in PoP) and raids about once a week.  I'm only level 58, so I'd also like to keep working on my epic (and help others with theirs, lots of cool fights to be had).  I'm not real interested in getting to the Plane of Time and would rather enjoy my playtime than be uber.<br />
<br />
My biggest problem is that even though I live on the East coast, I usually play late night 10pm-12am.  Therefore, I would probably be best suited by a Pacific time guild.  Unfortunately, I don't know anyone that plays in that area, so I've had no luck finding a suitable guild.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions, recommendations, or names of guilds that fit my description would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />

Oops, no wonder I was having a hard time. :)<br />

Edited my original post, server = The Nameless.<br />
