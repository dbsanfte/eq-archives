<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KriFos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">That needs to be fixed / checked upon is:<br />
<br />
1. The /sit off command... Currently, the /sit command is not checking for any flags. I noticed this a couple of months ago when cannidancing... /sit off was supposed to make you stand if you sat, and not sit if you was standing. <br />
<br />
This also made me re-doing my heal macro to remove the /sit off... Previous i had /sit off so if i sat i would be standing before i casted heal... Now when i use that, and if I am standing, I sit down, and thus cant cast the spell...<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Torpor drop rates. Yes, yes, yes. This has been brought up a LOT... But dear Verant, go into the bazaar zone.... do a /bazaar.... sort by spells (scrolls)... sort by price.... What do you see, assuming the shammy spells are even there?  Torpor 50-150k (though i havent seen it in 2 months time:P), Malo 35k, Khuras Focusing 15k, Kodiacs Endless Intellect 12k, Avatar 10k, Poxx of Bertoxxulous 10k, Tirgirs Insects 10k, Bane of Nife 10k.... <br />
<br />
Going prices for spells at AB server, or about....<br />
<br />
Point here is, of the 10 most priced spells, shammy spells are taking 8 spots... cant you SEE that something is wrong?<br />
<br />
Especially Torpor, which almost never ever drops, and when it finally does, it is being sold for prices sky high....<br />
<br />
Why cant Torpor be made questable, with a reward of a nodrop scroll: Torpor?  Make a quest that is not too easy, but at least can be done over a period of some time, so you are sure to get the spell at least when you put in, say 5 days effort to get it. Just an example. Torpor is more sought after than the epic... <br />
<br />
Torpor is worth so much, that if you are in a regular group, ie crypt, and the Emperor finally drops it (1 of 1000 im sure), the other group members demands to roll for it, cause they can sell it for much... Leaving the poor shammy with no spell at all...<br />
<br />
Spellcasters have spells AND equipment to buy.... Melees have just equipment.... And spells like this should not cost what they do today.... PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE look into this...<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Stupid fear overwriting Illusions - ie Form of the Great Bear... <br />
<br />
4. Alchemy alchemy alchemy... When the big tradeskill patch was... Where was the alchemy recipies? Why cant masters of Alchemy make a tradeskill-trophy? Why cant we get some more useful potions? At this point im not complaining about the prices, they are fine, it is just the effect that is so crappy compared to the prices :P  <br />
<br />
<br />
SIGH! Stopping here :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Alchemy?  WHAT Alchemy (feigns ignorance so he doesn't have to make 10,000 SoW potions and lose his mind<br />
<br />
As far as illusion overwrite goes, what about the stupid shrooms in FG?  I don't wanna be a big freakin shroom and lose bearclothes (yes, I know that I still got the stats, but I'm 255 Wis without them, I wanna be a bear!)</div></div><hr />
