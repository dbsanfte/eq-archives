<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Velch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a Barb Shaman, and I moved to the Freeport area to meet with a friend at level 4, and now that I am 5 I need to know where I can find my spells.  Am I going to have to run back to Halas, or is there someplace close?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well - Oggok is closer, but I recommend Halas - you will not lose your corpse there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Unfortunately Halas is your best bet, chief ! <br />
Unless you can get a Troll/Ogre friend to buy your spells in Oggok or Grobb for you. Because there is no way for you to raise faction in Grobb or Oggok. I would recommend buying your non-shammy spells (such as Endure Fire, Spirit Pouch, Gate, Summon Drink)  in Freeport, Feet like Cat can be bought from a low level Druid/Ranger vendor and get a friend to buy the others in Grobb. You can actually buy Sicken from a Troll vendor in Innothule Swamp near Guk (he is indifferent to everyone and sells Shaman poison/disease based spells).<br />
That would probably be the quickest way without having to run back to Halas (without SoW)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you are still bound in Halas, then you can buy gate from the enchater/wizzy guild in freeport and then gate back to Halas.<br />
<br />
Failing that your quickest route will be to find a friendly druid to port you to Surefall Glade and then you can run back via Qeynos Hills, Black Barrow, Everfrost, and then Halas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">All your poison/disease spells are in Innothul Swamp from a neutral Troll vendor.   If you head to location 1234,567 you will be close enough to see him.   For the rest of your spells you have to do as everyone suggested above.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you're below level 9, take the poor-man's gate...die.  You won't lose any of your equipment or experience.  You'll be back in Halas in no time.<br />
<br />
<br />
(This is, of course, assuming they didn't take out the 'no CR before level 10' feature recently...I've been gone for a few months, so I'm not real current.)</div></div><hr />
