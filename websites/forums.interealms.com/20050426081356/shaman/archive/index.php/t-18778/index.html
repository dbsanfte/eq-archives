Well.  You may be better served organizing a group.  As a 56th Shaman, I have no difficulty starting a pick up group.  The LFG tool works wonders.  (Don't forget to put your new group on LFP as well.)<br />
<br />
To answer your question, Nadox at the Torgiran zone (Shrine) is an excellent place for you at this level.<br />
<br />
Good fortunes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I want to grind in the planes, I look for a group needing a replacement that is already in the groove. If there isn't any then I just find some good spot, setup camp and put together my own group. No need sitting around.<br />
<br />
There's also tons of quests/skills/whatever you could be working on in your down time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gnofr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you like sitting quietly on your drogmar with Dogdog by your side and grinding through mobs non-stop, collecting a couple plat and a harpoon or axe worth another four from each, plus the occasional diamond or blue diamond while filling your bank with parts for essence potions, then the Dandolak and Oceancrasher (boats 3 and 4) in Dulak Harbor might be for you.  It seems to bore most folks stiff.<br />
<br />
There's no experience bonus and little risk to speak of, but the constancy of the action makes up for a lot of idle time and mobs with loads of hit points.  At 58-9 luggalds (upper safe tunnel) and water torn types (lower safe tunnel) in the Crypt of Nadox start to be faster experience despite their greater hit points.  The experience is about twice as slow as you'd get from a small group in Droga, but it's enough to get you to 60 without rezes or lfg and with loads of coral rings, darkwood bows and enough zombie skins to get to 188 in pottery.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ghobster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You should try solo'ing (duo'ing recommended) veksar in LoIO. Entrance is pretty easy but you can try church with shaman chanter and warrior with high hp/ac. worked very well for me and pretty decent xp. however, i think best xp is aggro kiting in pov outer with necro/shaman/rogue/chanter...</div></div><hr />

Solo'ing entrance is really boring (very easy). Use Anathema DOT and Malosi so you don't have to do the poison/disease debuff. Have doggie up and buffed with haste. Should be no problem. You have lots of room if you were to pull 2 for root parking.<br />
<br />
If you have JBB, help doggie out.</div></div><hr />

I was deeper in, fighting undead.  Pally was killing fast enough that I didn't bother trying to dot, altho my few nukes were painfully mitigated.  Dogdog helped the pally, who with his slay disc sure didn't me...but on my own, in the church or outside the kitchen...don't think I could do it. <br />
<br />
Also, I'm a lizard.  No JBB for me.   :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Knew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ghobster has it, PoV Kite group. Awesome XP, and even though all u do i sit there, XP rolls in. At 57 and 58 all kbs are red, and I got about 1 1/2 gold in an hour</div></div><hr />

Heck camp in the backroom and maybe you can get that nice ear http://magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=62312.  I find the exp is better then tier one and alot safer. It is a  bit of a run from pok book, I use to bind in pot, put up my lfg flag and kill untill I get a group in tier2, tier2 exp owns solo anyday. :)</div></div><hr />

That isn't fair...everyone knows level doesn't matter for resists..it's all about the $$CHA$$</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ranguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">While it may not be the safest way to earn exp, if you want a nice challenge and have GoD, give Natimbi a shot. I have been soloing right across from the zone-in. Not many trains over that side or many wanderers, but you do get to contend with some bards/necros soloing. I'm not sure how you would do without epic as it's a decent DoT for there. Some needed information about that zone...<br />
A.) Mobs are extremely resistant. Malosini everything and buff dogdog to hold mobs off while you cast 4 times. (I've had Malosini resisted a lot and dogdog can hold off mobs for approx. 3 Malosini + 1 Turgur's)<br />
B.) Learn which mobs YOU are comfortable with. Explanation:<br />
Tureptas - Higher HP than hynids, hit for less damage about 193 max. 75DD Stun proc, resist 80% of the time with 109MR unbuffed.<br />
Hynids - Low HP, hit for about 246 max, double and are very fast. Proc a 150DD easily resisted at 109 MR.<br />
Stonemites - Medium HP, medium hits. Proc 20DD DoT with -40 Poison Resist adjustment. I hate these things and avoid them like the plague =)<br />
Nocs/Mastruqs - I don't mess with these guys solo. The nocs run at bard speed, both proc 500DD fairly often and hit hard and fast.<br />
Other - The fierce cragwalker (named turepta) is a pain. He hits for 363, doubles and hits fast. I have burned an entire bar of mana on this guy and ended up rooting and Canni'ing to finish him off. Ate dogdog in 2 casts of Malosini (took 4 to land, but got a slow after 2nd resist of Malosini) I haven't seen the other nameds so no idea what they are like.<br />
C.) Adds REALLY suck. If you get an add, try rooting both and gate or run to magus. If you are FM and can land Malosini on first cast, keep the add rooted until first is dead, then work the second.<br />
<br />
Special notes...My lineup for fighting in Natimbi is Chloroblast, Canni, Root, Turgur's, Anathema, Bane of Nife, Malosini, and Stoicism. I have the epic and a drogmor, but don't use drog while fighting, just downtime. I can take 3 to 4 mobs between FM and oom. Suggestions:<br />
When you get to Natimbi, Invis first and get to camp. Pop dogdog and HoS/Regrowth/Celerity him (regrowth doesn't help much so I skip it sometimes) give him 2 rusty daggers from the fisherman. Tell him to Guard. Canni to full and Stoic. /dismount and find a target to pull. ALWAYS pull with Malosini, land or resist, dogdog will take agro. On the way to camp, sick the speedbump on mob and when he charges, cast Turgur's (if Malosini stuck) or Malosini again. Once debuffed and slowed, if dogdog is under 40% HP walk into agro range and Chloroblast him, then back out and load on the DoTs. I start with epic followed by Bane of Nife, let Bane tick once and wait 3 seconds then start Anathema, Anath will land on the second tick of Bane. This matches up their timers so both end at the same time. When they do finally end the mob should be dead or running and the final 4 ticks of epic will finish it. Once I have cast my DoTs, I walk into melee range and poke at them (unhasted) Mobs riposte A LOT and when they hit, they hit hard, minimize the damage you take as much as possible. If you try root-rotting, dogdog WILL die, or you will go oom from healing him.<br />
<br />
Natimbi is a fun place for me to solo in, the exp isn't the best, but with a chance at Talisman of the Spiritseer (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68319) it makes the soloing very worth it. I have already aquired one and put it in the shared bank, I'm trying for a second for my wife's cleric now. I've also aquired the Iridescent Turepta Shell (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68310) and Gnarled Mesh Bracer (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68302) the bracer was an upgrade for me. There are a lot of items that can drop off any mob in the zone, but some only drop from names, the Turepta shell I got off a fierce cragwalker, and the bracer I got from Kyv Heartpiercer (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=14229). Hope some of this info helps you, I have a blast in this zone while LFG. BTW, a Burning Affliction item REALLY helps out for Bane and Anathema. Good luck =)</div></div><hr />
