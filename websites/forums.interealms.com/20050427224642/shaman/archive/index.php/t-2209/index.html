<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>EVOLNOSMIRC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I play alot with my friend who has a 39 ranger (I am a 39 shaman) and I was wondering where would be a good place for us to duo?  Really, pp and loot doesn't matter as much as experience.  I was thinking more of an outdoor zone, but would be willing to try any good camp or pull spot.  Any information would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jestice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My personal favorite spot to either duo or solo is the Ulthorks in the Eastern Wastes.  If not familiar with the area zone in from Iceclad and at the bottom of the bridge turn right (North) and follow the coast line til you come to a trio of three dwarves around a campfire (The only MOBS to worry about up to this point is a hut of Rygorr Orcs - though with ranger harmony these may make a decent camp themselves). Just past this sit up camp and prepare for pulling.  The MOBS are Ulthork Hunters and Warriors, Walrus's, and Wholly Rhino's. The Ulthorks and the Wulrus's assist each other, but the Rhino's are non-aggro. In addition to what I consider good - great xp the Ulthorks and Wulrus's also drop velium wepons, hides, and Ulthork Tusks - which can either be sold to other players or turned in for a quest when you get to Cobolt Scar.<br />
<br />
I often solo here, but jump at any melee who is interested in duo'ing due to the fact I believe we kill at least 3 MOBS to the 1 I was killing by myself.  The only downside is this is quad-kite heaven and is often monopolized by druids and wizards - though from experience I have found that I can keep up the same pace as either class and by adding a melee I can generally leave them looking for the 3rd and 4th to complete the quad.<br />
<br />
Also in the area is Crystal Caverns - the 4 spawn of Terrors by the broken bridge is nice, though this is the worst area for pet pathing I have come across yet (Dog often gets caught swimming in the river and gets stuck). As you get accustomed to the area you may be able to pull from the hallway as well.  Only downside is the dwarf that wanders in the area once in a while killing your terror.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Megral Dotcalm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you're working with a Ranger, let me offer some insight from soneone who has played one in that level range. I gained a lot of levels as a ranger in EW and GD using a great little spell called Panic Animal. Your friend can fear kite critters. Just have him pull, snare and fear each mob. My partner and I did this off the EW/IC bridge by the hour. Just wait to cast Panic Animal until the mob is as high as the first arch overheard. Experiment with pathing if you pull slightly to one side so it stays on the bridge longer while feared. This tactic also works great at the bear cave in GD. You wil both take little damage, you'll get full value for your dots and on the bridge, it's very safe because of the proximity to a zone line.<br />
<br />
Happy hunting!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lumppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Here is another area you may try. DL at the back of the giant fort. Once you come out of the tunnel from the druid portal in DL the mobs are a lower level than the mobs around KC. The problem is finding a safe spot to kill. I found that at the back of the giant fort directly opposite the entrance (on the outside of the fort) is a safe spot. Just set up camp close to but not right up against the wall of the fort. I have aggroed a couple of giants through the wall but this is very rare. Then pull at will there is tons of mobs to kill and you will soon find which ones you like the best. At your level I was working with a warrior as a partner here and the exp was very good and the giants will drop some nice turn in loot. When I got around 40 I started to solo the yeti caves in this zone. Also good exp but almost nothing for loot. I love watching those Yeti running towards you when you pull them LOL.</div></div><hr />
