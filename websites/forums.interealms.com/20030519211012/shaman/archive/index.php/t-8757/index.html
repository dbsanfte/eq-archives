<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cubman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am currently working my AA points at lvl 60 and would like to get Canni5 and MGB before continuing to level.  There are simply too many places very soloable that green out at 61.  Once I get Canni5, it will be difficult to use with my current HP.  I was wondering if any of our knowledgable shaman out there might have suggestions as to what I could upgrade without breaking the bank (still saving up for Pox, Malo, and a horse)<br />
<br />
I have Torpor, Epic, Jbb, and Fungi.  Any suggestions on gear that can be either solo'd or single grouped would be most appreciated.  I have about 3k in the bank to play with if the gear cannot be obtained with a single group.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance...although I rarely post, I check the boards as often as RL allows.<br />

<br />
Face: Crystal Spider Eyes OR Death Mask of the Elysians<br />
Ear2: Silver Hammer Earring<br />
Arms: Hardened Grey Flesh Sleeves<br />
Hand: Coldain Skin Gloves<br />
Shdr: Pauldrons of Witness<br />
Feet: Barbed Dragonscale Boots<br />
<br />
Also ... consider saving up the Pages of Dark Power and seeing if you can catch 'em all for the Cloak of the Wise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Waist: Spider Fur Belt (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=3891) or if you can get it cheap Barbed Rubicite Belt (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=10320) <br />
<br />
Head: If you are max ally to CoV you can go for the Circlet of the Falinkan (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6452). Most of the steps are doable with one good group. May be Vielfang will be a tough fight with only one group.<br />
<br />
Back:  Hierophant's Cloak (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=2192) is easy to get with one group (if you have enough time to camp it)<br />
<br />
Neck: If you like quests you could go for Qeynos Badge of Nobility (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=13796). Small Clockwork Talisman (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16558) isn't hard to get too and can be upgraded later.</div></div><hr />
