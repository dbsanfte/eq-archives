<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>JoarAddam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know one ingredient is Griffon feathers, but what's the herb?  I can't find it listed anymore on any oldworld alchemy lists, and since the board was moved, can't search the old threads.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Try the EQ Traders Alchemy Recipes (http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_alchemy.htm).  You can skip down to the Old Alchemy section, it's Vampiric Spirit...and the herb is Feverfew :)  Incidentally, there seem to be two versions of Feverfew...the one off of most alchemy vendors won't work, you have to get the version out of Shar Vahl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>JoarAddam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks Dandi, only site I didn't check LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You're welcome :)  Since Belgar always did such a good job, EQ Traders never bothered to list alchemy info.  But now that Belgar went under I've volunteered to get alchemy info together for them...so if anything is missing it's only because I haven't heard of it yet *grin*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Think the herb that is doubled up in original alchemy and the revamped alchemy is Figwort. They have the same name but they are different herbs and cannot be used interchangably.<br />
Could be wrong, but i think Feverfew is only available in Shar Vahl.<br />
<br />
Hint for herb shopping in Shar Vahl: there are TWO vendors selling herbs in the shop next to the bank. The trick is the one  standing behind the counter on the left is indifferent and so prices are high. The other vendor (Marissa? or soemthing like that) will be standing behind. But when she is on the left side, she won't trade with you as she is busy. You have to wait till she crosses the room to the back wall to deal with her. This vendor was amiable to me, so i got much cheaper prices. Sorry if that's confusing, just have a look. :)</div></div><hr />
