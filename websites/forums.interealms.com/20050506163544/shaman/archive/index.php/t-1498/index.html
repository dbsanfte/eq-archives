<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been waiting for this to go in for months, but haven't heard anything recently.  With this patch being touted in advance as a major patch, I was hopeful that it might finally make it in.  <br />
<br />
Anyone have any info on the revamp's status?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hoping it isnt revamped until I have had a chance to level my monk up in there first :)  Is a fantastic zone and nice and empty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No info but they better do it and make it damn good. <br />
<br />
Lets see, Chardok. You have to spend hours factioning in a greenie dungeon to get faction up. Then you get a nice ring, lovely, whats next. Oh yes, you're going to have to kill two rare spawns that are now perma camped on every server oh and not only are the spawns a bottle neck the drop off one of them is rare too!<br />
<br />
So, you deny all these poor people from hunting in what is one of the best dungeons on Kunark in order to get a chance at items that outclass 99% of the drops in the zone. <br />
<br />
Hurry up and put in an opposing faction VI, I'm not about to play that twisted Chardok game tyvm.<br />
<br />
Not that I'm bitter, or anything.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hey Seredith. <br />
Those cords that are the final reward of that quest aren't only quested.  You can also kill the named Lorekeeper and sometimes he will drop them.  I know cause I was on a raid to royals bout a month or so ago and the Lorekeeper got owned and dropped the Spirit Wracked Cord.  Yes it was the same one, i looked at it on the body myself.  12 ac 100 hps some resists, and AoB effect as well as being able to go in several different slots.  <br />
<br />
So, get a kick ass group and head down towards royals.  The library area is the place to find this lorekeeper fellow.  He has a 21 minute spawn time, so happy camping!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yea? I always thought that was just an evil rumour, cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I keep putting off camping the King down there, hope they don't do it yet.  THough, god knows we need more 50+ xp zones.</div></div><hr />
