<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nihnyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi there. I am/was an EQ player. I won't tell my whole story right now  and if you would please read it HERE (http://www.forumplanet.com/planeteverquest/topic.asp?fid=2062&amp;tid=331919) then you would know my situation. When I previously played i was a member of First Order Of The Dragon guild. They didn't have a site cause they had just started but I stayed in nontheless because i was happy to recieve a request for a guild. Just lately I have had a craving for EQ and decided to look up some Veeshan server guilds. I found this and a few others but i'm not gonna bother looking at the rest. I've been in a clan for a different game and we had a good site and forums. This guild is organized by the looks of it. Great site and great forums (not that i think a clan/guild is awesome just cause of a good site and forums, but it shows a lot about the people). I've scrolled through your site a bit and it is very organized. Many, many members. now if i can find a way to play EQ again everything will be good. The one thing you might find confusing about my situation is the house thing. <br />
My parents are separted so i live in one house and visit the other.  I live in my moms house and visit my dad. I visit my dad every second weekend and every thursday before the weekend i'm with my mom. During the week i'm with my mom. Anyways the thing is that at my mom's house there is a shitty comp (the one i'm on now). pII 266, 32 megs of ram. basically the bare minimum req for EQ. at my other house there is a pII ???mhz and 128 megs of ram. EQ runs fine on that computer. At one point I did install EQ on this computer but it kept disconnecting,(it wasn't the cable it was my comps slowness). Since i wasn't at my dads a lot to play EQ i couldn't keep the interest up for it. Now i'm trying to find RAM to put in this comeputer so i can play it  A LOT.  I hope this topic isn't boring buy i need ppl to understand my situation for stuff. I would like to join this guild but i don't know if there is a point in signing up if i don't have EQ on it yet. At an end note, again i think this guild looks very promising and i can tell its organized. If you would like to see my DoD  (Day Of Defeat its a half-life modification) clan site here it is : http://cdn.vigilantegamers.com <br />
since i've had the craving for EQ., and if i get it back up i'll probably stop DoD. well until 2.0 comes out. my icq is 64886907 and my e-mail is pegged@home.com<br />

We are a continuously growing guild with few restrictions which allows people to do what they wish within the limits of our charter.  If you are interested please in joining please read our charter as well as the recruiting info then contact KOE in game around your level for groups.<br />
Our recruiting process is long and it requires a sponser as well as positive remarks from a number of KOE members before final approval from our officers.<br />
<br />
Welcome back to EQ, things coming in the near future with SOL will be exiting to share with you and others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree Moebeus.  Personally I can't wait for the huge graphics update in SoL more than anything else, and I would definitly buy it just for that.  But besides that, it adds so much more.  This is definitely the time to get back into Everquest and get ready for a huge change!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nihnyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Keeping top lol...cause i have nothin else better to do on this forum. not in guild so can't talk much and not back in EQ yet but i will be SOON!!! i'm dying here!</div></div><hr />
