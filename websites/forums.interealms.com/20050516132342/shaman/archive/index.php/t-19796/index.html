I will, if I'm still playing. I expect most people here will, if it has new content and they are not toying with retirement. Doing the same old stuff is boring, new tricks or not ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Didn't buy the current one. Willingness to get the next one will depend on what it offers. &quot;New content&quot; isn't enough.<br />
<br />
And of course, by the time the next expansion rolls around in November or so, WoW will be in either public beta, or actual release. I may not be playing EQ at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Kinda hard to answer without really knowing anything about it, no?</div></div><hr />

I think they've done a really nice job with it, from what I have seen.  Unless I quit playing between now and the next expansion, I will be buying it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I didn't buy this one, because pretty much everyone except Jinheim has strong negative or at the very best apathetic feelings towards GoD (and I was in beta so I knew better than to preorder).  But like Tugela said, &quot;Doing the same old stuff is boring.&quot;  I can say for sure that I will not be doing LDoN missions by the time the next expansion comes out.  However, whether I buy that expansion or buy WoW instead really depends on whether SOE cleans up its act (not too likely, but I'm an optimist, and I figure if they keep changing the dev team eventually they are bound to get someone halfway competent).  It also depends on the word on the street about WoW, but no matter how good WoW is I will stick with EQ if they give me a reason to stay.  Giving me a another LoY quality expansion that's almost completely designed for end-game raiders (I'm not even guilded ATM) does not count.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">So far my only bitch with GoD is i cant find people to freaking group with !! Unguilded is not fun at times /sigh.<br />
<br />
Anyway, i can solo around in it and its got a good theme so far. I still havent gotten very deep so i cant really pass judgment yet. I will say though that my SK was soloing by the zone in camp at 52. So that lets you know there is many levels that can do something in this expansion.<br />
<br />
Anyway, so far i haven regreted my choice to buy it. I mean if nothign else i dont get the ad anymore ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
But to answer your question, there is no way to know if we dont know whats in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah, maybe our spells suck, and only a couple AAs look interesting, but still, there is a LOT of content here. If you are going to judge an expansion based on spells and AA alone, or &quot;what did I get&quot;, then I think you are playing the wrong game. <br />
<br />
Gates looks pretty cool, content wise. Augs dropping off regular mobs, instanced areas, new strategies required to be effective in some areas (they sure come at you fast and hit HARD, this is probably why the new Slow is gonna be good).<br />
<br />
I enjoy spells and cool AA as much as the next guy, but my primary reason for playing this game is to hang with cool people and get some cool gear. Gates has opened up the EPs for now, and has also given us some new goals as a Raiding guild, as well as a few one-group options that look pretty neat. <br />
<br />
As long as I am playing EQ more than a couple hours a week, I will buy everything they put out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The next expansion will have a new level cap, I am guessing level 70. Although people may complain at this stage about it, I would suggest most people would actually look forward to it. New level cap paves the way for more class identifying and more powerful spells. <br />
Although imagine how lame it would be to get<br />
Disease dot<br />
Poison dot.<br />
Strength buffs.<br />
An extended cold nuke.<br />
Hopefully they will put some innovation into 65-70.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Didn't buy god, may well never buy it.  Not because of balance or anything, but simply because the content isn't really for me.  The high end badly needed an expansion and got it.  I'm not there, so its largely useless.<br />
So it very much depends on whats in the next expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">SoE is smart enough to put some hook in each expansion that is a must have.  I don't need the new content yet so I could have waited on that.<br />
<br />
I bought it for the Tribute (I only have one focus item).  Of course having a new class to replace my Shaman that has been broken by Gates is a plus (hehehe).</div></div><hr />

One of my all time most favorite lines:<br />
<br />
Q: &quot;Does this dress make me look fat?&quot;<br />
<br />
A: &quot;Not at all...its your ass that makes you look fat!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Arctarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">My only highlighsts in EQ since velious (the greatest everquest expansion for me) have been the Emperor Fight (neat design/ambiance), and Quarm/Teh Rathe. All the rest is kinda annoying and/or buggy.<br />
<br />
You need to ask yourself this question: given the direction taken since Luclin, would you like to play Everquest more, or EQ2?<br />
<br />
Until lately i didn't want to quit until WoW, DnL were out (i need my crack); but i am currently reconsidering, since it turns out i am playing an expendable class, only collecting virtual gear because i have the chance to be in a top guild. I really think i am loosing my time on EQ since the enjoyment has been taken from me.<br />
I bought GoD because... well my guild will be in GoD 5 days on 7. To be honest, i don't dislike GoD content, i just dislike playing an expendable class given what we have to fight.<br />
<br />
I quit once, i can certainly do it twice, and i hope it will be before the end of the year. I strongly believe that the next expansion won't be installed on my computer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">shamans own in god.  So much of this stuff that hits very very hard are fully slowable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yea i guess the point needs to be made that once WoW comes there is a high possability ill never buy a EQ expansion again. This all has to end sometimes. <br />

<br />
<br />
Heh, what direction?<br />
Luclin:  Screw melee.  Give all mobs super high hp/ac, not too high DPS, and leave resists like normal raid mobs are.  Endurance fights.<br />
PoP:  Zerg.  Bring 70-150 people on a raid to hit the highest stuff.  Super high DPS, but low hp/ac on mobs.  Blow-your-load-in-one-shot fights.<br />
Ykesha:  Don't use these zones!  Stay out! (I'm not saying that, I'm saying that's the direction Ykesha went  :p )<br />
LDoN:  Sorry, have to downsize your guild now!  Focused on one group stuff and smaller raids.<br />
GoD:  Damned if I know.  1 group trials, even greater extension of the high dps/low hp-ac of PoP, and luclin spells.  Unresistable high damage procs, faster than sow mobs, etc.</div></div><hr />

I guess GoD is ok for content, but there is so much content still left on PoP that my guild still hasn't done.  We aren't in Time yet, so we still have stuff/gear to work toward in that.  It also sounds like if you want to really give GoD a good go, you need to have some decent (time?) gear to advance well in GoD.  Maybe it will turn out to be great, but so far, I haven't heard much good about it.  As for the spells/AA comment.  Of course you want something for yourself in an expansion.  This isn't a patch, it is supposed to give you SOMETHING.  I am firmly thinking almost every AA/Spell we got is crap.  The endurance ward would have been good, a killable hp ward that does crap for healing is horrible.  As for the pet AA for group buffs.. Many times we do buffs before we go into a zone so we are ready to get it on when we do go in.  Maybe if they changed suspend minion so you could keep your pet across zones, it would be ok.</div></div><hr />
