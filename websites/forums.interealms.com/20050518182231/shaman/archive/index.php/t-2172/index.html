<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was lucky to aquire a Fungus Covered Tarmok (sp) Staff in a trade.  Stats are 30/45 +7 Disease Damage, +25 vs Disease, Wt. 2.2  All / All.  Btw, does the + 7 Disease damage make it effectively 37/45 ? Now that would be a  nice ratio (!)<br />
 It seems like a real nice staff, but due to Damage cap, I am thinking about selling/ trading this item.  My question should I hold on to it and grinn and bear it until I hit lev 40 ( i just dinged to 30), or should I attempt to sell/trade it and address some other equipment needs?  Your advise is welcome )<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hail Widda,<br />
<br />
I've been having a great time with my Groaning Mace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would keep it.  When solo'ing it's hard to beat a good 2hb.<br />
<br />
Mobs die so much quicker...that is if you actually get in there and melee a bit ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's 37/45 if the target fails to save vs disease.  My understanding is that this is checked on every swing, and since many mobs have poor disease resists, you can get in some nice chunky hits.  Effective ratio on low dark blue mobs seems to be about 35/45.  Certainly worth keeping, IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Widda, what is the graphic on that staff?  I guess I haven't seen it yet.<br />
<br />
Is it just the plain, long, brown 2handed staff graphic?<br />
<br />
Hope not...considering getting one :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Naaz, I got good news for you.  It absolutely looks KICK ASS.  Let me elaborate,  the business end looks like a two pronged fork, not too long and skinny, but nice, sort of a wide, almost crecent moon, blade like look.  The other end (after a long straight wooden middle looks like a wooden lightnig bolt.  It's hard to discribe, but definately a sharp (no pun) looking weapon.   I think it has a great ratio and is certainly a fun toy.  <br />
<br />
What server are you on Naazgruul?  How much are you spending on it?  I have heard some pretty wide range of price on it (anywhere from 1k - 10k)  So I would be interested in learning more about it's true value.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
Widda</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">WOOHOO...a nice 2hb that actually has a great graphic.  I know exactly the one you're talking about now.<br />
<br />
I'm on tribunal.  Haven't really done any pricing on them, but I'll check it out tonight.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">another 2hb which was mentioned above, the groaning mace, looks insanely kick ass also. its huge and has a 4 pronged claw on the end. not too bad stats either 23/44, 5 str, 5 wis, 40 mana.<br />
<br />
if you haste yourself you can do some serious damage. my 2hb is in the basement and i still hit for 25-40 every time. <br />
<br />
cake to get too, its off a groaning shadow in twilight. just a long camp if it's not up. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Tarmok Battle Staff is nice, also<br />
<br />
2hb, 33/44, +12 Str, +5 Bane vs Plants.<br />
<br />
Perfect for Fungus Grove, tho I still prefer my whackamole mallet for the fireworks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I got to ask, what is a Wackamole Mallet?  Hehe, i love the visual that forms in my head when I read the name, but please tell me what exactely is it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
Widda</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Sorry, it's what I call my Barbarian Spiritist's Hammer.<br />
<br />
It just.. fits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have a Mortificator staff.  But it used to be uber now it sucks.  There are 1hb now with higher damage and less delay. Heck a centi hammer has almost the same dam/del ratio and its 1hb.  <br />
<br />
But my MS has +7wis and it looks like a skull on a stick.  So I got that going for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">'nother vote for the tarmok stick. Had one for a long time, works great in fungus grove.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I like my velium brawl stick for a 2hb. 30/40 and a evil looking graphic.</div></div><hr />
