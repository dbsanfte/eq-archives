<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just thinking of this and I know it would never be put in but just like to hear opinions.<br />
<br />
Wouldnt it be nice if you have a 2-10% chance on landing a critical slow? I mean after all, at higher levels this is one of our class defining abilities.<br />
<br />
You can make it like an AA ability like 2pts-2% 4pts-5% 6pts-10% and you have a chance on Slowing a mob by 80-125 percent or something similar to the effects.<br />
<br />
I think this would be nice addition to our class and wouldnt be overbalancing IMO (I think) and of course we dont need it but never the less it would define out class alittle better.<br />
<br />
/shrug not saying its a good idea or anything, just want to hear opinions on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think these days mobs, are either made to be slowed through normal debuff means, or not all, despite no immune flag or with one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">he is not suggesting that we could slow mob's flagged unlowable.  Rather, when a slow lands, it could &quot;crit&quot; for a greater amount of slowing - i.e. slowing 80% (or more) instead of 75%.<br />
<br />
sounds fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think a critical slow would be unbalancing.  The two most powerfull spells in the game are Turgur's and CH.  Critical CHs are neat to see the big numbers but don't have any lasting benefit.  If you got a critical Turgur's the benefit would last for the full 6 minutes of the spell and make that particular combat a push over.   Currently mobs are being made with the assumption that a shaman will come along &amp; slow them and the entire encounter is based around that fact.  When they tag a mob as unslowable, the damage output isn't as high.<br />
<br />
Personally I think anything that improves slowing abilities has to be looked at very carefully and I'm willing to bet slow causes as many problems for VI making new content as CH does.<br />

I know.  I'm pointing out that if a mob isn't meant to be slowed with or without an immune flag, it's not meant to be slowed.   Mobs that are slowable, 75% is good enough.   Anymore, then mobs will get retuned for difficulty.   Before immunity came out, this would have been a good idea against those mobs that would resist slow 20 times, but you were still determined to keep trying.</div></div><hr />

Just wondering what a 125% slow would be.  If a 75% slow means the mob hits only 25% as fast as it was, then a 125% slow would mean the mob was hitting -25% of what it was.</div></div><hr />

Speaking of, how does slow work?  75% slow, but from what?  Hits per 100 ticks?  Delay increase by 75%?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good point Gard, hehe I wasnt thinking.  I guess it would be alittle overpowering now that I really gave it some thought, maybe a critical slow of an extra 5% wouldnt be bad however, say having a 2 percent chance of slowing a mob to 77% would be alittle more balancing.<br />
<br />
But you guys are right, 100% would be overbalancing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">But you guys are right, 100% would be overbalancing. <br />
<br />
you do realize that if a mob is 100% slowed, it's er, not hitting, right?<br />
<br />
75% slow=75% dmg reduction, i.e. it's hitting 25% as much as normal<br />
<br />
critical slow? how about: no!  :)<br />
slow is already overpowering as it is, 75% slow and ch=the two most broken spells in eq</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would rather see a manaburn type of slow spell that is unresistable and does maybe 50% slow.<br />
<br />
Drains all your mana, big aggro, and is a very high AA ability.  This would give shaman something to do with their AA, other than Canni 5 and Quick Buff.  Rest are pretty useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Janin2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">No....imagine you have 4 shamans on Aten Ha Ra, or any other slowable mob for that matter, then they will all just take turns on casting slow till a critical one lands? That way you could basically keep any ubermob at, say 95% slower attack speed.<br />
That is not the purpose of a critical spell, you can only apply the critical hit to direct spells, ie heals and dd's</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kytra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Perhaps an AA that gives shaman an unresistable slow every two hours? Might seem unbalancing, but wouldn't help much in most raid situations and wouldn't work on mobs tagged immune.<br />
<br />
IE, Dark Masters in Umbral Planes are immune, so couldn't be targetted. However, Black Reavers in CoM could be slowed with it.<br />

<br />
<br />
If it is only a 2 percent chance of a crit there is no way in hell I am gonna try and slow the mob till it crits - I already have aggro for long enough if I have to cast slow 3 maybe 4 times - having to cast it on average 12.5 times (i.e. there are 4 of us) would mean a lot of dead shammies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Odinson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">How about a Lure based, irresistable low agro type 50% slow?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I can't see how a critical slow would affect my raiding much.  There's only a chance for it to land, so we wouldn't set up a raid with fewer clerics or MA's with less AC and H{'s because of it.  To do so would be suicide.  My regular slow stops TPW's from happening when it lands, and all this would prevent is possibly another MA death when the cleric CH rotation's not going as well as it should.<br />
<br />
Verant already gave us a virtually irresistable slow.  It's called PoI,  Few mobs have the kind of DR as they do MR so it's rarely resisted.  Not slow enough for ya?  Irresistable and 75% would mean that one group could take down the smaller NToV dragons, and Verant wouldn't want THAT (and neither would I, think of the competition).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Either the mob is slowable or unslowable.  Not much in between anymore.  <br />
Giving shamans abilities to slow mobs that are unslowable would &quot;break&quot; those mobs balance wise for the entire raid, and thus the game. <br />
<br />
Sorry this idea has no merit, and it's not a skill or ability I'd want in the first place.  <br />
<br />
Try again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Malaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">one group could take down the smaller NToV dragons <br />
<br />
<br />
uh no :)<br />
<br />
Or rape drakes would have to be down,roy too etc...<br />
<br />
And most ntov dragons are slowable anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Yes, you CAN slow most NToV dragons, but you build up so much aggro that you often would be killed.  This would be my single group:<br />
<br />
Tank<br />
Cleic x 2<br />
Chanter<br />
Wizzie<br />
Shammy<br />
<br />
With that combo, you don't have enough CH's to keep the tank alive without aggroing the mob onto the cleric, without a slow hitting RIGHT from the begining.  However, you're right that the flurry drakes would be a pain while they're on patrol......</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought it might be a good idea but I had doubts which is why I asked for everyones opinions.<br />
<br />
No biggie, just a different topic to discuss. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Uthgar:<br />
<br />
In my opinion 75% slow is just a big of a game design problem as CH is.  When new encounters are being made, the designers are counting on the mob doing it's full damage for a handfull of seconds, then it will be doing a significantly reduced rate.  For 250 mana we are preventing *how* much damage over the length of the fight??<br />
<br />
Hands down, CH and Slow are the two most powerfull spells in the game, KEI is a very close 3rd but only because it doesn't mitigate damage coming in but instead allows an encounter to be taken on by fewer people.<br />
<br />
Taladaen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">why slow is overpowered? think, picture yourself as a dev. here you are trying to make an encounter, say an xp spot, now this place has to be doable without a slower, this means it cant have too large dmg output but still has to present a challenge of sorts.<br />
<br />
now picture the spot with a slower, to present any form of challenge at all, you gotta have huge base dmg output.<br />
i mean, youre reducing this thing to a kitty compared to what it originally was no matter how you look at it.<br />
<br />
so, due to slow being a basically permanent 75% reduction in dmg, you have to scale mobs up more than what you'd normally do, making clerics ch basically the only way if you have no slower.<br />
while with a slower a cleric is basically useless.<br />
nice evil circle.<br />
(the other way 'round, if you make mobs too easy, the slower is worthless, like hs to a certain degree)<br />
<br />
clumsily written and of course not the whole truth, simplified and such, but mainly this would be true.<br />
<br />
exception is ct, where you would want both a slower and a cleric in most cases, however you can perfectly well manage without the cleric, but without the slower i think you'll have problems.<br />
<br />
hm, hope i got the point through, not sure i understood what i wrote myself! :)<br />
<br />
<br />
edit btw, youre aware that kei=twice my normal standing regen, while a bard can triple? it, not to mention modrods, kei is a bonus when it comes to raids, not the key to much of anything :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gloobonious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">The type of slow I'd like to see, AAXP-based:<br />
<br />
&quot;Scourge of Insects&quot;<br />
<br />
Basically, an unresistable 25% slow with a duration around one minute. Mobs flagged immune to slow still maintain their immunity to this.<br />
<br />
There are very few ubermobs that just &quot;resist&quot; slow completely, over being flagged immune. What comes to mind are Telkoroner/Gozzrem/Lelandaria the Keeper in WToV, Lord Kreizenn in NToV, and Black Reavers in CoM. Essenitally, on an ubermob with full MR (but not slow immunity), it would be a small ease into getting a CH rotation set up. Hell, it would even work on slowable mobs to get started, while the Shamans try to land Turgur's. It should have a 72+ minute reuse time for balance.<br />
<br />
Really isn't anything overpowering about it. Hell, it's AAXP actually worth working for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Blacklace:<br />
<br />
When I mean mobs are tuned with the assumption of being slowed, I mean more specifically Boss mobs.  Raid encounters they plan on the mob being slowed.<br />
<br />
Taladaen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Or we could even ask for an AA to reduce our resists rate on slows (much like reducing fail rate on Alchemy...  Heck, REPLACE that one so I don't blow so much money thinking I can possibly make clarity potions and get a return)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Krelic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">What do you guys think of a slow over time spell?<br />
<br />
20% each tick for 5 ticks.<br />
<br />
So, it goes, 20%, 40% up to 100%<br />
<br />
The mob would not be hitting for 6 seconds, but hitting faster than turgurs for 18 seconds.<br />
<br />
Plus it would need a refresh, every 30 seconds or so. <br />
<br />
Would people use it for the 12 second advantage, and the huge 6 seconds no hit advantage?<br />
<br />
The disadvantages are:<br />
18 seconds hitting faster than normal<br />
Needs to be recasted every 30 seconds<br />
<br />
Where would this be used? On high end encounters, or mostly group encounters?<br />
<br />
Krelic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">ah, yes taladaen, but these are single mobs, you could just as easily say that a mob is balanced so that you need a tank with more than 5k hp to tank it, sure it's true, but well, uh. <br />
without slow being in the game you'd just have the mob deal the 25% dmg as base. the balance issue isnt really visible here, that would be in xp grps, 'cos on raids you expect to have at least 1 shm present, in xp grps you might not(or an ench/bst)<br />
<br />
krelic: well, not at all? :) <br />
a persistant reliable dmg output from the mob is more important than the total dps for a raid, i'd say the same for xp grps. not hitting for 6 sec? sounds like fg/hs to me!<br />
i just dont see any advantages, sorry :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Claymoore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">just my opinion but.. if shaman were given an unresistable slow for AA ability, yes it would rock if yer a shaman but.. it would raise alot of class balacing issues like the whole deal with the 75% ch.. <br />
IMO what would be neat to see is if the proc on rabid bear added a disease based slow that stacked with turgur's.. maybe 5%.. just to make rabid bear a more viable option for shaman after getting canni 5.  the proc could be high resist too so it doesnt always land on every mob.. &lt;shrug&gt; im just digging for a reason to explain to my officers why i went rabid bear before MGB =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Krelic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">What if it starts at 60% then slows over time 6% for 5 ticks?<br />
<br />
Not as fast, but for 18 seconds, the mob is even much slower than usual, however requires a recast in 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
<br />
This would somewhat allow for some knowledge of how consistent the damage would be.<br />
<br />
60% bareminimum, provided that it is refreshed in time, compared to 75% all the time. Would this be enough trade off to use it on certain occasions, and even sometimes more frequently than Turgur's.<br />
<br />
It'd add a bit more excitement to slowing, because of the short duration, and improve some shaman scalability on raids. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">You can make it like an AA ability like 2pts-2% 4pts-5% 6pts-10% and you have a chance on Slowing a mob by 80-125 percent or something similar to the effects. <br />
<br />
<br />
it is impossible, since little increase on % is huge difference. Eg: 50% slow =  mob hit you only 1/2 of normal damage, 75% = 1/4, 80% = 1/5; 83.33% = 1/6 ; 85.7% = 1/7 ; 90% = 1/10, and 100% mean mob will never never hit you, <br />
<br />
if there are 125% slow, then you can crash EQ server everytime you cast it since it will cause bug to the code if allow 125% slow<br />
<br />
I really like to see some lure slow, or change the slow on PoI to 50%; it nice to have lure unresistable 25-35% slow which can cast on any target</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">haha claymoore, i didnt take rabid before mgb but i still have to  &quot;justify&quot; buying it twice a day :p<br />
<br />
krelic, while the idea isnt bad, i just dont see any room for it, unless some compelling reason was given to use it, say less resisted, real cheap or something similar, which would make it worthwhile for some xp grps. for raids, no, never, you dont stop healing the mt if he doesnt take hits for a few sec, but if he takes alot of hits over a short period you might not be able to keep up the healing, see what i mean?<br />
<br />
a long duration(turgursalike) slow, not very resisted and say 50-60% slow would be nice, you dont always need 75% and could use the mana elsewhere, but the casting time and duration on turgurs is so way superior as it is.</div></div><hr />
