<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Geddar was arguably one of the oldest and most talented shaman on the server. While a clown on chat, this guy was no joke. And it was thanks to his generosity that I got my first (but alas lost) Child's Tear. <br />
<br />
All the time past and I haven't forgotton you helping me, dude. You had that kind of impact on peeps. <br />
<br />
