<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hurry for a patch to fix a patch!!!<br />
<br />
btw, i have secondary forte.  i had spec alt at 200, and spec conj at 118 (bought the prefix to secondary forte.  unknowingly i might add.)<br />
<br />
i log in today to see ALL my spec skill at 49....i xped from about the time the servers came back up to just before the next patch with a petition in asking to at least fix my skills so everything could be where it should be....no response...spec conjuration 58, specialization alteration 109...<br />
<br />
anyone else have this issue?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Seems to be that way with everyone who got secondary forte early and got their second specialization skill up past 100.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Any idea what reason they brought down the servers for was?<br />
<br />
I doubt it was for something that was an inconvience for the players such as slapping all your specializations to 49.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Patch is to correct a crash bug.  Servers should be up again rather quickly. <br />
<br />
got this from newbie board</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Danemoth Spiritconvoker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The scrolling text messege in the chat room says we need to run the patcher again to download the spells file. Wonder what that could be?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, hopefully they fix the issue with Anguish enabled guilds not being able to enter Anguish.<br />
<br />
Seems their alteration of back-flagging methods may have broken a few things in the game.<br />
<br />
I didn't check my specializations but I will be when I log back in again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't know if it's related but our newly qvic flagged people where not able to zone into the zone tonight. I zoned in last night and could still zone in but the people that tried to do it tonight couldn't get in. Might be related to the same thing anguish was having problems with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sigh, perhaps servers will be back up by the time I have to go to work in the morning.<br />
<br />
Heard someone mention new loot in split paw on regular servers though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Guess my favorite part about patches, is seeing the new loot and stuff.  Felt almost like christmas checking out the new AAs that I got (or should say.. the AAs that I got back that I could spend on other stuff).  Also, a few items were updated, specifically stuff from Tacvi and the Zun Muram in Txevu.  My shield gained 25hp/45mana and 10 regen.<br />
<br />
Unfortunetly, today lucy wasn't working (not updating the new items), so haven't gotten a good chance to see what's been dropping.  Spent a little bit of time in qvic before (oh, had a person try to get into the raid and couldn't.. but that was mentioned before)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i received a reply to my petition after logging back into the game from the second patch...<br />
gm says my skills being nerfed back to 49 is WORKING AS INTENDED and there is nothing further they can do about this matter...i have a bit of a heated response i am waiting for yet another reply to....<br />
customer server....i laugh....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">well, it's not like it's that hard to get it back up to where it should be.  Give it a few days and it will be back to normal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">it isn't the point that it isn't hard to get back up.  it is the point that i sat there for a couple of hours and chain casted the get my spec skills up. i am sure other did as well. and now they are gone because of a bug fix, when the bug was beyond the players control. literally beyond our control.<br />
<br />
btw, gm respons to me when i asked if this is the same result everyone is going to have through petition was yes.  pritty much tough ****, sit there and cast minor healing for 2 or 3 hours straight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Balkamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm dying to know.... How badly did they break bards?<br />
<br />
Heck, haven't been able log on in 2 days, much less see what got fuxxored.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">So far nothing i saw broken on my bard and love melody too. Was a pleasure to twist 4 songs with no effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">And yet again the servers are coming down.<br />
<br />
Ok, really whats up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">On Friday December 17, 2004 at 5AM PST (-8 UTC) all EverQuest servers will be coming down for a scheduled update. The expected downtime for this update is 7 hours.<br />
<br />
And I just hit warmly faction.../grumble. =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">And I just hit warmly faction.../grumble. =P<br />
<br />
/jealous - still kindly here... even after my 10-hour marathon session in MPG the other day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I just finished helping a group with a war, shm and clr by pulling the mobs off the walls near NC zoneline in DS. DS faction groups &lt;i&gt;pwn&lt;/i&gt;. =)<br />
<br />
Goodluck with your factioning though. I still have to do it on my cleric...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well, they have been having extreme problems with the 85/15 rule in getting people into certain zones.  It has not worked at all.  They were supposed to take the servers down the night before, but wasn't able to fix the problem that existed.  I'm sure this is what the patch is fixing/trying to fix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>drib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Heh, I don't miss EQ at all anymore.  They fired Vannoth and they mucked up another patch.  Same ole same ole.</div></div><hr />
