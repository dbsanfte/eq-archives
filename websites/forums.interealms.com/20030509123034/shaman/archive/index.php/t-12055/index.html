<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've seen a ton of people asking advice on &quot;should I do AAs or go to 60/65?&quot;.  Generally, people answer these questions based on the criteria of &quot;which will increase the shaman's power level more?&quot;.  I personally would rather answer it based on &quot;how much time is it gonna take to do my AAs?  At the moment, I don't care about how powerful I am in an absolute sense.  I just care how powerful I am compared with the XP mobs I'm fighting.<br />
<br />
So here's the question.  What AA rates can you get solo at various levels?  Grouped?  Please give specific camps and what strategy you use along with what gear is a prereq for that rate.  Perhaps a nice chart like this would help people out.  This might be better off in hunting grounds eventually, but since it's kind of a theoretical discussion about AA rates at the moment, I'm posting here.  Can always move it later if it turns into a useful resource.<br />
<br />

65     1.5 hrs  BoT               ?       <br />
<br />
<br />
At level 58:<br />
<br />
The only place I've done AA is Nathyn's Guards in Katta.  Next time I hunt there, I'll note down exactly the rate I am seeing, but it seems as though I can do a full AA in about 3 hours there solo.  I tank for the pet on my horse, slow the mob, use bane of nife and jbb for damage.<br />
<br />
I was XPing in a full group on some guardian things in PoI the other day and got about 30% regular XP at level 58 in about 3 hours.  I'm guessing that probably would have been more than a full AA per 3 hours.  I was slowing, sending in the pet, and using torrent of poison in addition to the usual buffing tasks.<br />
<br />
Considering that I get no significant power boost at all at 59, I assume that dinging 59 won't increase my kill rate any, and in fact might slow it down as more things become light blue.  And I don't really see much in the way of offensive spells at 60 either, except the extra mana regen that torpor would bring possibly allowing an extra nuke or something.  Again though, dinging 60 starts greening more things out.  Looks to me like the next bump in solo offensive power after 58 is 61 for the new pet.</div></div><hr />

53       3.5 hours  HHK Solo            Horse, JBB, Dog<br />
<br />
When I started doing aaxp in HHK I had just returned from an absance and was naked.  I did 52 aaxp in HHK before moving on and towards the end It was taking about 3.5 hours each.<br />
<br />
I did take a short trip up to 55 to spend some and then back down to 53 to grind another 30.<br />
<br />
I did an one more aaxp at 59 in Katta for the final point I wanted for QB2 but even with Can V and Krags it took about 4 hours instead of the 3 reported above for level 58.  A lot of guards went light blue at 59.</div></div><hr />

<br />
nope, Ive tested it.... if it were true then deleveling to get more AA wouldnt be an issue :(.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First, I have hunted in these places.  It takes me at least twice as long to get an AA and I have all the toys (horse, fungi, JBB, epic, snare necklace, and alpha).<br />
<br />
Second, last time I checked an AA was based on exp for level 51.  As long as a mob doesn't turn green on you, its going to fill up AAs at the same rate no matter what level you are.   The more you level, the faster you can get AAs because you can take on higher level mobs.<br />
<br />
Third, exp penalties (for being a troll like me) have no impact on AA progress.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Humm...  I had 10 aaxp at 60 and then I sold my exp bar to a necro and quite playing my shaman. <br />
<br />
At this time I had run3  regn3 and MC1 with 2 in the bank.<br />
<br />
I then quite the game for a while and when I came back I started my shaman up again.<br />
<br />
It was very strange because when I loged him back in I had a total of 5 aaxp<br />
<br />
rgn3 and chaneling focus 1<br />
<br />
I have no idea how this hapend but I was naked and level 51.<br />
<br />
I then went to HHK and got right to work farming both cash and aaxp.  After a while my missing 5 aaxp points came back so I spent 3 on run3 again.<br />
<br />
Over time I baught a buch of drop equipment and farmed another 22 aaxp so I went up to level 55 and spent the 24 I now had in the bank.<br />
<br />
I now had run3 rgn3 mc3 scr3 and cf1.<br />
<br />
Then I went back down to 53 to grind some more aaxp while I continued to rake in the plat to cloth my sexy Ogre body.  After maxing out at 30, and getting my equipment into reasonable shape I leveled out of HHK.<br />
<br />
When I hit 59 I baught Can V, scrm, mgb, and qb1 for 25 aa and then I did another point so I could get qb2.<br />
<br />
I am now almost 61 with 63 AA and I am so very glad that I took the time to farm for equipment.  The entire process took about 3 months and I am now having a great time playing my shaman again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is an exp bonus(I believe only post 50) for mobs within 5 levels or yourself.  Grouped in PoP I would get about 1 % AA per kill until the mobs were more than 5 levels below me, then would take 3 to 5 to get that same 1 %.  The number I have heard is 15 million exp points per AA, and that number stays the same from your first AA to your last(the exact number is not important, the fact it remains the same is).</div></div><hr />

HHK at 53 was great.   Some of the nobles / isa where going light blue but not a lot and I could kill them very fast.  At 54 a lot more where light blue and aa exp rate droped off quite a bit.  At 55 the bards go LB and the Captain goes LB.  53 seamed to be optimal.  I would kill Isa / Bards / 2nd floor nobles / 3rd floor noble / and sometimes the Captain from time to time when waiting on pops.  Cash was very nice from all the guards who each drop a FS short sward so I would keep a lot of guards dead also.</div></div><hr />

With the ocastional 7% witch I think came from the % almost being filled from the kill befor. At 65 I avarge 2% a kill from them. With a few 1% and a rare 3% witch once agine I think is from almost haveing the % filled from befor. In HoH I avrage 6% per kill.. I didnt go stright to 65. I would lv then do AA's for a bit staying at 10%lv 90%AA on my xp. 63 is a good lv to hang out in i was getting 4-5% per worm in PoV. My 2boxed clr is 63 and with both chars at 100% AA he seems to make 15-20% AA more then the shm per point. This would come out to about Shm 5 points per the Clr 6 points. What I did a lot was pick what skills I wanted to max each lv then when they are done I would get my next lv get 20% xp into it then go back to 10/90 till my next batch  of skills where maxed.</div></div><hr />

Fastest was 35-40 mins duo with CoD ench friend, groups i build from guild/alliance can usually make a steady aa in 70-80mins or so with No Charming.<br />

Rarely over 90 mins an AA these days overall.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The key thing is to keep fighting mobs within 5 levels so you get the XP bonus. Otherwise, things start to get very slow. Other than that, I'd say the AA gets faster and faster as you level.<br />
<br />
You're right that 59 makes very little difference, its a crap level for shaman. At 60, torpor makes a massive difference for soloing. 61, as you surmise, is a biggy with the new pet and other nice spells. 62 for the fast heal is also significant although that's primarily of use in a group or duo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">level 55 solo Jaggedpine aa/3hr<br />

level 60 solo hobgoblins ~5%/kill <br />
level 64 duo with druid(63) charmer in PoN aa/2hrs (hobgoblins)<br />
<br />
I believe nettlings and hobgoblins are both 55.  I attribute the steep drop off to the loss of the level bonus you get for fighting closer to your level.  For exp reasons, PoN isn't too hot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I only grind aa's in PoF past fennin trigger now simply because nothing else can compare to the exp I get there solo. I pull the lvl 68 guards and kill them on the ramp. Each kill takes approximatly 6 minutes, which means that I kill one guard every 8 min or so on average. <br />
<br />
aa rate = one aa per 40-45min at lvl65</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Juka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Just hit 65 the other day and thought I could chip in with some information which may / may not be useful:<br />
<br />
At 65 with epic, malo / torpor / pox / bane, no horse, fairly decent gear, I can make about 1 AA in 2 - 2.5 hours in PoV soloing razorfiends in outer / inner caves. This is with KEI / tranq / VoQ however, and the occasional add mob can greatly reduce this rate when you need to gate.<br />
<br />
At 65 grouped in inner / outer caves in PoV, my average AA clocks in around 1h 30 minutes, give or take 10-15 minutes depending on group composition (and whether Sleepwalker pops). <br />
<br />
Plane of Storms XP is comparable to PoV, except the mobs seem harder for some reason - I don't believe they are, but they feel that way.<br />
<br />
I didn't get flagged for PoV / PoS until level 63, where it was EXTREMELY slow going in PoN / PoD for AAXP, let alone regular XP. The gargoyles in PoN and crawlers in the courtyard area of PoD which gave 5% AA per kill at 62 dropped to about 1% AA per kill once I dinged 63.<br />
<br />
If I had breath of ultor and blood of saryn, I think I could grind an AA solo in about 1h 45 mins in PoV / PoS. I'm currently working on BoT and other flags, so I can't chip in any other information about those zones.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">where are you soloing in tactics?  i have been able to do some of the stuff by zone in and in the pit, but it is risky.  some of the mobs are slow midigated and run sow/close to sow speed.  in general i found it not worth doing, but i may just be missing something.<br />
tactics is in general empty on xegony so any advice would be great.<br />
<br />
also, in general charting AA timeing by just zone is pritty tough unless your talking about haveing horse/fullspellbook/similar tactics/similar AAs/same lvl pc/focus items.<br />
i am 65, have an exstened affliction 4 item, am missing ancient bane and our 65 dot, but have VP1/SC1/Canni V.  I have been doing about 1 hour to 1 hour 15 min AAs in hoh (can do about 4 mobs before respawn).  I could see frogs in PoS being a little better if they were not always camped.  I have pritty good MR so sometimes i solo the BoT courtyard (aa here can vary since they are clerics that don't always heal, but sometimes have endless healing mana...).  solo AA in bot is about the same as hoh from what i have seen.  ie 6% or so a kill.</div></div><hr />
