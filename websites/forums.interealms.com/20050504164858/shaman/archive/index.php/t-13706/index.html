<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sekin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Some might consider differently, but to me the good news is:<br />
<br />
Your bank got 2 extra slots to be shared by all characters in that same account and server. Of course, nodrop items cannot put in those slots.<br />
<br />
The bad news:<br />
<br />
We can no longer cast high level spells to low level players via a group buff.<br />
<br />
Both are currently happening on Test.<br />
<br />
Which is good, which is bad? You be the judge.<br />

<br />
the second one, will deifntally change the game, no longer will i dread venturing into the nexus/pok for dread of being sent tells asking for ever buff we can cast under the sun.  clerics have it easy, u want virute, gimmie cash, chanters have it easy, people are constantally spamming either looking for, or casting kei, etc.  however when people come up to me demanding  focus, agil, stam, ac, sow, haste, regen, and then drop 10 plat in my trade window, if that, f*** that, i'm glad to see this change go into effect because now when playing with my lower friend/guildies/twinks i won't have to worry about people saying , &quot;hold on a second, my kei just faded i'll be right back&quot; F*** that, i did it the first time without kei, without aego, and i'm sick and tired of being spammed, harrassed, begged for buffs that these new breeds of lowbie are to afraid of venturing into the outside world, let alone dungeon with out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">unfortunately with the change to buffs casting Focus of Soul will no longer be lucrative in any way. about 70% of my customers were below the 46 mark. Not sure why, but thats how it worked out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">First one is hella nice (although kinda useless to me since I dual box), second one is a double-edged sword.  On one hand it will greatly lessen the buff beg tells, on the other, it dulls the efficiency of dual-box plvling (something I enjoy doing).<br />
<br />
Guess it all depends on how it plays out in the end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Two-box PL is still going to be fine for melee and anybody under 25 (you can treat casters as melee when PLing as a shaman until then).<br />
<br />
When PLing casters over 25, do it the old-fashioned way: find a melee of appropriate level and PL both at the same time.  Melee gets more XP than he would have, your caster can sit down and do squat but still levels.  Maybe not as interesting as doing it yourself, but it works.<br />
<br />
Once you get to 43, group with your caster and kill greenies (to you).  Caster gets the XP and will fly.  I got my druid from 43-45 VERY quickly just sitting with me on VT shard camps, mostly green to my 62 shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tappion Zek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">What youngsters? Maybe 1 out of every 300 people i meet is a truely new player, and normally they have one or two RL friends who play so it's not like they are new in a true sense.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ailith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Guild members summed it up well. My feelings - all high level buffs/kei, etc should be nerfed so the lower the level, the less it really benefits (like with the &quot;recommended&quot; level on items). It may reduce the number of Alts a person has - not sure.<br />
This will slow the &quot;PL-ing to 50 in 5 hours&quot;, but it won't stop it - there will always be a way around it. If someone is going to PL any character, they're missing out on the point of the game - ROLEPLAYING! Learn how to play the character, suffer from the weak points and benefit from the strong points of the class!<br />
Just my humble (and probably insignificant) opinion.<br />
<br />
Cheers!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tappion Zek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">this isn't an RPG anymore, even firiona vie is only about 50% roleplaying. Lower levels are boring, i know all the classes, it won't help me to grind out for months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kunderu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I love the idea of the first one but am kinda torn on the second one..<br />
<br />
But if there is no casting higher lvl buffs on lower levels I think I will survive, thats why I have a shammy now on the new server Stromm because it is simular to the way things were in the begining, everyone is actually working on the newb quests and working on thier trade skills, there is no kei or aego yet. people are paying for what buffs they can get even if it is only a few gold, it is better than nothing on the new server and also there is still no real ecomomy</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't want to think about the programming nightmare this would cause.  It was tough enough for them to to the armor recommended levels, on spells, it would be much harder.  And then there's the question of server-side lag...  I wonder if this would make that worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Eluj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I think they are both great ideas. I normally go without KEI and to try to keep up with the Kei enhanced guys is tough.<br />
<br />
Of course every now and then, for a treat, I will get myself a KEI... then when it runs out... the shaking starts :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Itun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">No more C3 on players lower than 43....NERF BAT!!<br />
<br />
I think that's a bad idea and WAY too many KEI users are too addicted to the C3 buff which would cause a major uproar among the casting players.<br />
<br />
Buffing is a way of life and always has been for over 4 years now, expecially for the 2 or 3 boxers out there. Why would SOE throw away money from their customers if the made 2-3 boxers obsolete if they can't buff their other accounts? <br />
<br />
SOE's goal should be making money, not throwing away money.<br />
<br />
This nerf bat is not helping SOE meet their goals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I personally Love both of these changes. I get tired of getting tells from greeny monks asking for buffs. 95% of my sub lvl 43 buff spells have been deleted from my spell book. Now I can just say &quot;You are to low level to ask me for buffs!&quot; :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">There are some new players, but I feel bad for them.  I was in Upper G a few weeks back and some mid 20's player was LFG.  Only people there were me and my alt, and some guy camping something.  I talked to the guy a while, and he was talking about how it was very difficult for him to get a group anywhere.  All the zones I could suggest were equally empty of real players.  I offered to PL him a bit, but he didn't want PLed, he wanted to play EQ.  EQ must really suck badly for new players like that.  I am a Kunark era player, but there were always people around my level to group with in UG-CT-LG-Seb etc.  NOw there just aren't.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, if buffs help guys like that shoot up to their 40's where they can actualy find people to play with, I guess I am opposed to the buff nerf.  Even though in theory I like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Falyin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The way I see it, KEI doesn't make the game easier, it makes the game faster. While people INSIST that sitting on your butt medding (for non-shamans of course) is important to learning your class, I disagree. I was playing an alt wiz on occasion, and he is 38 now. He will likely stay that way. <br />
<br />
Impatient? Perhaps... but my time is too valuable to just *Sit and Med* for no reason besides sitting and medding. <br />
<br />
The idea is sound, really, I just don't really feel medding should be such a long boring process, especially at low levels =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Doesnt bother me. When I was leveling my warrior, I got tired of grouping, casting all the group buffs, disbanding everytime one of them faded (and they fade at different times of course). So, I just dug into the back of my book and pulled up all the best buffs that I could put on him regardless of level and put them on page 5 or so. Now if I ever want to powerlevel I just have to flip a few pages back and they're all in the same spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">KEI for low levels was always overkill. Now low level Chanters have a purpose for their lower level mind buffs again. Remember when Clarity was wanted or even when Breeze was nice to have since it was better than nothing?<br />
<br />
Hopefully with the low levels not getting KEI anymore this will create less rushes when only one chanter is in the Nexus or PoK casting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Khayla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">A change like this will always cause an uproar.<br />
<br />
On one side the arena, you have the opposing team and their arguments:<br />
a)  Medding is boring, Kei helps me med faster and &quot;be active&quot; more than sitting on my butt.<br />
b)  Kei/Virtue/Focus helps me PL my bot/alt/friend/self/guild/etc and you level faster to reach the so-called &quot;fun&quot; part of the game..i.e. high end.<br />
c)  High level enchanters/clerics will lose their most lucrative money maker.<br />
<br />
On the other side, you have the supportive team:<br />
a)  Low level enchanters can now feel more valuable and actually get groups.  Clarity will once again be wanted *gasp*.<br />
b)  Less spam for buffs from lowbies.   I think a lot of us 60+ shamans know what thats like, and enchanters/clerics have it just as bad or worse.<br />
c)  No more &quot;Kei gone BRB&quot; from your group's level 20 cleric before he gates out of the zone for his fix.<br />
<br />
<br />
To me, the KEI revolution has gotten way out of hand, and the Virtue revolution is quickly headed that way.  This is not a nerf, its fixing a bug that we've been allowed to enjoy for months, a bug that has spoiled us, our alts, and yes I've been spoiled also :)  <br />
<br />
Yes, to some the low levels sucks...ever hear of &quot;Clarity&quot;, &quot;Symbol&quot;, and other such obsolete spells?   Yeah, they do still exist.<br />
<br />
As for the shared slots issue, its about time!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Nakukak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">The bad news:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">It's all good to me<br />
<br />
Much as I enjoyed inviting 5 low level characters and casting all my group spells including blessing of replenishment. As far as I'm concerned, this is a bug fix. It'll be annoying to dig for old spells to buff lowbies but I'll live.<br />
<br />
Think of the low level classes who cast these spell types. After all, to quote an ancient and rather sexist joke.... It's a lot easier to go get a pint of milk at the corner store than to have a cow in the back yard.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I wonder if the loss of  business will make KEI harder to come by in the Nexus for high level folks?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I think the high level buff thing may cause so many accounts to be cancelled they may back down on it.  I rarely if ever have KEI myself, but I am 59 so I would continue to be able to get it if I wanted it.<br />
<br />
If the change does happen, I guess it will not be worth it for me to get MGB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">thumbs up, good change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Yeah MGB would be a raid tool, as it was originally intended.<br />
<br />
Honestly, the buff change's bark will probably be worse than its bite.  Also, if VI sees that it is that unpopular of a decision, they may reverse it or alter it in some way.<br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
Again, it all comes down to how it actually plays out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Hey I still go to get my fix of KEI. Thats mainly because I don't want to sit on my ass and med after every pull or after I buff everyone.<br />
<br />
If they want to change it make me regen mana twice as fast, then I'll be happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">First change ... thumbs up.<br />
<br />
Second change ... I have one problem with.  Clarity and even Clarity II were designed to help with mana regen back when the gear in those eras had much less mana.  There are probably many mid-30s twinks out there wearing level appropriate gear (required level 25, 35, etc.) with more mana than I had on my 50th level enchanter back when Clarity was all there was to be had.  Clarity simply will not cut it with today's gear choices.  And sure, those lower level toons can suck up and grab the gear from the old world, but what will they be able to kill then?  Luclin mobs?  I think not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Surely it doesn't take more mana to kill the same mob now than it did when we only had old-world gear, so the med time will be the same.  We were just medding from 0m, while the people with today's gear are medding from 50m...  And the gear realistically has better ac and other stats too, so they're probably really using less mana per mob.<br />
<br />
I think it's a good change  --  Being able to have a lvl 1 with 2khp and insane mana regen was just... wrong.   ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Sgt McDuff:  Attention Company!  I have good news and bad news, which do you want to hear first?<br />
<br />
Company:  Good news, Sir!<br />
<br />
Sgt McDuff: Alright, the good news is that everyone here will get a change of underwear!<br />
<br />
Company:  Hurray!<br />
<br />
Sgt McDuff: Now for the bad news, you change with you, you change with you, you change with you......<br />
<br />
But yeah, on a more serious note, both changes are good from my viewpoint.  I can still buy a KEI/Aego whenever I want (assuming I'm too lazy to load up a cleric and enchanter), and if I decide to start another twink, I'll just have to be a bit more careful when PLing it.<br />
<br />
Being spammed by annoying_beggar_01 for buffs when playing a cleric/enchanter is bad enough without throwing in all of the level 12's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">First one is hella nice (although kinda useless to me since I dual box)<br />
<br />
I dunno, I have kind of grown tired of transfering 80 bricks of Velium from account to the other and then back :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I agree that KEI for lower level players was overpowered, but yes, it does take more mana to kill a level 30 Velious or Luclin mob than it does to kill a frog in LGuk.  The gear these days has catered to that fact, but in doing so, it has increased mana pool sizes, while not increasing mana regen capabilities at all, without C3.  <br />
<br />
Like I said, C3 IS overpowered, but I think Clarity should be given a slightly better regen, or maybe caster self-buffs get a mana regen component, much like wizzy familiars.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Yeah, but they can kill those same frogs in lguk and get the same exp we got way back when (actually faster due to better gear).  Or they can kill the velious ones and use more mana, but get more exp per kill.  They still don't get my sympathy. :p  It's not a requirement that you should be able to level faster than was historically possible, but that happens just due to better gear anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Dasgood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">With star wars and EQ2 coming soon I bet that they want everyone play EQ to move to one of those games ... the problem is how do you get people to leave a never ending game?  You need to give them a sense of accomplishment as well as keeping them happy.  I bet the buff nerf wont go in .. it would just slow up people.  Crank them out and get them moving.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I personally would like to see the duration on KEI changed from 2.5 hours to 15 minutes.  I'd also like to see the mana cost lowered from 900 (or 1000 in the case of Tranquility) lowered to 150.<br />
<br />
Why?  Enchanters should be in groups, and they can't really get groups most of the time as things stand right now.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents.  Feel free to flame me, those of you addicted to KEI.  :)<br />
<br />
NOTE:  I play an enchanter as well.  I fully realize that such a change would permanently end the ever-enjoyable &quot;casting kei for donations&quot; routine (which, by the way, has financed a large number of upgrades for my shaman and my enchanter).</div></div><hr />
