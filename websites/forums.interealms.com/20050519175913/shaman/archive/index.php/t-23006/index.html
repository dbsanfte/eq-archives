Razco, I noticed you have not purchased pet affinity.  Heck, thats a really good one not having to buff fluffy (except for weapons) - well worth 20aa's for the high aa shaman.  Also advanced spirit call puppies put out way more smack than the old puppies.<br />
<br />
Now I'm not saying that either are amazing, but they are pretty darn nice.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>talabax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">remember those AA's we saw in the begging of God i wouldnt be surprsied if they added them. i bet we get some awful ones too. would be nice to get a fun AA like colon burst or something</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">More lung capacity!!!<br />
<br />
Innate levitation aa? (might be kind of fun?)<br />
<br />
I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't add *any* new AA's.  Well, aside from the extra buff slots and spell gem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Innate levitation aa? <br />
I'd spend AAs to resist unwanted Levitation effects, actually...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">These would make me happy as a shaman:)<br />
<br />
&quot;Mind over matter&quot; - The shaman has become so adept at his magical forces, that metals that used to hinder his abilities no longer effect his casting.  Allows the shaman to wear plate armor:)<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
&quot;Advanced Persistant Casting&quot;  - When activated, the shaman cast cast all spells with zero recast time for 30 seconds.  <br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
&quot;Aid of the Ancestors&quot; - Calls forth the ghosts of your ancestors to drain a target of life, distributing the health to your group evenly with each lifetap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">AAs could certainly be more creative and more fun.<br />
<br />
Deceitful Illusion:  15AA, 60 minute reuse, lasts until you zone.<br />
Turn into a random player race, with full abilities of that race (initial stats, regen, stun immunity, infravsion, etc).<br />
<br />
Skillful Mockery: 5/8/13AA, 5/8/13 minute duration, 120/90/60 minute reuse.<br />
Skillful mockery allows you to take on the form of a random NPC, but which NPC you turn into depends on your skill.  The first level would cover simple mobs from expansions EQ-Kunark.  The second level would expand the list to include basic mobs from the Velious-Luclin era, and the third level from the PoP era.  However, be forewarned, not all illusions are beneficial, so while you may be a juggernaut now, you may end up as a bush later.    But, a master of such illusions would be much more proficient at turning into EQ-Kunark era mobs than a novice, so his chance of turning into a bush would be far less.<br />
<br />
Enamored Gnome: 15AA, 5 minute duration, 50 minute reuse.<br />
Summon a gnome of the opposite? sex who instantly falls in love with your target.  For the next 5 minutes, that individual will here sweet nothings whispered into his/her ear, love poems written especially for them, or songs singing their praises.  What the enamored gnome will say and do is a mystery (based off target's class/race/AA count/level).<br />
Mystery Lover: 5AA.  <br />
Will it be a cute little gnome, a bearded dwarf, or a buxom young ogre.  You just don't know.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, those are the types of things I would have hoped to have seen.  So many AA dedicated to the powergamers, not enough to the people who like to enjoy themselves for 5 minutes out of the day.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I dont use doggy to much. He just doesnt have good enough dps and too few hp's to be worth recasting and rebuffing every 5  minutes because a incoming mob smacked him down.  Not worth the aa's to spend if even fully raid buffed, the dog goes down quicker than Richard Simmons at a N'sync concert. <br />
<br />
Advanced Spirit call looks alright, havent played much with the thought of buying it yet.  Saving some AA's up in hopes of something decent. If i get to 30 banked, i'll probably buy run 5 first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>talabax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Colon Burst This abilty causes your targets colon to burst rendering him/her immobile till he can recuperate from his little accident.<br />
<br />
Hulk This ability turns you into a incredible hulk quading 3000s with a proc that is serwide death touch. this ability is a upgrade to rabid bear.<br />
<br />
Hunger When you are low on mana you can eat your dog for 1000mana back reuse is instant.<br />
<br />
fun fun fun!</div></div><hr />

<br />
You perform a critical Agility (player becomes a cat, who's in heat, refuses to fight, and can only meow.  Gives off a strange odor, any animals in zone surround the player and attempt to mount him).<br />
