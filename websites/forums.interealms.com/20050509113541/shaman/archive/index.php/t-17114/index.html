<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've noticed two new slot 7 FT augs (FT 1 in EF, FT 2 in Guk).<br />
<br />
As just a couple of examples, I have an 8th Shawl (FT 3) and a Solstice Earring (FT 1).   Both items have a slot 7.    That's actually all the FT I have (4).<br />
<br />
When I saw the Slot 7 FT 1 aug in Mira (760pts)... I'm thinking I want to put it on gear that I know I'll keep for a good while.    Not in a raiding guild, no access to ele's, and only FT 4... it's a safe bet I'll be keeping my Solstice earring and 8th shawl for awhile.    So hey... why not make them better!     Turn the shawl into FT 4 and the Earring into FT 2 (Or save up even more and get the Ft 2 aug from Guk, but since I'm halfway opened in Mira for my 1476 armor, I figure I'll go that route, but anyhow....).<br />
<br />
This is where I get paranoid.... I petitioned this question, but got no answer.<br />
<br />
If I add an FT 1 aug into my Solstice Earring... will they stack?    I *know* FT stacks... that's not my question.    The paranoia in me says that maybe VI won't let existing FT effects on the SAME item, stack with an FT aug. <br />
<br />
I look at the 8th shawl... it takes a lot of work... but it's there for everyone if you want it... save up 1450 pts in Guk and you can turn that into an FT 5 item if they stack... that almost seems too good to be true....  760 pts in Guk makes it FT 4.<br />
<br />
I dunno... has anyone Aug's a slot 7 FT yet on an item that already had FT?    <br />
<br />
Does it say<br />
<br />
Effect : Flowing Thought 1<br />
Effect : Flowing Thought 1<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
Effect : Flowing Thought 2<br />
<br />
Before I invest the points I guess I just want to be sure... not like I don't trust VI or anything lol :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It should say:<br />
<br />
Effect : Flowing Thought 1<br />

<br />
Pretty sure it will look like that. If not, it's going to be fixed soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Why put it on the solstice earring?  Don't you have any other good gear that you don't plan to upgrade anytime soon?  <br />
<br />
Also, there's a slot 7 FT2 item in game also.  Why not shoot for that instead?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I rarely raid, nor am I rich, so honestly... given that I only have FT 4, the Solstice earring isn't leaving my ear anytime soon.   Same with the 8th Shawl.<br />
<br />
As to the Ft 2 aug... it costs twice as much, so no real point savings... yes, it's a better aug for the same slot,  but it also means I have to open up Guk to 1450.     FT 1's are in Everfrost where I'm opening up the 1476 armor anyhow.<br />
<br />
I don't live and breath LDON, I can dream of all the amazing setups I can do, but reality has to set in somewhere... I'll probably be playing Worlds of Warcraft before I can get every ideal piece of armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jorgan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I added the FT1 to my earring of the solstice.  It looks like this:<br />
<br />
Effect : Flowing Thought 1<br />
Effect : Flowing Thought 1<br />
<br />
I didn't hold out for the type 7 FT2 aug because people rarely do Guk on my server, and I would rather do Mir, Ruj, and Tak, before working on Guk if I had the choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I see no real need to upgrade my solstice earring any time soon, either.  I have other slots that need the attention a lot more.  But I can see upgrading it SOMEDAY, so I'm much more likely to put a good augment like that one, say, my Vindi BP, which I intend to wear until Time.</div></div><hr />
