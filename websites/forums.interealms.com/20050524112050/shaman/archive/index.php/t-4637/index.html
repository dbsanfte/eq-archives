<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I guess not what Clerics are asking for when they want something different, nice, but nothing new. A group Version of their Celestial Healing Line it seems.<br />
<br />
Might be good for AE Mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Lol, isn't group CH like 1100mana?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>koradin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Clerics already have their version of torpor its called Celestial Elixer and has been in game since kunark. A group version of CE is just a natural progression IMO, after all they do get group version of most of their spells anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">They also get some sort of big single shot heal, as well as Yaulp 5 and some new lvl 56 summoned hammer (no rent, no drop); which possibly might make it so they can melee effectively?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Racknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Bah, where's group torpor for shammy?<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah. They're getting a new heal to replace DL. Yaulp V is also 25 mana for 4 tics of an ATK bonus, a DEX bonus, stamina regen, 10 points of mana regen per tic and 25% haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rikkardo Montalban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Uuggghh, dont even say group torpor....<br />
<br />
Camping every guardian wurm that rears its ugly head for months and havent seen one drop.  I cant imagine the &quot;Fixed Drop Rate&quot; for group torpor.  Good thing I got some beers here....<br />
<br />
yeah yeah, I know its a &quot;What if&quot; kinda spell, dont give them any more ways to frustrate me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>WulfTyger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Cleric Group CE: 5.5 sec cast, 1050 mana, 1200 healed over 24 seconds.<br />
<br />
Cleric Group CH: 12 second cast, 1100 mana, Complete heal.<br />
<br />
If I was a cleric, I wouldn't be too thrilled about group CE. Since it's a heal over time, it's not something that would be used over fast casting heals to save someone. That being the case, why use it over group CH? <br />
<br />
They can keep that stupid 75% heal, I want group torpor =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah. They're getting a new heal to replace DL. Yaulp V is also 25 mana for 4 tics of an ATK bonus, a DEX bonus, stamina regen, 10 points of mana regen per tic and 25% haste.<br />
<br />
If this is how it went into the Spdat? then it's going to be like a cannibalize spell for clerics. They can chain cast it over and over and net an extra 15mana per cast.<br />
<br />
Love to see clerics doing the Yaulp Dance.</div></div><hr />

Group CE would create less agro then group CH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Like Kikak said, it &quot;should&quot; be less agroing to cast than group CH, or any CH for the matter.   I have no argument clerics getting this.  They are masters of healing, and nothing wrong with them having it.   Perhaps the new instant heals druids and shamans on Test won't be so damaging to clerics roles as first thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Maybe so Viscerator, but it's so painfully slow. That'd be worse than casting Cannibalize 1 over and over at level 60. I can't bear the thought of that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>extra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">actually, a little mana regen makes a lot of sense...this way they can get in, melee, have some fun, and still med a *little* bit of mana back, albiet slowly...i see no problem with this...actually would be cool if they upped the mana regen on it a bit, granted it shouldn't be an alternative to meditating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Group CE would probably be effected by spell haste effects, where as tmk group ch is uneffected because of the complete heal exclusion from haste.</div></div><hr />
