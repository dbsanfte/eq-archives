I am curious what level one needs to be to find a group in PoP zones.  Currently I am 47 - but I assume I may need a few more levels before finding groups in PoP.<br />
<br />
What level should I be?<br />
<br />
thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I started grouping there at 52.  At that low of a level it may take you a while to get a group in PoN.  If you can I would try and get a small group and go to PoJ and hunt rats guards and prisioners near zone out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I see people as low as early 50s in first tier pop zones... They are there because they hear about the incredible experience modifiers.<br />

Stick to old world zones for your 50s.  Do a dungeon or something.  Seb and Velks are good experience, even Karnors is good.  Loot in any of these places is better than anything you will see in first tier PoP.  Dragon Necropolis is a great place to hunt.  The Grey, Ssraa, Maidens Eye, Umbral, Ahkeva.... all of these will be green to you once you cross the line to 61.   Hunt them now while they are good experience and loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SilverD</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I started grouping in PoI at 51 and did pretty well.  Usually I cast malosi to start and give the tank some time to gain agro.  If that landed had almost no problems landing slow. <br />
<br />
The biggest problem I see now though, is that there are not as many 50ish people doing the planes anymore so it is getting harder to find a group.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">HHK is the best exp in the game until your 55.  At that level you can do pretty much any of the planes with little difficulty, and get groups pretty easy.  HHK is a far better place to go because of the cash aspect, and the fact that before 55, your going to have a hard time getting groups.  I made alot better exp there then i ever have down in pop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sorry but HHk is no where even close to the same exp.  I was doing hhk and getting less then 1% exp per kill at 52.  In pon killing yard trash fully grouped i was getting over 1% exp per kill and killing much faster.  Also HHk has 2 mobs worth any exp each on a 6 min timer.<br />
<br />
It is decent solo exp but if you want to get through the 50s you are going to be in PoP.</div></div><hr />
