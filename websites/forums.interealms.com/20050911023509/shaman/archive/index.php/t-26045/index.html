<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm thinking of switching alchemy/herbalism to engineering.  Although I might keep alchemy and just buy all my reagents in the AH, transmuting arcanite makes pretty good cash.  Anyways, I wanted some opinions on how valuable engineering would be for a PvP shaman.  <br />
<br />
Here's some items in interested in:<br />
Goblin Rocket Helmet<br />
http://www.thottbot.com/?i=11272<br />
Looks like it has a 30 second stun!!!  Breaks on contact but it seems absolutely fantastic for 2v1 situations or when you want to avoid getting ganked. <br />
<br />
Goblin Bomb Dispensor<br />
http://www.thottbot.com/?i=13716<br />
Free bomb to open up a battle<br />
<br />
Gnomish Mind Cotrol Cap<br />
http://www.thottbot.com/?i=11225<br />
Seems like a novelty but could be poetic justice against those bastard mind controlling priests in blackrock mtn.<br />
<br />
This along with an assortment of bombs looks like it could be really fun.  Can anyone with engineering recommend it and give me some other valuable items to go after?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Gnome is probably better for pvp, the net works pretty frequently, I have not seen the mind control  cap work yet, any engineer can use discombobulator, which is super, super neat in pvp and works most of the time, when you see a little green gnome it just makes you fall over laughing.<br />
<br />
Some people swear by the death ray, not used that either, my shaman will go gnome most likely. I only know what people do to me in pvp, net most common.<br />
<br />
Engineers can still transmute arcanite? What schematic is that? I must level my dude up then more, no arcane crystals being found lately, can make massive, massive cash selling heartseekers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No, I meant I might keep alchemy to do transmutes.  But then I'd have to buy all my engineering reagents in the AH instead of mining it myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Another question, can a goblin engineer use gnomish engineered items as long as he has the required skill?  Yeah I wouldnt be able to make them but could i buy them from gnomish engineer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Some can be cross used, depends if they are bind on pickup, pretty sure the mortar can be used by gnome engineers, but needs to be recharged by a golblin guy.<br />
<br />
I dunno, still newbie too man. Got tons of metal, just too lazy to crank it up, think I am 250-260 or so, not chosen a path yet.<br />
<br />
Mill</div></div><hr />
