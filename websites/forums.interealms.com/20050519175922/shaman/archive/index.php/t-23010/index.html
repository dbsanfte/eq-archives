<br />
I hardly post on this board i know, but i has been a great source of info for me, so cheers :)<br />
Quick question, im level 28 and my 1hb and peircing skills both need raising by about 40 points, im saving my training point to get alchemy going at 29. any tips on how to raise my meele skills?<br />
My magelo is below, everything i own i have earned and brought, this is my main character.<br />
At the moment im buffing myself and then hitting everfrost and tanking mammoths all the way, with a slow so they don't eat me for breakfast. is this the best way? or am i missing somthing?<br />
<br />
cheers for any advice or even conformation that the way im going is the only way.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I just meleed when I had to and leveled up whatever weapon I had.  <br />
When I got my Corpse grinder my 2HB was still at 70 skill or so.  I just would haste myself and melee whenever I had a chance.  I got 200 skill about 2 weeks after getting it.  Would have been quicker if I soloed a bit more during that time, and just meleed with Dog-Dog helping.<br />
<br />
Bottom line: don't stress too much about the skills.  when you get a good haste, haste yourself to melee as chances for skill-ups are determined per swing and haste gives you more swings per minute.  As a shaman you are not about melee damage and will eventually not have to melee much at all.  <br />
<br />
The way you are doing it will work fine, but worry more about your casting skills and making sure they are up to par at this point and don't worry too terribly much about the melee skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gaesekki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Cheap-o method incoming!<br />
<br />
Find a friend with pet hold, duel and whack it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>phatteydump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I sorta did what Kror said, just swing whenever you get a chance.  But as you get higher lvl you will not be getting a chance to melee very often.  I would be more worried about my defense skill personally.  According to your magelo tho you are doing pretty good with def.  Keep it up, that will be a harder but more productive skill then any offense skills you can get.  But if you want to skill up melee, just swing your stick.  Every grp you get into, after slow just run up and start hitting. Watch your agro tho, might want to let your tank swing a little before you go in :) With dog dog out you can send him in after slow and run in and swing away again, which will raise your def. too :)  Good luck young Heyokah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Loredan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">cheers guys, i shall continue to hit things with my club. :) <br />

28th Barb Shaman... nearly 29... come on new spells :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I only concentrated on piercing and 1hb until my 50s; when they were maxxed, I worked up my 2hb with a borrowed weapon... not that I've every had a desire to melee with one. Just seemed like they should all be maxxed, so I did.<br />
<br />
I hate that our 1hs is capped at 1 or 0 or whatever; even with max buffs and FA, I only slash for like 12. But it's still fun to equip my Runed Heretic Longsword, Parrying Daggar, and go into secret rogue mode, emoting :backstabs %T for 3489 points damage! :has slain %T!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">When you get higher level, an easy way to raise melee is to beat on the RESEARCHER (NOT Cartographer) in Innovation. You'll need factory access (or have somebody with factory access open door).<br />
<br />
Researcher will riposte only.  Cartographer will hit you hard. (Found that out in a &quot;Let's see what happens&quot; moment)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gaesekki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">oh...and a Tae Ew Hammer of Aggression works well for raising 2hb as quick as possible.  Not too expensive either....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">granted my solution isnt somethign most can use but figured it was fun and would share.<br />
<br />
i topped off my skills on the sleeper (still asleep).  squeezed into his bubble and went afk with auto attack on.  Hes red and takes quite the beating and never ripostes, thank god.<br />
<br />
but not the easiest place to get to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I remember before they decided to give everyone &quot;The Charm You Wont Ever Replace&quot; you actually had to camp them. One of the better one for us was in Togrins Mines, and got better if your weapon skill levels were higher. So as I camped it, I worked the skills on the blue mobs there. During the process, SOE, in their infinite wisdom, decided that there wasnt much interest in Charms, and gave everyone the one they wear today for free.</div></div><hr />
