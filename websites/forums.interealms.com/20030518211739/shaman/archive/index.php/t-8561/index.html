<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>woramorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Should I sell my JBB  for money to buy torpor? If I do sell it what would be a good bracer to replace it with?</div></div><hr />

You can just go to Seb or the planes and get cash from drops while you xp or AA.  Don't sell the JBB....I love it so much ;_;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I must admit, I would sell almost everything I own for Torpor. <br />
<br />
But I hesistate on the JBB. They are rare in the bazaar, and usually marked up to 20-30k (I bought mine for 15k), so replacing it would be a pain in the butt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hail,<br />

That's a hard call to make.  Obtaining my JBB (via auction) was one of my happiest moments when I was in my 40's.  I still use it regularly when soloing at 60, but almost not at all when grouped or raiding.<br />
<br />
The JBB pricing has been relatively stable on my server, with prices stable at around 15-20kpp (I paid 18kpp awhile ago).  Torpor prices vary from about 35kpp (seen ONCE) to well over 60kpp (crazy people) in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
I bought Torpor for 40kpp, after getting 20kpp gifted by my guildleader.  If I was flat broke when I found the seller, I would have done the swap, but I wouldn't have been happy about it.<br />
<br />
The JBB is a practical tool, but not an essential one at 60.  Torpor in my opinion is an essential tool at 60, even with Kragg's Mending available from 58+.<br />
<br />
I don't envy your decision.  I would recommend patience, and group more until you get Torpor.  As good as a JBB at 45 is, I'd say Torpor at 60 is an equally (if not greater) profound change in your gameplay.<br />
<br />
Good luck,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Talamorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok here is my take on the JBB, this is from the eyes of a level 58 shaman. The day i bought my JBB was one of the happiest EQ days for  me. was an item i always wanted. It served me well from level 48 to level 57. Then a few weeks back i  found myself not using it as often, with my mana pool and HP doing 263 points of damage in 8 seconds was driving me insane. I found myself using Torrent of Poison much more often with 2 cannis and just sitting on the horse. Even when soloing i never go below 70%. I sold it and upgraded my equipment and i must say i dont regret it. I would do the sale for Torpor, its one of the spells im looking forward to obtaining at 60. I know it will be a pain trying to get it but o well. I used to swear by the JBB at lower levels, its still a usefull tool at 60 but not as helpfull as in the lower 50s.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You know, I still use it.<br />
<br />
I just got a ss bracer, and I've been trying to ween myself off the jbb to wear the bracer. 1) cause I'm proud I have a piece of ss gear finally, and 2) cause my guildmates want to see me wearing it :)<br />
<br />
But when I'm soloing shrooms in fg, it's so easy just to throw some jbb's on.... and gasp, I sometimes find myself lazily using the jbb to nuke. <br />
<br />
I'm trying to wean myself off of it - wear JBB for soloing only, otherwise the ss bracer... but gosh, it's like loosing your security blanket. I find myself compulsively hitting &quot;2&quot; (link to the jbb) and wimpering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>mastahh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I saw Topor for 25K and Pox for 20K in the bazaar on Vallon Zek last week. Checked back in a couple hours and she had raised the price on Topor to 30k. Seeing as how im a shammy that rarely has more than 5k in the bank at a time, this wasnt an option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grromp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Maybe my experiences are rare, but every time I've been to GWurms, Malo or Torpor has dropped within the first few mobs.  Never stayed for more than 10, so I don't know if it was a fluke.<br />
<br />
Don't ditch the JBB!!!!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fonzerelli SZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The only thing I could see the JBB useful for now that PoP is out is farming items in lower level places. Once your 60 with torpor its way faster to canni up another couple dots and torpor yourself. Plus most shamans never use it in a group. <br />
<br />
<br />
    PoP group exp &gt; soloing anywhere else. Torpor is way better for soloing bigger mobs also (ie; PoP mobs)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would keep the JBB, complete pain to find, and I still use lots at 64</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">JBB is a great tool, but torpor is the single best droppable, non-store-bought thing a shaman can get by a large margin.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't sell the JBB unless absolutely forced too, though.  I use it quite a bit at 60.  I use it between rains of torrent of poison, since that takes so long to grey in again after casting, I use it to pick off runners when I don't want to spend a couple hundred mana and some canni time on a dot or DD to do the same, I use it between canni's occasionally...it's just pretty handy to have.  Sometimes I hardly use it, and sometimes I really use it quite a bit.  <br />
<br />
People say that they would rather use a high level DD or DOT than JBB once they level up and get them, or get a focus item(and I would too, often, now that I have a nice focus item for my cold DD's), but -- that means they have to give up a valuable, sometimes critical spell slot.  You don't really have to give up anything notable to equip a JBB, unless you have some pretty uber wrist loot.  And it would have to be pretty uber to compare to mana-free DD on demand without giving up a spell slot.  <br />
<br />
As it is, I have very few spare gem slots.<br />
<br />
If you have to consider giving up your JBB for torpor, you really badly need to camp some money up, or items to sell/trade(maybe even see if you can loot torpor yourself).  Your question should be, what can I do to BOTH keep the JBB and get torpor.  And if I'm not doing it ... why?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I would go for it.  But that's only because on Saryrn there's usually 2 JBB's selling in Bazaar, and I have NEVER seen Torpor (Malo is a stable 65k... Morons)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Still wrestling with this idea myself, but gonna try to get some friends to help me kill some guardian wurms and pray for good drops.. /sacrifices some tofu to the gods of spell drops ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Torpor changes your effectiveness in a group and solo far more than a JBB will at the same level or higher.  If the level cap never broke 60 you might have had some justification for keeping the JBB as a AAxp tool, but it is FAR more effective to get a group in PoV/PoS for exp or to root off and DoT multiple mobs for exp.  Sure, it is fun to bust out and go solo something that summons where the JBB is more of an asset, but this is usually not getting you any fast gains in exp.<br />
<br />
If you have to choose between the two, ditch the JBB and pick up Torpor for sure.  This is not an option on Xeg and the 20-30K from your bracer would leave you about 70K short of a spell. :/  Definitely put out the effort to get your hands on Torpor through the usual routes before just buying the spell in bazaar because free is still the best price.<br />
<br />
Some replacements for your wrist slot might be a Barbed Rubicite Bracer, one of the WW dragon bracers, or something questy like the Spirit Wracked cord/ToV armor.</div></div><hr />
