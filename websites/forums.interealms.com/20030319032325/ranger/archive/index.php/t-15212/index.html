<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">...at lvl 41 will they yeild XP? If so for how long (counting only dblues as XP)? Also with my gear will I need my druid friends help or am I just bringing him for moving pp to the bazaar and dt heals?<br />
<br />
(note: I can solo Giants in DL solo)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tathagata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You will get exp at 41 from them. They were still blue to me at 49 (Dk Blue). But the exp isnt great so dont go there for the grind just for cash.<br />
You will need your druid if you want to do it efficiently, otherwise you will be better off making money elsewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If its 1% or more per then the XP is fine and with the druid healing 2% per with a little DT is fine</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eorlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My level 50 mage friend is shredding HGs now, which as of now con lblue. At that level, he got 1 blue in 1h 45min of nearly constant killing. I would not ever suggest Rathe Mtns as an EXP zone for Rangers, unless you partner with someone who can solo them. In that case, you are a great puller - I pull for my mage friend when the HG gets to 1/2 health, and track always helps find that last HG before anyone else :)</div></div><hr />
