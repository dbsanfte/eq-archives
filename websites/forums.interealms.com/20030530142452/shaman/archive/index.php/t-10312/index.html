<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Convinced a cleric to let me solo ragefire for her. He's a pushover... I didn't win, but got him to 20% before my own stupidity caught up with me. <br />
<br />
1) Spear dotted myself. har har.<br />
2) Buffed up in the wrong order. He took out focus and STA on his early dispells. <br />
3) Forgot to summon a horse until midway through.<br />
<br />
You get the picture. Would have been a pushover if I hadn't made these mistakes. When I died I had 60% mana. Just didn't land a reslow at a crucial moment and he kept interrupting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LMAO<br />
I already doted myself with all my dots by mistake (after a quiescence usually hehe)<br />
Did you have self buff only or some of your cleric friend HP buff too ?<br />
He has 32k hp if I remind well.. what spell you used for damage ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Nice challenge tho.. Even if I can already hear the some shaman yelling that posting stuff like that will make us nerfed (wich I don't agree).<br />
<br />
If you have a log, I m interrested )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm sure a chanter could charm Talendor and solo it even more easily.<br />
<br />
Oh well, nice self challenge tho.  Sounds like a lot of fun actually.  <br />
Have to ask tho, did you do it self buffed?  Your gear is pretty darn decent, but not in the &quot;uber&quot; range yet.  It's better than mine, but I think I'd want a virtue or something before doing that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The ae dispel would make relying on charm (particularly on a level 60 dragon) a bit dangerous.  He could probably tear rage down pretty quick, but it'd still be risky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Want to try this...but I'm not even in the ballpark regarding equipment.....grrrrrrr..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My question is did the cleric get RF killed and the epic?<br />
<br />
hehehe<br />
<br />
Good try though!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah, we had a backup group there, so they jumped in after I died. <br />
<br />
I had symbol of Kazad. It was dispelled in the first minute of the fight. Even after focus and stamina were dispelled I was able to successfully can5 twice. (3k hp minus can5 = 1k hp ... not a problem if you time the Q/torpor tick so that it lands right after Can5.)<br />
<br />
I wasted lots of mana in the beginning trying to land disease and poison dots. After two resists on breath of ultor and on bane of nife, I just sat and swapped my spells. I used only spear dot, dogdog, and the occasional ice nuke after that.<br />
<br />
Dogdog died once when RF was at about 60%. I sat and memmed the doggy spell again and channeled one off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">do you need to be a cleric to trigger RF pop ?<br />
or just getting the 4 thingy in SF and handing them to the npc is enough ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Not sure on if you have to be a cleric or not, but I see where you're going with that question - and in answer to you, the spawned Ragefire has no spell/item drops other than the cleric epic piece and some really craptastic nodrop plate armor.  Stuff like a 13ac helm with 2dex and other uber stats.  Hehe, its a nice thought though ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I want to see Innorouk soloed.  Soloing a dragon has been done, but a god?  Er, okay, thats been done too, but Bristlebane is a goof.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">We still get the 100% weight reduction dragon bags when we kill ragefire (last one last week).  Haven't seen a CoF or anything like that, but the dragon bags are pretty nice to have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Snacko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Sounds like a nice fight =)<br />
<br />
If you are looking for challenges, try Myga (wurm in West Wastes), melee with a small fire AE.  Or the Sebilite protector.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Ragefire isn't high level enough to drop lvl 60 spells.  Even if he was a Kunark dragon, which he is not . . . at least not in theory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I can't recall ever seeing ragefire drop spells of any kind.  I've never seen anything exciting off rage except the weight reducing bag.<br />
<br />
Blazing armor of crap has fun effects.  Clicky nuke bracers and DS arms for everyone!  and twinks, it's a lot of fun for all your friends cheesy twinks.<br />

Anyways, sounds fun Soupy.  There's some wurms in VP that are a slight bit tougher than Rage, that I duo with a monk friend and it's fun to challenge yourself.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I've not seen any wr bags from Rage. Got one from sev, thanks sev. Seen it drop off of tal a few times, got tobrin's mystical eyepatch from Tal,  thanks Tal.<br />
<br />
We've gotten a complete set of gaudy armour from rage. One bard in our guild was completely decked out in it.... until some officer goofed and let her have ss pants the other day. damn! The orange bard was always a fun joke in the guild. Now she might actually get some fashion sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Saw 3 bags drop off RF once, luckily i got one.</div></div><hr />

I think I m way behind the point I could be interrested in any naggy drop.... I just want to k33l it.. I don't care of the drop )</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am fairly sure this would be possible, but...  I havent been able to convince my friends or guild to help me clear to him.  *grin*<br />
<br />
The fight would also take ages, no-doze would be handy!</div></div><hr />
