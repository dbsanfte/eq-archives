<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gukky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This may have been answered, but I can not do a search on the word &quot;pet&quot; as there is a 4 character minimum - so .....<br />
<br />
I was soloing with my pet in CoM and talking to a necro. I told this necro friend that I was trying to do over half of the damage to get the experience and it was sure eating my manna/medding time. <br />
<br />
He told me that pet experience sharing had been changed and I only needed to do 1 damage to get FULL experience on the skill. Is this true?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the information.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gagzook</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Have kind of a quick question on the same topic.  I was wondering if this is true, why is it that some dead mobs still have the rot time of like 25 secs?  <br />
<br />
I have been seeing some of mobs poofing very fast.  Can't really find any rhyme or reason.  I Pull with Slow, I then tank for a couple of hits.  Then dog gets agro and I JBB till dead mob.  I may Dot, depends on mob.  Then at mob death some mobs have full rot time and some don't. <br />
<br />
It makes me wonder on the ones with only 25 sec rot time if dog is affecting exp?  Any comments?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's been that way for years....there is a 30 second rot time on empty mobs.<br />
If there is any loot on the mob it will have normal rot time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ysgwyrthyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">One more thang, ta search fer a word wif only three letters, add an asterisk (*) to da end... e.g. &quot;pet*&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gagzook</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">D'oh!  I didn't even think of that.  Been playing for darn near 3 years now.  I feel like such a noob! :(  I need some pudding to make feel better now.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the answer!</div></div><hr />
