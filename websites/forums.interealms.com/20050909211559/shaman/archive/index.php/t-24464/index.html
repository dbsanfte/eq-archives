<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wow, that's certainly going to be a nice system when you get it all together.  Only thing I would have added was a DVD burner, as they are down to $100-$200 now.  But if you aren't the kind of person (like me) who can fill an 120GB hard drive up with (among other things) anime, Cartoon Network Adult Swim shows, and of course South Park episodes, in less than a month, you probably don't need a DVD burner.  Anyhow, I thought I'd throw in a few tips since I got the impression this was your first time building a system:<br />
<br />
1) The intarweb is your friend.  I highly recommend borrowing a friend's laptop or something if you don't have an extra computer in the house, as the right information from the net can save you a lot of time and/or money if (or rather when) something goes wrong.  Googleing for info usually works, but I also highly recommend checking out www.tomshardware.com, as they are a great resource for all things computer hardware related (should you become insane and feel the need to risk destroying your new investment to make it a little bit faster, they can tell you how to overclock things too).<br />
<br />
2)  Be careful with the processor, and follow the instructions on the heatsink/fan to the letter.  The last thing you want is for your CPU to fry itself because the heat transfer gel got wiped off or something.  Also, I don't think this is as much of an issue as it used to be, but when working with your parts (especially the RAM) make sure you don't have any static electricity on you.  Just touch a metal doorknob, or plug the case in (it doesn't have to be turned on) and touch a metal part of it to discharge all those RAM-destroying electrons.  Oh, and on the subject of RAM, MAKE SURE IT IS SEATED PROPERLY.  If it isn't and you turn the computer on, you will soon smell the lovely odor of your newly invested money burning up (it smells like burning ozone, and it will linger for weeks even if you leave all the windows open).  Shortly thereafter, you will actually get to see your computer catch on fire ... don't ask me how I know all this :(.<br />
<br />
3)  I generally attach the CPU, heatsink/fan, and RAM to the motherboard first, then install all the drives in the case, then put the mother board in the case, connect all the power cords and ribbon cables, and finally add the graphics card and any PCI cards.  However, this is in no way the official IT way to assemble a computer, so take it with a grain of salt.  Whatever order choose, make sure to check that everything fits.  There is nothing more annoying than installing everything except for one part and then realizing that because of the angles involved and the placement of your powersupply relative to that weird green doohickey, there is no physical way for you to install the last part unless you are Mr. Fantastic, and so you end up having to take everything back out and then put it all back in again.  Believe me, spending five minutes beforehand with a tape measurer and some visualization is a much better alternative.<br />
<br />
That's about all I could think of off the top of my heard, and I'm sure most of them are obvious things you already knew, but I figured if there was just one kernel of a useful info in there that saves you some hassle, it was worth the ten minutes or whatever it took to write this out.  Good luck, have fun, and come back here to /cheer using your new computer once it is up and running ... unless you encounter problems, in which case come back and post here if you need advice :).  Oh, feel free to PM me too.</div></div><hr />
