<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hekta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all, new Shammie here :) . My wife plays a 16 Ranger that I plan on playing with when she is on but I need another toon to dual box for those times she isnt online. In the past Ive used a Monk and found this to be very successful. My question therefore is what class to you think makes the best partner for a Shammie? <br />
NB/ My Shammie is a Troll soon to be equiped with snare necklace and I like dungeons better than outdoors. Thanks in advance...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Excidium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Most people   pick monks.    Monk/Shaman  are a verry powerfull Duo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>WulfTyger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Monk/Shaman is one of the best duo combo's out there.<br />
<br />
Shaman/Ranger is pretty durn gud too.<br />
<br />
Shaman/Rogue is sick if you do all the tanking (root, proximity aggro)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Shaman/Rogue = works great, nothing in ME I cant kill.  Sham tanks while the Rogue drops huge BS bombs.<br />
<br />
When I'm not on my bro uses my Sham with his SK and it works just as well, a lot safer having a bigger tank to do all the tanking and just use the sham for healing and utility but takes him roughly 58 times longer to kill stuff ;) <br />
<br />
Know of Sham/Monk and it's a great duo too.  Monks can take the hits and deal the damage so it's a nice mix between the Rogue and Sk.  Really up to you but the nice thing about using a Monk is that if it goes sour you just FD the monk and you can focus on running the Sham to safety or gate him out and then FD the Monk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Monk or rogue (or ranger) for fast killing.  Warrior to kill the toughest stuff.  But you can make it work with any class, really.  Lately I've had a lot of fun duoing with a mage, their pets rock.<br />
<br />
I 2-box with a warrior, I chose the warrior for the pure tanking ability.  No way a monk or rogue can stand and take it in the bad situations like a warrior, especially once you hit defensive level.  But the warrior does not have the output speed of monks, rogues or rangers.  I once spent literally 10 minutes killing a proselyte at the CT zone line, friggin thing kept CH'ing.  But ultimately I did win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Troll shamans own with shaman/rogue combo.<br />
<br />
Shaman slows and can hold aggro by spamming snare necklace.  If fact my shaman can hold aggro better than my 60th warrior (boggle).   Rogue backstabs to death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Shaman can tank for rogues well if they have a fungi or torpor, but it's more difficult without strong regen above and beyond regrowth.  I did this a lot and it worked great.<br />
<br />
Shaman/monk is great.  The FD ability lets you take on much tricker situations.  And if you have torpor you can keep anyone healed forever.<br />
<br />
Because of that, though, the warrior loses some of his value in a duo with shaman.  His strengths are his hitpoints, which I already have covered through regrowth and torpor.  His weakness is melee damage output, which is my weakness too.  Our strengths cancel each other out a lot, and our weaknesses combine.<br />
<br />
Monks tend to have lower hitpoints(but not always), but I have hitpoints covered with torpor/regrowth.  Anyway, monks take far fewer blows than other melee classes -- warriors have, what, dodge, whereas monks have block?  Whatever, the monk version is FAR superior.  So absolute hitpoints are again not necessarily determinative.  What I'm lacking is high melee damage output.  Monks have that covered.  <br />
<br />
And if things go wrong, monk FD's and I gate.  With warrior, one of us is going to die.  Maybe I'll stay around too long trying to prevent the inevitable and contribute my death to the mix.<br />
<br />
I've duoed many times with 60 warrior and 60 monk, and I can really see the exp slow up with the warrior.  His damage output is just too slow.<br />
<br />
Warrior does have taunt, though, which is nice.  But the thing that makes him most valuable in the general game, hitpoints, are irrelevant when duoing with a shaman who has torpor.  We'll both live forever with torpor anyway; hitpoints are not the problem.</div></div><hr />
