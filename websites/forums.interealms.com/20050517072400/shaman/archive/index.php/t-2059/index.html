<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kuthu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering about this zone since it was changed way back when. I am not really looking to get the armor from there... was just wondering if there is anywhere that would be decent exp to solo. or if i should just forsake this zone and never come back :p<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kappy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Drops are rare, most combinations don't work anymore, some boxes don't even summon dolls. 4 funnies to get a chance at a box now. mobs hit twice as hard and have twice the HP, yes, all of them. Don't bother. VI needs to go ahead and delete the zone.\<br />

<br />
It's not like super spectacular loot was coming from it at a great rate.<br />
<br />
Ah well, it was fun while it lasted.</div></div><hr />
