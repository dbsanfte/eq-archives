With out knowing what exspantions you have its really hard to say. Lets just say you will problly be in for a few saprises at first. If the char is still lv60 you might want to poke around the PoP and Ldon stuff to start with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ryoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">jbb is the bracer im assuming?  dont bother most encounters now have shaman spot healing or cureing ma etc, wont have time to nuke(least encounters from emp ssra on up)<br />
<br />
fungi always good to have lying around for GP<br />
<br />
shaman are doing better, we have some good spells from planes of power and LDON as for gates spells all are dropped from raid mobs so they will be slow getting for some of us<br />
<br />
after velious there is shadows of luclin(good imo)<br />
                             planes of power (better imo)<br />
                             lost dungeons of norrath( all instance incounters one group dungeon crawls ) very very fun if thats what you like<br />
                              and lastly Gates of discord(some instance zones others normal zones actually quite fun and some very nice gear drops)<br />
<br />
computer upgrades, if your not at 512 k ram and a processor of at least 1.2  its tuff. also need a VC that supports directx 9.0 if you want to get new expansions<br />
<br />
cant answer #6 not much of a solo'r.. i have solo'd a couple times in plane of earth(planes of power expansion) and have gotten 8%aa xp (thats new to you as well) per kill<br />
<br />
as for anything else... one of the better ideas that sony has had is the alternate xp.. starting at lvl 51 you can choose to put xp into AA xp and get other skills like better healing, a &quot;swarm pet&quot; , more innate hp , aa to take less damage, to give more damage (melee) the list is quite impressive, and with the release of gates of discord even more aa have been invented. also if your a trade skiller, they have made the &quot;click and drag&quot; to combine .. easier.. if you have the items in your inventory, and it is on the 'combine list&quot; you can just click on that combine it brings the items you need from your inventory to your combining satchel and just click combine, other than that for the most part eq has gotten better imho than it was 2years ago<br />

Uh, I'm running a 433 mhz processor with 256mb ram. Voodoo 5 64mb pci video card. Worked fine way back in the day...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">1) Is &quot;the bracer&quot; still great?<br />
<br />
Until level 55 or so, yes. After that, your time is better spent dotting/canniing back mana.<br />
<br />
2) Is the fungi tunic still uber? I don't know how I ever lived without it.<br />
<br />
Some people keep it, but at level 51 we can wear Tae Ew armor, which is far better &amp; far cheaper, &amp; at level 44 we get a fairly easy quest for a spell, Stoicisim, which is like a mini version of Torpor.<br />
<br />
3) How are shaman these days?<br />
<br />
Neglected &amp; somewhat underpowered in the high end raiding game, more powerful than ever in the low - see the sticky thread at the top of this forum.<br />
<br />
4) What expansions are good? There's this Evolutions thing out now. The last expansion I currently own is Velious. <br />
<br />
All of them. <br />
<br />
5) I haven't upgraded my comp since I quit. Have the system requirements gone up at all? <br />
<br />
Yes. Quite a lot.<br />
<br />
6) How's high-end soloing these days? I remember grinding a bit of level 59 solo at the SS camp in Sol B.<br />
<br />
From 60 on, XP is far faster grouped in the Planes of Power zones. Soloing is difficut with the newer content because it hits so hard - Yard trash in the best XP zone I can use, the Plane of Valor, doubles for 544. At 65 however, we can root rot these mobs comfortably. The good side of this is that a shaman is more or less required in these zones, so it's quite easy for us to get groups.<br />
<br />
7) Anything else you want to tell me.  :) <br />
<br />
Hmm. Read the forums a bit - especially the hunting grounds one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fixed regen of HP, plus regen gear, plus regen AAs are available if you have the expansions.<br />
<br />
I don't think 2.8mhz will get you anywhere, but 2.8ghz sure will. ;)<br />
<br />
The sad thing is people probably twink alts with better gear than what you last wore. The good thing is you'll be able to get some yourself soon enough. Hopefully your guild will pitch in and spend 50k to get you at least some Tae Ew legs and chest, Tactician's Bullwark, and decent gear for the other slots. <br />
<br />
There's better out there than the Epic, but if you want it again, /petition to have your True Spirit faction reset and start from scratch.<br />
<br />
Read, read, read. Read the gear advice already given to others, most of it will be useful to you as well.<br />
<br />
And yes, HP (and focus effects) &gt; all.</div></div><hr />

(yes EQ is dying since PoP mudflation.. or even luclin.)<br />
<br />
As it is, you will have fun up to 65, then discover what it means to play a broken class.</div></div><hr />

That being said, I was level 60 with my epic when I quit, and I was just wondering...<br />
<br />
1) Is &quot;the bracer&quot; still great?<br />
I dont have it, I never have had it. Believe it or not it's still 20k+.<br />
To me it isnt worth it when you can use the 20k to spend on level 65 spells. <br />
<br />
2) Is the fungi tunic still uber? I don't know how I ever lived without it.<br />
Never had one, cant wear it anyway. and it's still very expensive 75-100k. With LDON out, you can just get a nice BP with points from it and you can augment the gear with a regen stone. Of coruse since I tend to solo alot I opted for a Burning Affliction one.<br />
<br />
3) How are shaman these days?<br />
Pretty decent in groups with all the buffs, slows and debuffs. <br />
<br />
4) What expansions are good? There's this Evolutions thing out now. The last expansion I currently own is Velious. <br />
I reccommend you get them all. Legacy of Ysheka might not be a huge deal to you as far as expbut it does give you more bank slots, mapping, armor dyes, a lizard mount option instead of the horse mount from Luclin. <br />
<br />
5) I haven't upgraded my comp since I quit. Have the system requirements gone up at all? <br />
Sounds like you need a serious upgrade. I have a 1ghz pent4 ati radeon 7500 and 512mb ram on my laptop and it does fine. It sometimes out runs my desktop which is a amd athalon 2600, 512 mb ram and a ge force4 440.<br />
<br />
6) How's high-end soloing these days? I remember grinding a bit of level 59 solo at the SS camp in Sol B.<br />
Soloing isnt too bad things just take awhile to kill. Alot of 65 shaman are soling mobs other classes can't. I tend to farm Inner Acrylica alot when I feel like soloing. Some others prefer PoP zones. Been too busy lately pling my berserker though to do any soloing. <br />
<br />
7) Anything else you want to tell me.  :) <br />
Alchemy we finally made cheaper to raise by GoD. Of course, I wasnt too happy with only 2 skill ups in 60 combines myself. There are a few potions out there but it's still under used compared to tinkering.<br />
NERF THEM DAMN GNOMES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.<br />
Since you are level 60 already, If you guild managesto hook you up with some gear, then I would look into grouping in Plane of Valor first a bit or maybe even LDON zones. When you hit 62 move over to Bandwagon of Tards. If you can manage to get on a pickup raid for Mechanical Behemoth in Plane of Innovation or get guildies to help with the alternate quest for Plane of Tactics, I would reccomend going there instead of Bandwagon of Tards. I dont know how high your guild is in PoP flagging so maybe they might be nice and backflag you if needed. Otherwise you may just have to hope that you can find pickup raids like I did. I got flagged for 3 of 4 Elemental Planes just by doing Pickup raids.<br />
<br />
I've heard Tunare or one of the Other servers Pickup Raid channel is got Plane of Time Flagged.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">1) Is &quot;the bracer&quot; still great?<br />
The bracer is not as good as it used to be. It was always just great until you got torpor. Now shaman get min torpor at 44, mini CH at 58 and of course quiescence at 65. Now, it is not a bad item either - but you might be better off selling it to some twink and reequipping from the money.<br />
<br />
2) Is the fungi tunic still uber? I don't know how I ever lived without it.<br />
See bracer - when you can produce mana on a whim and heal for 300 a tick a fungi is not all that hot anymore. Especially since selling it would probably reequip you from scratch.<br />
<br />
3) How are shaman these days?<br />
A lot of people (like me) believe shaman have end game and raid issues. Unless you believe you will be leveling fast, then grind some AAs and join a raiding guild these issues should not affect you for some time to come, possibly never if we get some kind of fix in the near future. Shaman are still fine up to 65 and a bit into it.<br />
<br />
4) What expansions are good? There's this Evolutions thing out now. The last expansion I currently own is Velious. <br />
Luclin has the bazaar(great), some raiding zones(yay for 50 minute fights), some experience zones(some are kinda fun) but overall nothing critical except the bazaar.<br />
Legacy of Ykesha has some low to mid level zones, some of which may be perfect for you right now although you would probably quickly outgrow them. It also lets you quest for mini torpor and blood of nadox, as well as letting you dye your armor.<br />
Planes of Power is the main raiding expansion. It has a ton of raiding zones and a couple very nice high end grouping zones. It also has portals that immensely speed up traveling.<br />
Lost Dungeons has instanced zones to group in, some nice gear in these zones and a ton of very nice gear you can buy by adventuring in said zones.<br />
Gates of Discord has a few zones for about 55ish to 65 people and a ton of high end raiding zones you will probably not see for quite a while.<br />
<br />
5) I haven't upgraded my comp since I quit. Have the system requirements gone up at all? <br />
Yes, though not much at all compared to how system requirements have gone up on all other games.<br />
<br />
6) How's high-end soloing these days? I remember grinding a bit of level 59 solo at the SS camp in Sol B.<br />
Pretty decent although you will not spend your time toe to toe. MOBs in the current high end zones hit way to hard for that. Other then that we can still make decent experience soloing. However grouping experience has gotten a big boost, so soloing is weaker in comparison.<br />
<br />
7) Anything else you want to tell me.<br />
If you liked the battle-priest and/or pet parts of the shaman you might want to check out beastlords.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>illitian icerage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Okay, everyone else has shed their light on this topic. However, I can tell you that your comp (minus your Vodoo card if it can't run DX9.0) will runEQ. My comp hasn't been upgraded for ages either, but it still runs EQ at 333MGhz, an 8.0AGP video card, and 256SDR RAM. No lag issues at all on the old zones, although with some of the newer (Luclin and newer), I do expierence lag.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">ill also attest that the older machines will work.. just dont push them too hard and theyll be fine, ran a 2nd box with.. 500 or something mhz, 256 ram, etc.. and as long as you dont do stuff like full clip and spell effects, its really no big deal.. its the ram that will be the issue, so if you dont have enough just buy as much as your machine can handle.. really not too expensive (512 is max for non-winxp, i think?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">OK, my 2 cents.  Since I'm close to your level (I'm getting ready to ding 58), I think I can state with confidence that the shaman is a blast to play.  Especially at 58+, with all the great spells we get at 58, 60 and 65.  <br />
<br />
You will note that some of the higher end shaman (300+ aa's and elemental/Plane of Time raiding) have issues with raiding and soloing, however, almost every class has these same issues.  At the very high end, it becomes a game of specialists, and shaman are one of the games best generalists.  A blast to play for a long time if you are a casual or small guild type of player (I will never see the Plane of Time myself) but a bit frustrating for the power gamers.  To be honest, at the very high end, if you are not a warrior, cleric, or very high dps class (wiz, rogue), then you are probably replaceable by another class.  However, these great end game classes are also some of the worst solo'ers (except for Wizzes, but levels 1-29 are terrible for them) and most group dependent.<br />
<br />
So for the casual player, one who is not planning on powerleveling to 65 in a week and farm Plane of Time and GoD until they hit the magic 540 aa's, the shaman is a great class to play.  I can solo well, always get a group in a few minutes, and contribute to any group I play with.  <br />
<br />
Like most trips, the trick is to enjoy the ride and not just focus on getting there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">1) Is &quot;the bracer&quot; still great?<br />
<br />
Some folks seemingly worship it.  It doesn't fit my playstyle.  It apparently is still used although I'd hardly consider it mandatory.  Actually I think it's kinda of cheesy, but that's just me (see final points below).<br />
<br />
2) Is the fungi tunic still uber? I don't know how I ever lived without it.<br />
<br />
It's uber but I wouldn't consider it level 60 worthy.  Something with AC and stats would be more ideal.  Cast regrowth on yourself.  :P  Some folks might carry multiple chest pieces and switch them out based on the situation.  These days I think most people use fungi on their alts to make the low levels even more ridiculously easier than they already are (fungi + copper hammer of striking for teh win!).<br />
<br />
3) How are shaman these days?<br />
<br />
I love mine.  I'm rarely LFG for more than a few minutes if there's a group to be had - and if I don't group I always have something to do - so much so that I rarely play my alts.  Did I mention that I love my shaman?  I even solo some now even though I'm far from having a soloist mentality - now it's just another option.  You might browse the last 10-20 pages or so of the forum (that may be far enough) to read the *discussions* that went on about shaman around the time of GoD release.<br />
<br />
4) What expansions are good? There's this Evolutions thing out now. The last expansion I currently own is Velious. <br />
<br />
Again.  Opinions vary.  I like having all the expansions so that I have everything available to me...but then $30 (price of Evolution) isn't a big deal to me.  I think EQ Evolution is a great deal.  LDoN is some of the most fun I've had in any MMORPG and it's still very popular (been out a few months now).  I'm not sure about GoD yet...I bought it but have yet to have the opportunity to try it - it's less casual-player friendly than some content, IMO.  It's also 50+ minimum and to do the meat of the content (the 'trials') you really want to be 65 with decent gear (not necessarily uber) and some AA (from what I've heard).<br />
<br />
5) I haven't upgraded my comp since I quit. Have the system requirements gone up at all?<br />
<br />
No clue.  I'd imagine so.  My system isn't that beefy and it runs EQ very well.  I do have a decent video card though, which helps.  You can get a video card that will crush EQ and pretty much all games out today for $100 (or less if you shop around).<br />
<br />
6) How's high-end soloing these days? I remember grinding a bit of level 59 solo at the SS camp in Sol B.<br />
<br />
I can't imagine many people soloing in Sol B these days except for nostalgia purposes.  There are way more options and so much content that people spend more time soloing named in dungeons for more worthy loot drops or planes for massive xp (or both).  There are tales of shaman here soloing some of the highest (elemental planes) content in the game.<br />
<br />
7) Anything else you want to tell me.<br />
<br />
I originally played EQ at release and left days before Kunark shipped.  I'm in my second run of EQ now starting just before LDoN hit.  A lot has changed in EQ...some old timers don't like the changes.  Personally I think EQ has become a lot more fun and offers a LOT more to do.  There's so much content it's mind boggling and between classic content (traditional dungeons and outdoor zones), instanced dungeons (LDoN/GoD), planes (high level high xp zones), limited zones (those that require flags and/or level restrictions) and tons of raid-level content you have many options about how to spend your time (in addition to crafting, socializing, exploring, etc).  Additions to the banking system, crafting system, trading mechanisms, and travel (Nexus, PoK) have all enhanced the fun side of EQ.  And after all this time and with all these changes and additions EQ still has many challenges and many annoying time sinks.<br />
<br />
EQ still has its exploitive side (the PLing, uber twinking, overbuffing, 3rd party character/item/plat sales, multi-boxing/botting, overpowered non level-restricted items (like JBB and CHoS) and such) but it's easy to overlook the negative and enjoy the positives of the game.  (...and before anyone flames me for not liking the exploitive aspects of EQLive read up on EQ2 and notice that everything I listed is considered a flaw/exploit of EQ design by the EQ2 design team that they're doing away with in EQ2...and I love it...tyvm)</div></div><hr />
