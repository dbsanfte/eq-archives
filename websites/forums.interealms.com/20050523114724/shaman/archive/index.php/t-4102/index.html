On Karana I bought mine for 12k after a few weeks of auctioning.  The rogue who sold it to me apparently had been auctioning for many hours every day for several days (in EC, pre-Bazaar) and was VERY relieved to find a buyer.  I expected him to laugh at my offer of 12k, but in hindsight I think I should have started even lower.</div></div><hr />

At level 53, I was fortunate enough to camp the crypt and a JBB dropped. Then aother one at level 54. I think i spent too much time leveling in Sebilis. :b</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Stop stressing about the fact that they're selling for more than you're willing to pay.  On your server, if they go for 25k at market then that's what they're currently worth.  If you can find one cheaper, then you're fortunate.  My advice is to spend your time camping cash (use your favorite fund raising method to do so), save the money and buy the thing.  If you camp for the bracer, you'll more than likely end up losing the /random to one of your group mates. You'll also have a shot at some other decent loot, but from my experiences in the crypt in seb you'll have to be extremely lucky to pick one up there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">yea your right .  need a lil more patience . <br />

<br />
If you don't have the fundage for it, just camp crypt in seb.  You can hunt for high end shaman spells off emperor while still looking for a jbb to drop.<br />
<br />
Plus, in every group you can make sure everyone agrees to need before greed (so that jbb, malo, torpor will be yours in good time).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Crypt (http://www.trollworld.freeserve.co.uk/Grogbat/crypt.jpg)<br />
<br />
Ok a quick, hunt ya own JBB guide:<br />
<br />
I have spent a fair bit of time in the crypt, mainly when I was looking for my 60 spells. I have seen 2 JBB drop in all that time (both in same night ironically).<br />
<br />
Take a balanced group of 6 down there, and unless you are all low/mid 50 it will be slow, so take friends and make it a social event. A 60 puller makes things go smoothly.<br />
<br />
Your generic 'full group in a box' tank, cleric chanter, rogue, shammy, evac etc all mid 50's can clear the crypt. I prefer to take as few people as possible.<br />
<br />
Minimal Group: 60 shaman with spells, 60 rogue both epic, just invis past Crypt guardians <br />
<br />
Minimal 'kill everything' group: Good Shaman, Good Monk/SK, Good Rogue. Doable without Malo and Torpor if you are all switched on, just grab another healer type if worried, some of the nameds and chottal could be a bit rough if slow is resisted more than once etc. Need to FD split Guardians as they CH across the room even unaggroed ;)<br />
<br />
Minimal 'comfortable' group: Mezzer(52 up ench does fine, think necro/Bard have to be 54ish to mez ICG), shaman, melee, rogue -see shot above (60 necro, 60 shaman, 60 rogue, 57 ranger all epic), only had one moment when hierophant resisted 3 slows after Malo haha<br />
<br />
Unsubtle 'heavy melee' group of damage dealers plus shaman can just ride out the C-heals and run the Guardians out of mana -did this with 60 pally, warrior, rogue x2 and shaman - pally just stun tanked one ICG while the rest tore the other down..<br />
<br />
Mob wise it's nothing too tough apart from Chottal/nameds. Not too many MObs, but they are some of the tougher ones in upper seb.<br />
<br />
SK/Warrior/Nec frogloks, some with pets, some do ~601 HT ish. MR nothing special but they run low on health. <br />
<br />
Most 'skeleton mobs' are Melee's, easily slowed, some have HT (skeletal Barons I think, maybe mistaken).<br />
<br />
Froglok Mage: new-ish spawn, roams about before ICG's. Easy mob but vicious damage sheild, easy once it's annuled. Watch for DS on other mobs if he's up.<br />
<br />
Fallen Monk: for Monk WF quest, dies easily.<br />
<br />
Crypt Guardians: Bit harder than the Seb Golem on pyramid outside crypt. Cleric mobs but don't cast too much, but will try to CH. MR nothing special. Need splitting/mezzing as they assist CH if they have line of sight (it seems..). Can be pulled into one of the small rooms an killed to avoid CH if you have already cleared them once (ie: not respawned yet)<br />
<br />
Blood of chottal: just kill it already.<br />
<br />
Emporer 'wot no torpor?' chottal: 60 necro mob. Can be singled pulled by a level 60 using some none damaging means (annul is good if he is up when you get down there). Casts a lot, nothing talisman of epurtation won't fix apart from the magic dot (boil?). likes to dispell. Fight by doorway to his room or he may gate an summon you to nasty death. Leave chottal's skeleton guardians alone unless you are bored/clever/fancy a nasty CR.<br />
<br />
I like the Crypt overall, xp nothing special unless small group, but good chance of loot thats still reasonable for difficulty level. Reminds me, must head back for a heiro cloak soon.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">eeek  60's ?<br />
<br />
i dont get that . a 60 wouldnt want/need that thing so much . it should drop off 55is or lower do able mob :(<br />
<br />
ahh well . ill just keep trying to buy ;)<br />
<br />
tnx for the great guide though my friend</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">60 &lt;-- still using my JBB<br />
<br />
At 60, I would also appreciate the heiro cloak that drops in the Crypt.  Not to mention, the emperor has the possiblity of dropping level 60 spells, including the very rare Torpor and Malo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Hehe, Mojo.  They nerfed JBB drop rate a while after Kunark came out.  I was about lvl 25 when it came out tho, so LOIO was the **** for me at the time haha.  I remember there being about 5 people there and we scraped them up together for a group at the back door.  We had no idea there was a front door at that point haha!  Ah memories.  My biggest ambition was to kill the chancelor and get a JCP . . . I got one too!  Took a lvl 52 mage and a lot of deaths by all but woohoo I got me a spear!  <br />
<br />
Umm . . JBB.  I've camped crypt tons and tons of hours and NEVER seen one drop.  Then again the duke doesn't spawn often either.  I've seen about 10 clubs and never see a dam bracer.  Good thing I saved up the cash and bought one for 12k when I was 47.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heheh - mine is usually bagged when on a raid, but when I'm hunting for exp, solo or grouped, I use it CONSTANTLY.  At 60 grinding for AAEXP, the thing has never been more useful.  As far as drops go, I've put in my fair share of time in crypt groups.  The one jbb that I've ever seen drop there was won by a monk (iirc, he gave it to his twink shaman).</div></div><hr />
