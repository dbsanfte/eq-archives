<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Asylumdweller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Aaah, finally. A couple of notes:<br />
<br />
- Since I didn't really &quot;have&quot; to have this one right away, I bided my time in the bazaar and eventually just found the fangs there for about ~100 apiece.<br />
<br />
- The hand dropped the band on the third attempt, but it only took one visit there and since Lguk wasn't very busy that day, I was able to farm a FBSS, a TBB and some other decent sellables at the same time. <br />
<br />
- One group is plenty for the imp protectors, just bring a chanter to mezz the adds (I don't like those spiders). Watch out for the traps heading up past the lava pits if you head in further. <br />
<br />
- Camping the catliff for the fang turnin blows. Took a good 20 hours of sitting in mistmoore. Head in to the cemetary, go into the tomb, fall in the trap on the left side of the coffin and just kill your way up and down the stairs. There's a false wall to the left of the single fake door that leads up. Note: Do not go into the small closets in the room with 4 doors, because if it closes on you you're stuck. (heh, learned this the hard way). The false door opens up the other three.<br />
<br />
- Mistmoore mobs are fun to kill at 50+, and since you're going to be there awhile you'd may as well kill them. They still nuke for the occasional 250, so have your resists up. The mobs in the yard (greenies) are single pullable with snare and if you're bored you can come up with new and creative ways to kill them.<br />
<br />
- Catliff spawned at the bottom of the stairs in the room with 3 doors for me after killing the two mobs at the top of the stairs in the torture room, so they may be his placeholder (though I was just killing everything anyways).<br />
<br />
- The poacher is one tough cookie, and I couldn't come close to soloing him at 55 with good gear. Myself and a 55 druid took him down in a good fight, the druid landing 3k+ in DoTs on him and spending the rest of his mana healing me. <br />
<br />
- Having done it, I'll probably not use firestrike anymore unless I'm in a situation where I need to chain-nuke something with lightning/arrow/cof/firestrike. <br />
<br />

I am still working on those fangs, at 55 I got the Burnt Sash last nite  from an Imp Protector, he was pretty tough on a group of 5. We got whipped pretty good in SolB so please bring a chanter for Crowd Control and you should be ok with a full group. Try   to bring someone who can Evac if necessary and a rogue never hurts for the CR(hehe we needed it).<br />
<br />
Gratz again on getting this level 49 spell....../em snicker<br />
Stay Safe All,</div></div><hr />
