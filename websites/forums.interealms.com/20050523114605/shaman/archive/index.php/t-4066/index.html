When that type of person gets tired of comparing himself loudly against those of a similar type, brash, ignorant and obnoxious, he will eventually look around himself and see the quiet, relatively content person and decide he needs to compare himself against them.<br />
<br />
I don't let it bother me. I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that as much as these guys bitch about shamans being overpowered, if I went over to the necro boards right now and posted 'SHAMANZ R00L NECR0Z DR00L JU GUYZ R MAD SUX0R YO!!!!! I SOLO BETTAR TAHN JU AND MY DOTS ARE 3R33+!!' I'd get roughly ten thousand responses saying 'FU LOSAR U R TEH RONGZ NECR0Z 0WN JUR CANDY ASS IF YA SPMEELELELELELELELLLL WUT TEH NECRO ROCK IS COOKIN!!!'. Look at the necro board link I posted earlier. Necros complaining that shamans were overpowered, but constantly offering the caveat that shamans were not as powerful as them, but necros aren't overpowered, but shamans are, even though necros are more powerful. /boggle There's a desire to bitch about another class being too powerful, but there's an unwillingness to admit that their own class might be second best. Not that I think necros are, but then again, I don't think that shamans are overpowered.<br />
<br />
Whatever. It'll all blow over. People say the same thing about rogues and monks and clerics all the time, and it's pretty much BS there too. And if it doesn't blow over, then we'll get nerfed to hell and I'll quit, so I won't really care.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My favorite, dunno if its true or not :)<br />
<br />
Sounds like you play a pretty ****ty shaman, Zorlac<br />
<br />
Anyways, i love how people point out only the good sides of everyclass(of course we do it too, but thats besides the point).<br />
<br />
&quot;Shammys are soooo uber, torpor/slow/malo i wuv shammys, /em huggles all shamans cause they are SOOOO uber&quot;(well, something like that atleast).<br />
<br />
What they dont seem to realize is that ive only seen 1 copy of malo, currently on sale for 150k(yeah right, its not good enough for that IMO).  Ive never seen torpor...and am forced to merely drool when i see a 60 shammy using it...<br />
<br />
Our dots are resisted often, other classes have our debuffs, chanters can slow ALMOST as well, etc.<br />
<br />
Yet we are still over powered of course, simply cause we slow slightly better, and can solo stuff that otherclasses would never dream of touching w/ out 5 or more buddys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">One more thing...i kinda enjoyed seeing someone get shot down for saying the jack of all trades, master of none statement.<br />
<br />
I've always believed we were the masters at slowing, buffing(eeek), debuffing(to an extent), and we are truely the masters of soloing hard as hell mobs, and bieng a good Duo Partner w/ pretty much EVERY CLASS IN THE GAME.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Torpor dropped from jumpy two nights ago :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'd say we are more of a:<br />
<br />
Jack of all trades and masters of various things that other classes are a butthair from being just as good at.<br />
<br />
<br />
I would also say we are boring as hell to play on a raid when there is more than one of us.<br />
<br />
I think the easiest way to see what classes are well/over-balanced and fun to play is to look at what classes people emigrate to.  On my server its melee melee melee....  with shaman, chanter and cleric mostly being boted or logged on as a guildwhore when needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">We ain't the masters of buffing. Our stat buffs are mostly meaningless, our AC buffs are useless when clerics are around, and our HP buff isn't the 'best'. I'm not suggesting that I necessarily want it to be the best, or I want our AC buff to be that worthwhile, as I'd hate to have just that much more buffing to do, but I hate it when people quote Absor and insist that we are the kings of all buffing. Focus is a highly wanted buff, yes, but if people had to choose between it and Aegolism, it wouldn't be a hard choice. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I feel dirty after reading that :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You have a point Asta...the most overbalanced class's are the ones people create as Alts...<br />
<br />
IE: Monks.<br />
<br />
The only flaw in this philosophy though, is that Monks arent well balanced as a first class.<br />
<br />
the wieght restrictions, and the fact that lower level mobs drop mass CP/SP, that most lowbies save up for cheap upgrades, makes monks a kinda hard class to play, starting up, because they lose so much AC if they are overwieght, and thus saving money becomes to much of a hinderance.<br />
<br />
I've never played a monk like this, but from what i can see, monks would be very poor(money wise) mains, until higher levels(where they would be poorly equiped because of that).<br />
<br />
However, as an Alt, or as a late 50's main w/ good equip, a monk is amazingly, amazingly, amazingly powerfull</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>mystreez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I concur with Jinheim.  I feel really dirty after reading that.  Makes flames on these boards look mild in comparison. Wow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Serj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The deleting of BLs would be the best thing that ever happened to this game.  I can't stand that class with at all and I make it known to the little whiners.<br />
<br />
They are overpowered shamans when they get their epics, but useless on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>mystreez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well seeing as how I started up a beastlord twink, I would have to say that the idea for the class was good just not well developed.  However they are alot of fun to play, and their pets at low levels are formidable for their level.<br />
<br />
The problem I see is that they have too many parent classes to worry about being a melee, pet, and caster has its disadvanatges. As they have no real definition 50+.<br />
Developers should have put alot more thought into their development and to their roles 50+</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">As a raid class, we're not outclassed by anyone, that's just the reality.  However, Overbalanced?  Hae you ever seena dr00d or Necro who was unhappy with their contribution to the endgame start a new Shammy?   &quot;Wow!  I can't solo worth sh!t, this EXP suxx0rs!&quot;  We can't quad kite, fear kite and aren't ideal for AoE, so our EXP is a little slower.  I think that our strength in the support area of the endgame is a reward for eveything we've put up with.  I can just imagine the cries and lamentation from all the 00bear guilds if we ever got nerfed.  &quot;OMG!  we can't do AoW anymore!   Jeez!  the Sleeper just hit the snoozebutton again!&quot;<br />
<br />
If you look at another class and say, &quot;Gee, they're overbalanced, Verant should get out the nerf stick (and let me watch),&quot; who does that reflect on, me or you?</div></div><hr />

Everyone in it is examining the very last .5% of a characters advancement lineage, or in other words level 60, full spellbook, rare or high end gear, and tons of AA points.<br />
<br />
I dont see it as even remotely fair to say that shamans are too powerful when your example is a shaman with torpor, bane, poxx, epic, canni5, fungi, jbb, and add a horse on to it also.  It makes me sick.  I really feel for the sub 45 (or sub50 without a jbb) shamans out there that are struggling because they feel they should be soloing, yet cant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The deleting of BLs would be the best thing that ever happened to this game.<br />
<br />
Thats just silly exaggeration.  I can't understand how so many people are unhappy with the BL class.  When was the last time either:<br />
<br />
<br />
a)  A raid leader said 'nahh, we don't need you, Mr. Shaman.  We have a Beastlord here.'<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
b) a beastlord said 'Please tell me how to balance my class.  Give me your non-BL opinion'<br />
<br />
<br />
In other words, it doesn't affect you, and they didn't ask for your opinion on how to balance their class.  so all these posts about BLs is just so much hot air.<br />

/agree jsmaze.<br />

I understand that FoH is one of (if not THE) best guild in EQ, and because of that the are going to have a lot of people just hanging out on their message board...but that forum is a ****tard-go-round.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">While I have no idea what a ****tard-go-round is I agree with Snap on his other points.<br />
<br />
BL are fine as I can tell cause I dont have one or know anyone who does,  and they do not take away fom any other class.  <br />
<br />
I dont know if they are good on raids cause I havent raided with one but I look forward to it anyway.<br />

<br />
Any shaman, after 34, that cant solo is a very weak shammy.<br />
<br />
Im 47, no JBB(believe me im trying my ass of to get one), but i can solo as well as the next sham(well, more downtime i guess)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I understand that you can solo as well as the next shaman, what I was saying is that *all* shamans (I should have said sub49 as ebolt and plague rock) may have a very hard time soloing.  Theres specific gear that totally helps this, such as regen bp's and the reif, but otherwise we dont really come close to necros, druids, wizards, bards and even arguably mages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Tain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I'd really have to argue that point since I solo'd some exp in just about every level from 1 to 50, long before there was ever such a thing as &quot;expansions.&quot;  We're talking Mithril Tunics and Gatorskin leggings here.   With the massive glut of equipment out there ANY Shaman can solo from 1 to 60 if they want to, easily.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
As a raid guild, I'd agree they are effective.  They basically own Veeshan.  Legacy of Steel may disagree with it, but that's up to the two of them to decide :)<br />
<br />
But if all you get out of this game is raiding, go buy NWN.. you'll be a happier camper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">In my opinion Shaman soloing before L34 is barely worth it unless you have decent hand me downs for gear. And while the bazaar makes uber gear available there's still the problem of affording it. My shaman (L36) is my original character and my main although I got distracted by a rogue (L42) for some time. I've got the cheap pieces of jaundiced, spine chill spear, and totemic on most of the other locations (quested the BP myself). I splurged on a chitin shield with the remainder of my plat from both characters.<br />
<br />
I've tried soloing at levels before 34 but it's just extremely poor value. Mana pool is low,   HP's drop in an alarming fashion, channeling rarely works, resistances are high (since low blue mobs are close to you in level) and DoT's, DD and melee just don't have the grunt. The 34 slow, dogdog, plague, DD and haste make a huge difference. Although even at this point soloing is as much about working on my neglected melee skills as xp.<br />
<br />
I've no doubt the skilled shaman's can solo. And i've learnt a hell of a lot from reading this board (although this is my first post) which may help me to become a skilled shaman. But to say that a shaman can easily and efficiently solo from 1 to 50 is a somewhat simplified view IMO. Quite a commonly held one though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>wyrm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">i just hit 50 few days ago. i solo'd most of my life(maybe grpd for 1 or 2 levels) i have 1 piece of jb armor(arms) a couple of totemic, spine chill, etc... kinda low ac and wis 848 ac fully buffed and 159 wis. yet i can solo fairly well. although i dont hit BW, WL or anything. oh and i will never see malo, pox, torpor. im poor and in a smaller guild :(<br />
<br />
edit: spelling</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">My Shaman was my first character so there was no twinking. I soloed 90% or more of my career.<br />
<br />
As I saw it:<br />
<br />
In the old days the key to soloing untwinked Shaman cheaply before dogdog was cheap AC, yes stuff like straw spun belt 10AC, lumberjacks cap, Totemic where can afford or quest. The tunic from the heart spider in guk and even the shield (was laughed about mine here, moons ago), Ulthork leathers, all cheap junk now but was not bad back then on newer server. You get the picture. Cheap AC, wis was expensive at those levels.<br />
<br />
Stack dots, best poison, old poison and disease get mob dead fast, don't forget slows. Fury line of self buffs, regen and haste when you have and other buffs including the AC buff. You will not be soloing yellows or evens but you will kill blues without dying. <br />
<br />
I may be wrong but big hitting weapons seemed to be the best like Runed Totem staff (or whatever that funky looking 2 hander that lit up was called was called )and Drakkel Forged Sledgehammer for the hard fights also stuff like a Cold Iron Morningstar and later a Jade Prod worked well. <br />
<br />
Today there is much better stuff around much cheaper, froot loops, orc fang ears, cougar claw ears were about 2k a pair then. I paid 2k for a Spine chill spear, Totemic helms went for 1 to 2k<br />
<br />
I went to 50 in about 40 days played time back then. Believe me if I did it with my junk almost anyone can.</div></div><hr />
