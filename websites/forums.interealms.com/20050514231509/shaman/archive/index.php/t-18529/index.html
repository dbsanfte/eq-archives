<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, what do you guys think about the new spell effects? Pretty cool eh? So far, everyone I've talked to loves them. Much nicer looking and they create less lag. <br />
I haven't tried every spell yet, but the ones I've seen have been pretty nice. Root actually looks like there are roots coming up from the ground to surround the targets legs. Not just cool looking, but people can actually see that the spell has been cast. Velium strike has swirling flakes of snow going around the target. Not an overwhelming graphic, but it doensn't obscure the target either. I think thats a nice call on the developers part. The coolest one of our spells that I've notices is Breath of Ultor. I puts a big tan skull next to the mob. Pretty evil looking, and I'm an Ogre so I love it.<br />
Nice to see a change that is all around for the better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I like the eye candy. I like the new cannibalize effect, but I'll have to get used to no grinding noise when I cast it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I turned spell effects on for the first time in months, and I think I'm going to leave them on.  I really like most of the effects I have seen so far, and I definately like being able to tell what spells other people are casting without having turn on PC spells and read my combat spam box.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I really like the Malos effect</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lol, so thats where those insects were coming from. Had a druid ask me if that was one of my dots, I told her no I thought it was one of hers. I feel kinda stupid now.  :( <br />
I've never left a positive feedback before, but I think this warrents one.</div></div><hr />

I only see a borign barely there blue bar...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zectash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I love them. I was talking to a Cleric friend while I was testing them out. The Slow is realy cool. Love the swarm of insects that swirl around the mobs. <br />
<br />
I had to jump on my Wizard, Necromancer, Druid, Cleric and Paladin to check out what thiers looked like. I must say I am very impressed with these new ones. Druid and Wizard realy give new meaning to &quot;Nuke&quot;. Necromancers DoTs and DD even the Undead slow were great. Didnt care much for the Undead DD though. Didn't seem to be much to it.<br />
<br />
I have my spell graphics up to 50%, 100% was too much at once. I did like the fact that they are not as hard on my Graphics card as the old ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>NharviSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Omg I like! Favorites so far.. Pox of B and slow. I watched hubby's necro and omg.. necro's looks so evil now. Shackle and CoC was the best ones I have seen so far. I like Focus effect and STA-buffs as well =)<br />
<br />
Always fun with new toys to play with.. if they could only stop patching now.. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

I had this same problem, but thanks to the kind people on the serverwide.crucible channel, I have the pretty!<br />
Load up testeverquest.exe<br />
Let it patch.<br />
See all those files it downloaded?  Those are the spell effects :)<br />
Close the patcher.<br />
run everquest.exe<br />
sit for an hour or so in Nexus just checking out all the pretty new effects :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>icebain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The AA Canni effect has not changed but the canni spell has little bones flying around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Pox/Ultor, Turgurs, and Spear of Torment are the best shaman effects IMO.  <br />
<br />
If you haven't seen Spear of Torment, make sure to check it out.  Green cobra snakes come outta the ground and strike the target.  Very slick.<br />
<br />
Pox is definately cool but I can't help but laugh everytime I see bert puking on my target. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Very cool. I agree about Spear of Torment being very slick. I have a Warrior alt and the procs on some of the weapons are very cool also.<br />
<br />
The only thing I don't like so far is Chloro. I'm not sure if all the regens are the same but if your the person that this is cast upon you're surrounded with so much blue/white light that you're pretty much blinded for a few seconds. Other than that. Good job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sancha Delnocha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Check out HoS very subtle but beautiful graphics.<br />
And Turgurs close up is amazing, the DETAIL in the insects is really awesome.<br />
  I also noticed that overall it wasn't as blinding when you had a lot of casting going on at once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The absolute best shaman spell effect:<br />

<br />
I was able to cast grow three times on my dog and finally got the hound of the baskerville's I always wanted.  It was pretty funny watching the double-takes as people ran past him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'm liking the new effects so far... I was always kind of annoyed that Velium Strike had the cheezy old nuke spell effects while Rangers got very cool new-fangled graphics on their only cold nuke.  I've really only checked my most commonly cast spells, but so far I really like what I see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have to agree spear of torment was a very cool looking effect. Had a couple people commenting that it was really cool looking when I was nuking last night =). Haven't tried q yet but a spell effect around the person for as long as it lasts will be great for knowing when it wears off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Stepping</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The new canni is funny when in bear form it looks like your letting one rip with all that gas around you</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I think that no sound around canni is an imporvement.  I awlays get complaints about the noise on me canni-dancing from others in my group.<br />
<br />
Over-all though the seplls look great, I'm just glad i bumbed up the ram in all my machines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I preferred having a sound with canni. I got kinda used to hitting the key by the sound of the spell going off without having to look at whether the icon had refreshed. Ho hum, there's more important things in life. They definitely seem to be less laggy than the old ones though, and that's the best thing of all imo.<br />
<br />
And yes, Burst of Flame does look soooooo sweet now. Wonder if it's worth getting SCF3 so I can use it more effectively... ;)</div></div><hr />

Once we figured it out, I got close up ... and someone earlier mentioned the detail on the insects ... WOW it's amazing. I have to say I loved Breath of Ultor ... lmao that skull coughing on the target is just great. Spear of Torment ROCKS ... and I like the new Canni effects, I wish they'd put them on the AA ability as well, but dammit SOE ... gimme my canni sound back !!!! I've got more important things to pay attention to than the spell-cast bar. Besides, I like everyone around me to know I'm gnawing my arm. *wink*</div></div><hr />

Group regen is probably the worst effect possible, since you have 6 ppl in a close area completely blued out.<br />
<br />
I have the same issue with canni - just a line of blue, but I guess it's better thn the troll farts it used to be.</div></div><hr />

I can't tell you how useful it is to know i am casting canni after getting into a rut of just pounding the button.  They need to get that taken care of asap.<br />
BTW. If you have people that complain about the sound of it they can just go die IRL because there are FAR more annoying things in the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have to totally agreee here. In a ldon group middle of the dungeon, &quot;Sure, ill just gruop regen...&quot; <br />
*casting*<br />
&quot;Omg, my optical nerve disconnected from my eye!&quot; <br />
<br />
besides that everything looks great, i do miss the sound of cann but i can live without. What i really miss is the cloud of majesty that it formed around the player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I hated the canni sound, after my 5464324846356th casting of canni4, it's pretty damn old.  I won't miss it.  I actually didn't even know it was gone until I read this thread, since I usually play EQ with sounds off anyway.  I find most of them annoying and repetitive, and they interfere with my music listening. =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I am surprised we killed anything last night.<br />
<br />
The melees were all going &quot;wooo look at my battle window!&quot;<br />
The casters were all going &quot;wooo look at the purty lights!&quot;<br />
<br />
As far as spell effects go, I enjoy Bane, Ultor, and Spear of Torment.<br />
<br />
However, Can4 has my vote for the best effect. Why? Because I don't have to see it unless I look down!</div></div><hr />

<br />
First time I cast this I was thinking I just cast a nuclear bomb on my group - or AE Blindness.  At least there will be no doubt in anyone's mind about whether or not I'm casting group regen.<br />
<br />
I'm still getting used to the new effects, but I like what I see so far for the most part.  It took me a few restarts of EQ to get all the effects working for some reason.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know where our canni sound went though, the bards got it on one of they songs and I had my bard guildleader moaning about it as it was going off constantly  :p .<br />
<br />
 I miss it myself even though I found it annoying when it was there, but got used to it and was used to timing my casting off it  :rolleyes: <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Shrewd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">poor poor bards...<br />
<br />
Alot of their songs now use sounds..<br />
<br />
For instance, i tried outa bard last night and the level 1 str/dex boost song has the canni sound effect.  Immagine having that sound go over an over again every 6 seconds forever, even while in battle.... bad bad bad SoE.<br />
<br />
But the graphic for bards healing song is hella sweet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Anyone MGB a 60+ raid with regen yet? :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">My little bard always had sound on his first song, it was kind of peppy.<br />
<br />
As for Cann4, I have sound on it, it sounds like you are casting lightning, then no sound for it going off, which is somewhat nice.  Even nicer since I don't look like I'm farting anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Pay careful attention to the Pox/Ultor graphic, the skull isn't just vomiting on the target, it is vomiting a pile of flying maggots.<br />
<br />
Extremely cool. I sat in the bazaar and chain cast it on myself for a long time. The skull also winks at you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">You sound like you were bored, Arri ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>zensation</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">well like some people i got some but not all of the spell effects untill later. I have to say im impressed with the skulls and stuff on cann and i really like the effect for HoS with the Bull head above each person. Now im Strong like Bull</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Haw many different times have they redone all of the spell effects now?<br />
<br />
As far as in the ones in this last patch or over all? Over all they have changed spell effects a few times, mostly certain spells by various classes, this time they changed all casters. <br />
<br />
Some of the sounds for the spells have changed too, which takes a little getting use too and the no sound for Can is a bit of an adjustment, though I can understand that groups found it annoying to hear a Shaman Canning away, very much like the Druid Wolf Form Howl, that was really annoying. <br />
<br />
What’s interesting is seeing the new spells when used in a Raid, its nearly distracting and the MOB is just one big Flash Point of light.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>chikasaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">as others have said. i love the pox,root, and some others.  also i agree there not as hard on my system as the old graphics used to be</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">my top three fav spell effects in order:<br />
<br />
1) Pox/BoU (SHM) - Gotta love the shower of maggots<br />
2) Cessation of Corr (NEC) - tons of blood and a heart/vein pumping in the middle, toss in a few black beetles... very nice.<br />
3) Horror (NEC) - the necro LDON curse.  Hard to describe, but there's lotsa black with a sort of eclipse in the middle.  inside the eclipse there is blue lightening attacking the targets head.<br />
<br />
Runners up are SHM and NEC poison DDs and Bane (our curse, not BoN).<br />
<br />
About sounds... I'm thrilled that they finally made canni 1-4 almost silent, but dissapointed they forgot CannV (same graphics too).  I'm also extremely annoyed and pissed that they put the old canni sound on bard songs and I'm pretty sure it's on something else too, but I haven't pinned down the source yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Avatar has the glowing yellow masks circling the target then disappearing in front of you, I thought that was pretty cool as well.<br />
<br />
I want my canni sound back :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">The AC stat spell (Ancient Guardian? whatever) is pretty cool, a phantom BP emerges from your chest.<br />
<br />
I like the new effects, I leave them on now when I'm not raiding.  Haven't had spell effects on in years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">more cool effects:<br />
<br />
1: Druid lightning stun<br />
2: Shaman summon pet spell<br />
3: Agility(cast on yourself and then start running, you get little shadowed men following you!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">After not having played with spell effects on at all since I started even casual raids, this is a pretty nice change.<br />
<br />
First from a raiding perspective the bard songs being changed from the constanly annoying pulse to notes flying around is a huge improvement.<br />
<br />
Second, You cannot possibly miss which mob is the current target when its at ground zero.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Oh, and I actually managed to avoid wasting a Q when I saw the cleric's HOT graphic appear around the tank I was casting on and interrupted.  Definately useful.</div></div><hr />
