<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Two quotes from old patch messages: <br />
<br />
Experience gained in dungeons designed for players level 30 and under will be increased. For many people, there is nothing more satisfying in EverQuest than adventuring in dungeons. By giving people the tools to help them succeed earlier, and rewards to match, we hope that more players will discover why many people feel this way. <br />

<br />
There is no complete offically accurate list available.<br />
<br />
The only information ever provided is a list of changes to the ZEMs.<br />
<br />
Pre-PoP, every single dungeon has a ZEM higher than any outdoor zone of the same time period.<br />
<br />
In PoP, every zone has an insanely high ZEM.</div></div><hr />
