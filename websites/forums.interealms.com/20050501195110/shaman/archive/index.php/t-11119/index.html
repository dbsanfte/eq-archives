<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Follow the following link for more information (http://pub149.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessage?topicID=30323.topic) but as a small recap a poster on The Druids Grove to SOE was requesting that pure LoY downloaded files be compiled into a list so users could create backup CD's.    Scott Hartsman responded directly stating that was a good idea along with a comment that explaining why SOE staff was not posting on class boards of late due to the upcoming LoY release.<br />
<br />
My perspective on this concerns why certain boards (aka The Druids Grove) seem to glean more interaction than any other board which seemly is purely based on the numbers.   Druids are a very popular class in EQ with sizeable population of total environment thus SOE gets a bigger bang for the buck posting on those boards.  Which seems to be reflective off our board since Shaman's are one of the smallest classes of the player base thus we hardly EVER see any SOE representation posting on this board.   <br />
<br />
However, I do not want to come across as if I am bemoaning the issue ... I understand that SOE is busy on LoY so they are barely posting anywhere today.   My comment is this is just another indication of why our class seems to be low on the priority list for spells, gear, AA, skills, etc ... we just get over-looked in the grand scheme of things.</div></div><hr />

so maybe we should copy the upgrade/improve/whine/&quot;delete single target buff&quot;  threads and paste them on the Druids Grove?<br />
<br />
and perhaps a moderator could expunge all the counter posts so that we presented a &quot;unified front&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I dont think the shaman class is as small as it once was. I see a hell of a lot of shamans these days, compared to many other classes (bards, shadowknights, wizards, mages, necros off the top of my head). Course, it could just be that I tend to notice other shamans when I do see them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hadd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">agree with 1st opinion , i am irritated by VI always posting on druids grove . druids are maybe the most played class , they are as well the most hated hands down . sorry had to whine .<br />
VI is not helping by showing that kind of attention on their boards , they stimulate jealousy.<br />

Thsts so sick and twisted i almost wanna do it lol<br />
<br />
Hey , atleast we would know they were reading them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What we NEED to do is have next week be &quot;Bitch about druids&quot; week.  Need to have a nice long post saying how much druids are overpowered and call for nerfage a few times.  <br />
I guaranTEE you we'll get a nice big post on their boards dedicated to the shaman class and player balance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Over at the cleric baords, there's a long thread about trying to get EQ devs to talk to clerics more.<br />
<br />
Someone made the comment that the &quot;devs post a lot more on other boards like the Shamans Crucible than they do on the cleric boards&quot;.<br />
<br />
The grass is always greener ...<br />
<br />
I make an idle observation that &quot;Gallenite&quot; has 5 posts total at the druid's grove. &quot;AbsorEQ&quot; has 7 posts total here at the crucible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes, and the druids unite for their cause and to solve their issues, while shamans shoot down any other shaman, who even dares to post something regarding the class or issues or whatever. There are those who shoot with &quot;We're fine, we're uber, we have Canni and Torpor&quot; types and then those who call others &quot;Whiner, go play another class/go quit EQ&quot;. SoE/Verant heard druids as they yelled together, while SoE/Verant is not worried about shamans - one shaman makes noise, 4 shamans hurry up to gag that person.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Gallenite has also posted here along with other SoE reps in the last 3 or so months since pop's release.<br />
<br />
If yall think this board doesnt get enough attention, then you havent read one of the more recent updates from Absor about the bugged affliction focus items.<br />
<br />
Id say every major issue with shaman has been responded to in one form or another. people like me dont waste time posting a long rant on this board about somehting is broken hoping it gets attention. I email directly to SOE and i usually get a response.<br />
It helps to be courteous and concise and youd be amazed at how far that gets you.<br />
<br />
I havent been checking  this board too often lately but whats our &quot;major issue&quot; this week? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I thought we were hating Pallies this week Chuk ;P</div></div><hr />

I thought those were the same people?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe we should copy the whine &quot;delete lvl 64 &amp; 65 single target buffs&quot;  thread and send via e-mail to EQFeedback@station.sony.com<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Cali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I am pretty sure they are scared to post on some boards, hence why they do not post frequently here or EQCleric.<br />
<br />
One tiny lil EQOA advertisement and the cleric community was ready to tear the poor PR rep to shreds.  Where as TDG may give them a different reception.   Though I dont know, I only read EQClerics and the Crucible. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I am pretty sure they are scared to post on some boards, hence why they do not post frequently here or EQCleric.  <br />
<br />
IMHO - SOE should not be &quot;Scared&quot; to post or comment in the general public on cause.    Personnel opinions are just that and should not be under the SOE namesake but Dev, Admin, Company groups need to enaged the public on matters.   If a board isn't fair in it's moderation ... thats a problem with the board but that's not a excuse for not publishing ANY comments.   <br />
<br />
Other than the PR posts on the company websites ... SOE Dev and Admin folks have been incommincato for a long time.   Scott Hartsman was posting pretty regular when he first started in his new role ... that's really been missed lately.   Even Absor posts are becomming a once a month (if that) type thing lately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Just because they dont post, doesnt mean they arent reading.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Sure they might be reading without posting but that only makes it harder for them because its human nature to focus on the things that are broken or bugged and forget all the things that actually work or gets fixed.<br />
<br />
There would be absolutely nothing wrong in posting regularily what they are working on and also making a brief note about what &quot;hot&quot; issues they are NOT working on and why. No response to the huge thread about worthless buff &quot;upgrades&quot; is stupid and confuses/annoys their customers even further.<br />
<br />
Verant and now SOE has always been a scary example of how bad PR a company can get away with and still be a success if they have no real competition. When they were most successful they had Abashi in charge of customer relations!!!</div></div><hr />
