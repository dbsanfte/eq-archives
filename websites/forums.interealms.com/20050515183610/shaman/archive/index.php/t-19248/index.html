<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After all that theoretical stuff I came up with I actually sat down and did some real number crunching.<br />
<br />
The adjusted spell cost concept<br />
To make my calculations easier I will be using something I call 'adjusted spell cost'. It is the regular spell cost plus the amount of mana lost by casting (instead of medding or cannibalizing). This will enable me to use the figures for full-time medding or cannibalizing instead.<br />
<br />
The scenario<br />
The scenario is as follows: a LDoN hard mission. It is completed in an hour. Fifty MOBs are killed, each of them in 50 seconds. then 10 seconds are spent pulling the next MOB. MOB resists rate for <br />
normal spells is 10%. Resist rate for -30 resist adjustment spells is 5%. Resist rate for -100 resist adjustment spells is 0%. The MOBs mitigate slow by 25%.<br />
I will be calculating what kind of damage the priest classes can heal and how much they can dish out.<br />
<br />
The characters<br />
The characters are lvl 65 with 35 AAs. They each have Mana Preservation IV, Spell Haste IV and FT4.<br />
<br />
The Shaman<br />
AA skills are: Any 6 in general, Mental Clarity 3, Spellcasting Mastery 3, Cannibalisation<br />
<br />
The Druid<br />
AA skills are: Any 6 in general, Mental Clarity 3, Spellcasting Mastery 3, Spirit of the Wood 1<br />
<br />
The Cleric<br />
AA skills are: Any 6 in general, Mental Clarity 3, Spellcasting Mastery 3<br />
<br />
Mana Regeneration<br />
VoQ is obtained before entering the dungeon. Together with self buffs and emptying the mana pool over in an hour this gives us the following possible regeneration:<br />
Shaman: 130 per tick(includes cannibalizing)<br />
Cleric: 66 per tick<br />
Druid: 70 per tick<br />
<br />
The mana loss per second spent casting is:<br />
Shaman: 15.59 (cannibalize mana)<br />
Cleric: 3.67 (medding mana)<br />
Druid: 3.67 (medding mana)<br />
<br />
Calculations<br />
Shaman healing<br />
Slow is casted as soon as the MOB arrives, if slow is resisted it is recast as soon as possible. Multiple resists do not happen. This gives us two possibilities, slow sticks on the first try or it takes two casts for slow to stick.<br />
If it sticks on the first try (90%) it will land after 4.95 seconds, giving us 55.05 seconds to heal or generate mana.<br />
The adjusted slow cost(see above) is 250(base) * 0.75 (SCM3, Mana preservation, Specialisation) + 4.95 (cast time, recast time) * 15.59 (mana not cannibalized) = 265.<br />
After a resist(10%) the second slow is landed after 10.4 seconds, giving us 49.6 seconds for healing or mana generation. The adjusted slow cost is 537.<br />
With the shaman being able to generate 130 mana per tick this gives us an average of 1008 (0.9 * 1035 + 0.1 * 766) mana per MOB for healing. The MOB will be slowed, on average, by 49.4%, mainly due to slow mitigation reducing the slow percentage from 75% to 56%.<br />
The adjusted mana cost for Kragg's Mending is 511. Kragg's heals 1950, or 3854 if you factor in slow. Since we have mana to cast 1.97 Kragg's per fight this will heal a total of 7592 damage per MOB. With a fight time of 50 seconds this means shaman healing will keep up with up to 152 melee DPS.<br />
<br />
Shaman damage<br />
A fight time of 50 seconds is just barely enough for Blood of Saryrn to run the full time, thus one will be used per MOB. The rest of the mana will be spent nuking.<br />
Starting at a theoretical 1300 mana per MOB and substracting the adjusted mana cost for Blood of Saryrn (572) leaves us 728 mana for Velium Strikes. Thus far we have done 2240 * 0.9(resists) = 2016 damage.<br />
Velium Strike does an adjusted 833 damage for 400 mana. 728 mana will let us cast Velium Strike 1.82 times per MOB, adding another 1516 damage.<br />
Total damage per MOB is 3532, which means a DPS of 58.9, or 70.6 if you count the fight time only.<br />
<br />
Druid Healing<br />
A druid will regenerate 700 mana per MOB. The druid semi-complete heal has an adjusted mana cost of 517 and heals 4680. Since a druid will be able to cast 1.35 heals per MOB he will heal a total of 6318 damage per MOB, which negates up to 127 DPS.<br />
<br />
Druid Damage<br />
The druid will be casting his big DoT, Swarming Death once per MOB. The rest of the mana will be spent nuking with Winter's Frost. Note that Swarming Death has a -100 resist adjustment. It will deal 1440 damage for an adjusted cost of 326 mana, leaving 374 mana to nuke with.<br />
Winter's Frost does 1395 damage after resists and costs 361 mana to cast. 1.04 casts per MOB add an additional 1451 damage for a total of 2891 damage per MOB, or 48 DPS (58 DPS  actual combat time).<br />
<br />
Cleric Healing<br />
A cleric's mana regeneration gives us 660 mana per MOB. The adjusted cost for a Comlete Heal is 357. Assuming Complete Heal can land for 6000 a cleric can thus heal 11092 damage per MOB. With a fight time of 50 seconds that means a cleric can keep up with up to 222 DPS.<br />
<br />
Cleric Damage<br />
The cleric will be nuking with Condemnation. I will also make a separate calculation for Destroy Undead. Condemnation has an adjusted mana cost of 339 and an average damage of 990. 660 mana per MOB means a cleric will cast condemnation 1.95 times for a total damage of 1931 and a DPS of 32 (39 DPS fight time only).<br />
Destroy Undead is considerably more efficient, doing 47 DPS instead ( 56 DPS fight time only).<br />
<br />
Now for some realism<br />
Now I will factor in some movement - fight time is still 50 seconds but the 10 seconds are not spent pulling but moving. The shaman will have 156 less mana available per MOB, the druid and cleric both loose 37 mana. I will also add in Spirit of the Wood. This brings our numbers to:<br />
Shaman Healing: 129<br />
Shaman Damage: 64<br />
Druid Healing: 127 (123 if Spirit of the Wood can only be used on the tank)<br />
Druid Damage: 55<br />
Cleric Healing: 209<br />
Cleric Damage: 36 (53 on Undead)<br />
(All numbers represent DPS and reflect 50 second fights)<br />
<br />
The fun part<br />
Now, what happens if you have resistant MOBs? Obviously shaman healing will suffer, druid and cleric healing will be unaffected and everyones DPS will go down.<br />
For the following numbers I assume a resist rate of 50% on all spells without resist adjustments. Malos will bring normal spells to a 10% resist rate. Hand of Ro will lower resist on fire spells to 5%. -100 resist adjustment spells will land for full without debuffs. Druids will switch to Summer's Flame so they can use Hand of Ro to debuff.<br />
I will ignore the fact that the fight time is too short to malos and still have Blood of Saryrn run fully. I will also ignore that everyone will be best of debuffing one MOB and the chainnuking and skipping nuking on the next one.<br />
Shaman Healing: 51<br />
Shaman Damage: 47<br />
Druid Healing: 127 (123 if Spirit of the Wood can only be used on the tank)<br />
Druid Damage: 44<br />
Cleric Healing: 209<br />
Cleric Damage: 18 (53 on Undead)<br />
(All numbers represent DPS and reflect 50 second fights)<br />
<br />
Stuff I ignored<br />
The shaman will often have single seconds left and nothing to do except hoping to catch a med tick.<br />
The value of Cannibalisation increases and the value of Cannibalize IV decreases as total time spent casting <br />
increases.<br />
Pet damage, including hammer damage and charm pet damage.<br />
Cleric melee damage.<br />
Druid DS damage (might add that later)<br />
<br />
Comments, Conclusions<br />
I was amazed at how much difference the debuffing and moving made. Looking at my numbers I can now understand how easy it is for other classes to say shaman are fine or even overpowered. It takes the concepts of adjusted spell mana cost <br />
and mana lost by not actively cannibalizing to understand why there are problems at all. It also explains why shaman do not notice anything wrong until reaching this level and equipment.<br />
I think this is alarming because the trend of high mana regeneration, high MOB damage, slow mitigation, MOB resistance and time limits, coupled with the overpriced shaman spells will, if it continues, turn what today is a moderate problem for well-equipped lvl 65 shaman into a major problem for every 60+ shaman.<br />
<br />
I would love to hear your take on this. Feel free to ask questions or point out errors I made. This is rather complex and I am not 100% sure I did everything right.<br />
<br />
Edit: clarification x2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Do your cannibalizing calculations include catching all med ticks? (they appear to)  If so that will slant the numbers toward an unrealistic mana regen rate. <br />
<br />
I would bet very few shaman have the time or inclination to &quot;dance&quot; anymore and even when they do they are lucky to catch 2/3 ticks while dancing. That combined with the total lack of functional downtime makes catching med ticks difficult. <br />
<br />
The only active mana regen you can really count on being used at the maximum rate is Cann5, and you should probably subtract the 200 unadjusted mana and 5.25-8.25 seconds (depending on spell haste) you will spend Q'ing yourself for each canny.<br />
<br />
Great work though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Only thing you missed (that I can see) was druid DS on the MA and the DPS that added.  Considering it's mana efficieny it's a big plus for druids.  Also, under resist situations BoS will not run full course as the shaman will re-attempt slow rather than dot.  I haven't fully analised it myself as my brain and math tend have a death feud going, but it looks very interesting.<br />
<br />
EDIT Also, there is a solid resist rate on BoS ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Unless I messed up (and thats entirely possible) the shaman mana regen is standing only.<br />
<br />
Yep, i did ignore the druid DS. I might add that latr, for now I will add it under 'stuff I ignored'. Thanks for catching that.<br />
<br />
I assumed the same resist rate for all spells sharing a resist adjustment ( in the case of Blood, none).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Mana Regeneration<br />
VoQ is obtained before entering the dungeon. Together with self buffs and emptying the mana pool over in an hour this gives us the following passive regeneration:<br />
Shaman: 130 per tick(includes cannibalizing)<br />
Cleric: 66 per tick<br />
Druid: 70 per tick<br />
<br />
The mana loss per second spent casting is:<br />
Shaman: 15.59 (cannibalize mana)<br />
Cleric: 3.67 (medding mana)<br />
Druid: 3.67 (medding mana)<br />
<br />
<br />
Emphasis mine.<br />
<br />
Canni is not passive mana regen.  If Canni was figured into this set of numbers (and it HAD to be) then it cannot be considered under the passive mana regen heading.  <br />
<br />
Cleric Yaulp 5 is also not passive mana regen, and if it was included here (and it looks like it was) then it also needs to be removed. <br />
<br />
I would recommend that you have a passive mana regen category and an active mana regen.  Druid would not change at all I dont believe, but the shaman and cleric (particularly the shaman) would take drops.  Considering that 80% of the rest of the data is resting on the figures you present in this category I believe that the rest of the research is flawed.<br />
<br />
Also, please explain this:<br />
The adjusted mana cost for Kragg's Mending is 511. Kragg's heals 1950, or 3854 if you factor in slow. Since we have mana to cast 1.97 Kragg's per fight this will heal a total of 7592 damage per MOB. With a fight time of 50 seconds this means shaman healing will keep up with up to 152 melee DPS.<br />
<br />
I dont know about YOUR Kraggs, but mine ALWAYS heals only 1950 whether I slow or not.</div></div><hr />

Ooops, thats supposed to read 'possible' meaning 'if you do nothing but get mana back'.<br />
<br />
Cleric Yaulp 5 is also not passive mana regen, and if it was included here (and it looks like it was) then it also needs to be removed.<br />
This is without Yaulp. Yaulp only helps if you are meleeing. As I did not figure in cleric melee Yaulp is out.<br />

Luckily it is only mislabeled.  :)  Would hate to do this all again.<br />

That is the amount of damage Kragg's heals multiplied by how much the MOB is slowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I just want to point out, there's no way I'd ever cast Kragg's. With maxxed AHA, AHG and IH 4 item, tnarg's is more mana intensive but allows me to be more flexible.</div></div><hr />

Oh, there comes a point when Tnarg's also becomes cheaper then healing with Kragg's. But the point is to show how much sustained healing is possible, so I went with the most mana-efficient alternative.<br />
<br />
By the way, this is not pretty at all when you run the scenario with time level gear  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">This is without Yaulp. Yaulp only helps if you are meleeing. As I did not figure in cleric melee Yaulp is out.<br />
<br />
Umm...Im going to disagree.  The fact that Yaulp 5/6 has components to it that assist in better melee results is FAr outweighed by the 10/12 mana/tic that it generates.  Yes, it cannot be used on horseback or sitting, but in this scenerio with constant moving in an LDoN hard setting it is a very viable way for a cleric to augment their mana pool as it stacks with other mana regen spells.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Why are you factoring in the amount the mob is slowed.  Kraggs ONLY heals 1950.  The fact that the mob is slowed has absolutely no relevance on how much damage Kraggs will heal.  As you did not have any healing AA's in your setup, Kraggs will only ever heal 1950 damage.  This is the common misconception that shaman are fighting agaisnt right now.  Just because the mob is slowed does not make out heals any better (the 3000+hp that you are suggesting here).  A 100% resisted slow or a 0% resisted slow has no effect on the 1950 that I can heal with Kraggs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Okay, I see the mana calc now, I am a tard.  It just seems high because of the number of times per minute or so you will have to Q yourself, which costs you mana + time.  <br />
<br />
If you chain canny solid for the 3 minutes it takes cann5 to refresh, you will have done 6200+ damage to yourself, which would require 5+ casts of Q to rectify with no SCR.</div></div><hr />

But the theoretical mana regen for a cleric assumes you are medding full time so Yaulp does nothing for them. They way I calculate mana is, I start from the mana for medding full time and then when I cast a spell I substract the mana for the spell as well as the mana lost by not medding. Or in the case of shaman, not cannibalizing.<br />

If it makes you feel better exchange 'HPs healed' for 'damage negated'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shayne716</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">A few Quick points-<br />
<br />
Malos?  In hard missions this is almost a must spell not only if you expect/project 90% of slows landing but nukes and dots for yourself and your grp members as well.  Please add this to your model.<br />
<br />
Again as someone pointed out Cannibilize is active and are you accounting for the hp loss that the shaman occurs get this additional mana?<br />
<br />
As many shaman know(my opinion) the problem is not having enough mana as compared to other priest it is our &quot;fast healing and Damage&quot; is dead last in both cases by a very large margin.  Try using a KM in a hard mission after debuffing/slowing if you are the healer.  Guarantee its &quot;KM to target&quot; as i do not know a tank that can take 15+ secs of melee without heals/stuns from these mobs.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Doubling Shaman Heals based off slow-  do you know any clerics or druids that will do a hard mission without a slower?  Please adjust shaman heals back to their true value.<br />
<br />
Agro/Death Factors-  Slow on inc then slap our bigest dot on as soon as it lands.   You expect to channel 10 sec spells during this time too right?<br />
<br />
The DS point is also excluded as has the Clerics reverse dmg shield that heals all the grp members every time they hit the mob.<br />
<br />
I applaud your efforts but as Thott has proven getting an accurate and inclusive model can be hard.  Another factor is mob dps I haven't parsed it but i would venture even slowed the mobs put out over 200 dps.  Thus making the healing a shaman can provide using only KM a problem.<br />
<br />

Malos is already being used, check under 'the fun part'.<br />
<br />
Again as someone pointed out Cannibilize is active and are you accounting for the hp loss that the shaman occurs get this additional mana?<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />

Considering that the maximum amount of damage the shaman can keep up with in this scenario is about that of a Sebilis MOB I think we can safely dismiss this factor. :D <br />
<br />
Doubling Shaman Heals based off slow-  do you know any clerics or druids that will do a hard mission without a slower?  Please adjust shaman heals back to their true value.<br />
As the point of this scenario is to show what each class is capable of on its own (except for VoQ - and that wouldn't be in if I could ever find a pickup group who will go without) I will keep this in. I could add the unmodified value but I feel that would be misleading. Hmm. Will have to think about it.<br />
<br />
Agro/Death Factors-  Slow on inc then slap our bigest dot on as soon as it lands.   You expect to channel 10 sec spells during this time too right?<br />
Apart from the fact that the healing and damaging are completely separate, and the damage calculation does not include slow . . . yes, thats what this scenario assumes. It should work quite well with a Shadowknight or Paladin. A Warrior might have trouble keeping the MOB off you I guess. But as this stuff is impossible to quantify I did not include it.<br />
<br />
The DS point is also excluded as has the Clerics reverse dmg shield that heals all the grp members every time they hit the mob.<br />
Give me a reliable way to calculate the healing from that and I will include it.<br />
<br />

Please do not mention me and Thott in the same sentence. I could easily have rigged this to show how bad shaman healing is and refrained from it, which makes me very different from Thott.<br />
And yes, a shaman can certainly not heal a group by himself on a hard adventure. That was not the point though - the point is, that under the conditions listed a shaman can negate the listed amount of damage (or deal the listed amount of damage). To get real world numbers you will have to parse, there is no way around it. All you can do with numbers on a piece of paper is show the proportions and relations, in this case how shaman healing and damage stacks up to that of druids and clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">certainly interesting, i was like noway shaman heals like that but then read rest, perhaps make sure that you make it clear that the top one is if we didnt move, or do anything else other than canni (no fa , hasting, and dont use our tnargs, but the more mana efficient krag etc) was q included?<br />
and saryn would unlikely complete its run.<br />
<br />
i think the lower one probably reflects what the average shaman actually manages to do.<br />
<br />
just an edit. in reality if we could heal the same as the druid as the lower amount would suggest then i could heal in hard ldon easily and elemental planes, and i know i can`t. so it is still theoretical.<br />
are you casting heals at same time canni? i was abit confused here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Just from antidotal evidence of personal experience I think you are spot on veeshan.<br />
<br />
I’m just a lvl 62 shaman, still don’t have canni V, or many FT items yet, so maybe I’ll change my mind once I get more aa’s and better gear, but I have the same complaints that many “Uber Shaman” have complained about.<br />
<br />
I’ve noticed the huge difference in my character’s ability to keep up with the pace of the group, based on the factors that you suggest in your number crunching.  During static camps where I am rarely resisted, manna is hardly ever a problem. But during a fast paced ldon, especially one where mobs are more resistant and I have to malo, I’m consistently lom, and am usually aching from my own canni. <br />
<br />
During Ldon’s I never get back to full manna after summoning dog dog, and am consistently below 20% manna by the time we’re near the end.  I am constantly canniing, so much so that I sometimes fall behind when the group is OTM, as I wait the extra 2 seconds rather than interrupt the canni (or worse am snared by my own dumb stoic).  If I’m not casting malo, slowing, or spot healing, I’m canniing.  Still the pace is such that there is just never enough time for me to canni to full after I’ve got the mob slowed.<br />
<br />
 I’ve found it very frustrating that often the other players in my group seem to assume that I will always be full manna because of canni, and if I declare that I’m lom if I just “canni up” I’ll be good , but I quite literally never get enough time to “canni up”, as there is never a brake to the pulling unless the cleric warns he’s lom.  For some reason most other classes don’t realize just how much time it takes me to malo, slow, and spot heal, and I can’t do that and canni at the same time. <br />
<br />
If I am in a static camp and don’t have to malo, my shaman is uber.  If I have to malo often and move, I’m always lom, and usually below 70% health because there is just not enough time for me to debuff, slow, canni, and heal my self, and not skip the next pull.<br />
<br />
It seems obvious to me that since shaman spells are inefficient compared to other priest spells with the notion that canni makes up for it, if you put a shaman in a place where it is hard for him to canni (on the move a lot, little to no down time), and then add any other stress (like the extra manna cost and lost time spend on debuffing), the shaman is going to have a hard time keeping up. <br />

 A fast paced group is exponentially harder for a shaman to keep up with than other classes.  I suspect this is why apparently some shaman think that the class is still the UBER class it of the past, while other players, perhaps in environments with more time stress, feel that shaman are falling behind.  If I sit in a static camp where I rarely need to debuff, I have time to canni, and am usually full FM.  If I am OTM a lot, it is harder for me to regen the manna, but the inefficiencies in my spells cost are still present, so I am penalized with less compensation from canni to make up for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">pretty much hit the nail there, shaman are penilised for canni with higher mana spell, but there is a time element envolved with canni, (greatly help by canni5, but not completely negated) aand then we have the slowest cast spells of any class. which means we are penilised again. not only do we need time to regen mana , we need more time to cast them, this wasnt such a problem when killing mobs took 2 mins or more and we had time, but now with the faster death/pulling and the fact that for ldon anyway it is a moving group means that shaman (and i pretty well equipement full vt gear and in elementals now and 126 aa) <br />
is just abit too slow, we have all the right stuff to make us good, but just cant cast them quick enough.<br />
<br />
one big pull even in normal ldon can mean that my mana bar goes from full to 1/2 or less in a very sort time and then spend the next few fight trying to regain this. and if i am main healer on normal ldon i general am constantly casting q and turgurs and the tnargs for the ood boost to q, which means i dont get alot of time to canni or dot or dd. and it very hard work compare to say a druid healer, so though we can do it, doesnt mean it is easy or that we dont need a look at.<br />

on a side note i love the oh but you can solo , but at the end of the day necro,druid,and wizards can solo pretty much the same things and do it 10x quicker thatn us..</div></div><hr />
