<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Banuddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been wondering this as of late, and have been unable to find a solid answer, so I figured I'd see if anybody on the boards could give any input.  Answers backed with actual testing would be ideal, but any input would be appreciated.  Also, is there a breaking point when you start to receive diminished returns from AC, and if so, what is it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
However once you get up to a high amount of AC the value of it goes primarily by 100s...  1300 is nice 1400 is nicer 1500 is nicer still but 1480 isnt much better than 1400.  1510 vs 1490 is more of a shift than 1490 vs 1410.<br />
<br />
Monsters hit for one of 20 values.  Base+modifier*random(20).  If your ac is below a certain threshhold which varies monster to monster there is a chance that it will hit for full damage regardless...  If your ac is BAD enough you get hit for full practically every time...  Once you get rid of that percentage you get a percentage shot that the monster will hit for the minimum number and the mean value drops an increment every unit of AC (which for the big monsters seems to be by 100s)...  <br />
<br />
Most of this info was figured out on the warrior boards but it certainly holds for shamen...<br />
<br />
By example there is a pretty large difference in what you get hit for in LDON 65 normal if your ac is above 1300 vs below 1300.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think what you are referring to is what they used to call a &quot;soft cap.&quot; Up until PoP, there was a point, especially for warriors, where damage mitigation due to AC dropped off (in much the same manner as HP gained from Stamina drops off after a certain level). IIRC the soft cap for warriors was either 1250 or 1350, and the cap for shaman was thought to be either 1200 or maybe a bit less. YMMV on those numbers.<br />
<br />
However, the parses I've read since PoP came out seem to indicate that this soft cap no longer exists, and the previous poster is correct that mitigation just seems to jump in chunks now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually this is what scares me most about the whole warrior rebalancing debate -- It scares me to death that they might nerf the shaman ability to mitigate damage...  <br />
<br />
I mean with my ac and hit points I have survived resisted AE slows where 3 or 4 monsters unslowed charge you in LDON normal...  <br />
<br />
I would be *REALLY* upset if they monked us and all of a sudden if 2 charged me I would be dead before you could say heal the shaman.</div></div><hr />
