<br />
There's a mob in Frontier Mountains named Thuuga Dengible at loc -1900, -2200... he is about level 51 or so, quite resistant, hits for like 185.<br />
<br />
he procs a spell that turns you into a goblin for about 10 minutes... was scaring the absolute piss out of newbies at the giant fort ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Neat, how'd you do that=)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Griz... that tell in your sig.. is hilarious. <br />
<br />
thanks for the chuckle. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hehe, check this one out :D :D :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hehe, nice.<br />
<br />
Out of curiosity, Griz, what's the story behind Nikkiel's tell there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just being nasty... it was at the HS zonein, waiting for an epic druid (who couldnt keep all the spawns clear) to leave so I could take over... well she had like 4 roots resist in a row, so I malosi her pyre golem...<br />
<br />
The rest is history :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We have some good Druids on Xev: Courbis (Abayle now I think), Nini, Sylve to name but 3.<br />
<br />
But it's the bad ones with no concept of game mechanics, other classes or basic courtesy who ruin the rep for the rest of them.  I suppose the same can be said of any class, but as I have quoted before:<br />
<br />
&quot;Not all Druids are jerks - but all jerks are Druids.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I must go figt this guy so I can get a pic  of me as a gobby for my sig.<br />
<br />
What are the chances of a 46 shaman surviving long enough to get turned?<br />
<br />
&quot;Not all Druids are jerks - but all jerks are Druids.&quot; and im stealing that quote.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">he procs REALLY often... I just buffed my HP up first. the main problem is with 70mr (not sure what the spell is based on) I resisted it each time, and was getting my ass kicked (doubling for 185 often)... so I ran away and cast Malosini on myself, and healed, and ran back up and engaged him :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>T'harkis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i had to malo and malosini myself and pull off half my gear for him to land the spell on me.  It's not a proc, he casts it, so slowing him doenst slow down how often he tries to transform you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hahah Grizlor rules. Grizlor has got to be one of the funniest guys on my server. You should read his posts on the Seventh Hammer boards, great stuff. Awesome pic Griz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Warning to photo hunters - as far as I know, that goblin summons.<br />
<br />
Although mobs don't summon unless you have done them damage right? So you could slow him, wait to get transmogrified, take a photo, then gate out :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bazoom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I had to malo/malosini myself, and still took ages before he turned me into a goblin. Was fun running over to the fort and people were screaming &quot;REDCON GOBLIN!!&quot; :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I purposely didn't damage him knowing this heh :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">you have given me a GREAT time sinnk besides the Iksar cudgels :) <br />
<br />
<br />
That rocks</div></div><hr />
