&quot;THE SHAMAN who KNOWS he can SOLO anything in the ZONE&quot;<br />
<br />
lol, now i not sure if we could when they removed the mitagation (perhaps we could with slow working fully? anyone say? )? but i know with it i found it very hard to solo any mob in WOS in beta, basically summoning makes it very hard for a shaman to solo as we dont have that great a defensive ablilities or skills:) <br />
<br />
with correct gear i sure we could, but then so could most other casters i would assume:)<br />
<br />
it does get me that there is still this myth surrounding shaman and how well we can solo stuff.</div></div><hr />
