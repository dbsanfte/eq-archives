<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm done with EQ. A game I thought I'd be playing until they kicked me screaming off the server. Now the magic has just paled away. Don't know where really, I reactivated with OoW after a year of being inactive. I met up with some very old friends, had a few laughs and then realized I just didn't fit in anymore. Different pace, different people, different me.  Different pvp too, which was a big issue.<br />
<br />
It's been helluva adventure though, and much of it is owed to the great people on the Crucible. Thanks to each and every one of, but especially to the pioneers and posters who kept it positive, constructive and were able to see both sides of the fence even when they didn't totally agree. There's way too many of you to make a list.<br />
<br />
I'm staying as far away from online games as I would a mammoths fart in downwind on a pale Everfrost morning, cause they are the devil. So I won't be seeing any of you really. Most likely cutting off the board surfing too cause quite frankly I'm starting to realize I have no clue what the darn most of you are talking about nowadays. Call me grumpy 'n old. <br />
<br />
Stay frosty, and don't forget to cap an elf a day.<br />

I have watched you in action and been impressed...I remember reading your posts about PvP waaay back and thinking &quot;I wish I was as tough as Asta&quot;. Good luck wherever you go. You were one of the very best sir.<br />

On a side note , you have always stuck in my mind as I'm a David Gemmell fan , and Asta Khan is a character in his books , a tough nut shaman of course :)</div></div><hr />
