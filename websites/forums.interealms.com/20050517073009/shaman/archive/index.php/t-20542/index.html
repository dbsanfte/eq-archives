<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lohknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How many of you have tried your luck at the Casino?  I'm about 50k in the hole and no Gold Ticket.  I want to hear your stories.  How much have you spent?  Did you get a gold ticket?  What did you turn it in for?<br />
<br />
The only things I've gotten are Beer Goggles, Snakeskin Gloves, Gnomish Fireworks, Crappy Stat Food, Some gems, and Illusion Potions.  That's right, Illusion potions.  What a slap in the face to shamans, talk about flooding the Bazaar Illusion Potion market.  They sell for under the price it costs to buy wormwood.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dear SOE<br />
<br />
Illusion potions are very integral to shaman balance. Please remove them from the casino. Also run 5 infringes on money I can make from SoW donations. Get rid of that, and you can stop worrying about healing upgrades. Balance solved.<br />
<br />
love and kisses,<br />
<br />
Flabbo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lohknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok Illusion potions aren't that big a deal.  But I used to make decent plat by constantly having hard to find illusion potions on my trader, and that's completely gone.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I'm more interested in how much people have spent, and if they've gotten any luck so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaeydee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Got my gold ticket in around 75k.<br />
<br />
Got me a guise...the only thing I wanted. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Batuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have gambled about 400k or so and no golden ticket yet.  However, I found a ticket for sale and negotiated the price down to 237K.  I turned it down for Vibrating Guantlets.  :(  I have more to gamble and I will spend it all until I get the guise.<br />
<br />
Before people starting tripping about spending all that money--it is my choice.  There is nothing I can buy in the Bazaar for an upgrade and all of my tradeskills are maxxed.  I don't twink either so I have nothing else to spend money on.<br />
<br />
If you are broke or could use plat, stay away from the casino.  The casino is there strictly to suck money out of the game.<br />
<br />
Finally, I know there will be people that say &quot;Damn, how do you get all that plat?&quot; and &quot;I'm always broke.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Here are some logical tips on making plat:<br />
<br />
1) When new expansions come out, farm new items that are high in demand.<br />
<br />
2) When in groups, roll for any droppable item that [I]nobody wants.  You worked for that item just as much as everyone else in the group.  The people that 'pass' to be nice in my guild are always the poor ones.<br />
<br />
3) Clear out your bank or strip any twinks of items that you do not need.  Historically, prices almost always go down in Everquest.  Sell them high while you can.  New expansions bring better items.<br />
<br />
4) Create an AFK Bazaar trader if you can.  Whether you use another account or sell while you sleep or work, it all helps.  When I'm at my keyboard, the last thing I want to do is stand around in the Bazaar.<br />
<br />
5) Farm quest or tradeskill items.[/INDENT]<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">136k down no gold ticket yet....<br />
<br />
/rude barbarian illusion potions<br />
<br />
They could have put a few checks in for rewards....<br />
Check race at least before giving you and illusion for the race you are.<br />
<br />
The Casino was a great idea but the reward system was very poorly implemented.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Since they returned it, I spent 2k in tokens. I kept winning tokens on that run and was a couple times even had over 100 tokens just from the stack I started with. That time I didn't win anything. But I like that they greatly improved the chances of winning tokens back. <br />
<br />
The next time I went I bought another stack and got my gold ticket on the 10th coin or so.<br />
<br />
My prize? A Rubicite Breastplate. /shrug<br />
<br />
At least I can sell it for more coin. I buy a stack of coins before I log each night and keep trying my luck. Only other stuff I won was numerous illusion potions, a stick with 5 charges of illusion Tree, and an instant click gate potion with one charge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">yes i only spent about 20k:) as soon as i got a pretty good hand and only got a crappy 50pp gem i know that is was crap. a pretty good hand to me means aleast a lower end (nice ) equipement piece. not half the price of a token.<br />
<br />
what they need to do is redo it to make it 1 more fun, and 2 better scaling prizes like have bronze, silver and gold tickets, if the gold tickets are that rare they should be uber items, then decent for silver and ok for bronze then the crap stuff:)<br />
<br />
for the fun part i would like a game that has abit of skill aswell as luck involved, like blackjack playing against the dealer, where 21 (blackjack) is the gold ticket, a win with 21 silver and a win with 20 bronze other wins are the token/crappy items. of course that likely to hard to do but you get the idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I spent about 30K and got a ticket that I turned in for a guise of the deceiver. <br />
<br />
I then spent about 12K and got another ticket that won me a smashing rubicite bp. I haven't been to see how many tribute points that will be worth but selling it in the bazaar might just get my 12K back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ryoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">decided one night to mess around in casino... had never been there... i even had to have a guildy show me exactly where it was.<br />
<br />
took 10k out of the bank.<br />
bought 5stacks of tokens<br />
<br />
started turning them in 1 at a time. got nothing but stat food<br />
<br />
decided to turn them in 4 at a time(was getting sleepy)<br />
<br />
on second 4 token turn in got a gold ticket<br />
<br />
ran upstairs and got my guise of the deceiver.<br />
<br />
total coin spent for mask... 4k<br />
<br />
played some more after winning mask. maybe 2k more 4 tokens at a time... won total of 40 tokens back.<br />
<br />
still have over 3 stacks left  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Before they took it down last time I got two tickets in one sitting.  First one I got a Rubi BP. Disappointed, I sat back down and started pumping the rest of my coins in and lo and behold...another ticket!  Got a guise the second time and the next time they took the thing down hehe.<br />
<br />
Sonce they brought it back I put some plat in, not a whole lot though (maybe 20k).  Beer goggles, harvest potions, illusions and an insta-gate potion.<br />
<br />
weee :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I am down about 150k, no golden ticket.  Got some beer goggles and enough vegetable stew to last until I leave the game for WoWII or EQIII however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Galgor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">18k Spent, Got a guise</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">only spent 20k.  Don't plan on spending really any more, since I spent prob about 100k total everytime that it's been up with nothing to show for it.  It took till the last 2k from that 100k before I finally got something I could put in my bank, and that was the deluxe sewing bag.  I know a guildee who spent 2k total and got a gold ticket, and I have another one that didn't get one with 610k</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>BelegurthValar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">200k is nothing compared to how brutual that camp was back in the day.<br />
Used to be a massive KS fest as well, thanks to a certain pair of Wizards.<br />
I think I spent like 40 hours or so straight when I got mine orginally.. which is while nothing compared to Ragefire camps was pretty nasty back then.<br />
<br />
I must admit though, I did bitch for a bit when I found out they brought Guises back due to wanting to be one of the few with em and feel oldschool elite.<br />
Then I realized that was stupid and stopped whining.<br />
Was better insta cast though!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">spent like 8k and gotten Guise of the deciever and Rubicite BP from 2 gold tickets. Got beer googles and stuff too :p<br />
<br />
edit: Maybe I should spend 8k more for Elder Holgresh Beads and the leet Drogmor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Fenril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Spend like 200 or 300k maybe...<br />
<br />
Got one gold ticket and the ticket gave me a neat black drogmor ;). Headed to the bazaar to sell back the high speed purchasable black horse I had :p.<br />
<br />
I just want a Holgresh bead and/or a fungi staff for my necro.<br />
<br />
Other prices I got :<br />
<br />
Snakefinger (maybe 11 or 12 times ==&gt; destroy button)<br />
Green Resistance Stone<br />
Red Resistance Stone<br />
Beer Google<br />
2 or 3 Prayer Life (useful when you fight some mobs with huge AEDD like Quarm)<br />
Some harvest potions<br />
Some gate potion (all on my war ;))<br />
a lot of illu potions<br />
a lot more of useless statt foods, fireworks, gems.<br />
<br />
I just have one fear with the gold tickets : I would be very upset to turn in a ticket and get a &quot;duplicate lore item not allowed&quot; red message back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">A guildie played a joke on us the other night.<br />
<br />
Said in guild chat idly that he was gonna go try his luck at casino, then awhile later.. goes oh dang I only have 150p.. oh well I'll just buy one ticket..<br />
min later <br />
<br />
OMG WOOOT !! (Link of  Golden Trinket here) I'm so lucky.. followed by a lot fo spam, so the link just scrolled off our screens.. faster than we had time to recognize Trinket instead of Ticket.. <br />
had us going for about 5min till someone figured it out :p<br />
<br />
I dont' think anyone in my guild has gotten a ticket yet though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>frroooaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I spent 400k the first day they brought it back with the anniversary. I got beer goggles, snake fingers, white &amp; green resistance stones, prayers of life, food, and ton of expendables. I came back the next day spent 200k and got food, expendables, and a gold ticket which I turned in for a Ton Po Bo Staff. Today (week later) I went back, spent 12k and got a gold ticket which I turned in for a Guise.<br />
<br />
I'll probably still go back occasionally  :D</div></div><hr />

If you turn in one and you get lore text, it will let you turn it in again for another chance to get something else.  We have someone that has every dropable item and you borrow those items then turn in your ticket.  It seriously narrows down what you can get from it.</div></div><hr />

hehe...dont do that...first day the 2nd casino was up, like a moron i gave 4 stacks of 20...ate them all except the 4 that was used for the bet.

&lt;qatw3rk&gt; Instead of the casino, give me all of your platinum and I will kick you in the nuts, give you some ****ty stat food, and a couple of random illusion potions and a gnomish firework and we can call it even!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">From what I have read on other posts, if you have a LORE item when turning in your gold ticket it will allow you to redo the hand in.  Thus, by boring all the droppable LORE items you COULD win from a friend you can avoid getting them at all. (Fungi, Rubicite, I think Ton Po Bo and Elder Beads would be ones you can do that with)</div></div><hr />

Why would you want to get 2 NO DROP guises??  You should get your ticket back if you get the lore message.</div></div><hr />

During my little run though I was getting a lot of coins. At times I was probably up 3-4 stacks of coins before I was down to my original amount spent. A person next to me clicks a golden ticket into /say and we all good wooooot. The roughly 10 minutes later I got one as well. Turned it in and walla DE mask on the kitty cat.<br />

Never been back.<br />
