<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Medican</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi I have a problem with  my friends comp. For some reason my friend seems to be having troubles with graphics and connection. He sees naked characters ( and I mean naked as in there default clothes don't show up, it is disgusting) with the graphics on ( luclin graphics) and in the loading screen , where they have a picture of a troll and a froggy fighting, it takes like 10 to 15 minutes just to finish loading and zoning is slow as well<br />
<br />
Here is a list of his comp and connnection<br />
<br />
He uses a  Dell Dimension L7000cx with a intel celeron processor at 700Mhz that has 255 MB SDRAM ( adjusted originally 128) and is using a cable modem and is using a In tel 82810e Graphics controller. His comp is about two years.<br />
<br />
<br />
So is there any advice you super computer experts could please help me with? Like how I can upgrade it ( my friends GeForce2 for his sony wouldn't fit for some reason)? Could I install a pentium 4 processor into it? or pentium 2? I really don'tknow a lot about computers.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all your help!!!!!!!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>steveo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The weakest link is the graphics card.. That is generally an on-board graphics chipset (on the motherboard, meaning there is no separate graphics card) and it is not very good.<br />
<br />
To install a graphics card you need to know what slots you have available in the machine (ISA, PCI or AGP) and insert an appropriate card. Your geforce2 is either PCI or AGP (you can tell by looking at the metal lines on the plug, 2 rows vertically means AGP, else its probably PCI) <br />
<br />
PCI slots on the machine are usually short white slots compared with short brown slots for AGP. (generally anyway)<br />
<br />
My second system is very near those specs with the exception of my graphics card and it runs fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'll agree that the graphics card could use an upgrade, but a 700Mhz chip is getting a little long in the tooth.  You said:<br />
my friends GeForce2 for his sony wouldn't fit for some reason<br />
It sounds to me as if his computer doesn't have an AGP slot, although I could be wrong.  Many cheap, mass produced computers from 2-3 years ago didn't.  If that's indeed the case, he'd need a new motherboard to accept a new graphics card - and a new motherboard would involve getting a new chip as well.  Basically a new computer :p<br />
<br />
I'm not complaining - I would report the post if I was - but how come something like this stays in general and a post about cute puppies gets moved to the grey?  As I've said before, moderate the board however you like, but please try to be consistent.  Your blatant favortism toward/against certain people, Henora, is very aggravating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The computer has good enough specs to play EQ.  Just upgrade the Graphics Card using a Geforce 2 MX PCI card.  They are really cheap and seem to be very stable with EQ.  Most likely the card you were trying to install was AGP.<br />
<br />
PCI is usually a white slot with a small section and long section like so<br />
<br />
----  ------------------------------<br />
<br />
AGP usually has 3 sections some times 2 but generally longer.  They usually color this brown.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Running a 500 mhz celeron, 256mgs of ram, and intel 810e onboard video.<br />
<br />
Update drivers for the video and don't do luclin graphics, he should be fine.<br />
<br />
The motherboard your using will not have an AGP slot considering what kind of onboard graphics your using, its a combined AGP video and memory controller, its kinda goofy but works well.<br />
<br />
Past that, would not recommend upgrading his processor or a PCI video card, unless you have something that will fit laying around.  Just go out and buy a new computer, it will be cheaper and do a whole lot more than trying little upgrades that aren't going to do a whole lot.</div></div><hr />
