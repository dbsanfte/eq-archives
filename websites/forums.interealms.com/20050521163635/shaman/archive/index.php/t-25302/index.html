<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">1.  Are we required to go through the app and adept spell sequence in order to scribe a higher level spell?  Or, can we scribe an adept 1 after receiving app1 on a ding?  I'm thinking as long as the spell is grey to orange for us, we can scribe it.  However, I don't want to throw down the silver/gold to buy one, and not be able to scribe it.<br />
<br />
2.  Spell vendor locations - since I'm not seeing Ursine Elder app3 on the brokers, and it's not on the scribe vendor in Graystone, anyone know if it's on a particular vendor in Qeynos?  Maybe a list showing where they are available until we're able to get the app3 or adepts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jindaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1 - yes you can go right from Apprentice 1 to Adept 1 scrolls.  You do not need to upgrade in order.<br />
<br />
2 - Apprentice 3 scrolls are not available on vendors - vendors only sell the Apprentice 2 scroll upgrades.  Apprentice 3 scrolls are player/tradeskill made.  Adept 1 are mob dropped, if I recall correctly Adept 2 are not implimented yet but will be quest related and Adept 3 maybe player/tradeskill made.  Then are are Master scrolls which I think are mob dropped also.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jindaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Since I can't edit my own post - I wanted to add you may want to try the &quot;Black Market&quot; brokers.  some spells and components are more readily available out of each starting city.  So if say the Adept 1 version of a spell does not drop often in Qeynos, it may very well drop more frequently in Freeport.  The &quot;Black Market&quot; vendor in Qeynos is located in the harbor area - jump in the canal that runs around that zone and it is a secret entrace that looks like a hole in the wall under the bridge in the water.<br />
<br />
Just beware - the black market vendor charges a 40 percent handling fee.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Even with the 40% markup, I've found that a lot of spells are still cheaper from Freeport than buying them straight with no markup in Qeynos. At least on Crushbone, the prices some players charge for spells has gotten rediculous.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I meant app2, sorry.  However, I was unsure on skipping the progression.  Thanks for the info.  I could have saved a couple silver.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>WaringMcMarrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not sure how accurate this info is since a lot of it came from Beta but I rember reading that APP III, Adept III and Master III where all player made items. I really cant be sure though since there are other tidbits of info from that site that have changed from Beta to Live that have not been updated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Currently:<br />
<br />
App I - Automatically receive this at the appropriate time with a very small number of largely irrelevant exceptions.  (Udor's Spirit of the Hawk for instance)<br />
<br />
App II - Can typically be purchased from a scribe in a city.<br />
<br />
App III - Made by tradesman.<br />
<br />
Adept I - Relatively common drop from mobs.  Note that certain spells drop more often, some rarely.  Adept I books are by and large fairly common however.<br />
<br />
Adept II - Not currently implemented.  Originally they were to be dropped off of very tough (perhaps raid level) mobs.<br />
<br />
Adept III - Made by tradesmen using very rare harvested components.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, all that goes out the window when the upcoming tradeskill patch goes live.<br />
<br />
Basically, the &quot;quality&quot; of the scroll determines its level.  So if I, as a tradesman start to scribe &quot;Weakness&quot; if I get a &quot;Crude&quot; scroll, it's App I, if I get &quot;shaped&quot; scrolls it's App II, if I get a normal scroll it's App III, and if I get a &quot;Pristine&quot; scroll it will now be App IV.  Same will apply to Adepts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. No you aren't required to go through the spell upgrade sequence.  You can go right from Ap1 to Ad3.  Also, make sure to check the broker first for Ap3's before you buy any Ap2 spells.  Many Ap3's sell for just about as much as the Ap2's do.<br />
<br />
2. Ap2's are sold on vendors while all others are either quested, player made, or mob dropped.  Ap3's and Ad3's are player made and can be found on the brokers.  Ad1 and Mst1 spells drop uncommonly from mobs and are also available on the brokers.  Ad2 and Mst2 spells are currently not in game from what I have read.  Mst3 I assume are player made but I don't know if anyone is high enough to make them yet.</div></div><hr />
