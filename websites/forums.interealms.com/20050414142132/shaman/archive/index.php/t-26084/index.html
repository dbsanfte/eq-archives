<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Denorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Congrats!  I can only dream of this.  I only buff out to 7.7 now :(  got a long long way to go</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You obviously need to be on the &quot;take over the world in 60 days&quot; plan, Den.  Where's that guildleader?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Denorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, just got elemental saturday.  And only about half the guild is flagged, so I expect to be backflagging for some time before any really serious raids go to the elementals.  Since we are a &quot;family&quot; guild, we don't really require raiding.  I know backflagging will have to be done so I just assume we're sticking with the 2 nights of OoW for gear and 1 night for progression.  <br />
<br />
I'm happy to be in a family type guild, though I play every day, and raid just about everytime we raid.  As do most of the guild.  But I'm not really looking to be a hardcore raider.  I do wanna see Time, but I know we'll get there when we get there.  Hell, I only started playing EQ less than a year ago (March 16th is Den's birthday)  And to have gotten as far as I have in that time is totally amazing to me.<br />
<br />
I do want to be &quot;uber&quot; but I'm patient.  As I need tons of aa's before I get to that content anyway.<br />
<br />
For now, I'll sit back and watch all the pros and learn from you guys how to be a great shaman :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What're you selling? /eye</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Denorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">LOL. I'm not selling anything.  I'm just an brown-noser :p<br />
<br />
But seriously, coming here and reading what you guys do and looking at your magelos makes me quite humble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>SneakyB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks  :cool: <br />
<br />
I think you have done well Denorea, seeing as you have only been playing a year, I say congrats to you  :D <br />
<br />
I don't want to rememeber how long it took me to get my Sharkspine, it was hell, hehe.<br />
<br />
If it's any consolataion, I don't have TA yet  :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Congrats, Turi.  Enjoy that lead while you've got it.  I've already got some ... plans in mind.   :D<br />
<br />
And, yeah, I don't even want to think about trying to camp a Sharkspine.  Already dumped over 100 hours into that without seeing one.  I'll be content with the fact that I've got my TA and 1.5 and call that good for primary slot toys for awhile.</div></div><hr />
