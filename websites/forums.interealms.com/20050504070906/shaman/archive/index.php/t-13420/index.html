<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, first off you have to understand that I am the kind of masaochistic player who likes &quot;epic&quot; quests, because they provide equipment I can keep for the rest of my character's life, but generally they can be worked on individually or in small groups.  I've already completed my actual epic (Yay clickie DoT), am one fight away from my 8th shawl, and have &quot;quested&quot; for my JBB, drogmor, Solstice Earring, and Crystaline Torque (I plan on staying at 60-61 for at least 20 AAXP points, so Mana Preservation 3 will stay good for awhile for me).  I also just picked up the signet of grisk (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=63051).  The rest of my gear is random junk, as the curious can see in my magelo.  I'm also currently working on my VP key (need Torpor), my chardok faction (Spirit Wracked Cord), and various PoP flags.<br />
<br />
So my questions is: can people recommend items besides the ones I've already mentioned that an average level 60  (I'm only 59 ATM, but let's be generic here) shaman could acquire (possibly with the help of one group), but which are good enough that they won't be replaced for a long long time?   I'm not currently guilded, but I do have random high level friends who I can call on, so when I put my mind to it I can usually get a quality group together.  However, I'm NOT looking for items that require large guild raids.  Basically, I'm looking for really good loot (for anyone who isn't a high-end (VP,ST,VT, Tier 3+) raid shaman) that comes from long time consuming quests, rather than long time consuming raids :-)<br />
<br />
For instance, one item I was thinking about working on was that iksar cudgel, but it seemed like so much work for a barbian like myself, and I didn't know if all that work was worth it just for one more right click buff.  Maybe any of the people who've completed this quest (iksar or barbarian) can give me some idea of the value of it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The two that pop up in my mind are the Coldain shawl quest and the Spirit Wracked Cord quest.  The first requires positive Coldain faction and is all about tradeskills.  The letter requires positive Chardok faction (helloooooo  droga) and gives an item that I think you'll NEVER replace, with your focus.<br />
<br />
I'm not talking about the Coldain Ring quest, because you can't finish it without a strong guild in back of you to kill all the giants in the great war.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hey, Lor... Lana never said you were this big a masochist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rewts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Shield of bane warding was a decent quest.  Shield is AC 25 wis 20 SvM 12.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Shandy:  That's odd, Lana's a big sadist who delights in making me suffer, you'd think she would have mentioned it :-)  Seriously though...<br />
<br />
Finaljustice: As I said, I'm already working on both the shawl and the cord.  The ring however I haven't touched.  I thought I heard that you can solo through most of the quest, is this true?  If so, I can probably put together a ring war raid for the very end, if the item is worth it.  However, there are so many different quality magic rings (Chardok, Dain, POP JC ones, etc.) out there these days, I'm afraid I'll invest a huge amount of time in to doing the 10th ring, and by the time I finish it something better will have come along.  Maybe shaman who've had their 10th ring for years can help me; who still uses their's, and who finds their's rots in a backpack somewhere? <br />
<br />
Everyone who mentioned PoM:  This really interests me.  I've never even looked at how to get to PoM on a map (I know it's in ToV somewhere) because it was always too high level for me, but the gear there is godly!  If I remember correctly though, all I need to get in to PoM is to &quot;quest&quot; for a few shiny brass idols (Divne Aura right clickies), then run through hallways filled with dragons with my newfound DA on.  Is this right?  And once I get there, is there somewhere safe near zone-in where I can bind myself?  If so, I figure I can get out to go grouping/bazaaring with my spiritstone, and just gate back whenever I want to solo.  Will this work, or do people have any other suggestions as to how I could &quot;get in&quot; on PoM?<br />
<br />
Grippa:  That Tae Ew stuff looks nice too, just not as good as the PoM stuff.  If I abandon the PoM plan, I'll probably go after the Tae Ew stuff, but otherwise I'll just pass Tae Ew over in favor of the superior PoM armor.<br />
<br />
And last but not least:<br />
Rewts: Shield of Bane Warding is ok, but I already have:<br />
<br />
Skull Marked Shield<br />
MAGIC ITEM  LORE ITEM  <br />
Slot: SECONDARY  <br />
AC: 22<br />
WIS: +7  HP: +50  MANA: +50<br />
<br />
So 2 ac and 13 wis for 50 hp and 50 mana isn't much of an upgrade.  And neither shield is &quot;end-game&quot; enough for me, since they both can be replaced by better items such as the Tae Ew Shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Oops, I forgot that you said you weren't in a big guild.  Without their help, you'll never get to PoM.  It's a teeny tiny castle located in the farthest end of NToV.  You have MAJOR amounts of yard trash and flurries to go through to get there for the first time.  You MUST get a lot of info on PoM before you ever play there, as things like hailing will get you killed.  <br />
<br />
The ring war is a major event.  We just did one the other day, and it's a fun three hours for a large guild.  It locks all zoning out of GD, so it's not real popular with the midbees EXPing there.  Also, if you screw it up, you'll kill every NCP in Thurd and Icewell for 6 hours.  But if you can get the final ring, it'll be better than anything you're likely to get or buy for a long while (or at least better than the second ring that would push it out of your inventory).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yah collect the items in CT for making the Tae Ew armor.  Or collect the other stuff from the planes for it.  Also consider Circlet of the Falinkan quest, easy enuf for one group to do and wont take long. Yields a good hp crown with good stats/resists and Affliction Haste III.  Velious quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yeah, Falinkan's good.  Your friends should be able to do that with one hand tied behind their backs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, I have to admit I was disheartened when I read finaljustice's post, and pleased when I read Ceno's, but nevertheless its entirely unnecessary to insult a fellow shaman for giving his opinion, however correct or incorrect it may be.  This is how flame wars start, and then we'll be no better than Dr00ds.  That being said ...<br />
<br />
&quot;you wont make your first run, just have a necro there to summon yourself, and bind outside. getting up there is half the fun&quot;<br />
<br />
Thank you Ceno, this is exactly the kind of thing that I'm looking for.  I'll have to go kill random greens in high hold (so much nostalgia going back there, *sniffle*) to collect idols, I'll have to read up and learn everything I can about PoM , and I'll have to waste a whole lot of time killing myself over and over again, first in ToV then in PoM.  And then once I've done all that, and can run to PoM in my sleep, I'll have to camp (to paraphrase finaljustice) &quot;a year per peice.&quot;  But even if all I ever get for that trouble is a single pair of Shamanistic Shenannigan Boots, I think it will be worth it:<br />
<br />
AC: 45<br />
STR: +5  STA: +10  AGI: +10  HP: +50  <br />
MANA: +10  SV DISEASE: +5  SV COLD: +5  <br />
10 Charges Scale of Wolf<br />
<br />
Tae Ew stuff sounds like something I should maybe work on before, or perhaps during (going to need breaks from all those highhold expeditions) my PoM time.  Ultimately, I'll probably wind up wearing some sort of patchwork combination of Tae Ew, PoM stuff, and whatever other random (tradeskill made? velious dwarf armor?) armor I can find.<br />
<br />
Finally, the Circlet of Falinkan sounds pretty cool, and Shandy was right on the nose in saying &quot;Your friends should be able to do that with one hand tied behind their backs&quot; since a mutual friend of ours (Doc) offered to help me with it once awhile ago.  Thanks all for reminding me about this one.<br />
<br />
And thanks as always for all the useful suggestions.  This board is always my first place to go for useful EverQuest info.  Y'all rock :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">if you ever make it to PoM you'll want to bind there, I recommend a spiritstone to port out, and I've seen it done with +CoV faction and only one DA item... though I actually think that was a monk who FD'd a few times<br />
<br />
If there are still guilds that do NTOV on your server you can most likely ask them to tag along until they get to PoM as well, most guilds are nice enough to let you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">&quot;If there are still guilds that do NTOV on your server you can most likely ask them to tag along until they get to PoM as well, most guilds are nice enough to let you&quot;<br />
<br />
This was supposed to be a thread about epicly difficult quests!  I was all prepared to for such a quest, and then you had to go and suggest this wonderfully simple and easy solution to getting in to PoM.  Damn you and thank you!  ;)<br />
<br />
While I'm at it, I might as well mention this link I found in case anyone else out there is also interested in learning more about PoM:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">You totally want to look into the Circlet of Falinkan quest.<br />
I'm not sure how many people it takes to kill the DN dragon (probably like 2 groups) but you may want to look into the Sanctum Guardian's Earring quest as well.<br />
A single really solid group can obtain the key to the Emperor's room in Ssra Temple.  This is the key:  Ring of the Shissar (http://www.magelo.com/components/eq_item_shot.jsp?num=19719)<br />
You could also obtain the 9th coldain ring with a single group I think.<br />
If you are working on tradeskills a LOT, look into Aid Grimal's (spelling?) earring quest in PoK.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, I know exactly what I'm talking about.  What are YOU talking about?  Selos inside ToV (it's an interior zone, nice trick).  Item DA might be a player, but targetted DA isn't, as the refresh time is too high. <br />
<br />
Following a friendly guild towards PoM is a real good idea, as the patrolling flurries are pretty tough.  But don't take my word on it, ask others that you respect and try the experience.  This isn't trivial, but it can be very rewarding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Xeras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I think the selos that they were referring to is the one with 5 minute duration, Selo's accelerating chorus or some such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">5 mins isn't tenough to get you in position in NToV, let alone to the portals of PoM.  30 minute SoW would work much better, but running isn't going to get you through.<br />
<br />
SOE put guards in the area of PoM, just so you couldn't CoH or reverse CoH to the portal.  Tricks just get your hopes up, without much hope of success.  A good strategy is needed here.  Following a guild into NToV is the safest. surest way of getting to PoM.<br />
<br />
And again, PoM can be a tricky,empty zone, and the only Rezz you're likely to get is the one you bring with you.  Be prepared.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Ok, I have to admit I was disheartened when I read finaljustice's post, and pleased when I read Ceno's, but nevertheless its entirely unnecessary to insult a fellow shaman for giving his opinion, however correct or incorrect it may be.

im not trying to start a flame thread, im just making sure soild advice is being given.  in this case i see some horribly misguided advice and want to make sure no one takes it<br />
<br />
with that being said, finaljustice is one of the most helpful people on this board. always adding his 2 cents<br />
<br />
xeras is on the right track, rest of the pieces should be easy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I stick by my guns here.  I think that you won't make it to PoM unless you have:<br />
<br />
1.  a guild in front of you <br />
-or-<br />
2.  a good group of 10 - 14 people (gotta be able to handle 2-4 adds), well equipped.  You need a pulling monk with good NToV experience, a CoH mage with positive CoV faction, a well-equipped tank and at LEAST 2 good clerics, with dr00d help.<br />
<br />
If you can handle the flurries on the way to PoM, you might think of farming them, they srop some very nice, class-specific shields.<br />
<br />
Oh, and if Aary's up, yer screwed, you need 18-24 well-experienced (experienced in him, specifically) people to kill him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Simple to get to PoM.  You're thinking about it all wrong.  Firstly, get a hold of a Staff of Forbidden Rites with at least one charge on it.  Then get yourself a lvl 65 rogue friend with Shroud of Stealth AA skill.  Kill yourself inside ToV and have the rogue drag you to PoM entrance . . . there's a very small place there u can have him rez u where you won't get eaten, but DONT move around! <br />
<br />
Staff can be gotten one of a few ways:<br />
1) Buy a charge off someone who has one and is a friend/acquaintance.<br />
2) Buy one outright (make sure has charges)<br />
3) Put together a Vox raid (you as raid leader, you don't have to actually participate) and assign the staff to you if it drops with all other loots normal rules.  <br />
<br />
OR, there's yet another way to do it.  For this you need a few friends among which is a rogue with SOS.  Go to DN and go down in the tunnels and kill rats and kill oozes especially.  The oozes sometimes drop some gunk with one charge of a minor form of Rez, like 0% revive or something like that.  Then, have the rogue loot that item and take your friends to ToV, have them drag a CoH mage and rez him in there using the goo, and then CoH u all in very carefully.  <br />
<br />
Should be fun to do, and can be done with one group in one day without a problem, provided you have the mage and the 65 SoS rogue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Okay, regardless of whether you can get to PoM or not ... you don't want to do the PoM quests.  You're a masochist, sure, but you said you actually wanted gear, and the PoM stuff isn't happening before you die of old age (as an aside - why do people try to con folks into trying for PoM gear ... that's just cruel, people).<br />
<br />
I recommend:<br />
<br />
- Blessed Coldain Prayer Shawl.  Masochism is the prerequisite for tradeskill based quests.  1 reasonably high level group, or 2 groups to be safe, can handle the 8th shawl &quot;war&quot; with no problem.  You'll pretty certainly never see an upgrade.<br />
- Circlet of the Falinkan.  Proceed only if you are friends with Claws of Veeshan (ally).  Easily 1-groupable.  While not the powerhouse item that it used to be, you won't see a replacement for this soon.<br />
- Cloak of the Wise.  Its a lot of farming (and some luck) in the various Tier 1 PoP zones to get all the pages, but its a nice cloak.  Technically, the Heirophant's Cloak is a lot better ... but if you've got more time than money, this one might be for you.  Plus - earn great XP while you &quot;quest&quot;.<br />
- Regal Band of Bathezid/Spirit Wracked Cords.  Faction *really* sucks, and so does trying to snag the Angry Goblin, much less that accursed Urn.  That said, you'll likely never replace either.  I consider the RBoB to be better than Valor rings.  SWC is simply not upgradeable until Vex Thal or equivelent Planar.<br />
- Ring of Dain Frostreaver IV.  While there are 2 other rings on this list (Shissar, Bathezid), this is worth looking at in the long term.  Ring 9 is not worth wearing if you have the other 2, but its an indoor-usable insta-clicky item, and those ARE handy.  Also, if you manage to get Ring 9, on many servers it is possible to host/lead open ringwars, especially if you have connections with some other guild that's into that sort of thing.  Many people find ringwars fun, and they often draw help fast.  Should you succeed, Ring 10 is definately an amazing item, and one you will never, ever replace.<br />
- Ring of the Shissar.  Okay, so its the Ssra Emperor key, and the mobs for the Insignias suck.  Its still 1-2 groupable, if you're on your game, and along with the Regal Band, will make a pair of rings that will likely outstrip anything you could get conventionally.  Plus, you get to tell people that you have the key to Emperor Ssra. =P<br />
- Sanctum Guardian's Earring.  This is the Spirit of Garzicor quest.  Proceed only if you are friends with Claws of Veeshan (ally) and into smithing (as in, near 200).  The final dragon fight might be too tough for your friends - its a lot like Zlandicar, but its something to consider.<br />
- Skyiron Cudgel of the Ancients.  Faction sucks, and parts of this quest (read: Kurn's) sap the will to live.  Forget about the clicky effect and check the stats, though - you'll be hard pressed to beat it without raid-mob drops, and you can impress your friends with it - these suckers are still rare.<br />
<br />
Non-quested:<br />
<br />
- Barbed Dragonscale Boots.  Run around 6k on my server, your prices may vary.  Best HP boots you are likely to see unless you get a chance for Vindi's boots or something unusual falls in your lap.  Should you prefer mana and mana-regen to hp, then consider camping the Boots of Flowing Slime, but expect to have you and your group of friends lose the next couple weeks of their life in there.<br />
- Tae Ew Equipment.  The Tae Ew BP, Legs, and Shield will require some hunting in CT and the services of a GM smith.  They are likely to be worth the time and trouble.<br />
<br />
Don't do:<br />
<br />
- Shield of Bane Warding.  Tae Ew is better.<br />
- Sigil Earring of Veracity.  You don't want to get earring 3 - those reports are the devil.  Earring 4 requires some funny tactics that you may not be able to pull off, and earring 5 needs Seru's head, which is totally unaccessible.  If you've got the force to do earring 3/4, you've got the force to do Sanctum Guardian anyway (assuming you can deal with the faction and the smithing), and its frankly more worth the trouble than camping reports.  I've been there.  Trust me.</div></div><hr />

Selos inside ToV (it's an interior zone, nice trick). Item DA might be a player, but targetted DA isn't, as the refresh time is too high. <br />
Uh.  You don't know at all what you are talking about, to tell the truth.<br />
You can get a bard to sing selo's on you out in Western Wastes.<br />
Selos will last for 5 minutes.<br />
5 minutes is EASILY a long enough time to last to run to PoM.<br />
You zone in to ToV after getting Selos.<br />
Since you should be on dragon faction, you can run up to the entrance door to NToV.<br />
If you move quickly, and with a bit of luck, you can open the door and run in to the right side and you won't aggro any of the Ancient Wyverns off to the north west of the door.<br />
There's a bunch of baby Wyveryns where you will be standing now, but they are on Dragon faction, and won't touch you.<br />
Run straight north up the stairs, through the door, and follow the path up the stairs until you get to 2 kos drakes.<br />
If you've done the run correctly, you won't have any mobs aggro on you yet.<br />
Before you as you face North are 2 drakes that are kos, and the spawn location of Aaryonar.<br />
You run up past the 2 drakes which will aggro on you, drop off the small drop off into Aary's little pit area, and run to the right.<br />
There will be many many kos mobs here, so you pop your DA from the Shiny Brass Idol at this point.<br />
Keep running counter clockwise around the huge pit to your left, and run as fast as you can towards the North.<br />
Eventually the path will veer away from the pit, and continue North into the rock.<br />
Keep going, and you'll get to a 4 way intersection.<br />
Hang a right (you'll be coming from the East at this point) and go North.<br />
In the North West corner of the hallway, at the L part of the hallway, there's a little cubbyhole in the wall with a teeny tiny castle that you can barely see anymore sticking out of the ground.<br />
Click on the castle, and you'll teleport into PoM.<br />
One warning though, is you will most likely need a 2nd charge of DA before you get to PoM.<br />
A SBI won't be enough, so that's what the earring is for.<br />
<br />
Then again maybe you do know what you are talking about, and I'm just talking out of my ass....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">In regards to PoM, what about buying the cards and what-not in the bazaar?  On Quellious at least, I see cards for sale all the time, though I'm not sure if these are the right ones or not...  My plan on getting in is to kill WW dragons (I do that anyway) and keep an eye out for raids heading in.. Actually found one one night at like 2am but they said they weren't headed that far in that late at night :(<br />
<br />
I wouldn't mind questing for weeks - I have my shawl after all ;)  What I do mind is having to show up at such &amp; such time on such &amp; such day for guild_raid_05.. this is a game, not work.  I find it amazing that 99% of people who play LOVE raiding and HATE tradeskilling and questing... But then the game is made to cater to that preference so I must be the only one &gt;_&lt;  Questing and tradeskilling are going the way of the Book.. Those evil paper things that you won't ever have to touch after you get out of school heh.. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Buying cards in the bazaar does work, but only if you want to get the flowers of functionality.<br />
Also, you need the no drop quested container from POM to be able to do the combines.<br />
He'll still have to get to POM in the first place.</div></div><hr />
