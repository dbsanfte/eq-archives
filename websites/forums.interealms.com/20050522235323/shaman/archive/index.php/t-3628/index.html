<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hahaha was wondering when someone would get bored of clearing VT, take a break, and pay a visit to this encounter again :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Good for you Jenny.<br />
<br />
&quot;still in game&quot; - are you implying that Vulak was never taken out? Or is the correct term that Vulak is &quot;back in the game&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">He means someone actually could stomach being in tov long enough to do the whole script.  Last time we tried fought 2 hours strait and the fooking thing reset itself.  bah.  <br />
<br />
Grats on lots of patience!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">nice, grats :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Skinnart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hey jen does that mean you still have a shot at getting that shield before Arele? /ducks and takes cover.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Jenamdar,<br />
<br />
First grats on your kill. Second from what I've heard the ring has been &quot;Working&quot; for quite a while in that a GM could go in and /kill everything and it worked but things kinda went fubar when players actually tried bringing raid forces to do it and had that many people running around. How many people did you have to do it and have you done it more than once? O and what did he drop and was it worth the time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Heh, Luclin made the Vulak shield less of a hot item, it's still hoss, but with capped AC, 75 AC is no longer such a big deal, and I took a Shield of Holy Vigor instead when I got the chance...  90 HP + Dragon Haste is better for a Shaman than 100 HP :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Skinnart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I realize this. It was ment as an inside joke between the Jen and I, thanks for the advice though ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hey, Jen, would it be possible for a little spoiler info?  How long did it take, were there tons of spawns, or minibosses, that kind of thing?  Not a complete walk through, but I'm curious to see your assessment of difficulty.  :)<br />

<br />
The problem with these scripted encounters is that they don't dynamically change their difficulty.  So something that is boring or slow for Afterlife could be considered to be at ludicrious speed for others.<br />
<br />
Basically the only real spoiler to the encounter is .... it is doable.  <br />
<br />
Will it be too easy for some?  Certainly. <br />
<br />
Too hard for others?  Maybe.  <br />
<br />
Will everyone be doing it at some point in time?  I believe so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Gugek, <br />
<br />
I don't agree that the &quot;only real spoiler to the encounter is ... it is doable.&quot; I think there's a ton of info that can be shared, if you felt that you wanted to:<br />
<br />
1. Number of mobs spawned per wave and timing between wave. HP and Max hit (with and without defensive) for mobs.<br />
<br />
2. Number of people you attempted it with, minimum number you'd take for next run at it, number of deaths experienced, typical cause of death.<br />
<br />
3. boss mob spoilers -- hp, special attacks (flurry? rampage?) debuff info (slowable? any magic immunities?) and so on.<br />
<br />
It's obvious that you don't want to share that info, and that's your prerogative. I'm not saying you suck for that (even though others might). I'm simply saying you're being disingenuous when you say that there's no real spoiler info to give.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">A post on AL boards certainly wont get you any spoilers I am quite sure of that :)<br />
<br />
I think what would be interesting to hear is how many of the items Vulak drops would still be of use to AL. Or has Vulak joined the rank of dragons you have to kill for spells?</div></div><hr />

<br />
All the other information you suggest that I offer is of secondary importance,  to the fact that the encounter is working and can be finished.  That is what I mean by real spoiler.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to be disingenuous.  Honestly, I wasn't keeping track of composition of the waves or the timing, I just slow and buff. So in terms of specifics I have nothing to offer, just a general feeling and my experience with the encounter. <br />
<br />
Some of the drakes are meaner then other ones, some of the drakes are smaller then the other ones, some of them heal, some of them flurry.  <br />
<br />
Most competant guilds will have the encounter figured out after the first series of waves, it is that straight forward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Soupy I am gonna give you my &quot;canned&quot; answer. --&gt; try and find out yourself :p<br />
<br />
The info is &quot;experience&quot; if you have hunted in NTOV before.<br />
<br />
Sure they could come out and tell you how long per wave etc but man that would just take the fun out of it.<br />
<br />
Haven't you seen the pic with the &quot;broken&quot; ring where all those drakes etc were stacked on top of Vulak? That should give you an indication right there.<br />
<br />
Have you ever fought in NTOV? Fought those flury drakes? They hit damn hard, and flury like every round till they are debuffed. 1 Flury drake can wipe out a raid easy if people are not paying attention.<br />
<br />
Personnaly I wouldn't want a spoiler for this ring, would take to much fun out of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">glad to know it is actually possible to do it, lol<br />
<br />
how long did it take you guys to do the ring anyway :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It may not net you any spoilers, but it's fun to watch Gospadin fly off the handle for no reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Aurron Shadowstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">You guys may want to check out www.invictusmaneo.org<br />
 also. They were actually the first ones to spawn Vulak in the event a couple of days ago and killed Vulak within a couple of hours of Afterlife.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Well thanks to AL for showing the guilds that this encounter is possible.  The ancient spell source might be enough of a lure to get people to try the ring now that it's no longer broken.  I think the reason nobody has tried it for a long time is that we all assumed it was broken as intended.  VI has such a horrible history of making either broken or impossible rings that most people just say forget it, not worth it, and go kill something that is killable and actually drops loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Shammy to tank!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>JenamdarAL</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The ring took 2 hours and 55 mins to run from start to finish. <br />
Beyond that if you want to know more I suggest giving it a try yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Please remove those fricking spells. i dont want to go back to toV anymore. My guild managed to stay away for 7 months, there was no reason for us to ever go back.<br />
<br />
Like that line from GodfatherIII, &quot;just when i get out, they PULL ME BACK IN&quot;<br />
<br />
:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">hehe eqphreak, I read that on their page also and came here to post it only to see you had gotten to it first.  Shammy powah!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Gratz AL!  Maybe this will be the pull that will bring the guild I'm trying to join back to NToV alot...I really really really want onyx chain legs and vams (need more AC, and going for the all black look)!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Snacko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Finishing the ring is not a guaranteed vulak pop.  The ring itself has been completed many times, and vulak has only popped 2 of those times.<br />
<br />
As of right now it's a crap shoot on whether or not you'll even see the dragon for the 3 hour long war.<br />
<br />
Until he becomes a guaranteed pop, I don't foresee many people even bothering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">maybe they didn't complete it the right way. i don't know what's right or wrong, but maybe you have to kill certain mobs, let certain mobs live, or whatever.<br />
<br />
btw vulak shield &gt; shield of holy vigor, don't kid yourself :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">We've tried Vulakk ring a few times about 2 months ago. Was really boring and kinda flaky. One time the mob push agroed the mobs out in the hall beyond the 3 guys why block the exit from Vulaks chamber. Really sucked and can get busy if you are a little low on people. We are going to try again real soon since ancient ageo is a damn nice spell to have. <br />
On some fo the info i would recommend one thing. Bring 50+ people cause if something goes wrong having a few extra peeps can really make the difference for off tanking and rampage tanking.<br />
<br />
On a side note Shield of ssrae off HP &gt; Vulak<br />
stats dont mean dick and FT is greater than all.</div></div><hr />
