<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bearage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was scouting some of the other class forums and I found this thread on the Mages forum:<br />
<br />
http://eq1.eqsummoners.com/viewtopic.php?t=20675<br />
<br />
The lines I was interested in was:<br />
<br />
'The bug is actually with all pet proc buffs, but the only ones we really feel need changing are the panther line of spells. So we'll be fixing the problem with them procing more and then upping the specific pet spells to compensate and retain the same rate as before. -Rytan'<br />
<br />
I can't find this post on the EQ dev site - maybe someone else can link it - so that  I can read  exactly what he has said.<br />
<br />
But it sounds to me (if it's true) that the Panther spell is about to be nerfed (prolly lep too) so that it procs more like twice a minute as opposed to 15 times a minute or whatever it is doing at the moment.<br />
<br />
Now, I know Panther and Lep were uber.  However..  <br />
Given the Enchanters and Beastlords increased slow power - inline with us and the Paladin heal upgrades etc.  I'd say after this nerf we are:<br />
'Shafted'.  Shaman are back to being a 'no need' class.<br />

Good stuff - but that was more 'in the air' - this seems more definite.<br />
<br />
Here is also the beastlords rejoicing post:<br />
http://www.beastlords.org/forums/index.php/topic,5131.0.html<br />
<br />
<br />
The thing that gets me about the the beastlods &amp; the mages all bitching is that:<br />
Shaman didn't make the DPS - they allowed others - the mages and the beastlords to make it.<br />
<br />
The wizards were bitching because they saw it as the Shaman as the new king of dps.  Where in fact the shaman was the 'buffer' again allowing people do make more dps (sure enough it did not include nukers).<br />
<br />
Once this nerf goes in - making the proc 1-4 times a minute (probably 2 though) it will make this spell simply not worth it to cast.  <br />
<br />
The real funny thing about all this is that the Shaman were really happy allowing others to make massive DPS.  I wonder if a Wziard or a Mage got a buff to make others do massive dps if they would be happy?<br />

You just make stuff up as you see fit, or do you see some numbers posted by SOE on the &quot;nerf&quot;?<br />
<br />
What do you think it procs now on pets? How about on PCs?<br />

Woha Blazz!  Fanboi attack?   You know Blazz just because you realy really don't want it to happen and as much as you kid yourself and pretend that it wont...<br />

<br />
So you may as well face the enemy/problem and confront it - rather that try to make yourself believe that that damn pet is gonna still proc 50 times a minute lol P<br />
<br />
<br />
Blazz, seriously - I saw on EQ dev site somewhere that they expected all procs to be no more than around 2 a minute - and that is the basis for this and any other spell.  <br />
<br />
Now, what I understand is that they still intend mage pets to have high proc rates and therefore don't want to nerf that in making the 'generic' code change that will effect all pets.  Therefore, they are going to make the 'fix' (nerf) to all pet procs THEN my friend, increase specific proc spells - such as - mage pets or any other 'intended' high end proc.  <br />
<br />
Now, Blazz, half of what I just said is my interpretation of their intended change and half is what I have read from Sony as to what they think should happen.<br />
<br />
My point is that IF it procs even 4 times a minute it is barely worth casting for the mana and duration...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Theres absolutely no reason to beleive that panther will proc 2 times a minute on pets after the change. Several parses here have shown most melee proc ~ 10 times per minute and pets several times that. The only thing verant has said is that pets are procing much more than intended so after the change i'd expect them to proc at around the same rate as pc's or ~10 times a minute.<br />
<br />
The base for procs might be 2 or 3 times a minute but panther as a spell has a 4 times modifer that makes it proc more just like cleric hammers are set to proc more.<br />
<br />
Yes panther is fun but ~250 dps on pets just from procs really is too much.</div></div><hr />

Shaman - amazing.  The only class that wants to nerf itself.<br />
<br />
Tar, what would you say is an acceptable proc rate for a spell which cost that amount of mana for a duration that small?  I'd love to know what we consider 'worth it'.  Oh and also think about what upgrades the classes just got in comparison to what we are about to loose when you reply.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shamylamy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Wizards whining about this is retarded. I swear I remember giving wizard pets panther. Pretty sure they proc'd it too. I mean the sword pets btw, not the familliars.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Retron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">So far (on Test), Leopard has kept its 400% proc rate modifier so there should be no changes on players. The beastlord proc buffs, magician epic clicky buffs etc have all gained a 150% modifier.<br />
<br />
BST buffed warders proc 6 or 7 times a minute and knowing that post nerf they'll still be doing the same, suggests the base for somewhat buffed pets is being changed to 100*(6.5/150) = 4.3 procs a minute.<br />
<br />
Therefore if things stay as they currently are on Test, leopard/panther will go off 4.3*4 times a minute, or 17 times a minute. That's still an order of magnitude above player procs but a good chunk below the 30 or so you'll currently get from a fully buffed pet.<br />
<br />
For Leopard, 10 procs a minute is ~67 DPS, currently at 30 procs a minute it's ~200 DPS. If my calculations are right, post nerf it'll be ~114 DPS, probably a little higher as we have better DEX buffs.<br />
<br />
114 DPS for 540 mana every 90 seconds is still pretty good going.</div></div><hr />

This spell is pretty reasonable on pcs. Personally I can keep this up on 4 or 5 people pretty easily for an extended period of time. If thats all pets thats over 1k dps of essentially unresistable damage at this point and that really is broken. Thats out dpsing even high end rogues and wizzys with no worry about aggro either.<br />
<br />
If I pop spiritual channeling I can get it up and going on virtually an entire raid. 1.5 cast time + 2 second recast time + some time to target so we'll call it 5 seconds per person. 20 per minute or easily enough time to get it up most if not all the melee and pets in a reasonable size raid. Even at 100 dps a person on melees that would be several k dps while it's running. Make that pets and it's just rediculously wrong.</div></div><hr />

We are not doing the damage we are buffing players and pets to do the damage. I find it funny that players are upset about this. We are not out DPSing them we are simply buffing them to do more damage, like any number of spells. I will agree it is good DPS and I for one would like to see it stay that way.</div></div><hr />

IT WILL<br />
What &quot;will&quot;? That they will reduce the proc rate on a shaman pet from 28 per minute (per Griz's 10 minute parse Here (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=26069) to TWO per minute? Are you high? Seriously, listen to yourself. You are making up numbers to incite people, and you have absolutely ZERO facts, or even hints, to back them up.<br />
So you may as well face the enemy/problem and confront it - rather that try to make yourself believe that that damn pet is gonna still proc 50 times a minute lol P<br />
Do you just happen to use hyperbole in EVERY statement you make, or just here when your trying to &quot;prove&quot; a point. I didnt say 50. I said 30-40. Its 28 on OUR pet, significanly more on BL pets, and I would like to see a Mage/Necro pet parse, cause I think its probably slightly higher than our pet. <br />
<br />
And in case you havent been paying attention, I am of the school of thought that the spell is too powerful. I think a proc rate of 10 on PCs and 20 on ALL pets is relatively balanced, and still VERY powerful. If they reduce the pet rate below 20, or the PC rate below 10 I will be right there bitching up a storm with the others (those are per-minute, BTW).<br />
<br />
SOE is not the enemy man. People like you are. People with closed minds who twist and distort things to fit whatever &quot;point&quot; they are trying to prove. Fanboi, no, happy with the additional power the shaman class has gained since OoW, yes. <br />
Blazz, seriously - I saw on EQ dev site somewhere that they expected all procs to be no more than around 2 a minute - and that is the basis for this and any other spell.  <br />
Here we go again. Link please. Quotes please. currently NO pets proc at 2 per minute, NONE of their procs. Give em a proccing weapon, test it yourself. There is no way they will reduce ANY procs on ANY pets this far. I think you might have &quot;per minute&quot; and &quot;per tic&quot; mixed up. Just so you know, 2 procs/tic = 20 procs per minute, the number I have already stated as acceptable IMHO.<br />
Now, what I understand is that they still intend mage pets to have high proc rates and therefore don't want to nerf that in making the 'generic' code change that will effect all pets.  Therefore, they are going to make the 'fix' (nerf) to all pet procs THEN my friend, increase specific proc spells - such as - mage pets or any other 'intended' high end proc.  <br />
<br />
Now, Blazz, half of what I just said is my interpretation of their intended change and half is what I have read from Sony as to what they think should happen.<br />
Maybe you should go back and study the numbers again. First off, BL pets have an innate higher proc rate than all other pets. I suspect that Mage pets are next, then Necro, then ours. That is why I think the current proc &quot;number&quot; is 30-40 average on Mage-Necro-BL pets. <br />
<br />
I think you have the overall plan sort of correct, but your numbers are completely out of whack. Again, are you confusing &quot;Per Minute&quot; with Per Tic&quot;?<br />
My point is that IF it procs even 4 times a minute it is barely worth casting for the mana and duration...<br />
If it only procced 4 times per minute, it would be totally worthless and I would never mem the spell again, probably not even soloing. Think about it man, you are talking about a 650 mana spell that would add 35 dps. Even you have to admit your numbers are TOTALLY wrong.</div></div><hr />

Thanks, I hadnt read that post too closely, since I was rather annoyed about bear's response.<br />
<br />
So BL pets have a higher proc rate innately, and mage, necro and shaman pets are all at the same rate, with any variances depentant wholey on stats and not anything else? Am I inturpreting that correctly?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gumurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">it sounds to me like they just plan on changing pets as well..  I think the DPS that comes from pets alone is insane, i was guessing that it would be changed sooner or later, as soon as i got back into everquest and was able to experiece this new line of spells.  The proc rate of the spell on PC's is fine, i don't think it will be changed, but as far as the pet's go... I was guessing from the beginning that something would eventually be done about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">just wondering what kind of proc rate would make panther worth casting on pets for you guys...i am talking min proc rate.<br />
<br />
i like panther how it procs on pets currently, but i don't think it is totally balanced...  i wont complain when sony fixes it as long as pet panther DPS doesn't drop down below pc panther dps.  it is still as about as efficient as our best dot, and panther lasts double the duration of curse dots.<br />
<br />
curse of Sisslak 577/6=92.16 dps for 5 ticks (30 seconds) at 609 mana unfocused<br />
panther is ~100 dps on PCs for 1 minute (60 seconds) at 650 mana unfocused<br />
<br />
sisslak = 6.6 dps per mana<br />
panther = 6.5 dps per mana<br />
<br />
if they nerf pet panther procs down to PC proc rates i'll still be casting it instead of dots during group/raid encounters.<br />
<br />
<br />
let's look at panther adding 100 dps for pets/players.<br />
sample group- shaman+pet, pally, cleric, enchanter + pet, rogue, mage+pet<br />
we are looking at a low guess of about 400-450dps we add from panther alone (i say low guess because: who knows who AFKs, forgets to pet attack, pally will be casting a lot and that lowers panther dps, pally imbue proc being above panther in the buff bar may lower dps, ect.)<br />
<br />
the low end 400dps from panther where it may stand come patch compaired to the 650-750ish dps it adds now.  a huge differance, but at 100dps a pet, it is still worth casting.  doing 400dps with dots nukes eats mana as you have to cast new dots/nukes every mob.  it is huge ass agro too.  panther is a mana hog, but the duration is double our curse dot durations and we do not have to cast it every mob.  the only drawback on panther is that we put our DPS in the hands of potentially afk or slow PCs...<br />
<br />
this is how i see things anyway.<br />
<br />
*i would like to see our pet doing a bit more than 100dps from panther, it is damn nice to finally be able to farm green mobs as fast as other classes! =p</div></div><hr />

We are most definitely are doing the damage. This is not a buff. It is a damage spell. The duration and effect mean it might as well just be an unresistable dot we can cast on the mob as many times as we want. Our disease dots last longer than this as do several other peoples dots. Just because we aren't getting flashy numbers showing up in our window doesn't mean we aren't responsible for that damage. If we weren't there casting panther that damage wouldn't be happening.<br />
<br />
I know you'll try and bring up something like haste or attack buffs but it's not the same thing. Haste and attack buffs have a much longer duration and are avaible from multiple different sources and just enhance peoples normal abilities. Making them hit for more, hit faster etc. They don't add an entire new ability, aka a 550 point proc. I'd still say in a sense the dps from a haste is dps from the person that cast the haste but it's not easy to directly quantify that and is pretty much a given on a raid.</div></div><hr />

Haste and attack buffs have a much longer duration and are avaible from multiple different sources and just enhance peoples normal abilities. Making them hit for more, hit faster etc. They don't add an entire new ability, aka a 550 point proc. I'd still say in a sense the dps from a haste is dps from the person that cast the haste but it's not easy to directly quantify that and is pretty much a given on a raid.<br />
<br />
If you believe that you are doing the damage more power to you but if the other players and their  pets were not there you could not do near as much DPS. It is not a damage spell its a buff. <br />
<br />
My question to you is why other then the argo would you cast panther. I hate people begging me for buffs and this one is the worst. The one minute duration sucks. In my opinion if the DPS does not stay where it is I will just switch back to dots. Here is hoping SOE does not screw this up to bad.</div></div><hr />

casting/recast time, not being at fault for breaking mez.<br />
<br />
honestly, this discussion has really gone down the drain, I dropped my posting in the other threads because it just became redundant. its getting changed, nothing you can do but bend over and take it like a man.<br />
<br />
as far as who's DPS this is. you are both wrong. its shared DPS. without the shaman or the other character to cast on, the spell isn't really being used efficiently.</div></div><hr />

I agree. Spell doesnt do a thing on the AFK guy who doesnt hit attack or /pet attack. Spell is also not really stackable, i.e. 2 shaman cant both Panter 1 guy and double up the procs, while 2 shaman can both use the same DOT on a mob, or 2 wizards can both use the same nuke on a mob. <br />
<br />
I dont mind this feature. I think its a brilliant idea by SOE, personally. Adds damage in a combination function of players/pets/spells. SOE always looks for better ways for groups to integrate, and this is a fantastic one.</div></div><hr />

Obviously your using someone to actually deal the damage but I can't think of a single situation where I didn't have several different options on who to cast this on. I'd be rather surprised if you had a group with less than 3 potential targets for panther. At the very least your going to have a tank and your pet to cast it on. In all likelyhood your going to have at least one other melee class or pet too. If it came down to it you could even cast it on yourself and melee. You'd still get just as many procs and possibly do more dmg casting it on yourself due to more crits.<br />

Why wouldn't you want to use panther? 1 minute duration for panther sucks but a 30 second duration for curses or 45 second duration for poison dots is good?<br />
<br />
Lets see, panther has a longer duration than any of our dots other than disease which no one uses and gets extended by SCRM which lots of us have. It casts faster than any of our dots and benifits from the quick buff and benificial spell haste alot of us have. It's virtually unresistable compared to no resist mod for any of our other spells. It has no recast time on it unlike our curse dots. It generates no aggro for us. We can stack it by casting it on multiple people. It can move from mob to mob as long as the target is attacking something. It won't break a mez. I honestly can't see any reason why you would want to use any of our other spells instead.</div></div><hr />

Heh, this is actually pretty solid DPS. Especially if your in a Time/Yxxta capable guild. Pick up a Hammer of Hours or a Illuminated Hammer, stick a Veintapper Stone in it, jack up your attack with every Ranger/Shaman/Chanter buff you can get your hands on, and go to town. 550 on Panther, 750 on Hammers, 75 on Stone (with lifetap). The nice part is, all have independant timers, all can crit if you have the AA, and the Lifetap aug can even double crit (crit proc for 150, then a crit heal on the tap, mine is 352 or something, goes off all the time). Of course, you cant really count yourself as 100 dps, since you will be spending a lot of time Panthering other targets, but I have seen my own procs spam my screen a few times.<br />
<br />
Our biggest DPS complaint was that we couldnt effectively stack DOTs in most situations for fear of aggro, and our nukes had limited effectiveness due to no innate resist mod. Panther solved these problems with 1 fell swoop.</div></div><hr />

<br />
DPS per mana is COMPLETELY irrelevent for shaman. Shaman don't run out of mana. That's the whole point. The problem for us has never been dps per mana, it has been dps per time-period, because our spells cast too slowly, they refresh too slowly, and they do too low dps per time-span, meaning our overall dps output PER MOB is too low to be considered a dps class.<br />

My DoN knowledge is sucky, heh. I have been mega busy with a lot in RL lately, and I have only recently completed the first few levels of DoN and gotten my spells, heh. I havent even LOOKED at the buyable gear/augs yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>agrad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Well, from the numerous times I have had leopard cast on my main (bst), I have only twice achieved or passed the fabled 10proc/minute figure - a few in the 10 procs/90sec range for an extended leopard/panther.  More often than not its in the 4-7 procs/min range, whether this is how it should/needs to be, I don't know, but 10procs per minute on PC's is highly situational and at least for my bst has never proved to be the 'norm'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">&quot;But it sounds to me (if it's true) that the Panther spell is about to be nerfed (prolly lep too) so that it procs more like twice a minute as opposed to 15 times a minute or whatever it is doing at the moment. &quot;<br />
<br />
You need to actually read (and understand) the dev's comments about this, and look at what changes are happening on test, because you are completely wrong.<br />
<br />
All said and done, panther will still act like a dot or nuke that does 4400-6600 dmg for 650 mana, with zero aggro and low resists.  That will occur on PC and Pets alike.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">and don'T forget, you can cast one dot only on one mob at a time, but you can buff all of your group with leopard/panther that attack one mob -&gt; way more dps on one mob :)<br />
and yeah, i know, you can do the same with stacking several dots, but then you tank the mob unless your tank is an excellent and good geared knight who knows what he is doing (and has enough mana :))<br />
<br />
imo you cannot really compare that spell to dots, its completely different.</div></div><hr />

I'll be suprised if it even compares with a dot.</div></div><hr />
