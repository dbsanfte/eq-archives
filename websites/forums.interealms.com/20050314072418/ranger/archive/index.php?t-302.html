<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taldaas</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 02:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok so im really into the whle play a ranger look like a ranger thing.  i wear my ivy and i use my morin quested weapons.  Anyways, I would like to know the prices of these weapons and how many people i would need to go get them myself.  i play on the Saryn Server BTW, but prices from other servers would be helpful.<br />
<br />
here's some information on the weapons<br />
<br />
Short Sword of Morin | 1HS | 6 / 22 | +3str +3agi | quest | NO DROP | (I'm using in my Primary)<br />
Orc Impaler 1HP | 7 / 23 | +3str +4wis +10hp | quest | NO DROP | (I'm using in my secondary<br />
Dragon Horn Ykesha | 1HP | 8 / 23 | Ykesha | Old Sebilis<br />
Icy Blade | 1HP | 6 / 21 | Shock of Ice | Kaesora<br />
Flamesong | 1HS | 10 / 24 | +6 wis Flamesong | Kael Drakkal<br />
Lupine Dagger | 1HP | 9 / 18 | +4 dex +4 wis GWF | Karnor's Castle<br />
Faygaurd Parrying Dagger | 1HP | 9 / 17 | +10AC | Word of Pain| Charasis | NO DROP<br />
Silver Swiftblade | 2HS | 16 / 24 | Chardok<br />
<br />
ok so once again I am just wondering the prices of these weapons and what number of people of what level would be needed to get these items.<br />
<br />
*edit* added no drop on SSoM and OI</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Underbrush</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On terris at least it seems that class specific weapon prices have bottomed out. 15k for a lupine was really unreasonable anyway, the 4k or so it's going for now is more reasonable.<br />
<br />
Oh, you forgot the ebonies, who are certainly low priced these days.<br />
<br />
Best bet is a Dragon Horn Ykesha, the price on that is certainly very low, sub 1k, and it's an excellent weapon. The flamesong is nice but not a common drop although most rangers that pick it up on a raid to that part of Kael will not need to use it. Had one handed to me the night I got my bow, I looked at the stats and had to pass it down to another ranger. Too bad it had a cool look to it.</div></div><hr />

A swarmcaller is MUCH better, slower but the proc will save you a lot of spam healing.</div></div><hr />

Drops in South Wing....good luck!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Borzak</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 04:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well on Torv I recently saw a flamesong go for 200pp from a guild that does the Tormax side for faction a lot so I'm sure they had a fair amount of them.<br />
<br />
Lupine Dagger I'd say 4-5k, I sold mine maybe a month ago for 5k (or maybe 4k can't remember).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">farmatyr</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 12:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I sold a Silver Swiftblade for 700pp today. Got a swarmcaller cheap a week after I bought it. Silver Swiftblade is an excellent weapon until the 2 handed bonus starts to get up there. I would expect even a BABS to outdamage it by 50.<br />
<br />
Swarmcaller is an excellent 2hs, even before it procs. The proc makes it useful even if you have a dual wield combo that outdamages it.<br />
<br />
Non of the weapons you mentioned are realistically attainable by getting the drop before 45 or 50.<br />
<br />
Dragon Horn Ykesha is very reasonable, and I would expect flamesong to be also. DHY, because it's ranger only and lore, will sell for less than a SSOY.<br />
<br />
Fayguard Parrying Dagger: you need a key even to get into the zone. Then you need another key to get to the north wing.<br />
<br />
Icy blade: no idea.<br />
<br />
Put the orc impaler in main, and the SSOM in offhand until you upgrade. The difference between 22 and 23 delay won't cover the difference in damage ratios.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mdallasw</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 03:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Icy blade shouldnt cost much, sold a couple of em (helping people get HS keys can get boring, so ran around chasing named mobs), sold one for 200pp and gave the other one to some ranger who was standing near me.  Drops in the little rundown house next to the library, group of your level should be fine to get it, reccomend bringing someone with you who knows the spawns, and someone who can evac though.  (Kaesora is a blast btw)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mdallasw</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 03:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, its steel hilted flint dagger, 4/28, procs conflag, another version drops in VP, same stats, blade or dagger of falling stars I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lycanthrope33</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 10:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a thought, but maybe someone should put up a list that includes all these Ranger only type weapons and tactics/who/what/where to get them.  I only say that cause I'm too lazy to head over to Alla today hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think I paid 900 for my Dragon Horn Yak, but that was before Luclin. I'd assum you should be able to get one for 750 or so now...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bangzoom</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 06:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Paid 400p for my Dragon Horn Yak on Brell -- about the same price an SSoY goes for. <br />
<br />
Nice to get your piercing up with, but not a primary weapon post-50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bleuhearts</div><div class="date">03-30-2002, 07:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On Saryrn, as of late:<br />
<br />
200-500 on Dragon Horn Yak.<br />
500-1000 on Silver Swiftblade.<br />
3-4k on Lupine.<br />
<br />
Prices on class specific weapons can vary greatly. Just saw someone trying to dump a lupine for 8k, the fact that another person wasn't having any luck selling at 3k didn't seem to affect them one bit...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rontic</div><div class="date">03-30-2002, 09:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does anyone know some of the average prices on Nature's Wraith or a Woodsman's Staff?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mridule</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 04:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On Stormhammer I have bought the following:<br />
<br />
<br />
Silver Swiftblade - 100pp<br />
Dragon Yak - 200pp<br />
Swarmcaller - 1000pp<br />
<br />
I'll have to admit, I think these prices are really cheap probably due to the high level lopsidedness of the server.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ellizzbeth</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">our economy is fairly devalued, but<br />
<br />
DHY goes for 200pp or more, I havent been able to sell mine in forever.<br />
Icy Blade is junk.<br />
Swiftblade 2hs is 200-600p<br />
Woodsmans Staff is 2-3k<br />
Natures Wrath is less<br />
Flamesong was 1k a long time ago<br />
Lupine I've seen for 2-4k<br />
FPD is no drop as well, and common drop, and rev whip and F axe from PoF also<br />
<br />
There are some other tradeable weapons that of course aren't ranger only, or are no drop high level drops, but that's for another day.  A sort of easy weapon to get is from SoRZ, and is the HoB (no drop) or SoZ (not no drop).<br />
<br />
Tolan Bracer = 2k or so as well.<br />
<br />
Best wishes, <br />
