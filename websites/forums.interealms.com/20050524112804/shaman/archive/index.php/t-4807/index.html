<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was looking at this 59 Paladin spell and thinking this would be an awesome addition to the Shaman line. It's sort of like a mini-Torpor.<br />

I want a larger heal, not a smaller one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well since I'm 99.99% sure that I will never have Torpor when I am 60, this looks much much much better to me. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">How are you so sure, Thual? You can one-group camps that drop torpor and malo.<br />

Are you 99.99% sure that you will never be able to put together a single group of friends to hit these camps? Blah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">lol<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure if it was all that easy, they would not be selling (not up for sale...but selling) for 60k+.<br />
<br />
I can play about 2 hours a day. It takes nearly 1 of those hours to get a group even moving on the same continent...<br />
<br />
Not impossible, sure, but pretty unlikely IMHO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Oh, and I wouldn't be 56 now if it weren't for HHK!<br />
<br />
Thanks man :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It sounds like you've been talked out of your spells before you even had a chance to look for them. Ignore the negative guff on how rare our spells are and actually go after them. These one-group camps WORK and are attractive to other classes so it shouldn't be terribly difficult to put 'em together.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, I haven't even mentioned the trade route... People can and do get lucky with these spells by checking the bazaar frequently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've seen Torpor in the bazaar twice now.  Once for 80k, other time for 90k.<br />
<br />
Hmm... one of the good things about the proposed new 75H spells for us &amp; druids....  nobody will pay 25k or more for Torpor. ;)  Going to be a lot of sad little farmers, if that's the case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Of course I'll be looking for an opportunity to get those spells, just as everyone does, and I'm not complaining at all. <br />
<br />
Just a realistic statement of fact. With my limited playtime (my own choice/problem) it will be difficult for me to put any more that a few hours at a time into it.<br />
<br />
I think that a lower version of Torpor would ge a great assest. I also think that Druids need a &quot;big&quot; heal more than Shaman do...as most of the time Slow = indirect healing.<br />
<br />
No group should ever *not* need a Cleric, but they should be able to squeek by with a druid or Shaman IMO.<br />
<br />
Cleric  = Big Healer.<br />
Druid = Medium Healer.<br />
Shaman = Low Healer (add in less damaged due to Slowed MoB) = Medium Healer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">perhaps its so expensive cause the people bother to camp these actualy use/need them. i kjnow most guilds on my serve rsimply horde these spells for guildies and future oracles.<br />
<br />
i mean , oyu know how long it takes to find someone willing and able to drop 50-90k on 1 spell , muchless 2 ? you could farm 20 vah shir earings or centi long swords in that time ( yes im currently camping ME :p)<br />
<br />
maybe its not farmed and prices are cheap cause of high supply cause its simply not worth it to farm it. im thinking i might not get my spells either, but you can bet your arse im going to put in a crapload of effort to try ...<br />
<br />
<br />
PS: Think about this , how much fun would it be to get a practicly epic spell, something shamans look foward to all their lives, how woul dit feel to go to your local bazaar-mart and just pick one up. how would it feel if any twinked power leveled shaman didn thave to earn that or anything else for that matter. some things are a testemant to your hard work, something that shouldnt be just bought for 100pp, i cant lie , it would be nice , but i also cant lie and not state that i would not enjoy it nearly as much</div></div><hr />

&quot;Cleric = Big Healer. <br />
Druid = Medium Healer. <br />
Shaman = Low Healer (add in less damaged due to Slowed MoB) = Medium Healer.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is a bunch of bunk. The best heal is the one that's not needed, and thanks to slow we have that option. As such, I will outheal a druid via tigirs, turgur, malo and torpor. <br />
<br />
I recently joined the VL tents camps and found an oom cleric. I buffed and said start pulling, I'm good, med to fm Mr. Cleric. Our cleric laughed. We pulled the kobolds and cleared the camp. Then we pulled the statues/gargs behind, cleared them. The next thing I heard was a rant about how shaman are too powerful. I did the same think at VL top rares. <br />
<br />
We have limits, but I've been the only healer in exp camps just about everywhere. Now, this has limits, like deep in Chardok, CT and one-group HoT, but shaman can do surprisingly well as primary healers, so don't sell yourself short.<br />
<br />
Try using NT to keep a tank alive against an unslowed mob and maybe you'll realize which of the priest classes is the weakest healer. Sorry, but the old &quot;damage sheild verses slow&quot; balance just hasn't held up as the game grown.</div></div><hr />

Not everyone is 60.  Not everyone has Topor.<br />
<br />
I dirty-double-dog-dare you to go back to any of those locations &amp; try it again without topor.  Gosh, probably kind of hard then, huh?<br />

<br />
What a great thought. Let's tune the game to the lowest common denominator. Sadly, my friend, the game's structure is designed and subsequentially tweaked taking into consideration existing abilities, spells, gear etc. <br />
<br />
A better question would be, how dumb would it be to design encounters assuming higher-end spells/gear/etc didn't exist? &quot;Since 33 percent of level 60 shaman don't have Malo, let's lower MOBs' resistances to make them slow easier.&quot; Riiiight.<br />
<br />
Those spells exist, therefore a 60 shaman w/full spells &gt; 60 druid w/full spells, healing wise. Ironclad fact.<br />
<br />
If you're not 60 and don't have these spells, you're right. The druid is a better healer. And a level 60 ogre warrior with 6000 HP, 1350 AC and 2 SoDs is a better tank than a level 20 halfling in full bronze with 2 mino axes. Your point again is?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Vargo Hoat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">being below 60 is not the lowest common denominator</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">jesus christ when the hell will people realise that nature's touch has the excact same hp/mana ratio as CB....it's a matter of casting the spell twice...AND we have torpor 60 + slows, making healing trivial, sometimes unncessary with regrowth.<br />
<br />
and you pessimists saying you'll never see torpor/malo...go camp tolapumj, protector, emperor and guardian wurms instead of living in the bazaar, because they - and other lvl 59-60 spells that you can trade for torpor - drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>mystreez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">What most of you are failing to grasp is that the new heal being tested was not originally designed for group use but RAID use.  How many times have raids been called off to lack of clerics? Plenty.  <br />
<br />
What this is for is to allow guilds with lower people who have an abundance of druids/shaman to heal adequately in a raid environment.  This is a boon so please stop the whines. You would think that this board was turning into the cleric and druid class boards :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
My usual EXP group spends time in Juggs collecting spells for our guild vault (Including SebbyProt and Jumpy), as well as SkyFire on the Guardian Wurms. I've, personally, seen these spells drop. The drop rate is neither encouraging nor discouraging. If you want it bad enough you just have to work for it. Aside from my level 25 Shamaness, I believe every Shaman in our guild has one of either Malo or Torpor waiting for them now. I know for a fact she'll have them before she's 60.<br />
<br />
My guild isn't uber by any definition. We've yet to kill Venril Sathir for chrissakes. But we have a lot of very strong and knowledgable individuals. <br />
<br />
Besides, if you want something bad enough, you work for it or you pay for it. If the price is an arm and a leg, it's your choice to save up for it or actively pursue it with a passion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I know for a FACT there are people tha camp these spots EVERY day and don't have them. What's your point?<br />
<br />
YOUR experiences are not EVERYONES experiences. Just because something happens for you, doesn't mean it happens that way for every other shaman playing EQ.<br />
<br />
The ORIGINAL point of my thread...is that I think that a mini-version of Torpor that can be aquired by those that are either (a) not willing or (b) not able to aquire the Torpor spell in the manner you think they should.<br />
<br />
As I said before, I play about two hours a day. That is my choice/problem. Because of that CHOICE, I think that an easier to aquire mini-version of those spells would be helpful to ME. Not you and your experience...but mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The best heal is the one that's not needed<br />
<br />
I agree, and as I stated our best &quot;healing&quot; spell is a slowed MOB. <br />
<br />
I was thinking more from the standpoint that if a druid and I are in a group with no Cleric, I am not doing as much &quot;direct&quot; healing as the Druid, and therefore he generally a better healer. I am actually preventing more damage ~ ala &quot;healing&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Glencannon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I was in Dragon Necropolis last nite for the first time, killing Kung Fu Rats.  Approximately half were Unslowable, even after Tash.  Malosini would not land either.<br />
<br />
The moral:  Turgurs can be resisted, Heals cannot.    <br />
<br />
Afterwards, we ran over, grabbed the Crypt in Seb-- 58 Shaman (me), 59 Ench, 60 Ranger, 60 Rogue.  Only 2 resists on approximately 30-35 mobs we killed before the Ranger got killed (on a mob that resisted Turgurs), and we called it a night.  <br />
<br />
The moral:  Turgurs can be resisted, Heals cannot.</div></div><hr />
