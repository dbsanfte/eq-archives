<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dagor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have completed all tasks in the epic quest up to Ghiosk.  Well I ahven't turned in my combined book of pages/reports and the like yet, but that will happen pretty soon.<br />
<br />
That means that Ghiosk is next.   I tried a site search, but just got error messages.   So I am asking while I try to correct my problem with the search.<br />
<br />
Where does he spawn?  How many folks are required to take him down?  There anything to be sure to avoid?  <br />
<br />
Any info is appreciated.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh and Just dinged into 48 last night, so well ahead of epic schedule.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Basically Ghiosk spawns from a reaver.  That reaver is located on the ground floor of the Castle, and can be easily single pulled to a single reaver capable group(melee heavy with Cleric and healers).  That single pull is made by a rogue picking the lock, and someone pulling him with a ranged weapon or spell.  Ghiosk is pretty much entirely MR even to Disease and Poison.<br />
<br />
Alternatively one could hang out in CoM, look for a Reaver raid and seek to join in or at least ask if you can loot the books if no raid shaman are in need of them.  Apparently Ghiosk is usually killed several times during the average Reaver raid.</div></div><hr />
