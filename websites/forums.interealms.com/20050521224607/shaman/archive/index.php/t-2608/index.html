Is it worth trading a jbb for this weapon, fbss and some cash?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Matters on your 2hb skill really, the JBB might be able to outdamge it, and with the FBSS and another weapon, you could probably still outdamage this weapon. So I'd say no, but I'm not sure, don't know all the numbers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Fairly certain this weapon can't be used until 51.  Seeing as your magelo profile says you are 30, I'd have to say no...then again, you cant use the JBB either, and believe me, I know how that feels...halfway through 44...LOL.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">you wont outdmg a jbb with it either way</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No way.  Keep the JBB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heh..need to update my magelo profile.<br />
<br />
I'm actually lvl 36, but still a ways off from being able to use the jbb.<br />
<br />
I solo a lot, and mainly use 2hb.  So my skill in that is maxed for my lvl.  The guy that wanted to trade told me that the war maul could be used before lvl 51, but the ratio would change.  Having said that, I doubt very seriously that it could outdamage the jbb at lvl 45.<br />
<br />
Guess I'll keep it.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would advise to keep the JBB as well.  Dang lucky that you have one man!  In regards to 2hb, there are some options for you that only marginally are less potent then the Tar Ew War Maul.<br />
<br />
1.) Granite Face Grinder  29 36, great ratio and speed.  + 10 to Wis, Str, Int does not hurt either.  You should be able to pick one up for 5k or less.<br />
<br />
2.) Fungus Covererd Tarmuk staff:  30/45 with + 7 disease damage, making it effectively 37/45.  Great ratio, but no wis, and fairly slow.  Perfect for hard hits between bracer casts.  Fairly light, so endurance should not be a problem.   You should be able to pick one up for 2 -3 k<br />
<br />
3.) Tarmuk Battle Staff: 33 / 44, +12 str, + 5 ac   No wis, but great ration and str and ac.  a sweet 2h blunt.  <br />
<br />
I am sure there are others out there, but these came to mind. Good luck!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah..I'm using a granite face grinder.<br />
<br />
That thing hits HARD.  Had to trade my fbss for it, but I can pick up another one easily.<br />
<br />
Love the 10wis on it as I'm a not so bright troll :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">No way, hold onto your JBB. You can find a better weapon that that anyway. BTW, how's your Piercing skill? I was using 2HB all the way till lv34. Once I got my pet, I switched to piercing weapons and been using it ever since.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My piercing is lagging a bit.  Think it's at 102.  Have a slime coated harpoon, but I just love using my gfg too much to bag it.<br />
<br />
Guess I'll get started working that again.  But I always have training points to use if I have too much trouble getting it up to par.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Shaman melee only gets worse as you level. Keep the JBB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">There's little chance ANY weapon you own will ever out damage the JBB.<br />
<br />
On greens you may out damage the JBB with a Facesmasher and rabid bear, but that's about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Smasherr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">JBB= god<br />
<br />
i have a taw ew hammer of agression....and in no way will out damage my JBB.<br />
<br />
that hammer is 17/20 10 wis str sta i believe.<br />
<br />
gotta also remember....we shammy's tend to wiffle alot.:)<br />
<br />
in perfect world...maybe could outdamage JBB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Litchebane is correct.<br />
<br />
in the 30's and 40's, i could melee stuff down with a gatorsmash maul for exp.  now, i can't melee down anything other than the same mobs i fought in the 30-40's.  stuff just has too many hit points and high AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Don't do that trade, JBB &gt; All, but a nice wep is good to have.  I had Tae Ew War Maul before I got my hammer of spiritcalling, 39 43 15 wis str and some other stats effect granite crush, snare \ small dot that lasts 3 or 4 ticks heh, and its fun to melee with, but not worth trading JBB in for.  BTW, it will NOT be equippable before lvl 51, it shows it as a lower ratio before 51 but you still cannot use it, my 46 monk friend couldnt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">whats the graphic on this maul?<br />
<br />
i was using a poison windcensor to kill guards in highkeep, but i have poor poison reist still so was taking too much damage lol<br />
<br />
i still think that this one best 2hb (cost me 2kpp)  20 28 366 aoe<br />
<br />
thos the 17 20 from CT is unbelievable, its gotta cost far too much for most folk to get (<br />
<br />
my 1hb is maxed [piercing is 193] i wish i could get the BLAM stcik from POM what a great and funny item :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Brat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Your JBB lets you damage out of melee range (till root breaks) with a hamma, you gotta step up to the plate &amp; get smacked around to do the same, or less damage.<br />
<br />
Dont get rid of that bracer!</div></div><hr />
