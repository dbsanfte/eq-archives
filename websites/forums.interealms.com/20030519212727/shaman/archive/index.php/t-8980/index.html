Would Verant actually put in a quest that can require 60+ hours of faction work, and then nerf the quest item two weeks after the quest is implemented?  Don't know about you all, but I have already spent several long, boring nights in LGuk killing waves of undead frogs working on this quest.  Would they really nerf it?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bumtuol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The dark elf illusion mask used to be usable by all. When they changed it, they just created a new mask that was bard/rogue only and made it so only the new one would drop. Perhaps they would do something similar if they decide they don't want the all/all mask.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lorena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i dont think they will nerf the Wood Elf ciclet since bard and rogue can be wood elf at start....well where is the enjoy to be wood elf if ur class can be that race at start ?<br />
<br />
Shaman Dark elf is kewl<br />
Shaman Wood elf is kewl<br />

That logic hardly holds up. There are masks for bards and rogues for almost every race in the game now. Barb mask, gnome mask, halfling mask, dorf mask, val shir mask off the top of my head. I think they have half elf in jagged pine too but not sure. All of which are rogue playable races normally.<br />
<br />
They do have some like iksar or high elf or erudite that they can't normally be too but they have tons of masks for races that they could normally be too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">yes but none of them require massive amounts of faction farming, and a 250+ skill tailored item.  faction farming = gag...<br />
<br />
all the rest are just drops, maybe some camping or in the case of gnome, dorf, and barbarian, some heavy duty raiding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The quest was designed specifically for all/all... if you notice, somebody specifically made a faxion boosting item for very specific classes, races, and religions so they could complete this quest.<br />
<br />
The only reason they'd &quot;nerf&quot; this quest, is to recreate the DE mask fiasco, where only a very few people have them... not that I'd put that past VI... they love to stir up the hate</div></div><hr />

I have heard from several people that the Wood Elf Illusion helm has been NERFED on test server.  It is now bard/rogue ONLY.<br />
<br />
<br />
Checked with a friend on test server, its still all/all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hail,<br />
<br />
Thanks for checking this out Atarak.<br />
I was worried.  Finally had the 4 furs together, and my 250 skill GM Tailor friend failed on the cloak combine. :eek: (Ouch!)  I'll be trying again soon I'm sure. :D<br />
<br />
I'm not KoS on live side, but I'm not exactly loved either. :p <br />
So I had some work to do even if I did get the cloak.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">As Atarak said its still all/all on test and I have a strong feeling it was intended that way. I finished it early on the 25th; the crown and the quest itself are still working as they have been.....<br />

As a troll worshipping Innoruuk, my faction topped out at indifferent and amiable w/ the Ghoul Lord Scalp, meaning if your in this position you'll have to have an enchanter to illusion you. I used a halfling mask from our Regent Symbol of Innoruuk quest and it (most 'good' race forms) bumps you to the needed warmly faction. You may be able to skip some frog killing though since Imp form seems to give allot bigger bump at this time(not sure if this will change) At indifferent faction +scalp +imp form I was at Ally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>loptar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Omg! it'll be like Lore centi long swords and No drop Fungi's!<br />
<br />
seriously though.. don't believe it till you see it. I play on veeshan and see idiots in the bazaar asking 60k+ pp for the cloak needed.. it's 60k now and they're going to nerf it.. see where this is going? it's like solstice earings and the people that ask 40k for them cause omg omg they're going to make them no-drop or lore or level requirement or all three next patch but these ones will be normal so you gotta buy them now!<br />
<br />
I know, kinda trolly for my first post but /shrug :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">But they are no-drop, and they are lore, and they do have a level requirement.<br />
<br />
For the solstice earring anyway :)<br />
<br />
There is always a big rush when the first of any item hits the market. For instance - Valorium rings. They started at 60k on my server. Now they're down to 25k, because more people are saving liquid metal and more of them are in circulation. I still won't pay that much for a damn ring, I'll wait till I get the metal and have a friendly jc make it, or till it drops to the 5k range. Which, I predict, it will.<br />
<br />
On the flip side, was the girdle of mithandrael. Started at 60k. Went down to 15k. (I bought mine for 10k). The drop rate was nerfed. It's now up to 60k. I Was glad I bought mine when I did - I heard about the nerf in advance, so I was forwarned and picked mine up griping about the price at 10k. It's a nice belt. It's not worth 60k. But it is worth 10k.<br />
<br />
So sometimes it pays to hear what's next on the nerfing wheel. I don't think wood elf will be nerfed. But I do want to be aware of the rumors and try to verify them to make sure I don't miss out on, say, Valorium rings at a &quot;cheap&quot; price of 25k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>loptar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">haha ya, a steal at twice the price!:D</div></div><hr />
