<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kervin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is it possible to start in Iceclad at 29? Not looking to solo really, just looking to set foot in Velious for the first time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gudin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My warrior soloed in Crystal Caverns from 28 to 35 without much trouble, a shaman could probably do it. Thats where I'm going at 29  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, you'll be fine there at that level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Elindra_BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What level are the mobs in crystal caverns?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aye..what level are the mobs..and whereabouts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Deian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not sure what lvl mobs, but I remember many orcs being blue to my warrior at 27. I was there with a group of 3 others, no chanter, and had no problems exping there. I know this is vague, but hopefully it's helpful a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Exodus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes, I'm level 29 and grouped their with a couple guildies. Miners con blue to me, but th oracle cons yellow. The loot is pretty good, each brick of velium sells for 12pp. I've also looted a few velium weapons and frozen longswords. The only problem with Crystal Caverns are the merchants (If you don't have sneak or illusion), and getting out. Getting into CC is easy, but getting out is a bit difficult. The exp is pretty good in a group, and if your killing maybe 3 orcs every 5 minutes, you can get a full gold in about 30. I've left this place to go to High Keep, mainly because I died twice in a row here. Hope this helps. - Exodus</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Starlettex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">you can lvl here from 28 to 51, it s maybe boring but well...</div></div><hr />
