<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>RizzWulfgard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night we made a run at a boss mob in Akheeva ruins, fairly deep in.  Unfortunately, several adds aggroed before we were able to kill him.<br />
<br />
We suffered a wipe out, and due to the servers coming down for a patch we were unable to CR.<br />
<br />
If you died, please get back to the Nexus when you can.  We will be CR'ing those who were not recovered using coffins.<br />
<br />
Those who died, post the times that you will be available for CR's.  I do know a small handfull of bodies are at the zone thanks to the dragging efforts of Seran, Theznir, Jice, and Sarconus.<br />
<br />
Please update here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Infinate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I wish that I could assist in the CR's but my EQ days are over far a while with the new daily patch schedule.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Traz Blackwolfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am available probably from 1pm Pacific on...I will assist in any way possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seran Swiftstrike</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Probably not any earlier than 6pm EST</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Arsecn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I FDed at the end of wipeout but had no ivis nor a cos... so after several attempts of standing/casting invis, finally /q out came back and managed to invis up at about 3 minutes til server down... managed to pull Meia, Windi, and Traz off of ledge and to the center of floor near entrance of that room... then ran back to zone and camped.<br />
<br />
I will be on at 8pm EST for any corpse summons if I can get some coffins...  also can try to drag any that still need it.   Rocks and the brainiacs didnt see through invis, didnt see any ghost types so not sure about them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valfaroth GoldenHeart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">unsure when i'll be on...I have a christmas party to go to tomorrow and i plan to get drunk all night long 8)....hopefully i can get in before then....maybe 4 or 5 oclock pm EST</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Atokal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">available from about 11 am EST. Ominnous is there as  well so if we need a break/CR team I can help with that too as well as sitting there all day doing resses if needed.<br />
<br />
BTW I had a blast even though we lost at the end. Thanks Rizz for leading this raid.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
<br />
If you need me for anything else lemme know</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Windigo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I will be home at about 4:00 PM Central until 6 PM central, then not sure when I will be back after that... could be as late as 9:30 PM central.  I am in Thurgadin with no cash left in the bank so if anyone is able to port me to a Luclin spire I would love that :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Meiamour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I don't know for sure when I can be on tonight. Both my daughters have programs at their schools. <br />
<br />
Rizz check your email please I emailed you info on this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I was there earlier and running around some invis. The undead do see invis if they are there. Also, if you trip the worm trap, they also see invis.  Some of the undead are casters, so FD is a bit tougher. <br />
<br />
Goodluck everyone..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Canelek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I will be on around 6PST to coffin those that are left.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Quinnell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Windigo, I can get you to a spire with enough cash to get up to the Nexus.  It may be 5pm CST though before I'm online.<br />
<br />
-Quinn<br />
<br />
Wish I could help with the CR; but, my machine still won't run Luclin without crashing to the desktop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Windigo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thanks Quinn :)  I'll try to be online then and if I'm not to a spire I'll surely take you up on that offer.<br />
<br />
<br />
Happy Birthday by the way :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Unless something goes wronghere at work, I should be online by 4 PM CST to help clean up the mess.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>RizzWulfgard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">CR is complete with the exception of Moebeus who will need to be coffined and Jice who can be reached up the main hall with invis.<br />
<br />
Jice and Moebeus will both need experience resses.<br />
<br />
All other bodies have been coffined and dragged.  Special thanks to Tempin, Atokal, Knarlz, Sinfutura, Nekky, Dexail and others im sure I missed, for assisting and helping with CR most of the day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Temp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Sheez, when I left Rizz had died 5 times already on this CR, I hope that was the end of the Rizz deaths for the day.<br />
We have to be careful about risky operations near patch times like that. Of course, is this the first time ever the patch was that early?<br />
I was pretty lucky and got camped out, in the morning I logged back on with my finger hovering over the DA hot key, and made it back out to the hallway before it faded and i died, an easy CR from there.<br />
<br />
Temp</div></div><hr />
