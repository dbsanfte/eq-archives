Caster NPC Update<br />
<br />
As Alan's already said, the driving idea behind these changes to NPCs is to make them more interesting to fight. Previously, especially toward the high end, it's no secret that many caster NPCs were considered free targets. They spent the majority of their time casting ineffective spells, and frequently the same ones over and over again.<br />
<br />
Originally, they were given exemptions to the normal spellcaster rules to make up for their shortcomings. It only makes sense that the average NPC should be a challenge for the people who can gain experience from its demise. However, we think it should instead feel like they're playing from the same rulebook as player spellcasters.<br />
<br />
Making them challenging within a similar framework to the one that players use, we feel, provides for more rewarding victories. Conversely, let's face it, the argument, &quot;Of course NPCs cheat -- They're NPCs.&quot; really doesn't make anyone feel better when they've just gotten themselves obliterated. Yes, dying is painful, but doing so in a fair fight is much more tolerable.<br />
<br />
<br />
None of this is an attempt at &quot;Making EverQuest Universally Harder.&quot; We'd like our NPCs be a little smarter than they were previously, yet an encounter with them should still feel challenging, but fair.<br />
<br />
<br />
In last week's patch we introduced a significant enhancement to the &quot;Challenging&quot; half of that, which from observations on the Test server appeared to be mostly fair. However, we feel confident enough in the NPCs' newfound strengths that we've taken a look at some of the special bonuses that they get just for being an NPC.<br />
<br />
With that in mind, we've internally tested some changes to address the &quot;Fair&quot; half, and they'll be available for public testing on the Test server over the next few days, in the hopes of reaching a balance between player and spellcasting NPC. Ideally, we would like to have a balance which leaves them a challenge; something to be mindful of, but not inordinately unfair.<br />
<br />
There are some that we're still internally debating, but we all agree that we'd like to see them in action in front of a wider audience before we make any final decisons.<br />
<br />
<br />
* NPCs are now bound by the same Line of Sight rules as player characters. (An NPC must be able to &quot;see&quot; you to hit you with a spell.)<br />
<br />
* Neither NPCs nor player characters will use mana on targeted spell casts that do not connect due to Line of Sight.<br />
<br />
* NPCs are now bound by spell casting distance rules. Meaning, an NPC's spell will no longer connect from halfway across the zone. (We want spellcasters to be challenging -- Not a deathtrap that a person has no ability to run away from.)<br />
<br />
* NPCs now have a chance to be interrupted by normal combat when casting newer spells.<br />
<br />
* NPCs that are extremely green have had their potential casting damage reduced using a similar mechanic to the one that player characters' level differences use.<br />
<br />
* NPC Wizards no longer have an inherent bonus to their fire and cold based spells. They appear to be doing just fine on their own.<br />
<br />
* Most NPCs that had previously had their spellcasting level inflated to make up for poor spell selection have been brought back into line with their actual level.<br />
<br />
* NPCs no longer automatically get free access to rarely dropped spells, such as Garrison's Superior Sundering and Funeral Pyre of Kelador.<br />
<br />
* We've begun looking at NPC pure caster hit points and melee damage, and will continue to watch how this plays out over the coming weeks, making adjustments in some cases. Some adjustments are already visible on the test server.<br />
<br />
<br />
Even this balance may not yet be where we'd like it, but please rest assured that it will continue to be tuned. Most of us enjoy playing the game as well, and what we would like to see in our own playtime is NPCs that are a reasonable challenge<br />
<br />
... Darn Verant!  They're actually listening!</div></div><hr />

<br />
So....we as PCs didn't have a chance to interrupt them on the lower level or older spells?<br />
<br />
Might make sense seeing as how it takes nearly two groups of melees knocking a caster halfway across a room to actually stop them from casting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I guess I've just been very lucky, then.  I hit most of the time with my slam, and interrupt almost every time I hit them.<br />
<br />
Wonder if it's cuz I Incapacitate them first?  That'd explain the ability to land a slam, but not the interrupt...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sweet, I've been sliding and ducking behind rocks, trees, corners etc for the longest time always trying to break line of site.  Nice to see it'll actually work now ;P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Shandy, by 'normal combat' they mean slashes, pierces, punches, crushes and similar 'hit the a key and go to the bathroom' type attacks. Slam, bash and to a degree kick aren't considered 'normal combat', and have always been capable of stopping spells on most mobs. However, on unstunnable that can CH, such as white fatties in ToV, either killing them using powa-fiyah the instant they started casting or, for smaller raids, moving them enough that they got interrupted was the only way to stop 'em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Feias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks Bahimiron.  I should have been more clear.  I was thinking about non stunable mobs or by simply using standard attacks.<br />
<br />
The mobs manage to channel though immense amounts of normal non stun damage.  Maybe now there will be a better chance to interrupt the casting in general.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well at least they are admitting they FUBARED the patch.<br />
<br />
I once (with my Monk) hit a MOB 17 times while it was casting.  Did not interrupt.<br />
<br />
Taking 1434 points in two nukes from a MOB 28 levels below me is a &quot; tad &quot; bullshet. (Young Shardwurm)<br />
<br />
You know, if they would actually TEST these patches (ala DAoC) before having the players be the guinea pigs I would stop 75% of my complaining.  <br />
<br />
When you think of all this game COULD have been....</div></div><hr />

<br />
BUHahahahah<br />
<br />
That's a joke right?  DAoC has by far the worst testing enviroment ever.  <br />
<br />
Grass isn't always greener.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Class imbalance, Realm imbalance does not mean they don't test their patches before going live.<br />
<br />
Sure Mythic has a small test server pop.  They also will copy your character over to test for that purpose.<br />
<br />
When there IS a DAoC patch, that's it. Patch and play. When was the last time a major EQ patch didn't have emergency server shutdowns, post-patches, fixes, and subsequent patches to fix &quot; fixes &quot; ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Sez Bahimiron<br />
Shandy, by 'normal combat' they mean slashes, pierces, punches, crushes and similar 'hit the a key and go to the bathroom' type attacks. Slam, bash and to a degree kick aren't considered 'normal combat', and have always been capable of stopping spells on most mobs. However, on unstunnable that can CH, such as white fatties in ToV, either killing them using powa-fiyah the instant they started casting or, for smaller raids, moving them enough that they got interrupted was the only way to stop 'em.<br />
<br />
Cool!  I've never really thought of standard melee attacks as being capable of interrupting a critter.  I guess mostly because up until now... they haven't.  Kinda take slam for granted, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">HAH!!!  FEEL MY LINE OF SIGHT!<br />
<br />
Pillar_01 just became more useful! (1)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">dark age of camelot's testing is piss poor.  there's even fewer people on their test server than on everquest's.  the people that are there aren't given an opportunity to properly test half the stuff that gets put on there.  mythic fails to listen to the player community on a large number of things that would be detrimental to the game.  they also don't listen to the players on a large number of things that would greatly beneficial to the game.<br />
<br />
i'd probably be playing daoc still if mythic listened to half the valid complaints from the players.</div></div><hr />
