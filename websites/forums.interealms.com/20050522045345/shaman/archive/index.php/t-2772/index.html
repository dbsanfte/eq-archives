<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Akirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone have a link or a chart that they could post listing the various HPs and level ranges of each class' pets at each spell level, along with the max they hit for?  This seems like the sort of thing that would be sufficiently useful to have been assembled into some sort of comprehensive table.<br />
<br />
Also, if no such thing exists, could someone tell me whether or not the 55 shaman pet quad attacks, and how it tanks in comparison to the 49 shaman/necro/mage pets?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">55 pet doubles for 51.  It is a piece of crap compared to mage/necro pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Arisai/Miser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">the best 49 pet i can summon hits for 51, so that cant be correct</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Smasherr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i'm pretty sure the 55 pet hits for 53 max.<br />
it has around 1800 hp unbuffed.<br />
(unfortunatly its ac is like 0 so unbuffed all mobs hit it for max!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Arisai:<br />
<br />
&quot;the best 49 pet i can summon hits for 51, so that cant be correct&quot;<br />
<br />
Applying logic to what a shaman pet can and cannot do is not a good idea. 51 is the max hit - it was once 53 that but that was considered extremely unbalancing and had to be lowered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">my fluffy doubles for 28...has about 400 hp unbuffed.<br />
<br />
phear him.</div></div><hr />

Heh, you would think that, wouldn't you...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sad to say, the 55 shaman pet does not hit harder than the 49 pet. 51 is the max. The 55 pet just has more hps and supposedly higher AC and level.</div></div><hr />
