<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Emmhim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello<br />
<br />
I went from lvl 48 to 54 in Dulaks harbour (mostly trying to get the charm from the captain on Boat 1).<br />
I liked the zone, so I would like to go back there and solo once in a while, but the first 3 boats are too low now, and I want to avoid boat 5 (I hate fighting clerics with CH and shadowknights).<br />
<br />
That leaves Oceancrasher. Are there anywhere on that boat I can sit down and summon my pet, or is the aggro range simply too large?<br />
Is it better if I am sitting on my lizzie?<br />
I often group with a lvl 51 druid. Is she so low level that she will draw more aggro, or can she also rest safely somewhere on the boat?<br />
<br />
Any other things I should be aware of on that boat? I am thinking on the special event with the captain on boat 5 - somthing similar on boat 4?<br />
<br />
Greetings<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sancha Delnocha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've done that boat a few times.  I've never found a safe spot, but if you go up the ramp and then to the other side of boat, theres some ropes and boxes that I set up camp at.  If you drop invis there you will get only 1 mob so either bring someone to help you break, or root the mob, cast pet and slow and then you are good to go for the rest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When you go up the ramp go straight to the other side of the ship. Then go about half way up to the front of the ship. Stay tight against the low wall and face boat number 3. On your left should be a mob standing next to the ships mast and 2 mobs on you right where the front of the ship slopes up. Staying against the wall pick the middle distance between the mob by the mast and the closest of the two by the front of the ship. <br />
<br />
I may have just been lucky but I was able to bring up doggy and buff there. I took about two steps towards the front of the ship and that mob came after me so you don't have much room for error. After that mob I killed the other one at the front of the ship to give me some room and then continued with the one by the mast.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">the normal spots by the catapults will just aggro the closest assasin with plenty of room to run along the edge of the boat to root him and do whatever else you want with him.</div></div><hr />
