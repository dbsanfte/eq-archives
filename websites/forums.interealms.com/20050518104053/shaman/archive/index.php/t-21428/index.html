<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Serriously though, when I first started playing eq I wasnt into the lore at all..Now that Im getting a bit bored, Ive descided to delve into the lore surrounding some of the critters in EQ.  I mostly likely wont be flagged for time or even the elements but Im cool with that..Here is my question, Ive seen the big statue of the sleeping dragon in EW I think..Whats the basis behind this guy?  Can he be woken up?  Would it be poetentially a bad thing to wake him up?  Just currious...Tell me what you know..We have way of making you talk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">He's been awakened on most servers already. Usually whichever guild wakes him isn't very popular for a while, because it permanently removes a number of loot-dropping mobs from ST.<br />
<br />
As far as I know, he's only been killed once, on Rallos Zek, and that was the ultimate of all zergs. ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Clicking the sphere on the dragon statue in EW takes you to Sleeper's tomb (Kerafyrm's lair).<br />
<br />
The lore behind sleeper is many thousands of years ago two dragons of different colours got funky together against dragon laws/rules and the Sleeper was made (it was NOT Vox and Naggy, they wanted to get it together so they were imprisoned away from each other). Sleeper was the most powerful dragon that has ever existed and it took a huge force to take him down and put him to 'sleep' in sleeper's Tomb. <br />
<br />
In ST once all 4 warders have been killed and all are down at the same time Sleeper awakens and opens a can of whoop ass on everyone, its a one time script on all servers. He apparantly goes to ToV or VP and theres a zonewide messege before all dragons depop in the zone. <br />
<br />
Sleepers only once been killed, a few months ago on RZ server i believe with a force of apporx 180 people and 3 hrs work (after a GM depopped sleeper the night before as he was going to die then to a similar force, and he was created to be unkillable and play out his script).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ok, on second thought let the bastard sleep...lol..the last thing i need is an uber dragon looking for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The &quot;sleeping dragon&quot; in West Wastes is just a statue marking the entrance to Sleeper's Tomb.  AFAIK sleeper is already awake on all servers, RZ managed to kill him, but SoE declared that it wil beofficially ignored for the sake of Lore (mobs in SkyShrine talk about his escape)</div></div><hr />

<br />
By the way, it seems the sleeper is the child of Lady Vox and Lord Nagafen. Since they are dragons of different breeds they were not allowed to mate because their mating could result in an offspring rivaling Veeshans power. But alas they did.<br />
<br />
I also thing there was a scripted event when the sleeper awoke. He appeared in Skyshrine and made a zonewide DT and stuff like that, and there are even rumours about Vox and Nagafen shouting something upon the sleepers awekning...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Kerafyrm is NOT the child of Vox and Naggy.  Kerafyrm is much much older than either of them and was the result of the first interracial pairing of the dragons.  It is because of Kerafyrm that the rules were passed banning interracial dragon pairings, and when vox and nagafen were found out to be trying, they were isolated and cursed by the rest of dragonkind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ah ok, i understand... but vox and naggy were included in the awakening script?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kubke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thats my understanding too Vigdis, tho Ive not been present when that happened :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">No, Vox and Naggy are bound to their lairs.  The wakening script involves Kera making a trail of MASS destruction from the tomb over to ToV where he and Yelniak have at it for a while.  In the end a ton of dragons team up on Kera and he takes off.<br />
<br />
  Lotta people pondering if Sleeper is the mysterious dragon now named Mata Muram who is hell bent on revenge against Norrath in Omens of War.  If you want hearty lore on Sleeper you can poke your head into the Lore Library on the EQLive boards, one of the most insteresting areas of the boards, with a fair amount of interaction from SoE's Lore Lady.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Being bound to their lairs or not, i still think that atleast one of them shouted something inside his/hers zone... but im not sure about that... i wish i remember where i read that.<br />
<br />
Also, did Kerafyrm &quot;The Sleeper&quot; really go to ToV? I was under the impression that he went to Skyshrine.<br />
<br />
Oh and thanks for hinting about SoE's lore boards. Ill go check them out  :D  Lore is afterall the last area of this game that seems to grab my interest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">We've woken him up like at least 6 times on Stromm, and the script bugs and crashes the zone. We could hang out in EW for a bit and kill the warders over and over if we wanted. Our scrip is seriously fuct heh. Dwarf mask wru!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>JuyshinRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">from what i have been told, vox and nagafen start shouting when the sleeper is awoken, and i think a few other dragons also. we killed him on rallos, basically twice, so he never got out of sleeper's tomb here and i can't say first hand ;p but i imagine it would be a great thing to witness him in skyshrine killing everything and everyone, yelanik included.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It is just as forbidden for dragons of different colors to mate as it used to be for High Elves and Wood Elves to mate with humans. Vox and Nagafen are bound to their lairs for their indiscretion, and lore holds that Half Elves are shunned almost completely by both the High Elven and Wood Elven societies, and are forced to take refuge with whoever will provide them one. Wood Elves are, of course, more accepting of their Half Elf cousins, but are still a bit standoffish.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gabus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Vox and Naggy DO indeed say something when the sleeper is released, but Kera is NOT their offspring.<br />
<br />
As stated before, the sleeper is much older than Vox and Naggy, and the rules governing dragons of different colors getting freaky were put in place because of Kera. The rules were already written, which is why Vox and Naggy are imprisioned when we discover them.<br />
<br />
Vox and Naggy DO run a script when the sleeper is released, but it is more to the effect of how now that Kera is out, he will destroy the forces that keep them contained. (IE the ToV dragons) It is a side effect of the release. Not because they created them. (cause they did not) <br />
<br />
There is some good lore on the EQ official site, as well as the Role Playing Game books, which do a nice job of pulling the lore together in a cohesive fashion.</div></div><hr />
