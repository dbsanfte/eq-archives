  What mobs have you all found out there which have a chance to drop our spells that are rootable and non summoning?  Even if it takes 100 kills to see the spell, if it can be solo'd it is something to do while talking people into helping out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hordza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">From what iv seen, i dont think such a place exists in God :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">don't think you are going to be soloing your spells man =/....i have been one group farming the &quot;lair&quot;...zone in and check for named that are close to zone and lvl 65, if there aren't any zone out and get another...about the easiest thing i have found to do...though, i have yet to see a shaman spell drop.<br />
getting spells in this expansion is proving to be a PITA...although the twinks love the rott trial gear lol =p<br />
<br />
edit- i do say i don't know of any rootable/nonsumming mobs that drop spells, but there are serveral named mobs throughout god that can be rotted down.  even in some of the harder zones past the sewer trials.  if they drop spells or not i do not know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, I haven't had the opportunity yet to play with the mobs (doin that tonight), but judging from the lists of who drops what it seems there are a couple candidates who could be considered.   Sludge fly (somethin like that) should be about an even con, and they said hits 600s on a defensive warrior.   Long as he is straight melee that'd be doable given a relatively low Hp.<br />

  Will be risky of course, but I've done worse from time to time :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">using other threads around here I have found some spawn locations for static named mobs, and plan to work on spawning them solo if I can work out the pulls right.   I figure even if I can't solo kill it, I can DEFINATELY draw a group to me once a name is up and I link his non spell drops :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Korbis Catchaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Your magelo image is poorly punctuated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Never really paid attention to that, but it was designed by am Ikky monk, so you just have to be happy he didn't drawl on the Ssssss's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Solusek.Xtreem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">as far as loot goes...like loot to sell in bazaar....does the officiator in riwwi summon? doesnt even need to be rootable, can just send pet on it for agro....and can chain Q myself if i get agro....im wondering, does FA have much an effect on pets?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">focus/diaku/haste/fa+duel wield = pet is about as tough as he is going to get for soloing...FA adds dps, but the real dps comes from haste/duelweild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Been doing Ferubi lately.  Real dang hard to get the mobs singled out, and once you do, if root breaks there is a good chance you die.   But it is doable, and I have heard of people getting some nice items and even a spell as rare drops on junk mobs.  So working with that while I convince people to work on GoD with me.<br />
<br />
  My advice, don't touch the dogs.   Pretty hefty root break potential on them, plus they snare you and proc a 650DD.   Not nice stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">decided to lend a hand =)<br />

natimbi + qiniimi are pritty easy to root rot/tank.  they are lower lvl zones...i did try one of the roaming named in qinimi, and found him to be unrootable/unslowable...he pritty much raped me, and ran at sowish speed so i couldn't get away.  i didn't catch the name, but i talked to a guildy who has been PLing there.  he said there are occasionally 2 roaming named, and they both lay down a similar smackdown (i only tangoed with one personally.)<br />
<br />
i have done a bit of soloing in barindu, the xp is less than fanominal.  i did zone line from qinimi.  Once you figure it out the splits are easy, the pets don't hit to hard, and i only found one nonrootable mob type which are tankable since they slow.  unrootables hit similar to sol ro mobs, a little weaker.  there is a nice FT 2 ring that drops rare off one kind of trash mob in barindu.  I haven't tried the archer guys, but i did get a suprise attack from the named infront of the temple with access to the sewers.  he put me down REALY fast...  if the big blue guys are the same ones that are in the sewers (meaning unslowable/unrootable, shaman killers) i wouldn't mess with thim.<br />
<br />
i did try ferubi as well.  found pritty much similar results.  one root break = tough recovery.  single pulls were tough to come by as you have said.  If the dogs hit you with that snare it is over for you.  While there is some decent trash loot drops i don't think i will be going back solo.  the risk vs. reward is not there for soloing imo, but it is soloable.  the only place i found it safe to fight was at the zone in points, a lot of mobs see invis so traveling through the zone is out (due to see invis/mob density,) some stuff runs really fast, and i spent most of my time running away/dieing =p  XP was pritty decent here, i don't think it would be tough to convince a group to come xp since there are decent drops =)<br />
<br />
i did go back and try some of the trials...alas i forgot which were which in terms of mob difficulty...the fist and second trials are easiely soloable from what i recall(not sure about the named)...lair is tougher since mobs can midigate/beunrootable, they also hit a lot harder than the firt 2 trials.  i didn't try the other trial yet.<br />
<br />
i'll try to hit a few of the named i pass by solo or in groups to see if they are summoners/rootable, but i am not flagged past the sewers yet =p</div></div><hr />
