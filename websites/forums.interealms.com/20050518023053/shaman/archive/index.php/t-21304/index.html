<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sikulik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I havent posted to this message board in forever. Getting flamed by zorlac is a step below getting flamed by milman but I digress....<br />

<br />
I wonder if there would be an easy way to re-distribute the loot in all zones, just mix it up with level and difficulty appropriate mobs.<br />
Heck, I think it would be amazing to see things mixed up where different mobs were dropping spells or equipment that was formerly found in other zones, even changing the skin on the equipment would be a welcomed change. A sword turned into an axe, etc. etc. etc.<br />
<br />
Any one know what the feasability of this would be ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I don't think they need to do a wholesale switch but a little more randomness might make it interesting.  Say a random one chance in a thousand that something from a different loot table drops from any MoB.  <br />
<br />
I don't think we want to see ornate patterns dropping from moss snakes but maybe we could get something nice once in a while.  Definately want to leave the highly farmed MoBs out too.  Make this something for those of us who go a little out of the way.</div></div><hr />

They can dynamically change mob difficulty and loot tables on the fly.  Or maybe its just going to be my patented idea that I will make billions off of :D<br />
