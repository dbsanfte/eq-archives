<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shambler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has the buff extension aa/gear been working when you cast avatar on pets? It lasts 11minutes for me on players but only 6min 30sec on pets.</div></div><hr />

It seems that the last buff cast on your pet, shows as non-extended.  Cast say stamina on your pet after focus, and focus jumps to the extended time counter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shambler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks :)<br />
Avatar always is the last spell I cast on a pet... seing as I have to so often heh. Usualy the beast and mages pet.. usualy too lazy to add my own to a rotation, that or a melle class wants it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>melusina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I actually noticed this too, but realized that the timer will go to &quot;00:00&quot; in the buff window for pet, but the buff still seems to last longer (ie. it stays at &quot;00:00&quot; for awhile).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I noticed this tonight, too. My FA only showed 6:30 duration on my pet when cast, but I have SCRM and Eterninostrum buff extension focus. I didn't check to see if it actually did fade when timer expired.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Aye, its annoying.  Ive taken to casting CHA on my pet after Im finished buffing him so that I can get the real timers set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This is something I noticed a few days ago.  I swear Focus was lasting the full ext.  Then this morning, I put on several buffs on pet and all were basic duration.  Annoying and weird.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>jolav21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I did notice this as well. I do believe that they last the full duration though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ah, so that's why sometimes FA will last 5 or so more minutes after hitting 00:00, and other times it will leave as soon as it reaches 00:00.<br />
<br />
I noticed a couple days ago that when I singled fortitude on myself it lasted 118 minutes, but a warrior said it lasted 121 minutes on him. What's the deal? =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I often buff my pet if we're melee light in a casual group (Heh, why the hell not... it's not like I am running out of mana). It lasts the same 10+ minutes than it last on any other melee I cast it on. same for the pets of other casters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Peroxide</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks to the person that pointed me to this thread.  It appears there is just a sync issue between the server and home computer.  It may be a little bit more complicated than that but its what I have discovered so far.</div></div><hr />

I have always had this issue and its especially noticeable when you are playing 4 characters at once. I'll do a group buff like focus and it'll start wearing off some while there's still minutes remaining on others. The longer the buff, the more the difference. Mage DS which lasts about 15 min for example is usually off a few tics on any given character, but 2 hour buffs can be off up to 5 minutes or so.</div></div><hr />
