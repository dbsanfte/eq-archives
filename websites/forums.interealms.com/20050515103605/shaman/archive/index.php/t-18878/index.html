Use of this ability imbues your pet with a rabid bite. Additional ranks increase the damage caused by this attack<br />
<br />
<br />
Doesnt this pretty much destroy the Alpha Pet if used?<br />
Correct me if Im wrong but he only &quot;bites&quot; when hes not using weapon(s)<br />
<br />
So if we give him weapons, this ability is crap...<br />
If we dont give him weapons.. he hits less often?<br />
Is that right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shazgok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">He still bites when using Hand of Ixiblat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was going to say that Sony wasnt stupid enough to make the rabidbiteproc work only on bites, but then I read the list of AA's that they are offering and I cant say that anymore.<br />
<br />
Im going to go out on a limb and say that it will still work with an alpha pup.  The proc will be added to weapons.  I could be very very wrong, but thats what Im guessing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It depends on how pet procs are implemented I suppose. Some player classes have buffs which give them a proc, for example shadowknights' vampiric embrace. If pet procs are like this, they'll work with or without weapons.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I think the reason the pet &quot;bites&quot; with a Hand of Ixiblat is that the hand is a hand-to-hand weapon. Give him a 1HS and he slashes, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would assume that this is a pet proc buff, much like SK's get for thier pets. I would not think that it would be H2H only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually think about this -<br />
<br />
Rabid bear gives us the ability to proc &quot;tainted bite&quot; which is 35dd and a small dot. Even though it's a &quot;bite&quot; spell, it can still go off if we are using a weapon. If it wouldn't, it would be just silly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Beastlord, necro, and mage pets all still proc when using weapons.  I can think of no reason for ours to be any different.  I assume they worded it they way they did because it just sounds funny to hear about a wolf that can dual wield swords.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I am worried they may nerf alpha, and this aa is to make up for it. Not causing any rumour, its just a worry, and maybe totally unsubstantiated.</div></div><hr />
