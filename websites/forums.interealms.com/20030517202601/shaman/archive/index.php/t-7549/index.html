<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Iranicus Spellbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering if anyone has had luck getting the Chant rock of a Goblin Rockchanter in Mines of Nurga lately. About a month ago i cleared the place with a 60 monk friend and only got a blue and green chant rock. Second time around with a 60 Warriar friend we didnt even find one rockchanter. Was wondering if this part of the quest is broken now? Also if someone has a chant rock (tan in colour) and is selling on Terris Thule server iam willing to pay well for it thanx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Keep slaughtering those gobbies, friend.  It will drop.  I got my tan chant rock about 6 weeks ago, soon after the patch that fixed the Overseer spawn.  I think it's utterly random off any stonechanter, but if it's of any help, mine dropped off of a stonechanter in that large central room where the Overseer used to spawn before his spawn rate was fubard.  <br />
<br />
It still does drop though, just very rare.</div></div><hr />
