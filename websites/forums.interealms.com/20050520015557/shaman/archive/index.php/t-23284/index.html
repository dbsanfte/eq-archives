<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>dennman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings!<br />
<br />
My guild Clan Ta Veren on Terris Thule (http://www.clantaveren.com/) is looking for a few good shamans. Currently we have 2 “full time” and 2 “casual” shaman but the two full time players are getting busy in RL so there have been raids without shaman support. While I am not an officer I would like to see my guild get the proper shaman support even if I can’t be online. <br />
<br />
We are a raiding guild that is working in the Tacvi zone at this point. Our usual raid times are 4-11PM PST on weekdays and longer on weekends. We love good challenges and progression but yet we take of our own people (we did A LOT of backflagging raids) Loots are distributed on a DKP system and raids are mandatory, as in you can’t log off and play a toon just because the mob doesn’t drop any loots that interest you. <br />
<br />
Requirements:<br />
First of all we are looking for people with HIGH playtime. You HAVE to be level 65 with at least about 100+AA’s. More requirement details can be seen in http://www.clantaveren.com/join.htm<br />
<br />
Ideally you should be at least Kod Tav flagged, since you should be motivated enough to have the 6 one-group trials done. Cross-server applications are accepted but only the exceptional ones will be considered. <br />
<br />
Attitude:<br />
From our page: The most important thing we expect from our applicants is a positive and proactive attitude. We are looking for players that will make an impact in the guild -- highly motivated self starters who realize their enjoyment of the game is ultimately in their hands. We are looking for players who love their class and enjoy playing it in a raid environment. Also, at the level that we play, you will die. A lot. If you are not willing to beat the learning curve of new encounters, and stick to it until the challenge is defeated, this is not the guild for you.<br />
<br />
While we are proud of our accomplishments, we prefer to keep things to ourselves. If you like to shout things like “look at me I am super l33t!” or have the impressions that guild chat must be filled with obscenities, we are probably not compatible with each other.  <br />
<br />
That’s all I can think of now. If you are interested please feel free to apply via our site. Or if you have any questions, please /tell me in game or email me at abcxyz@gmail.com.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time.</div></div><hr />
