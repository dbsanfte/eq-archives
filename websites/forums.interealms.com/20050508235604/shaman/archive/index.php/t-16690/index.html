<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Recently my guilds has began doing VP keys (not really my guild, more like a few bored warriors etc etc).<br />
<br />
Anyway it got me thinking, is VP still worth gonig to for the effort put into farming the keys? atm we're only vindi level killing UP mobs, Xanamech etc etc but moving onto AoW fairly soon meaning a whole new load of raiding places will be open to us. You have to also take into consideration NToV on AB is on a rotar, which is i beleive atm every 8 weeks for the current guilds there to raid it. <br />
<br />
Personally i would think that Ssra is a bit of a replacement for VP (starting there soon) so is VP pointless now? <br />
<br />
Opinions please.</div></div><hr />

The question would be would you enjoy it personally I have never been to VP but I think we should all try to expirence what ever content we can but that is my 2cp</div></div><hr />

<br />
I remember when FoH(sp?) broke VP first and how uber it was back in the day :) Would be a blast to do it for fun and nostalgia.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Go to some spoiler sites and look at the loot lists for the mobs. I have a suspicion that there will be very few items anyone really wants. The weapons from VP were the high end stuff in the Kunark era - and are outclassed by bazaar drops nowadays. I always here about wizards wanting the robe out of VP (right clicks Rend?) but even that probably isn't worth much any more, at least not to a L 65 wizard with decent gear and most of his spells. I'd take a serious look at the item drops before putting any effort into getting a VP key. <br />
<br />
Personally, I don't think it's worth it, and haven't for a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you need to farm level 60 spells, it's the place to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Graal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Overall VP is a much better zone than it was originally.  The respawn of yard trash is closer to normal now rather than the 2 minutes it used to be.  Level 59-60 spells drop often enough from the Guardian Wurms that they are a good source of cash if you get the right ones.  There are even a few drops from the dragons that are not completely obsolete.<br />
<br />
Shroud of Veeshan (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=3555) <br />
<br />
Spear of Constriction (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6644) <br />
<br />
I am sure there are a couple of others.  All in all VP is a fun little crawl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grimdreg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I really believe that Veeshan's Peak needs to be unlocked.  If you can just zone into Plane of Valor, Crypt of Decay, or for hilarious contrast, Temple of Veeshan, there's no reason to keep Veeshan's peak locked with an absurdly long and involved key quest.  I'd bet the farm that VP is the least used zone in the game simply because its not worth the time to get a key to get in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i retired before VP upgrade (there was one, wasnt there? i remember something about that).. so if my info is wrong, then so be it..<br />
<br />
VP is great, you can get snare spears, 60 spells, and a few fairly decent drops.. i wouldnt pass it by, especially since no one ever goes there</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There's a few decent drops there, and a whole lotta crap.<br />
We saw things like 11/20 piercers and 40/44 2h slashers drop and there was some neck thing for priest/int casters with just stats and no hp/mana on it.<br />
<br />
There are a few very very good items though.<br />
Rend robe is one.<br />
Sow sword is another.<br />
Snare pokey is another.<br />
Rangers can find a use for that sword that procs the 600 or so DD (good for Emp and Seru).<br />
There's a &quot;nerfed nerf stick&quot; for monks.  It's some 2h blunt that you have to equip :( that casts dispel magic.  Awesome pulling tool.  (The REAL nerf stick drops off Vulak that can be cast from inventory and has an insanely useful effect that strips only beneficial effects from mobs).<br />
I think there's a few more items that are worth mentioning I think, but I can't recall which they are at the moment.<br />
<br />
Also, something we ran across when my guild went there about a month and a half ago was a random named wurm that dropped some plate pants with about 45 or 55 hps and similar mana and about 25ac or so.  It was tradable too.  I wonder how many more named mobs there are.<br />
<br />
Oh, and something that seems to have been fixed/changed in there is that Hoshkar and Silverwing no longer seem to wander.  They can be pulled just the same, but now you don't have to worry about them gating if you choose to fight them on their spawn location.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">didn't they pull the rend robe from the drop table?<br />
<br />
VP was kinda fun, but it was REALLY hard to motivate people to get keyed, and I don't think we've gone back since we cleared it the first time.<br />
<br />
The loot isn't really worth the effort but it's fun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Also, if you are wondering how tough VP is... it's not tough.<br />
The yard trash hits for about 600.<br />
If you can handle hunting in PoV, you can handle the yard trash in VP.<br />
The named hit for up to about 800.<br />
Don't try slowing them as they usually bounce just about every magic and disease related spell.<br />
Just heal the main tank or anyone who's taking a beating.<br />
They have annoying AE effects that can easily be overcome with proper resist gear and bringing a bard for resists.<br />
I don't even think they rampage or flurry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">VP is a treasure trove for spells. They literally drop like candy. The ones I notice the most are the cleric group heals which seem to be pretty rare elsewhere.<br />
<br />
And there are numerous items still in VP that you cannot get anywhere else. Shaman snare spear, PE hammer, 41% haste slippers melee dont want, 100 HP robes. And the fun thing is that they are not rare drops like most other zone drops are. Last time I was in VP, Silverwing dropped not 1, not 2 but THREE PE hammers. And I was there on my rogue... LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">For the effort involved in the key quest, I would say VP isn't worth<br />
it. I took a couple of groups in there months ago. We'd get one or<br />
two sellable spells per night. It just isn't worth the hours/weeks<br />
spent camping the pieces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brodda Thep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">No.  It is not worth it.  These people are insane.  You will waste valuable time doing VP key quests when you should be AAing or working on Emp keys.  You would be insane and suicidal as a guild to make keying up for VP a priority.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It isn't always about the loot.  VP is something different you can do on offnights that's never contested, and now that you can gate/port out it's a lot easier to leave if you decide you can't get all the way through</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Walgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hell I for one would love that snare spear. :)<br />
<br />
I think for people that are looking for the fun factor rather than the phat loot/xp side of things, VP is still viable.  Sure the key quest sucks, but once that is out of the way, could be good for people that are bored. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If unlike 99.99% of the current EQ population your motivation is not sorely on advancement and loot lust then go for it, its a pretty cool zone, has that exclusive feel about it and is one place many people wont ever see.<br />
<br />
edit : I destroyed my VP key after zoning in and it being added to the keyring right after it was introduced. A few weeks later I tried to zone in and couldnt,only then I noticed the key had poofed from my list and the GMS wouldnt give me another. Gutted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Besides which, with a good bard...<br />
<br />
You can 1 group anything in VP.  Granted you need an above average group, but not an &quot;uber&quot; group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">My guild was requesting that people get keyed for VP a few months ago.  Was made a guild 'mission'.  I personally refused because I thought it a waste of time, but we did have about 9 or 10 people actually finish a key.  The result?  There is none.  I dont even thing the people that got keys ever went.  Yet they all wasted hours getting they keys together.  Oh well..more magelo eye candy for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Looking back on it, I think I spent more time on<br />
that damn key quest, then I did actually inside<br />
VP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Wampaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Does anyone know where I can find a nice VP guide? Some of us in my guild got our keys just for the fun of it. We have about 15 keyed and will be going soon. I Havent been able to find a good guide. Mostly a few paragraphs about the old VP before the revamp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">My guild was requesting that people get keyed for VP a few months ago. Was made a guild 'mission'. I personally refused because I thought it a waste of timeWith guildmates like you, who needs enemies? The guild made it a mission priority and you refused... How nice.<br />
<br />
VP is not going to make your guild uber. But its fun, fast paced, and there are useful items that drop there that cannot be had anywhere else. And there still are items dropping that non-elemental guilds will find to be of high quality. Getting your clerics the group heals will definately help your guild as you get into more and more of the encounters with the nasty AEs. Shaman &quot;rares&quot; drop there. And so many others. Yes, many are quite common in todays game, but you will get some good spells every trip if you clear the dragons.<br />
<br />
If you put your mind to it, and you have your guild helping, you can complete VP keys for your entire guild within a month. And the only reason it would take that long is because you need teeth from Trakanon, and I would assume you wouldnt get him every spawn. Other than the trak tooth and the drop from the skelly in Karnors, the quest is easily soloable by level 60 players.<br />
<br />
I've done the quest for both of my toons, and both have items that they still carry at all times from VP. And there are still a few more things I would like to get each of them from there. We dont go often, but its definately nice a change of pace when we do go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">dont forget the green scale that drops from hoshkar. that always can fetch a pretty penny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sherah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Given the npc's you are currently killing, ssra isn't a good replacement or next step...doesn't sound like anyway.  People tend to underestimate Ssra.  You need grc (bard cursed song helps a lot) and good dps not to forget becoming highly competitive.  So probably out of ssra, you can start nailing the rhags/AL cycle and see how you stand up.  If you can't kill the AL decently, then you need to take a step back.  Basically mobs don't stay up long on most servers in Ssra...so going for ST/Ntov route gets you in the groove for competing and nets you some real nice weapons/gear you need to make ssra happen.<br />
<br />
Camping zlandi/klandi/lendi (good to have a cov coh mage) wasn't too bad..we didn't get into kael all that much and so that is how we keyed up..and on some servers, sonty is up a lot.  Once you get into ST, you can primal up and your dps will skyrocket and ssra would be more feasible.  Camping a mage in the ST tunnel prior to the FA/dragons helps gear you up much faster (the first two or 3 named in ST drop very few primals compared to the ones further in) and for the most part can take the place of NTOV loot if you go this route.  By the time my guild was done with ST, most of NTOV loot was rotting after our 4th raid.  Having this gear enables you to do more with less ppl and therefore will increase your competitive edge in Ssra.  Your guild has to want this though and be very focused.<br />
