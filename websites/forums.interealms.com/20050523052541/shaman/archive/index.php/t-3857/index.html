<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A long time ago the world seemed big and wonderful, around every corner you took a new and dangerous beast was lurking. Dungeons where places filled with great danger and many wonders. I will never forget my first trip into Kurns Tower and how amazed I was, how big the place seemed and I remember that I could not wait to go back there. (even today I really like the way Kurns is set up) Some time later I entered Lake of Ill Omen for the first time and I just stood for like 10 minutes at the waterside watching the water, the sunset and the little river. Then I explored Warslik woods and battled the giants in it. I wandered into the Overthere and very very scared I took the wreck that transports you to “the old world” (calling it a ship is to much credit for it). And so I explored and grew in power, but no matter what you did there was always a new corner to take, a new danger to battle and new dungeons to explore. But alas all good things come to an end and soon the last corner was rounded and only the most remote and inaccessible dungeons where left to explore. Then I joined a fledgling raiding guild and we started to explore the places a pick-up group will never visit (at least not back in those days). Hate, Fear and Air where the places my raiding skills where trained and later the RoK dragons and even later the giants in Kael. But after a while all that was left was a mindless grind for more loot in a place that proved no real danger to the raid anymore.<br />
<br />
And that brings us to today.<br />
<br />
Now I am a member of a decent guild (some would rate us even as an uber guild but well that is a matter of definition), we are capable of killing almost any mob in the game and the few mobs we have not (yet) killed are just out of reach due to artificial restrictions (Hi boring key camps in Luclin) and recently it seems that every raid is just like a mindless repetition of old tricks. No matter what mob you take it al comes down to learning how to adapt to the trick they use and when that is understood the farming can begin. Please do not understand me wrong, the process of learning how to deal with a mob is one of the most fun parts Everquest has to offer (at least for me) and during those “learning” raids I enjoy myself (even we have to summon all corpses for the 3rd time that day or we have a strategy discussion for an hour)<br />
So I just wondered why VI never made the boss mobs more variable. Why not have like 2 or 3 versions with different skills available for spawning so that you never know if you face a rooted, unslowable, pure melee mob or that you have to face a mobile, slowable but spell casting mob. In my view this would increase the challenge of the encounter.<br />
<br />
So my questions to you are:<br />
<br />
Do you have the same feelings about the current high end content that I have? (and then I am not talking about the level of the loot those mobs drop but just about the battle they offer)<br />
Do you think that adding more variation in the mob can solve this?<br />
Or do you think that by design Everquest is loot focused and this is a lost cause?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I only have one thing to say about that:  AARY<br />
<br />
Every time we have to kill this mob, I tremble in anticipation.  Shammy's are KEY to the success of this one, and his mana-stealing AoE makes for a VERY challenging fight.  Add to the mix that you can't kill him before the little chickens respawn, and it's an all-out good time for all!  If we win the battle, the Bear Patrol gets the major Kudos on it and if we don't then we regroup and try again!  Always love this fight!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Um, yes.<br />
<br />
I took about 2 months off cause I moved and had to wait for my DSL to get reconnected and when I came back I found I had a hard time getting motivated to play.  My guild has done everything except NToV and the 4-armed bandit temple and I have found that I am a bit burned out.<br />
<br />
However,<br />
<br />
I have found a few encounters that I enjoy a great deal.  Scripted events are alot of fun,  I like being able to decide when the encounter takes place and it's cool to be apart of an event.  Examples are Chanter room in KD,  ring war in GD, and there are many others.<br />
<br />
One question is what you enjoy on a raid.  I know that some guilds like to try and see how few people they can use to kill a uber MoB instead of Zerg tactics.  <br />
<br />
Variable MoBs require more memory unfortunatly so I dont think that your suggestion is plauseable even though I think it is a good idea.  Besides after a while people will get so used to the 3 types of the same MoB we will be right back where we started with people getting bored with encounters.<br />
<br />
I think the only real answer is new content.  That way the game stays fresh.  Myself,  I have no problems with the enounter content but then I havent done it all yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloobonious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">But even Aaryonar eventually boils down to a CH rotation.<br />
<br />
Yes, it is unfortunate that most fights are this way. But really, how &quot;different&quot; can  Verant get without pushing it beyond the limits of the game engine? NPC's are very limited in what they can do overall. Truth be told, there is quite a bit of variety in the ubermob engagements. Yet even then, they all boil down to the same tactic, which has the same reliance on Clerics and Warriors.<br />
<br />
I honestly wish that Shamans had a more potent role besides slowing and buffing. Especially on mobs that are completely unslowable. IE: for the Avatar of War, after buffing, I just sort of sit around tossing in weak heals during transitions, torporing casters who Mod Rod, and landing a few ice nukes on him. Really, I'm not doing much.<br />
<br />
In the long run, I too miss the &quot;challenge around every corner&quot; feeling that I had in my younger days.&quot; I know that when my guild finally hits up Ssrazera Temple for key camps, it will be the same type of engagements. The Emperor Too will probably boil down to this. Heck, not that I know much about it, but I am sure Vex Thal has the same tactics. It's very disheartening to know exactly what advancement you have left to do in the game, compared to back when I was level 30 in South Karana, in which dozens of doors were just opening up to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think VI added a lot of variation with some of the boss mobs in Luclin and working out new strategies to defeat them has been fun. High Priest and Cursed in Ssra, Shei in Akheva, and Ring of Fire in Acrylia all require a lot more than the standard Velious MT and CH chain strategy.<br />
<br />
Also in a keyed zone and not currently in game (/rude VI) is the script that leads up to Tashakhi which is honestly a very fun raid and totally different than anything else I've seen even if the loot was subpar before it was removed for retuning for three months (/rude /rude VI).<br />
<br />
I'm expecting quite a bit more unique boss fights with the planar bosses in PoP.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sure, once you figure out your strategy for a mob, you *can* do it the same way the next time (until Verant decides to change it, which they do). But..especially with Luclin, there are a lot of different strategies to work out. It's not just insert uber warrior + 15 clerics, rinse lather repeat. Yes you need them, but you also need a strategy that makes the fight doable.<br />
<br />
If you're bored with the fights your doing, I would suggest trying to do some new mobs instead of farming the crap out of the old ones. <br />
<br />
Just my 2c,<br />

<br />
I totaly agree.  If you join a guild well after an expansion, or you wait till all the strats are everywhere, the yeah i guess its boring.  But if you are the ones to figure out how to do things first, then its cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Snacko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The high end game has some fairly inventive fights now really.  Emperor Ssrae, High Priest, Shei Vinitras are all fairly different from your normal uber encounters.<br />
<br />
Not all encounters boil down to a CH rotation, but most all of them have at least a small rotation as a 'part' of the system. <br />
<br />
However, with the listed encounters above...if other people fail at their job a CH rotation is moot, because you're all dead anyways.<br />
<br />
Fights where you have to deal with more then 1 monster at once seems to be the direction VI with large encounters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ezeekial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">if you havent tried the 10th ring war, or the Ring of Fire/Slime, that might just be what your looking for. i think those are a blast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Let me explain what bothers me a bit more.<br />
Even when looking at all the high end mobs in Luclin and the tricks they use in the end it is all still a cheal rotation.<br />
Most have some trick you have to figure out but once that is done all that is left is endless repetition.<br />
<br />
Now if you compare that to a random spawn mob you will see that at least in some zones you can get a different type of mob at the same spot. Imo it would help to delay the boredom to have that also apply to end game mobs.<br />
<br />
And I agree Ezeekial the well done event type of encounter is a lot of fun to do (Ring war and burrower).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Why not get together a small group of travelers and head to Cazic?  No CHeal rotation, no sitting on your butt the majority of the time casting maybe one or two spells and sitting back down.<br />
<br />
Get a group of good friends, and go explore.  With only one group you will find a ton of different and varying challenges that have nothing to do with Ubermob_13359.  Check out some quests, check out every zone. There is a lot more to this game than just raiding imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">CH rotation doesn't work on any high end mob if the Shammy's don't stick the slow (if it's slowable).  High end dragons take at least 5 clerics doing the rotation right to keep the MA alive, but only 2 shammy's who got the skillz to land the debuffs.  That's very entertaining when that's all you got on the raid, and it's all up to you.<br />
<br />
And on unslowable mobs like AoW, I'm assigned to debuff it and then act as cleric for a non-melee group like wizzies, with Torpor.  Even when they're not slowable, I'm usually busy dropping epics on them or giving people the only 100% reliable cure in the game.  And some of the 'unslowable mobs,&quot; aint.  I've dropped Plague of Insects on some of these, the only ones I have given up on give immunitiy messages or are completely mr and dr like AoW.</div></div><hr />
