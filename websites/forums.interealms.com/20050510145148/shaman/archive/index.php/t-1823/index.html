<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Congrats!  Now that I've broken 50, I'm seriously beginning to think about the epic myself.  Five Kims... *shudder*... maybe I'll wait another level or two.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>dominan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Gratz on you epic.<br />
<br />
Hey Big, shammy epic ain't that tough since it's faction base. I got mine at level 48 without guild support. I just have a level 48 friend that help me do woe/envy turn in over and over. And we kill HGs in the meanwhile (2 hour spawns). I just load up 1 set for monk, 1 set for shammy, and 1 set for my druid toon. And go track and turn in the stuff in WK. I think i did like 4 or 5 runs with 3 set each time. And made around 5 to 7k from killing in rathe.<br />
Anyways, i maxed faction and asking /who 55 60 sham for an extra tear for MQ. I got 3 replies with tears and i offered 5k for the MQ. Anyways, he wanted 7k and brought a few friends (mages) for rek, and Got my epic that night.  I think did the epic in about 4 or 5 days guildless. Kinda cheating tho, but I wanted my epic ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">dominan:  Any idea how much the dire wolf pelt turnin increases faction relative to the woe/envy turnin?  I've been thinking of repeating the dire wolf step (assuming I could dual it with my level 60 warrior bro) because I thought it returned much more faction than the woe/envy step.  I've never heard of anyone maxing faction with just woe/envy - kind of encouraging to know it can be done.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Congrats kaalisti<br />
<br />
Bigguss, don't be discouraged, you will get it eventually.<br />
<br />
Dominan..........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Congrats on your epic! <br />
<br />
Quick question I had for Dominan or anyone who can answer. If you do a MQ with the tear, is there any reason to have max ally faction to kill Rak? From what I can tell, a shaman with epic gives in the tear and he agro's rak, you loot the scale. At that point you would need Max ally to turn the scale into the spirit correct? Sorry to steal the thread, but reading this only increases the bug in me for epic :D<br />
<br />
Congratulations again Kaal!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>dominan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Humbert: Yeah, you only need maxed faction for the scale turn in.. but the shammy that MQ needs to have maxed when turning in tear.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, I'm in no way suggesting that people do their epic this way. It was just how I did it because my old guild disbanded and I'm guildless.</div></div><hr />
