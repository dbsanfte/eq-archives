<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sekin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">(Sorry made a mistake here...this was supposed to be a reply...anyway the named golem below was the one at RCoD...one of the nameds at the 4 ways camp)<br />
<br />
I did manage to kill the named golem solo once with self buffs and V (8K hp no C) and I got a glowing rune. It was an extremely lucky fight.<br />
<br />
I have the L69 dot, ET5, BA5, aa dot crit at max level (level 6?) and what I did was: pull with malos, immediately click ornate pants, slow, spiritual calls, Q myself, bane+BoS+BoY, (got summoned), click epic 1.5, heal myself, repeat bane+BoS+BoY, more heals...finally killed it with 3rd set of bane+BoS+BoY.<br />
<br />
Didn't dare to Canni5 during the entire fight...was just using the L68 canni when my hp was above 80%. 5% mana left when the fight was over.</div></div><hr />

I was facing him with the cliff wall to my right...just a few steps down from his spawn spot.</div></div><hr />

Hmm, I had thought that the static Noc spawn would add there.  When I 3 box there (Ranger/Shaman/Mage) the only thing I fear is pulling a Noc.  Those SoBs will surprise you.  I wish I had discovered RCoD earlier.  But as it is, i've pulled more PP out of there then I will ever need.</div></div><hr />
