<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It seems like the SoE developers are listening to feedback and addressing our concerns recently.  Perhaps we should keep a regular thread going to track any remaining or new issues we'd like addressed next time they're looking at shaman issues?  That way when SoE surveys the various class boards for feedback/issues, there's something there for them at their fingertips.<br />
<br />
Here's a crack at such a list:<br />
<br />
************ Class Balance Issues *************<br />
<br />
Healing and Slow Mitigation<br />
<br />
Having such an exceptionally good slow spell may have justified giving shamans a &quot;complete&quot; heal which heals less damage for the same mana and casting time than the druid version.  Yet with slow mitigation, the advantage in slowing has been drastically reduced, with several other classes (including melees using weapons proccing slows) able to provide a slow spell which when mitigated yields a very similar result to that of shamans.  Since the slows are less of an advantage than they were, perhaps it's time to take a look at increasing the cap on Kragg's mending to be something closer to 3000hp?<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't think that slow mitigation is causing shamans to lose out on xp groups, so I don't really view this as a huge class balance issue.  But if other shamans do, then we could try to express their concerns here.<br />
<br />
Shaman Melee Skills<br />
<br />
Some of us thought we were rolling up a &quot;battle priest&quot; when we created our shamans.  Yet shaman melee is a total joke.  It's nearly unusable.  Clerics are clearly the superior of the shaman in melee and are the real battle priests now.  Not that clerics are going to be meleeing all that much either.  It would be really nice to be able to get a good weapon and not feel silly actually using it once in a while.<br />
<br />
Why a goofy little frog cleric can shield bash for more than a giant ogre shaman is a question which is in sore need of an answer.<br />
<br />
Having rabid bear in its current incarnation as an AA skill just rubs the dismal state of shaman melee skills in our faces.  And wasting another AA skill on an enhancement to this silly skill defies all reason.<br />
<br />
King of Stat Buffs?<br />
<br />
Being the king of stat buffing is a dubious honor at best given how small an effect most stats have.  Yet sadly, a large portion of the shaman spell lineup has been dedicated to stat buffs.  Some nice progress recognizing the low value of these buffs has come in recently in the form of very nice replacement spells for some relatively useless 63-64 stat buffs.  A continuation of this sort of progress would be most appreciated.<br />
<br />
It has been suggested several times that minor &quot;direct&quot; improvements be added to some of the stat buff lines that shamans get, making them have an effect more in line with what may have been intended when the lines were first developed.  Add a minor +ATK to STR buffs.  Add some minor +AC to AGI buffs.  Perhaps add a -FIZZLE or +ARCHERY to DEX.  And perhaps a -AGRO to CHA.<br />
<br />
************ Quest Related Issues *************<br />
<br />
Symbols of the Tribunal<br />
<br />
There are a lot of barbarian shamans still wondering where the disciple and regent symbols of the tribunal are.  The other shaman gods reward their loyal shamans with a nice out-of-class ability for their loyalty.  Tribunal worshipers would love to be able to prove their dedication similarly and be rewarded in kind.<br />
<br />
Broken Arrow from Epic<br />
<br />
I for one would love to have confirmation from SoE that this piece from our epic quest is either part of an unsolved quest, so we can get ourselves motivated to solve it.  Or is just junk of some kind.  At the moment, most every shaman believes it's either total junk or that that part of the quest is broken.  If it's part of an unsolved quest, a tiny bit of encouragement from SoE may get the shaman community re-energized to take another look.<br />
<br />
************ Spell Related Issues *************<br />
<br />
Rarity of Kunark Spells<br />
<br />
Hopefully, the absurd rarity of Torpor and Malo has been adequately addressed by the new priest spell research given to INT casters.  This remains to be seen.<br />
<br />
Spirit Quickening<br />
<br />
This spell appears to be entirely useless.  If the shaman community is somehow mistaken about this spell, some hint from SoE would be most appreciated.  If in fact this spell is as useless as log parses have seemed to indicate, then an upgrade to fix it or a replacement spell would be most appreciated.<br />
<br />
************ Alchemy Related Issues *************<br />
<br />
Cost of Ingredients<br />
<br />
The last expansion had some nice improvements for alchemy.  However most potions still remain too expensive to be viable.  Most of us feel that a cross the board reduction in herb costs would open up a number of potions as reasonable things for shamans to actually bother making.  Currently, many of our potions are simply to expensive to bother with.<br />
<br />
Resale of Potions<br />
<br />
Skilling up Alchemy is extraordinarily expensive, since venders don't value potions any more than most other players do.  An improvement to vender buyback prices for potions would open up alchemy for the less wealthy shamans.<br />
<br />
PoP Alchemy<br />
<br />
PoP brought a lot of very nice recipes for most trade skills.  Yet Alchemy received only one recipe.  And it's for something that only magicians need.  It would be nice if Alchemy felt like it was being treated with even a fraction of the care that the other tradeskills are receiving.<br />
<br />
************ Brainstorming *************<br />
<br />
This section is in case SoE needs some ideas from the shaman community of things which we feel would enhance our experience without grossly changing game balance.  If we never get any of this stuff, no big deal, but this section is where we put our requests for things that would make common activities easier for us, taking some of the grind out of the game, leaving more time for fun.<br />
<br />
Minor PBAoE spell<br />
<br />
Many of us would like some minor form of PBAoE spell.  Nothing spectacular enough to alter game balance.  Perhaps something like a 20% slow spell?  Or a pbaoe version of one of our weaker DoTs (scourge?)<br />
<br />
Maybe some NODROP or NORENT potions with more powerful effects?<br />
<br />
Curses<br />
<br />
In at least a few of the past threads similar to this one, there were suggestions that shamans should transition from being the masters of stat buffs to the masters of curses.  Curses to increase casting time, fizzle rates, reduce melee damage, reduce ATK, etc. would be most welcome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nah, everyone deleted their broken arrow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Graal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Add Symbol of Rallos Zek which also stopped after one quest.  Or you can be completist and add Symbol of Marr and Symbol of Catnip since the frogs and cats dont have any symbols at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>icebain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have always acted as an Advisor to my guild and friends, don't Call me sad (go on i dare you!) But i would love some Spells or abilities that gather information. for example the LB DB W Y R system is far too simple (especaily at high levels) being able to gather a bit more information on a target would be fun. yeah it would lead to that information being passed onto the rest of the world via forums like this but would that be so bad ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Give group shrink a confirmation box like TL and make it able to be cast on other groups and MGBable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think the biggest 'problem' with shamans is obvious. Classes are supposed to be really good at one or more things. Often one class is equally as good as another at one thing, but both have specialities. Clerics HP buff and Heal. There are other classes that heal, and others that HP buff. But none come close to cleric's. Enchanters haste, so do shamans, but they have great mana regen spells that nobody else gets.<br />
<br />
However the shaman has 2 categories in his little specialization niche... slowing and stat buffs. The class superiority in slowing continuously is blurred as classes like beastlords and enchanters come within 5 or 10% of our slowing ability. This could be considered like the enchanter haste, or cleric hp buffs. Nobody else has stat buffs close to ours, and that is where we are really strong. But the problem is stat buffs suck ass.<br />
<br />
We need another class specialization.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Nice thought, but I seriously doubt anything will be done about it.  Let's give SOE some time before we bring it up. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I will join a cause on Alchemy... for consumables the cost is way way way way way... way to high.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Iksar Shaman (Cazic Thule) don't have a Symbol quest to my knowledge.  But then, we do have the easiest route to get the SkyIron Cudgel of the Ancients.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>sorsisis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Id love to see shaman melee skills get better, something along the lines of double attack maybe would be nice.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Genine Goosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I always wished we could get our dodge higher. Maybe an AA similar to the bind wound one. Allow us to up our dodge skill a certain % for each level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You lost me with the silliness about the broken arrow.<br />
After that, I didn't bother reading the rest.<br />
Old gripes, rehashed.  <br />
We already got them to do all they will do for now.  You can quote me on that.  <br />
If any shaman-enhancing changes go in from this date, they will be for all casters or all classes.  <br />
<br />
I've fought long and hard for the improvements we did get.  But every warrior has his limits.  Like Chief Joseph of the Sioux Indians said when confronted with the grossly unfair situation in which his tribe had been placed, &quot;I will fight no more, forever.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Stuff missing from list:<br />
- Ridiculous aggro from poison DoTs.<br />
- No DoT related AA skills.<br />
- Poison nuke upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I agree that it would be kind of fun to see something like the curse line, and perhaps make some potions more viable sellers.  The new gate potions are really cool and all but not many are willing to pay 200pp for a gate to bind, especially when you can get that talisman from PoP.  It would be really cool to make Damage shield potions and stuff like mystical apititude for a reasonable price.  The price to get alchemy isn't really that bad.  Perhaps I just got lucky but I got it up from about 42 to 180 with about 6-7k.  Thats not including the various illusion potions I made, they really aren't big sellers any more as of right now on my server :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Im content</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Healing and Slow Mitigation<br />
<br />
I think our heals and slow mitigation are just fine personally, we have gotten several nice heals over the years. In your post you sight how our slows are less and less needed with weapons that proc a slow, what group in there right mind wouldent take a shaman because they &quot;Got a epiced ranger already&quot; There fine, Slow is the king of PoP and will remain that way.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shaman Melee Skills<br />
<br />
Start a BL. Your just grassping for stuff to bitch about.<br />
<br />
Rabid Bear? I will comment the same way I comment on alchemy, don't like it, don't use it PERIOD<br />
<br />
King of Stat Buffs?<br />
<br />
You seem to sight shamans as being the best at 3 diffrent things, and then are bitching when someone else comes withing 80% of our power on one of them. <br />
<br />
************ Quest Related Issues *************<br />
<br />
Symbols of the Tribunal<br />
<br />
I won't comment, I whave no experince on the issue.<br />
<br />
Broken Arrow from Epic<br />
<br />
I honetly camp belive your commenting on this. Delete it and shush.<br />
<br />
************ Spell Related Issues *************<br />
<br />
Rarity of Kunark Spells<br />
<br />
These are some amazing spells lets not forget that, torpor and malo are incredible, there is no denying it, its because of that reson they don't just put them for sale in PoK. Besides your constant bitching got them researchable, if you bitch about something till you get it you usally stop bitching when you get it.<br />
<br />
Spirit Quickening<br />
<br />
Every class has worthless spells, suck it up and move on. Its not like your getting this instead of another spell on a parchment turn in.<br />
Go look at the spell Greater Decession for wizzards, they get that from a glyphed rune turn in. You will see how silly your request seems.<br />
<br />
************ Alchemy Related Issues *************<br />
<br />
Let me just say one thing on the subject.<br />
Alchemy is in no way a necessary skill, its not needed for anything except for use by other players. Off the top of my head I can think of maybe 2 quests that require an alchemy combine, IF YOU DON'T LIKE HOW ALCHEMY IS SET UP DON'T DO IT!! IT'S NOT NECESSARY. Your never going to get refussed from a group because your alchemy skill is low.<br />
<br />
************ Brainstorming *************<br />
<br />
<br />
Minor PBAoE spell<br />
<br />
Shamans don't need aoe spells. We are not a class designed to deal with crowds.<br />
<br />
-----------------<br />
<br />
Final Thought.<br />
Just because shamans arnt the master of 20 diffrent things anymore dosent make them worthlesss. You will still get exp groups, your still needed on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">&quot;Like Chief Joseph of the Sioux Indians&quot;<br />
<br />
Chief Joseph was a Nez Pierce.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>glydor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">i couldnt agree with you more penny antics</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I want Feign Death! That'd balance out the shaman completely!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The biggest problem in my eyes is that slowing is utterly essential if you want to kill in pop, its not fair for us to keep the lead in slowing that we once had.  Other classes had to catch up with us (and they did in a very big way).<br />
<br />
Personally, in an xp group setting, we are slightly ahead of enchanters, but not by much at all now.<br />
<br />
Which leaves us with what?  Stat buffs of which only 1 is any use?<br />
<br />
Its like being the best arse flutist in the world, yay grats for you etc, but it doesnt actually achive much appart from making people go 'oooh' for a few minutes.<br />
<br />
Oh and as for melee, tbh I'd quite like to be able to melee for a damn again without killing myself to ripostes, why?  Because melee is often all I can do on raids these days.</div></div><hr />
