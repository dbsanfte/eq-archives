<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>tinysun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i'm not in a big guild, dont' have many friends in game,not high lv.<br />
<br />
with a small group of friends i attempted to get sow boot for quite a few times.and i got it  nights ago.so just want to share how i did that.perhaps some of you might find this useful.<br />
<br />
group was 53 shaman(me),53 monk,54 cleric,51 warrior,50 sk.<br />
<br />
i really did tried many ways to do it,but i'll just tell you how the succeed attempt goes.<br />
<br />
1.clear the valley with bloodwolves,there are a few DE and 2 garg that will arggo on you.main force set up here.<br />
<br />
2.get my monk tp train adviosr(and 10+ DE) down to the valley,kill them all while we leave adviosr alone.just let him hit our tanks.no biggie after slowed.<br />
<br />
3.casters med up while melee keep the bloodwolves killed upon spawn.<br />
<br />
4. when we're set ,trigger black dire and kill him, at lv 53 my first cast was malosi,got resisted but slow landed without it.it's very easy kill after it's slowed, but before slow landed it drop my monk from full to half hp in around 10 secs( then my monk use all-ripost disc)<br />
<br />
<br />
i think it's actually doable with a shaman,druid and a tank.just with care.the most difficult part is to clear the blood wolves.others aren't too difficult.<br />
<br />
hope this helps</div></div><hr />

<br />
nice work, gratz on your new booties :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tekish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What's a sow boot? <br />
I was thinking why would this guy want some journeymens till I read your post. :p<br />
<br />
While I'm at it, what is JBB I keep seeing mentioned alot? Is that the bp that trek drops?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>WM231NIKE</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I did this fight with a 51 shaman(me), a 52 druid, and a 50 sk.  He was very easy after I landed slow, which landed on first or second try.<br />
<br />
We ran up to advisor and killed him, then had to evac out because we had about 15 mobs.  We ran back, harmonied the wolves, and killed black dire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">SoW boots are the Black Fur Boots. They are one of the rewards from the shaman epic quest, to get them you have to kill a wolf in mistmoore castle.<br />
<br />
JBB could indeed stand for Jaundiced Bone Breastplate, which is something that Trakanon drops, but what people are actually talking about is the Jaundiced Bone Bracer. The nice thing about this bracer is it has a right click nuke spell on it - ie mana free damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mcdunno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sometimes our own abbreviations come back to haunt us. As I was approaching 45 I was auctioning all over the place WTB JBB (Thanks to Sol Ro's wonderful greed &gt; need policy in Lguk at frenzy :) ) Get a tell one day &quot;I'll sell you JBB for xxK&quot; I don't remember the exact price, but it was on the very low side, but hey, I wasn't going to argue.<br />
<br />
So, we agreed upon price and place to meet and I ran off to the bank to get the cash. Come back and meet the guy and he puts up JB boots... /sigh<br />
<br />
<br />
Then there was the time that someone else thought that vambraces were the same thing...</div></div><hr />
