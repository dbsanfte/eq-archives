<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>yadaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok i know this is old but i want to tell this to you guys so it may help your graphic look problem thingy magig. (i mean by armor is visible armors)<br />
<br />
first you will need a non playable race illusion item/spell (for you shammies, you guys have bear form so that works.)<br />
ok first take off the armor of graphic you dont want (helm, boots, gloves what ever) <br />
then click illusion<br />
then while in illusion wear your armor you took off<br />
then click off illusion, looks like your not waring armor but you are, the graphic just doesnt show up.<br />
<br />
or pretend you have a leather graphic armor but you dont want it, you want a chain grpahic. no problem. heres the solution:<br />
<br />
take off all armor, ware your chain armor (s). (or you can just do 1 piece of armor if you like) <br />
then cast bear form.<br />
then ware your leather gear (or the armor you wear normally)<br />
click off illusion, and you have chain armor graphic, but still waring leather.<br />
 <br />
or another fun one<br />
<br />
take off all visible armor<br />
cast illusion, put back all your visiable armor on<br />
then click off illusion, your still wearing armor but you look naked ^_^<br />
<br />
i dont know if this method still works but it worked for me before i quit. have fun</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Doesn't work with an aon, but I've been using bear form to get rid of the stupid chain helm graphic for years.  That rabid bear trick is pretty cool though.</div></div><hr />
