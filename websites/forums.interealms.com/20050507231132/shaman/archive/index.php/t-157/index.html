<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>cepheusRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone seen any of these drop yet on regular server?  We've killed all kinds of mobs that I'd think would drop them and haven't seen one.  I know I read that they weren't all implemented, but I hope they're not this rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Only ones I have heard drop of so far was when they put them in and a mob in Seblis.  Next day there was a Patch to correct this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Using Luclin spell drop logic they are prolly dropping rarely off a single mob somewhere deep in Ak'anon.  They definitely aren't dropping off the usual suspects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gawkmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually we got a spell that was marked as &quot;Ancient Focus of Spirit&quot; while in Sleepers Tomb, however when trying to scribe it it says you already have this spell memorized. We did a /bug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>AlynaRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Gwarker, What did the spell drop of in sleepers was it a named? <br />
<br />
A warder (If still avialable on your server?) <br />
<br />
Or just random mob 01</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gawkmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I believe it came off a random mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Arorot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">On tirbunal ive heard of a copy of ancient druid DS dropping in POA I believe .I forgot the exact name of the spell ancient legacy of spike ? something like that but dont quote me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I was told by someone who was there, that Tormax dropped 2 copies of an enchanter ancient spell recently.<br />
<br />
It may not be an ancient spell, but recently a couple of druids have become the first on the server to scribe &quot;moonfire&quot; (or something like that)...might just be an insanely rare normal spell, and not ancient. I ain't no dr00d.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ghanimaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I don't think moonfire is an &quot;ancient&quot; spell. It's just a 60 nuke that came with luclin and is pretty rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">moonfire was just put in recently.  It was one of those spells VI neglected to insert as promised.  Last weekend we got approximatley 8 copies of it.  Aint that rare no moe!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sandrak Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Peope were reporting on The Safehouse that Ancient spells were dropping in NToV.  Now while we didn't finish clearing it last night, thanks lame random spawn times, we did kill half of it and not a single Ancient spell dropped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Blarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Saw an anicent spell for chanters drop in NTOV.</div></div><hr />
