<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For the past four years or so most servers had a leading guild or two, with a number of guild being half an expansion behind.  With LoY and LDoN not adding anything at the top, by the time the next (hopefully raid oriented) expansion comes around in next spring, a lot of guilds will have reached time.  Looking at my server, and assuming the usual progression of 3-4 month past RZ to get into time, and another 3-4 month to get to Quarm, next spring will see about 6 guilds fully elemental equipped with some degree of time gear.<br />
Or, with other words, 400 top level players will fight for whatever SOE offers as the next &quot;end game zone&quot;.<br />
Having all these people doing a &quot;classic&quot; race for the spawn would be so ugly (and require so much CS) as to being unthinkable.<br />
So, are we going to see more of the Time-like instancing? Or LDoN type events only? What's your server going to look like by next spring?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Denor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am on Cazic Thule and by next spring i really think there could be 6-8 guilds in Time. With the gear that has come in with Pop a lot of guilds are skipping places like NToV, Shissararararara, VT and some bigger luclin mobs and headed full force into POP. <br />
I guess only time will tell what is going to happen on CT but i can only assume most servers are the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Every guild on Rodcet that has tried to skip Ssra/VT has died from lack of progress unless they had a huge bankroll and bought enough Ornate to get through.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Denor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think with lack of gear most guilds will just choke the mobs to death with zerg tactics. If we can stick 60 characters down the dragons throat we might win  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I hope for more LDON type events, but who knows what they will do.<br />
<br />
I actually just had this discussion with a bunch of my friends in game and the overwhelming majority believe all future content will be instanced like LDoN.  But we could all be wrong:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I am on Cazic Thule and by next spring i really think there could be 6-8 guilds in Time.

<br />
4, possibly 5 if the other two ever manage to make it past elementals.  Won't be 8 for a good long while on Cazic, won't even be more than the current 2 guild alliance and my guild in Time until then possibly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I bet future high end events will be similar to LDoN, ie instanced in some way, but with loot rewards instead of points.  I think Sony sees this as a way to add infinite content.  <br />
<br />
I'd like to see something like the dragon in Veksar, where someone has to do a quest to get items to spawn the dragon.  This way you have a built in method of limiting people doing a raid, without spawn timers and time zone issues.  You just have to control the flow of the quest item into the world.  (I know there is also the issue of the trigger mob, and i know the one in veksar isn't always up..but I'd like to see them do away with that and make it triggerable any time).<br />
<br />
Mainly, I'd like to see a way for a guild to raid regardless of time zone, without worrying over X mob will be available for them or worrying about getting leapfrogged or cockblocked.</div></div><hr />

- www.pakcafan.com , they skipped Ssra, well organized guild, 2 kills away from time. And I am sure they'll get those kills in the near future. Ornate has nothing to do with their success.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If a guild skips over content it will make it harder for them, sure, but with good strategies and a solid, structured player-base it can be done.<br />
<br />
The first few kills will be tougher for them without the higher end gear, BUT, after the first few kills and they start equipping their players with the stuff they get from upper tiered PoP content - every kill makes the next kill (and reflagging for more people and more gear) that much easier.<br />
<br />
They'd have a steeper hill to climb at the start, but once they get rolling, they'd still be cruising along.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My guild did the NTOV thing, then we started planning SSRA/VT, it quickly became apparent that there was another option that we could use to leapfrog the other 2-3 competing guilds into the planes.<br />
<br />
Ornate/PoP boss loot/Flagging, the thing is all three things can be done at once....<br />
<br />
So here we are 2 months getting our equip up to scratcj before starting on flagging, we started 3 weeks ago, with some trepedation. Were we skilled/equipped enough?<br />
<br />
Day one Grummus 0 My guild 1<br />
Day two TT 0 My guild 1<br />
Day two MB 0 My guild 1<br />
Day three Aerin Dar 0 My guild 1<br />
Day four Zek brothers, I'll let you know how it goes but from everything I have read seen so far we are gonna gimp these guys.<br />
<br />
Where are those other guilds? Still in VT, admitedly they are better equipped, cant argue there, also due to the 'buy a flag' raids that sell for 5k a person most of these guys are flagged to about the same level as us.<br />
<br />
BUT we are on a par with them and have probably invested about 30% of the time they had to.<br />
<br />
Wonder how we will do in the planes...they will be more efficent I imagine but I have no doubt we will do fine. Will be an interesting comparison though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">BTW in each of the above fights we lost no-one on  Grummus, TT and MB. Aerin Dar we lost about 6 people.<br />
<br />
Aerin Dar took the longest to fell, Grummus lived or about 30 secs, TT for just over a minute I think (a good part of the time you are not doing DPS to her, but to butterflies), MB lived for maybe 30 secs, Aerin Dar lived for a bit over a minute aswell.<br />
<br />
No we dont zerg, we are very solid and structured. Raids are well organised/planned and so far each of these kills has been on first attempt.<br />
<br />
I know these guys are wimps compared to bosses we have to face yet, but I am proud so far.</div></div><hr />

you can't do that way, PoTime isn't instances yet(only 1 instance), also it can only hold max of 72 players limit <br />
<br />
since PoTime have 6 days repop time(5.5 days), mean one guild take 2 days to clear PoTime and have to wait 4 days for repop, so if there are 3 guild with 2 days rotation, each guild don't have to wait any longer than repop time(6days) -- that maybe what he mean PoTime can only support 3 guilds<br />
<br />
anyway, other guild not at USA time zone can alway raid PoTime anytime they want without effect other guild</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">PoTime absolutely needs LDoN-style instancing to become viable for the horde of people destined for this zone.  The amount of cockblocking and general savagery between guilds will only grow worse unless SOE gets off it's ass on this issue.<br />
<br />
Not saying that EQ is supposed to be fun, but where is the fun in fighting like hell to gain access to a zone you can't use??</div></div><hr />

Good for them. But they are in the minority, and they are decidedly not on RN. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Merdenoms</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The Plane of Time can only support 3 guilds per server because of the respawn time and limited player access.  Therefore, GUILD A would raid the first two days using the 72 player limit (making impossible for another guild to raid there the same day.), followed by GUILD B another two days and lastly, GUILD C with another two days.  This does leave an extra day for the Plane of Time to be raided by a fourth guild.  But honestly, do you think those other three guilds would make room for GUILD D to mess up the nice rotation on the Plane of Time mobs?  I highly doubt it. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Merdenoms</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If Potime can only support 3 guilds per server then I suppose VT can only support 1 guild per server eh?  This is partially true since VT is a 7 day respawn.  Currently, there are only two guilds on my server actively farming VT.  They've decided to rotate insead of race each time that the mobs repop. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">In the spring I reckon we'll have 5 time guilds, ~350 of our public raiding system in time (they're just about there, in elementals now), and 3-4 guilds still in elementals.<br />
<br />
Damn, public Time raids....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I give a 50/50 chance that SoE drops all focus on &quot;raiding&quot; per se. Fact, SOE wants to see online gaming assume a mass market role comparable to and in competition with broadcast media and pay TV. To do that they have to seriously dumb down the game and remove exclusionary aspects of the game. <br />
<br />
So far, this is exactly what they seem to be doing. The game is massively easier than it was in  the early days. There is much more hand holding. There is more short time segment content. <br />
<br />
OTOH, if online gaming FAILS to go mass market, then the &quot;uber&quot; playerbase is the only market segment lame enough to pay insane monthly costs (broadband, multiple accounts, premium accounts, 18hr+ play segments, etc). <br />
<br />
There is evidence that SOE still panders to the &quot;uber&quot; crowd. For example the LDoN item nerf which they left the original items unnerfed for those players capable of doing 400+ missions in the first 2 weeks or the entire POP expansion (pre-flag nerf). <br />
<br />
Who knows. My personal feeling is that single-group content is more fun than raiding and gives me more of that immersive, stereotypical &quot;small fellowship of adventurers on a quest&quot; feel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jaeydee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Currently the Tribunal has 2 Time enabled guilds.  It works out really well for us, for the most part.  While we have no rotation set up with the other guild, we do have an informal understanding thing going on.<br />
<br />
However, we have (counting the 2 time guilds) 7 elemental guilds.<br />
<br />
The elemental planes weren't designed to have 7 guilds competing in them at once...<br />
<br />
Of course, the time guilds basically spend all their raiding times in Time.  But still, if for some reason they don't...there is slim pickins on what other mobs they can kill.<br />
<br />
Our next highest guild needs Coirnav and the Rathe for time.<br />
<br />
It could be interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Brat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I don't think you will ever see 8 Time guilds on CT.  AFAIK there are currently only 3, 4 if your count the alliance as 2 guilds, that have even killed an elemental god.  I would expect there to be 3 in time before toooo much longer, but I think those that follow the 3rd guild in while be a good while back.<br />

<br />
I am not to sure of this. Not to long ago we had the Pal only sword drop. Sinces non of our Pals needed it. A Pal from another guild was invited to come and loot it. When he tried to zone in he was pretty much told to piss off its to soon for him to return to timeB. His guild had just finished the day befor. So I do belive that each guild gets thire own instances of time that is on a 6 day repop. So haveing 7 guilds hitting time on a 7 day rotaion is a actully possablilty. And while yes you can only have 72 people in timeb at anyone moment. 3 guild can still split the day into 3 portions giveing all 3 a shot on the same day. Is this a good idea? Not IMO. But 2 guild spliting into 12 hour shifts is. Over seas guild has 12am to 12noon. NA guild has 12 noon to 12 midnight. (adjust for what ever time frame fits the 2 guilds.) Sinces time can be finished in 7-8 hours a rotation of this sort has a lot of potental.</div></div><hr />

Ugh don't even say it, PoP was/is horrible, it basically killed EQ...  if you want an arcade experience, try Quake, CounterStrike, Unreal Tournament, etc.. some titles due out soon are Halflife 2 and Doom 3..

Not more challanging ?<br />
<br />
<br />
MY shaman at low level had a 7/37 rune staff that was UBER.<br />
When i had no wizzy or druid i had to run from qeynos to Freeport, that alone was a challange. There is so much challange that has left EQ that i have to fully disagree with you on that point.<br />

There's 3 guilds in time right now. I'm pretty sure there's 6-9 guilds that have killed atleast one elemental god. And the 2 guild alliance has already defeated quarm. There will easily be 8 guilds in time on CT eventually.</div></div><hr />

<br />
flagging and backflagging aren't time sinks?<br />
The only benefit is the mobs drop useful items usually (to at least someone).  This has changed a bit from when pop first came out in that not everyone has to have a flag to go to most zones.  What is it 85%? of the raid needs one though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Pop is the best expansion ever. &lt;-- period..<br />
/cringe :p  you certainly have every right to that opinion... I feel it was the worst.  Either way, I think we can agree that it was a major contributor to EQ becoming the completely different game that it now is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">In terms of broading the game, Kunark was the best expansion. Very cool zones and a plethora of new spells. Sad to say, PVP went out the window with it, but such is life in a PVE game.<br />
<br />
Some of the later expansions have been good but they did not revolutionize the game as much as Kunark did. First visit there, a druid friend took me flying over the Dreadlands towards FV, thats an experience i wont forget.<br />
<br />
Im sure PoP is a nice expansion. I hope to experience more of it than just tier 3 someday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Pop is the best expansion ever. &lt;-- period..<br />
- Not even close. SOE lied about it. Remember when they said it's going to be about SKILL and NOT NUMBERS. Yeah ... even hard core guilds like FoH had to cave in and recruit to fill the Zerg(c)(tm) Army. Not to mention they messed up class balance even more. Marginalized quite a few classes, oh and it took them only one year to fix a ring event in Plane of Air (drops keypiece for Xegony), not to mention it took them to 11+ months to fix Coirnav event, 4+ months to remove the cockblock on Rathe for guilds (yes it was intentionally left by SoE so they could finish Time). Same time, quadders and bards get insane no risk XP on mobs single groups would have trouble killing. Not to mention also the constant dumbening of the RZtW event, now every guild with half brains can get to Elementals (hello overcrowding!). Best expansion? Hell no, it makes the clusterfvck Luclin look like a masterpiece. Velious was the best expansion. <br />
<br />
all the other expansions required you to timesink to get anywhere ie VP key.. ST key.. Emp Key.. VT key.. <br />
- Yes, backflagging and the same time getting rot loot reward is not a timesink? How about mindless ring events that last 3 hours for alt/bot loot and flags? Plane of Torment anyone? <br />
<br />
yeah really enjoyable moments... get key kill mobs basically.. in pop it became work together to progress.. but it's not just work together progress until you reach a zone and farm.. <br />
- Yeah great concept. Wait for 72 of your guildmates to get online so you can &quot;progress&quot; with your flags. In Luclin/Kunark you can just get 2-3 friends and camp mobs for (1) XP, (2) AA and (3) Keypieces. Once again Velious shines here. You need raid mobs for key (ST) but those mobs don't require 3 hour grueling events with 80+ people in attendeance to succeed. 30-40 people back them could have killed easily ST key droppers.<br />
<br />
it's rewards as you progress.. so you have a steps approach.. progress a bit, gear up, progress etc.. much more fun =]<br />
- Gear up on what? If you are a VT guild there are only a handful of items actually useful to you pre Elemental plains. Have you ever compared VT loot to anything dropping in Torment? Lxwanon? Nighmare? BoT? Other than a few specific trinkets VT loot owns it. So for guilds who have farmed VT, most of pre elemental loot is ****.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">In some ways I think pop was a very bad expansion, however it did its job of providing content for raiders. I am pretty excited about the prospect of a new expansion. But they have 2 appeals to branch-1 the raiding audience is demanding new content 2- the grouping ldoners are also demanding new content when they get tired of the 5 themes. <br />
<br />
Either way an expansion will likely be instanced to follow along lines it has gone so far.  Also gys will be used. If its a raiding expansion I can see an addition of levels, most probably 5. Maybe some more aa also. The variation of raiding will be tough to add onto. Ie there will be time equipped people and VT equipped people to cater to. Will the time equipped people be keyed past a part of content as it will be trivial or will it be chosen as hard, medium or normal along the lines of Ldon. I have to admit its very curious but I can't help thinking they have ruined some parts of eq branching out the appeal too much.</div></div><hr />

If such is the case i better find a new server cause Mith Marr has 3 guilds in Time I believe. I know we had the very first guild in Time. If i remember right the second one got in Time just before LDON came out. Of Course, I really dont give 2cp about Time because I know I will never see Time. I'm just killing time til EQ2 comes out. I know alot of people say they will never play EQ2 because of Item Decay  and Starting Over. Get Over It!!! **** will break over time and this game is so easy it's not funny any more cause everybody and their brother know where to go to level from 1-65 in a week or less. I am definately welcoming a new start. Especialyl with some of the good points like EXP debt and Tradeskill Classes. WoW lol I will definately not touch any Blizzard game after the Diablo 2 hacking problems on &quot;Closed&quot; BattleNet. I just dont trust any security in any Blizzard game. even WC3 has hacking problems with most being map hacking. WoW is just the shortened title of Wow i just got screwed by Blizzard by buying a $20 game with a $40 box cover.</div></div><hr />

Well, I have to respectfully disagree. The Zergling expansion destroyed the EQ I knew and loved. Pop AA only worsened class balance. From port books to non pvp safe zones directly connected to xp/raid zones, pop is nothing but a big piece of ****.<br />
<br />
No timesinks? Are you kidding? Flagging/backflagging is a worse timesink they lucid shards/emp key, and at least a group can get xp doing most of those.<br />
<br />
Work together? I dont consider 70 person raids as &quot;working together&quot;. I call zergling on this. Yeah raids of 40 or so in luclin wasnt good enough for some people, they had to up the &quot;fun factor&quot; by making going to a 90 person system!!!! /vomit<br />
<br />
I dont particularly care for pop's &quot;lag mobs to death with 300 people&quot; style. I especially loathe the dreadlands 2.0 through 8.0 that are all but like 3 pop zones. Basically all I see when I look at Pop as a whole is a giant cleveland steamer.</div></div><hr />

Just because something takes numbers doesn't mean it doesn't take organisation and skill. the limit on a raid is 72 people and we hardly ever reach that.  Try and Zerg Time with 72 people and you will fail every single night you try.  PoP invented whole new ways of fighting mobs, try the old MT/healer chain Luclin/Velious tactics and you won't even get Behemoth targetable.<br />
<br />
Stuff like Behemoth and The Rathe are inventive new kinds of encounters and I for one love that.<br />

You can't take more than 72 people into an instance in time, try 'lagging mobs to death with 300 folk' there<br />
<br />
One thing I do agree with you on though is the amount of outdoor zones now available to xp in, dungeons were always the most fun and created some class skilled players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Please stop kidding yourself if you believe that remark. PoP is one of the worst expansions I can think of in the 4+ year history of everquest I've been playing. <br />
<br />
It took a fairly decent &quot;upper&quot; game, opened it wide up to retard #'s fest fights and completely destroyed any semblence of fun that high end raiding once had. Raiding with 72 people is NOT FUN, it will NEVER BE FUN. Add to this the ability to ignore the 72 man limit on almost every fight in the PoP expansion and I don't really see any point in being proud of kills anymore. Wow we killed **** with 90 people, or wow, we lagged that zone so bad the boss attacked like 20x the whole fight, we are the **** now! <br />
<br />
Add to this the thing called backflags that require you to farm content so below you it isn't worth the time in everyones mind and actually the truth in most cases. I would take a VT key over backflagging **** in a heartbeat, least it made you feel somewhat proud getting that dam sceptre, that dam com2 ring. Getting a flag instills a feeling like it's almost pointless, this is the true timesink and also the most vile. Requiring say 50+ people to catch others up, I can see this being viable for maybee 1 or two final steps as it was in previous expansions. Requiring this for 90% of all PoP progression steps tho is complete bull**** and is the reason for massive burnout among all servers. Single or double group multi small steps for a final reward &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; full raids for almost every dam step for that final reward.<br />
<br />
The last semblence of a good expansion was velious, more-so kunark. Sadly the people in charge of making those zones, those events, those mobs are long gone and mostly in sigil games online. I am loving LDoN, the only reason it is a half decent expansion is because it is mostly just single group encounters. Raids are there, mostly useless but they are there. 36 man limit while on the low side for most guilds is perfect. No slackers, no tards, no numbers safety-nets like PoP, just play good or you lose - period. The way it was before /server filter, the way it should be.<br />
<br />
I consider myself lucky to not have to deal with all the elementals bull**** yet, i'm quite happy clearing VT with 30-40. Sadly most of my guild isn't, the lure of phat pop loots is pulling everyone that way. When we start running into the obscene number of ring events, the zone lagouts, the plethora of busted-to-this-day content and the forced roster inflation to do anything; I think they'll quickly wish we were back in luclin for Aten #whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Khozik didn't even start EQ until after PoP was released, so his prespective is a little different than most. <br />
<br />
PoP was extremely ambitious, and you have to give them credit for that.  <br />
<br />
PoP destroyed a lot of the &quot;old&quot; EQ, but it brought some positives along the way too.  <br />
<br />
It could have been much better though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">As far as PoP goes, I originally hated it.. with a passion.  I felt it destroyed a lot of what the EQ I knew and was all about.  Shortly after PoP came out, I took a 6 month break.  Now I'm back, and slowly working my way through PoP with a new guild, and I have to admit, I'm starting to enjoy it more and more.  Sure, some of the encounters are a real PitA, but there is a lot more variety than Velious/Luclin raid tactics.  My favourite to date has to be the Torment encounter, where you get eaten by that 'thing' (having a memory block today) and have to fight your way through it's innards and out, and then attack him once you're there.  <br />
<br />
VZ/TZ, Behemoth, all fun, and different.  I wouldn't say I love it, and I really have a nostalgic love of the Kunark expanstion, but overall, I'm warming to PoP, and wouldn't mind another one with a similar amount of variation put into the encounters.<br />
<br />
Just my 2c.</div></div><hr />

I honestly see no positives, only destruction.  In one fell swoop, PoP trivialized travel, making the world less cohesive and immersive, trivialized challenges with graveyards, trivialized 60 (well, now 65) with zones whose ZEMs know no bounds, and basically turned it from an RPG into an FPS.  Worst of all, in a supposedly social game, it's built up walls between people on the bricks of guild lines.  A few formerly close friends of mine, while still acquainted, I rarely even speak with anymore, and certainly never do anything with.  They're in the top two guilds on my server now.  Like anyone in an EP/Time guild, they are phenomenally powerful in comparison to non-EP+ players.. twice the hp/mana, foci 2-3x more powerful, half again as much ac, 3x the resists, as anyone not in the right guild could get, access to zones with 2-3x the exp of even BoT..  why would they want to crawl through a place like HS with me?  It's silly.  Folks in top guilds should be more powerful than others, but not more powerful than a freakin group of lesser level 65 players who don't join the right guild..  PoP thoroughly disgusts me, and of course, that's just my opinion ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">In terms of broading the game, Kunark was the best expansion. Very cool zones and a plethora of new spells. Sad to say, PVP went out the window with it, but such is life in a PVE game.<br />
<br />
I agree. Kunark was the last expansion that had any &quot;atmosphere&quot;, finely handcrafted dungeon maps, and challenging content. Luclin was average. After that the zones started becoming squares and dungeons becoming just tunnels. Timed &quot;trials&quot;, instanced repetitive zones, average content...totally console starting with PoP.</div></div><hr />
