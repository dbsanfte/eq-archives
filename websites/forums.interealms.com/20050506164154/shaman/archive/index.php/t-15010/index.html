<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild has taken down the maestro a few times ( friggin awesome shaman legs on him BTW ) and we are moving on to inny, tried him a few times to get the swing of what is expected here. Doesnt seem to be too terribly hard, just a PoP style fight really with adds. <br />
<br />
I have not been able to find much on him as far as other guilds that have killed him, seems to be only a few guilds around all servers that have bothered with him. Anyone on yall's server killing him? AFAIK noone on xev has.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dunwut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I know a few of our more uber guilds went in and dropped him a few times but don't think we have anyone regularly trying to kill him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My guild (Veeshan's Fury on Bristlebane) drops him pretty regularly. As far as I know, we're the only ones on the server that have done so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">any recommendations on getting to him?  or Maestro?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't have a map of Hate and try follow the guild when the monks call move. It's pretty easy to get separated from the group in Hate because the buildings tend to look the same and block your line of sight.<br />
<br />
Clearing to the Maestro or Innoruuk (sp?) doesn't take very long at all - maybe 5 to 10 minutes - which is pretty refreshing. None of the trash mobs are very hard and you rarely pull more than two or three.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">check your pm's please zarniwoop, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hard to believe that people don't do him much, he has the second best warrior weapon in the game, behind the blade of war from RZtWL. A 2HS with enraging blow, just not as good as the BoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>mmshah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ive killed him once, not worth the hassle imo.  If u can win that fight u can at least be vieing for elemental access.  Ure better of just trying to progress in PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">any links to the EB 2HS?  I haven't seen it linked or mentioned anywhere but your post</div></div><hr />

Also drops Constricting Cuirass (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=52056) <br />

I think the rest of his items can be found under Inny's entry in Ilia's Everquest Bestiary.</div></div><hr />
