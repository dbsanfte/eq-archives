<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild has lately been playing with the Manetic Behemoth encounter, with varying success.  Since the encounter is so short, I don't have much of a chance to &quot;experiment&quot; with &quot;what works and what doesn't&quot;, and hope someone here has done it often enough. My questions are:<br />
a) can the AoE's be resisted? According to Lucy they only have a -150 resist adjust, nevertheless I was hit for full everytime, with decent resists.<br />
b) can you use AA abilities while silenced, and does RC cure the silence (and if yes, at what level)?<br />
c) can blood of nadox cure the AoE (please say no, I don't want to camp that spell ;) ?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Radiant Cure cant be used if you are silenced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">All I have to say is I sure as heck don't want The Crucible turning into a spoiler site.<br />
<br />
As far as Blood of Nadox goes: Take some friendly advice and go get the spell if you can, it is one of the best spells there is for a Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Best place to go for this kind of info that I have found is the safehouse back alley. That being said the key to this encounter is DPS. Don't hold back. I guess he does have different AEs but I never noticed. Kill it in under a minute and you won't have to worry about that stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't need spoiler info, we got the encounter done, we are just a bit short on dps so it's iffy.  I was looking for shaman specific info for an encounter that doesn't give you much time to experiment with your personal tactics, and I felt kinda underutilizing my abilites.<br />
Thanks for the info on RC.</div></div><hr />

They are resistable.<br />
You can't use AA abilities while silenced.<br />
Blood of Nadox can't cure the AE, but get it anyway, it's very useful and important for some other encounters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As a shaman, my duty was always on one of the 4 crowd control teams. AFAIK, we have very little to contribute to the behemoth itself. A malo(s) to make nukes get off better, and then spam nuking with our cruddy nukes.<br />
<br />
Best advice, 4 crowd control teams of 2 people, an enchanter and either a shaman or a druid. Once the Behemoth becomes targetable, everyone besides CC gathers at one of the doors (don't rush in from both sides). MT gets supernal elixir, /discs riposte or evasive, runs in to engage behemoth to turn it away from rest of raid, and get it to waste its first AE on a single person. Cleric MGB's supernal elixir, rest of raid charges. Max DPS...melees /disc at 90% health, manaburns/lifeburns, clerics nuke and heal after the fight is over. Get behemoth dead, clear as many corpses out of the Behemoth's room as possible, then run everyone else out...CC teams will be on the verge of being overwhelmed by bugs at this time, so they all die, get dragged/rezzed. Living people hail the gnome for the tactics flagged. Specific intelligent people (and those with divine aura/harmshield) run into behemoth room between the 4k AEs to drag out the remainder of corpses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Question regarding the silence portion. Do effects like that, also stop the use of clicky items?<br />
<br />
For some reason, just thought about it, and realized I don't think I've ever tried. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You cannot use clicky items while silenced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">not much you can do on this other than heal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">really just like was said...you are best in this fight as one of the crowd control teams.  Only once have I ever done this fight without being on one of those teams..and I don't remember any of my dots landing..although I did sneak a couple of quick nukes in.  The key to this victory is killing him as fast as possible.  The one time that I did this as a part of another guild (I had missed the flag event twice cause of work) I ended up myself having 15 of those freaking spiders on me by the time that everyone was dragged out and the stupid gnome in the right position and I dragged 15 freaking spiders all of the way to the flag mob and not caring what happened (hey...it wasn't my guild and my group had requested help for over 5 min and no one helped us.  Anyways...just remember that your best role as a shaman in this fight..is to slow the spiders and keep them underwraps as best as you can</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sarnian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Only other thing I can add is whatever you do, DONT have the clerics/necros/pallys res anyone inside the behemoth room after he is dead.  The first and last raid i went on that happened and just before it died so did I.  The clerics then made the mistake of immediately ressing everyone and just as everyone was looting their bodies one of the CC teams let a spider through.  It entered the room and what followed was an immense chaotic CR and tactics flagging, not to mention a mad grab for the behemoth loot before the corpse poofed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">When silences you can't do anything that involves a spell. You can't use aa's. You can't use clickies. You can't even proc a frigging weapon. The way silence is implimented in the game currently it makes basically anything other than meleeing impossible which is why the pally silence spell got nurfed so fast when they tried to put that in. Imagine fighting sontolak with out his ae or proc. What a wuss he'd be.<br />
<br />
As far as behemoth goes this is just a stupidly hard encounter for the level it's at. It's all about kill the thing as fast as possible and thats one thing shaman are definitely not good at, fast damage. I don't think i've ever been in anything other than spider coverage when doing this encounter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">this fight is too fast, I just stay outside and cast fast heal on tank or group members, that way you can avoid AE and watch chanter after he die; chanter ususlly safe in first minutes</div></div><hr />
