<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jebuss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been soloing/grouping in City of Mist, and it's still good xp, but the amount of people training goos is getting pretty frustrating.  I've tried Seafuries, but that's pretty overcamped.  Is there any other places to solo?<br />
<br />
And when I get tired of soloing, where is a good place to find a pick-up group?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Let's see. I'm currenlty doing a study of where to go at 50.<br />
<br />
So far, I've evaluated CoM and Echo. Echo was godlike at 50, I did 50 in 6 1/2 hours in the deep room. See my post in the 40-50 area on it.<br />
<br />
At 51, I get a blue an hour there. So it's not worth the camp times anymore, and I move on.<br />
<br />
CoM, at 51, I can do a blue and a half an hour there. I got trained a lot, which is irritating, because I'd loose my pet and my non-jbb non-epic non-horse strategy is slow, tank a bit, put pet in, med till regained mana, tank.<br />
<br />
So the pet is buffed well to take the beating.<br />
<br />
Velks was about a blue an hour, but while I was there, the zone crashed and we had some nasty CR's after that. So I need to redo my velks analysis on a non-crash scenario. Velks is groups only, stinky loot, but I need stuff for my 5th shawl from there so it's all good.<br />
<br />
I've been told Mons Letalis, the skelletons in DL, DL north wall, KC, Sebillis, Chardok, Lguk, Neriak 3rd Gate, Seafuries are all good, I plan on going to each and doing a study.<br />
<br />
Study setup:<br />
<br />
1) get there and find a spot, buff myself and pet, take note of xp bar.<br />
<br />
2) start timer for 1 hour.<br />
<br />
3) work for an hour, record names and lb/db/green content, any adds/trains.<br />
<br />
4) stop at 1 hour, note xp gained. Go to new area.<br />
<br />
It keeps me entertained for now....<br />
<br />
I'll post the results up in a bit when I've got 5 or more areas to report on.<br />
