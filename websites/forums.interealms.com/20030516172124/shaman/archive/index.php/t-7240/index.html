What do you guys who have thrown in the towel do when you are not playing EQ?<br />
<br />
My hobby of choice is currently IPSC pistol shooting, but thanks to some looney Hong Kong citizen killing a few classmates in Monash Uni, the Australian government wants to take that option away...<br />
<br />
TV sucks, I've read out the local library... I dunno, any ideas?<br />

<br />
Aye there is,<br />
<br />
Downloading MP3 :D<br />
<br />
I download stuff and if I like it enough to play it for more than a few days I buy it.<br />
<br />
It's a bugger though when you get lag 'cos WinMX has decide to use all of your connection speed to download something ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hyacinth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You could try getting a job so you could get internet connection again.  :D<br />
<br />
You could also draw, paint, sculpt, go for walks, watch movies, write a book, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Smylee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My creative juices are not flowing freely, Hyacinth... Unfortunately I am still dealing with the local council and their nonsense with regards to my new house that I will be building soon... So, tho I have a job, as does my other half (or will have, she is starting new one in a week or so), all the money we are earning is being pumped into the 2 morgages we are paying :rolleyes: ... Either way, creativity has never been a strong point of mine. <br />
<br />
The main problem is, there is no pastime that I can do from the comfort of my own home that compares in entertainment value to EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Njaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Find a local group of gamers!  Wheee table top gaming!  Or better yet, take up table top wargames ... after buying all the figures, then you have to paint them!  Then, you can customize em, look for other players, build terrain, find a place large enough to play ... that'll take the better part of a weekend right there.  Before ya know it, it'll be Monday and back to work for ya!  As for next weekend ... you're on your own!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Oogaschaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">While it might not be much help, I temporarily broke my addiction with another online game-WarCraft III...for me at least, it was one, maybe two games and then a rather long break to go and do whatever I wanted-and it felt good, and immediate sense of accomplishment, or a desire to better myself after almost every game. Wow, this is sounding like a really shameless plug right about now ;P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I got back in the gym and got my health back in order. I still have a ways to go to reach my goal (210 lbs @ &lt; 12% body fat), but I should be able to get there before my next vacation (May 2003). <br />
<br />
I'm currently in a massing cycle so I'm putting the weight back on, but intentionally, and the right kind of weight. I start a cutting cycle in February where I'll shred down considerably and be nice and ripped for vacation. :)<br />
<br />
Go ahead, take pot shots if you want. I'm secure enough with my accomplishments and physique that you won't offend me. I know what I've done, what I can do, and where I'll end up, so knock yerself out. :)<br />
<br />
The fig leaves were my wifes idea. She wasn't comfy with a pic of me in my FotL's floating around on the net. LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Hyacinth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Pen &amp; paper RPG's are alot of fun! We usually play EQ through the week, then spend Saturday hanging out with friends, watching movies, playing video games, &amp; playing D&amp;D. <br />
<br />
But I do agree, there's nothing quite like EQ when you need your fix. :p</div></div><hr />

How have you been? Missing EQ a little bit? <br />

Why would anyone take pot shots at you for looking after your health? I say good on you for having a plan of action and the will to carry it out. I started back to the gym a few months ago just to get fit again and loose some weight. The hardest thing for me is getting up early to go for an hour, especially now that the clocks have gone back and it's really dark in the mornings. I like my bed too much ;)</div></div><hr />

You know how some people can be on the net. Anonymity breeds large low hanging brass ones in some people who have nothing better to do than find fault with others. :)<br />
<br />
Glori - thanks for the ego stroke. Makes it all worth while (as if my health alone weren't enough. LOL) :)<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhh vanity. My favorite sin.&quot; - Al Pacino in &quot;The Devils Advocate&quot;. ROFL!</div></div><hr />

I am missing EQ a lot, but i truly can't afford (time wise anyway) to come back. I am working too many hours and the other half is much happier that I am not glued to the PC for 6 hours a day. <br />
<br />
On the plus side, I just got a new Oxy/acetylene cutting mask. So I am sitting here typing away near the end of my working week and wearing it. All the red things look black. It's awsome!... I am SO easily amused.<br />
<br />
Anyway DJ, read your PM's cause I am about to send you one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">When I quit, I read a lot, skated a lot (miles of sidewalk on my campus), and played a few other games.  Wish I'd gotten laid.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I've peaked off and on in EQ lately to check out PoP and play with a couple of RL friends who have gotten the EQ bug again.<br />
<br />
But honestly, just enjoy what RL has to offer.<br />
<br />
EQ is great and all, and the experiences you have and friends you make in it are rewarding, your RL just has to take priority over everything else.<br />
<br />
Just take a tall glass of life and drink deep :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>flashman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">since i quit eq i have drawn alot of pictures in paint, beat solitaire, beat minesweeper, paint is the best program ever im going to draw in it now ! maybe ill post my beautiful pictures</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Valgoth im curious why you would blur your head?<br />
<br />
We have already seen screenies of your head in your RL Totemic armor thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">That was just a pic I had posted on one of the body building/fitness boards I frequent. It's just common practice to do so in that arena. Some people &quot;juice&quot; (use steroids) and don't want their faces on their pics. Others just follow suit and blur the face. Kind of a stupid practice really, since tats and body peircings would be sufficient for identifying anyone. :) But oh well....when in Rome. LOL<br />
<br />
I have nothing to hide, but that pic was just the most handy I had available. :)</div></div><hr />

That's what to do when you quit EQ.  Just be naked, preferably *with* someone</div></div><hr />
