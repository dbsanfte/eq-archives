<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">repair an item which is not bound to you (But will soulbind), or is unuseable by your class?<br />
<br />
The reason I ask is that I had to eat a Spirit Healer Rez which affected all my items in inventory.  Now I can't put them up for sale at the AH because they (the items) aren't 100%.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
Oh, and selling then buying them back from the vendor doesn't cut it. (Tried)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Never tried this myself, but there is a single repair button next to repair all... I *think* you can click that then click the item in inventory.  If that fails, I guess you are left to spamming in trade channels to sell it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yup, the &quot;repair all&quot; (anvil with the plus symbol on it) repairs everything on your person and in your inventory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think the &quot;repair all&quot; only repairs equipped items.  You have to manually repair other items that were damaged from the spirit healer rez.  Unless it was changed in the last patch..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Repair all does indeed only repair equipped items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Click the &quot;repair single item&quot; button and then click the items in your bags.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hmmm...news to me. Even Blizzard posters have stated otherwise.<br />
<br />
&lt;--- goes to look for post.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Since the search function is still broken on the official forums I decided to test this myself. <br />
<br />
1) Made sure everything was at 100% durability.<br />
2) Unequipped my bow, placed in backpack.<br />
3) Sacrificed myself to Elune by letting some Murlocks inside the walls of Menthil Harbor kill me.<br />
4) Used Spirit Healer to rez.<br />
5) Went back to armorsmith to &quot;Repair All&quot;.<br />
<br />
Bow was not repaired. Had to use &quot;Repair a Single Item&quot; to bring it back to 100% durability.<br />
<br />
Learn something new every day I suppose. So yeh, my bad. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I had my warrior's rare blue sword &quot;break&quot; the other day.  It went back into my inventory and it would not let me re-equip it.   I was really worried that it was done for, and &quot;repair all items&quot; (like stated above) didn't fix it -- but I was able to do the 'repair single item' and use it again.  Whew.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Don't forget to fix your fishing pole.<br />
<br />
Can be quite the pain in the ass to stumble over a hill and discover a beautiful new lake, decide to throw a few casts and find out your fishing pole is broke.</div></div><hr />

Hit any key that opens the chat bar, then use ALT + up/down arrow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The &quot;alt-Arrow&quot; keys (plus home, end) also work for editing around in previously sent chat lines too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hi<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I love you guys for posting the ALT tip.  I've been hurting for that one (though obviously far too lazy to look it up)</div></div><hr />
