<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zugugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Blind Rage, maybe. But the first 3 have a 3h 15m duration. No potions last that long. Not to mention, the effects are insanely great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>xDeMeNtiAx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">seriously, those effects are INSANE, and duration is crazy....u could sell a charges of those like KEI to melees (depending on making price/diffulty)....but they are too good not expecting for this to be potions</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Achzizra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Pyrokinetic Aura  Detail | History | Stacking | Raw Data  <br />
 <br />
  <br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Increase Damage Shield by 75 <br />
2:  Decrease ATK by 175 <br />
3:  Decrease  All Resists by 150 <br />
 <br />
If this is a potion it looks like they're not moving from the old &quot;have to balance good with bad&quot; trend from our earlier potions, although the earlier ones have been changed now.<br />
Could be it is a typo from the devs considering Caustic Aura increases all three slots but who knows if the typo is on Caustic Aura or Pyrokinetic Aura.. <br />
Good to see they seem to have changed their mind about not making any further updates to Alchemy, tho. Anyone taking bets on how much these are going to cost per try if they are indeed potions? :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Those arent potions. Those are most likely bogus or innate abilities of mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ghorharth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If there are new potions... and i think atleast blind rage is the effect of a new potion....the herbs for them will only drop in elemental planes and so they will be only for raiding guilds and no one will be able to afford one of thise potions</div></div><hr />
