<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wilddeuce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a level 20 ranger, with 97wis, 75 int, 84,dex. My archery skill is at 105. My fletching is at 150. Last time i bought 40 sets of parts (feild point, wood shaft, Ceramic Vane and large nock i created 195 arrows. My question is can I get over 150 fletching at this level? I have bought over 200 sets of parts and I get good yeild but no skill points. I have fletching quide and it is open. Any suggestions or help would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>khalysta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you can go all the way to 250 if you want but you could use to get some wis or dex gear to help with skillups. it also gets quite expensive over 200 skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Elured</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not entirely accurate.  It gets either &quot;quite expensive&quot; or &quot;mind-numbingly, suicide-enducing boring&quot; depending on what route(s) you take 202+.<br />
<br />
Acrylia arrows are very cheap, but it takes forever to farm and make all the parts.<br />
<br />
Other methods cost huge wads of stinky cash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Forza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok, I'm a little confused. If you're lvl 20 how do you have a fletching skill of 150? Shouldn't it be 105 if my math is correct? 5*lvl+5=max skill <br />
I could be wrong or they changed it since the last time I looked this up.</div></div><hr />
