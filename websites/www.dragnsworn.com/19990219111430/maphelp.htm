    <p>Ok this is to help all would be mapmakers in our clan who are having troubles. I will
    discuss triggers and switches later on. Ok when you are making a map first you should have
    some things in mind to make it easier. You should know what type of game you want to
    create ex:(RPG, Paintball, etc&#133;), how many players will be in it human and
    computer&#133; the general map lay out, and what things you want to accomplish. </p>
    <p>Most of you understand the easy parts of a map but I will run over them briefly for
    you. For every player you make you must have a starting position: (Left task bar, player#,
    star location and then the start location marker on the map). Then go into Players and
    settings to set up what type and how many players you want. Also here you can enable
    special abilities like burrowing: (Players on main menu, settings, special abilities, zerg
    technologies, burrowing, then select a player and uncheck use defaults for player, and
    then picked researched for player). Other special abilities are set likewise. Then goto
    scenario under then main menu and choose forces. Here you have to click and drag all comp
    players to a separate force from human players. You can also rename the forces whatever
    you want. Also I always uncheck random start location. Put guys you want allies on the
    same force always. Then go ahead and place your units and buildings. This is all you need
    to know for a really simple map.</p>
    <p>Next comes a trigger like part that is important&#133; the briefing. Select scenario
    under the main menu and mission briefings. Ok first select the specific players you want
    to see the briefing. Then as the first thing I always choose is mission objectives. So
    just tell what the basic overview and point of this scenario is. Now since I don&#146;t
    have any actual long talking waves I can&#146;t help you there. But if you want to make a
    moving portrait as words are scrolling down at the same time this is how you do it: 1.
    First pick show portrait and the slot you want it in and what portrait you want. This part
    you only need to do once for every portrait. 2. Then choose speaking portrait and tell how
    long you wish to show it for and have it be the same one as the one you chose for show
    portrait. 3. Then choose text message and what you want to say and make the length the
    same as the length of the speaking portrait. Now if you want to add another one just
    follow all three steps again. If you later want one of your guys who has already said
    something to say something again then just repeat steps 2 and 3. If you don&#146;t follow
    this procedure you may have mess ups like I did for awhile in your briefings. Ok now when
    you are done with all this you always want to add one last thing. Choose wait and wait for
    the combined length of the lengths of all your text messages. If you don&#146;t do this
    when you play on multi-player you will only see the briefing for a second and the whole
    thing will get skipped. Trust me this happened to me several times. <font FACE="Wingdings">L</font>
    Well that about cover mission briefings.</p>
    <p>Ok now on to the hard part many of you have been waiting for&#133; Triggers. I think
    that triggers are the life blood of any good scenario. They let you do so much with it,
    but sadly the more you become aquainted with triggers the more you will wish that they
    could do so much more. When I first started SC map making I was in awe at all the
    possiblities triggers gave you, but now I see 1000 improvements that could be made to give
    you so much more freedom. Ok anyway what a trigger is is something that executes a certain
    command when certain conditions are met. Triggers can be accessed through the main menu
    scenario, and triggers. The first thing you should ALWAYS do when making a scenario is
    delete the three triggers that already exsist there. Ex: a trigger could make it so when
    you bring a marine to a certain beacon it moves your marine to another spot on the map. Ok
    first a few words on locations. Locations and triggers go hand in hand. I&#146;ve yet to
    reach a maximum number of triggers you can have but know there must be one. Anyway you can
    atleast make like 100 triggers np. As for locations I found out the VERY hard way you can
    only make 63 of them I think it is. So don&#146;t make a location for 50 little details if
    you can&#146;t help it. Now to make a location select layer from the main menu and
    location. Then drag your cursor from one point on the map to another point and you&#146;ll
    see a shaded regoin come up. To rename it right click on it and hit properties then give
    it a better name. And you can slao resize it or then place it on top of other locations.
    You use locations to make something happen at a certain place usually in a trigger. Ok now
    back to triggers. First of all I don&#146;t have to do all of this in triggers you can
    always select on help to see exactly what each trigger can do and how it is used. So I
    will tell you what I think nesseccary for you to know about every trigger and what the
    most practical uses are for them. I will discuss switches later on. Forst of all there are
    three parts to a trigger&#133; who it affects, under what conditions will it execute, and
    what is to be executed. For the first part choose exactly who you want to be affected by
    this trigger. (This doesn&#146;t mean they will be but that they possibly could be
    affected by it.) Now onto the conditions: The under lined portions are those that you MUST
    fill out specifically before you can go on. Also&#133; A trigger only executes once. Once
    it has been done it will not just keep executing. Also for triggers where you have to
    choose a player current player means the first player out of the possible ones that fill
    these conditions. Like if you chose allies for who the trigger applied to and then current
    player for this condition it would affect the first ally that met that condition.</p>
    <p>1. Accumulate: <u>Player</u> accumulates <u>quantity</u> <u>resources</u>.</p>
    <p>This is straight forward. It is best used to give someone something when theyhave a
    certain amount of minerals. This trigger will execute when that player reaches that
    minimum amount of resources.</p>
    <p>2. Always: Always</p>
    <p>This one is like a set up trigger. It will execute when the game first starts and never
    again unless you tell it to. I use this one to set up things like minerals for players and
    also for continual things like showing a board of how many kills each person has. </p>
    <p>3. Bring: <u>Player</u> <u>Brings</u> <u>Quantity</u> <u>Units</u> to <u>Location</u></p>
    <p>This is a Very common one. It is made for use with locations. Make a location on the
    map and then say when a player brings some units to that location something happens. I use
    this for just about everything: Heals, Upgrades, Text&#133; very useful.</p>
    <p>4. Command: <u>Player</u> commands <u>Quantity</u> <u>Units</u></p>
    <p>This is best to see if a player has no units left to end the game for them.</p>
    <p>5. Command the Least: Current Player commands the least <u>Units</u></p>
    <p>The only use this might be for is to penalize or help the player who is doing the worst
    unit wise.</p>
    <p>6. Command the leat at: Current Player commands the least <u>Units</u> at <u>location</u></p>
    <p>This is like 5 but values a location.</p>
    <p>7. Command the most: Current Player commands the most <u>Units</u></p>
    <p>This is used just the opposite of 5. Either to help the best player or hurt the best
    player ususally.</p>
    <p>8. Command the most at: Current player commands the most <u>units</u> at <u>location</u></p>
    <p>Just like 7 but only applies to a specific location.</p>
    <p>9. Countdown Timer: Countdown Timer is <u>duration</u> game seconds.</p>
    <p>This is used to see how long it took a player to do something. Before you use this you
    should first set the timer in an action of a trigger.</p>
    <p>10. Deaths: <u>Player</u> as suffered <u>Quantity</u> deaths of <u>unit</u></p>
    <p>This is good to see when a player as had so many of a unit die like if you want to give
    4 lives as marines to someone to see when all those are used up.</p>
    <p>11. Elapsed Time: Elapsed scenario time is <u>Duration</u> game seconds</p>
    <p>Tis is good when you want something to happen near the beginning or just at a certain
    general time.</p>
    <p>12. Highest Score: Current Player has Highest score <u>Points</u></p>
    <p>This is of course to do something to the person who is doing the best.</p>
    <p>13. Kill: <u>Player</u> kills <u>quantity</u> <u>units</u></p>
    <p>I use this a lot for upgrades when a player has made so many kills and thing like that.</p>
    <p>14. Least Kills: Current Player has least kills of <u>Unit</u></p>
    <p>This is to do something to the person with the fewest kills. </p>
    <p>15. Least Resources: Current Player has least <u>resources</u></p>
    <p>To affect those who are exceptionally slow j/k.</p>
    <p>16. Lowest Score: Current Player has lowest score <u>points</u></p>
    <p>The same as 15 basically.</p>
    <p>17. Most Kills: Current player has most kills of <u>unit</u></p>
    <p>very straight forward.</p>
    <p>18.Most Resources: Current player has most <u>resources</u></p>
    <p>also very straight forward.</p>
    <p>19. Never: Never</p>
    <p>Ok I really have never found the basic use for this one. But I did see once an
    intersting use for this one in a map someone made. They put never so it the trigger would
    just be skipped over but the they put display and just something they wanted to say to
    someone who was looking at the triggers themsleves to help them. Like (Disp: Nexdt trigger
    helps set up the players scores or something else).</p>
    <p>20. Opponents: <u>Player</u> has <u>quantity</u> opponents remaining in the game</p>
    <p>this is good to end in victory for a player if ofr example all enemies have been
    defeated.</p>
    <p>21. Score: <u>Player</u> <u>Score Type</u> score is <u>Quantity</u></p>
    <p>Just used to see if they have a high enough score for something.</p>
    <p>22. Switchs Due to the complexity of switches they will be discussed in another
    section.</p>
    <p>Now you can make many conditions in the same trigger if you want, but the trigger will
    only execute if ALL of the conditions are true at the SAME time. Now for actions you can
    add many actions on the same trigger and if the trigger executes ALL actions on that
    trigger will take place.</p>
    <p>Now those were what the compute looks for inorder to do soemthing which is the next
    part&#133; actions. This is what the trigger actually does.</p>
    <p>1. Center View: Center View for current player at <u>Location</u></p>
    <p>This is best used to center the screen on something important when a player reaches a
    certain location.</p>
    <p>2. Create Unit: Create <u>Unit</u> at <u>Location</u> for <u>Player</u></p>
    <p>This I use a lot. It simples makes a specified unit at a location you make for any
    player. This is good in heals, upgrades, gains, and countless other things.</p>
    <p>3. Create Unit with Properties: Create <u>Unit</u> at <u>Location</u> for <u>Player</u>
    apply <u>Properties</u></p>
    <p>same as 2 but you can change their health level and if they are burrowed or not when
    they are made and stuff like that.</p>
    <p>4. Defeat: End Scenario in defeat for current player.</p>
    <p>Whoever this trigger applies to this will cause them to immedialty lose&#133; very
    simple.</p>
    <p>5. Display Text Message: Display for current player <u>Text</u></p>
    <p>Best used to tell certain players things like warnings, or hints, and list instructions
    for them. Don&#146;t make each one too long though or they won&#146;t have time to read
    thw whole thing.</p>
    <p>6. Kill Unit: Kill all <u>Units</u> for <u>Player</u></p>
    <p>simple. Just becareful who you use it on <font FACE="Wingdings">J</font> .</p>
    <p>7. Kill Unit at Location: Kill all <u>Units</u> for <u>Player</u> at <u>Location</u></p>
    <p>Same as 6 just only in the bounds of the location will it work.</p>
    <p>8-19 Leader Boards: Show Leader Board for ______ Label _____</p>
    <p>There are a lot of these and they just show the players how they are doing in a
    particular aspect. If you are going to use this one you should have a preserve trigger as
    the last action on this trigger.</p>
    <p>20. Mini-Map Ping: Show Mini-map ping for <u>Player</u> at <u>location</u></p>
    <p>Use this to direct someone to something important on the mini-map.</p>
    <p>21. Move Location: Center location labeled <u>Location</u> on <u>Units</u> owned by <u>Player</u>
    at <u>Location</u></p>
    <p>This one basically lets a location follow a unit around. To make this so use a preserve
    trigger as the last action on this trigger. This is good for doing domething for a unit
    that could be anywhere on the map or something to the units around it. Like in Defend the
    Temple this is used for the Ion Cannon to kill things around the probe. I like this one.</p>
    <p>22. Move Unit: Move <u>Units</u> for <u>Player</u> at <u>Location</u> to <u>Destination</u></p>
    <p>This is used to transport units from one location to another location.</p>
    <p>23. Mute Unit speech: Can&#146;t say much about this one since I&#146;ve never used it.
    Pretty straight forward anyway.</p>
    <p>24. Pause Game: Pause the Game</p>
    <p>If for some really weird reason you feel inclined to stop the game which they can just
    unpause anyway feel free to use this trigger. <font FACE="Wingdings">J</font> </p>
    <p>25. Play Wav: Play <u>Wav File</u></p>
    <p>Plays a sound. </p>
    <p>26. Preserve Trigger: Preserve Trigger</p>
    <p>VERY Important. This should always be the last action in any trigger it is in and
    should never be the only one. This is used to let the trigger be able to execute itself
    again and again whenever it can. Just becareful that the condtion won&#146;t always stay
    true or the trigger will repeat indefinitly. <font FACE="Wingdings">L</font> </p>
    <p>27. Remove Unit: Remove all <u>Units</u> for <u>Player</u></p>
    <p>same as Kill units but it doesn&#146;t count the units removed as kills for any player.</p>
    <p>28. Remove Unit at Location: Remove all <u>Units</u> for <u>Player</u> at <u>Location</u></p>
    <p>Same but only applies to a specific location.</p>
    <p>29. Run AI Script: Execute Ai script <u>Script</u></p>
    <p>This is to make comp units do something that aren&#146;t activly building. In my
    experience it doesn&#146;t work do well.</p>
    <p>30. Run AI Script at Location: Execute AI script <u>Script</u> at <u>Location</u></p>
    <p>This is the one you use to get a computer to activly build a base but don&#146;t ask me
    to get this one right for you because I have had absolutly no luck with this one.</p>
    <p>31. Set Countdown Timer: Modify Countdown Timer <u>Set</u> <u>Duration</u> seconds</p>
    <p>Always do this before you use a countdown timer as a condition. This is best used when
    someone brings a unit to a specific location.</p>
    <p>32. Set Doodad State: Set Doodad State for <u>Units</u> for <u>Player</u> at <u>Location</u></p>
    <p>You this one to trigger traps and such. Caution: You MUST use a separate location for
    every doodad you want to switch or else only one doodad will switch or even worse none.
    Under the Units choose neutral and then Doodad. </p>
    <p>33. Set Invinsibility: Set Invincibility for <u>Unit</u> owned by <u>Player</u> at <u>Location</u></p>
    <p>Pretty easy.</p>
    <p>34. Set Mission Objectives: Set Mission objectives to <u>Text</u></p>
    <p>This is not used to set mission objectives but rather to change the ones already set in
    mission briefings. This will totally erase any objectives set then.</p>
    <p>35. Set Next Scenario: Load <u>Scenario</u> After completion of current game.</p>
    <p>This one is used for campaigns to load the next game if. You can even go so far to load
    different games depending on weither they will win or lose.</p>
    <p>36. Set Resources: Modify Resouces for <u>Player</u>: <u>Set</u> <u>Quantity</u> <u>Resource</u></p>
    <p>Simple enough.</p>
    <p>37. Set Score: Modify Score for <u>Player</u>: <u>Set</u> <u>Quantity</u> <u>Points</u></p>
    <p>Also simple enough</p>
    <p>38. Set Switch: Don&#146;t worry I&#146;ll be discussing those very soon.</p>
    <p>39. Talking Portrait: Show <u>Unit</u> talking to current player for <u>Duration</u>
    Milliseconds. Sames as in mission briefings.</p>
    <p>40. Transmission: Too long to write out all this: Same as in Mission Briefing.</p>
    <p>41. Unmute Unit Speech: Unmute all non-trigger sounds for current player.</p>
    <p>Just undoes the affects of 23.</p>
    <p>42. Unpause Game: Unpause Game</p>
    <p>Well if you were crazy enough to pause the game in the first place sometime afterward
    this action would be advisable. <font FACE="Wingdings">J</font> </p>
    <p>43. Vicory: End Scenario in victory for current player. Automatically makes current
    player(s) win.</p>
    <p>44. Wait: Wait for <u>Duration</u> milliseconds</p>
    <p>This one is usefull when you want something to happen in the same trigger but later
    like you want to show many text messages but want to have time inbetween for the player to
    read them.</p>
    <p>Ok now to the part sooooo many of you have been waiting for&#133;&#133;&#133; Switches!</p>
    <p>To use a switch you first need to understand a switch. First of all a switch is used
    when some action takes place and you want another action to take place because of that
    just at a later time. I&#146;ll use a map of mine for an example. You bring a guy to a
    location that gives him a key. So he gets the key for a door. You don&#146;t want the door
    to open yet though but want to somehow mark that yes he now has that key. You can do that
    with a switch. In the beginning of a game all switches are set to clear. They are either
    set to clear or set. (On or Off). So now when I come to that key location on the map I set
    a switch (any unsed switch will do.) This lets the computer know that my guy found the key
    so some action will take place for that later. Now when I bring my guy to the door that
    this key opens the trigger checks and sees that say switch 1 is set so it knows I have
    found that key. So then it will open the door for my guy because the switch is set. All a
    switch is is like to delay an action to a later time. You first set a switch to note an
    action took place (finding the key for example). Then when you want the delayed action to
    happen you make sure the switch is set in addition to the right condition. Here are the
    trigger stats for a condition switch whiche tests if a switch is on or off (If the action
    has or hasn&#146;t occurred.) By the way switched are very flexible one switch can&#146;t
    just be used to mark 1 action and then its over it can be turned on and off forever if you
    wanted or made to check for a different action.</p>
    <p>Condition:</p>
    <p>Switch: <u>Switch is Set</u></p>
    <p>This lets you choose which switch you want and if you want it to be set or cleared for
    the action to take place. You would do this when you want the delayed action to occur
    (Bringing your guys with the key to the right door)</p>
    <p>Action:</p>
    <p>Set Switch: <u>Set Switch</u></p>
    <p>This lets you set, clear or change the state of a switch. You would do this when the
    first action takes place. (Finding the Key)</p>
    <p>Here is the correct 2 triggers for my key scenario if you are still confused try to
    follow this example until you get it:</p>
    <p>Trigger1:</p>
    <p>Players: Force1</p>
    <p>Condition: Force1 brings 1 or more anyunit to Key1</p>
    <p>Action: Set Switch 1.</p>
    <p>Trigger2: </p>
    <p>Players: Force1</p>
    <p>Condition: Force1 brings 1 or more anyunit to Door1</p>
    <p>Condition: Switch 1 is set</p>
    <p>Action: Toggle Doodad state right pit door for all players at location Door1</p>
    <p>Key1 is the location of the key.</p>
    <p>Door1 is the location of the door.</p>
    <p>Well I hope you all under stood most if not all of what I have said. If you still need
    help then you can contact me via e-mail or just catch me on B.net.</p>
    <p>Now I will give you some additional map hints as well as some generic triggers for
    certain things. Ok here is a mistake I made and some of you may have read the post about
    it. For some stupid reason th sc program can only handle so many walls. If you maek over
    that amount of walls like I did in a map it will sy some junk about ther being too many
    small corridors and won&#146;t run. So if you are going to fill a map with walls
    don&#146;t use a map size bigger than 156X156, or else cut way back on the walls. Ok now
    if you watnt to edit the values of characters choose scenario under the main menu and then
    unit and hero settings. Now if you want to change the character name you can only use
    heros. Also DO NOT give the computer players heros. It is useless. Comp heros for some
    reason just sit there and don&#146;t attack. Ok now if you want to change the cost of
    special abilites pick scenario under the main menu and special abilities settings. Then
    find the tec you want and uncheck default and have fun. To change damage for scarabs it is
    found under unit and hero settings, protoss units, ground units, then scarab. To change
    spider mine damage go under change unit and hero setting again, terran units, special, and
    vulture spider mine. Also if you are going to be using many beacons keep the following in
    mind. If you use beacons the color of a player that is not playing they will not show up
    but and location triggers for that area will still work. For example you have a three
    player game and only 2 people were playing. If you had made a teal beacon you will not be
    able to see it. Now onto some generic triggers I use and you can too if you want.</p>
    <p>Healing: This is on for healing a unit that comes to a beacon which on I placed a
    location named Heal1. This lets them heal an unlimited number of times.</p>
    <p>Trigger1</p>
    <p>Player: Force1</p>
    <p>Condition: Current player bring 1 or more marine to Heal1</p>
    <p>Action: Kill Marine for Current Player at Heal1</p>
    <p>Action: Create Marine for Current Player at Heal1</p>
    <p>Action: Wait 10 seconds</p>
    <p>Action: Preserve Trigger</p>
    <p>Limited healing: This will let player 1 heal only once at a beacon on which there is
    placed a location named Heal1.</p>
    <p>Trigger1</p>
    <p>Player: Player1</p>
    <p>Condition: Player1 brings 1 or more marine to Heal1</p>
    <p>Action: Kill Marine for Current Player at Heal1</p>
    <p>Action: Create Marine for Player1 at Heal1</p>
    <p>Now this trigger shows how to get a left lower pit door (On Installation level) to work
    properly by just coming up to it when there is a location on the door named Door1.</p>
    <p>Trigger1</p>
    <p>Player: Force1</p>
    <p>Condition: Force1 brings 1 or more anyunit to Door1</p>
    <p>Action: Toggle Doodad state for Left Pit Door for All Players at location Door1</p>
    <p>Action: Wait 10 seconds</p>
    <p>Action: Preserve trigger</p>
    <p>Upgrade: This one upgrades a unit from a vulture to a tank when the controller of it
    has gotten 20 kills whereever the unit is. For this one to work you must have a location
    premade and call it maybe like upgrade1 or something.</p>
    <p>Trigger1</p>
    <p>Player: Force1</p>
    <p>Condition: Current Player kills 20 or more anyunits</p>
    <p>Action: Center Location Labeled Upgrade1 on Vulture owned by current Player at
    Anywhere.</p>
    <p>Action: Kill all vultures for Current Player at Upgrade1</p>
    <p>Action: Create Tank at Uprgade1 for Current Player</p>
    <p>Action Preserve Trigger</p>
    <p>Well I hope this has taught you what you seek to learn about map making and if not you
    can still contact me and ask me questions directly. If you have ideas for specific
    triggers for me to add to this just let me know and I will make a trigger for what you
    want and give it to Kirrock to put up here if it can be made any way. </p>
