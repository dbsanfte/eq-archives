<br>
Q: WHo are these devs people keep referring to?<br>
<br>
A: devs = “developers”, the people who are making this excellent game for us.<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: What do you mean by &quot;con&quot; when referring to MOBs?<br>
<br>
A: &quot;con&quot; means &quot;consider&quot; and is a way to determine how powerful a monster is compared to you. More details on this and other game play related questions are in the manual.<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: Since you mentioned it, what is a MOB? <br>
<br>
A: The term MOB refers to computer-controlled creatures and people in the game. Usually it's for talking about critters, as humanoids are also called NPCs. The term’s origins are murky, but hearken back to the days of MUD’s, referring to Mobile creatures. During the development of Everquest, the devs referred to creatures as &quot;Mobile OBjects&quot; internally, and shortened this to MOBs in the forums.<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: What is this NDA people keep talking about?<br>
<br>
A: NDA = Non-Disclosure Agreement. It’s the thing you signed before getting into the beta promising that you won’t talk about it to anyone not in the beta, post info on any web sites other than these forums about the game, or even show the game to your friends. I’m not a lawyer, so you should look at the NDA if you have any questions about it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: What is BF and how do I get rid of it?<br>
<br>
A: BF = Battle fatigue and it accumulates during combat. If your BF gets too high medics and doctors have a harder time healing your action and health pools. Stop by a cantina or hotel and target a dancer or musician. Use the /watch or /listen commands. Your BF will slowly fade. Remember to tip the entertainers, as they are helping you out instead of running missions to make money for themselves.<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: What does CDEF, as in CDEF Pistol, CDEF Carbine, etc, mean?<br>
<br>
A: The Devs haven’t said if it stands for anything. Speculated answers from beta-testers include: “Character Default Equipment File” and “Civilian DEFense”<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: What does BAF mean?<br>
<br>
A: BAF = &quot;Bring a Friend&quot;. This refers to when you attack a monster that's in a group, and instead of him coming alone, he will bring a friend (or 2 or 3) to help make you dead.<br>
<br>
Slice hounds and other carnivorous animals tend to do this. Non-aggressive critters are more likely to come alone while their friends run away.<br>
<br>
** Other acronyms/terms: **<br>
<br>
DB = “Death Blow” is used on an incapacitated PC to kill them. Some monsters and NPCs will do this.<br>
<br>
<br>
PvE / PvP = “Player vs Environment” / “Player vs Player” : terms used to differentiate the experience a player has fighting computer controlled opponents (the &quot;environment&quot;) as opposed to characters controlled by other players.<br>
<br>
<br>
POI = POI generally stands for &quot;Point of Interest&quot;, and I'm pretty sure I've seen it spelled out by the Devs here, but don't quote me on it, as the old forums are soon gone and I won't be able to prove it At this point, we see POI preceding the placeholder names of mission buildings in-game.<br>
<br>
<br>
GCW = “Galactic Civil War” : the ongoing conflict between the Rebellion and the Empire, played out in SWG through factional alignment.<br>
<br>
<br>
PA = “Player Association” : the SWG equivalent of a guild; a group of players that have enough in common to want to form an official organization. A PA Hall is a building owned by a PA and used for meetings and other nefarious purposes.<br>
<br>
<br>
LD = “Link Dead”. LD will appear after the name of a character in-game if the server loses connection with their PC.<br>
<br>
** Non-Game play questions and answers **<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: Will we get to keep our beta characters in retail?<br>
<br>
A: No. This very very rarely happens in betas, but it's not going to happen here. Everyone will start fresh in retail.<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: Speaking of retail, will beta testers have to buy the retail game or can we just keep playing off our beta install and pay the monthly fee?<br>
<br>
A: Everyone who wants to play after retail release will have to buy a copy of the game. You might want to pre-order now.<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: I gave my &quot;buddy CD Key&quot; to a friend, and now I would like to transfer my original key and CDs to someone else since I don't plan on beta testing anymore. Can I do this?<br>
<br>
A: No. The NDA specifically says:<br>
<br>
1.2 License Restrictions. Recipient shall not:<br>
<br>
(a) Sublicense to, transfer or permit use of the Beta Software by, any third party;<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: But they allowed us to give a copy to a friend when we received the Beta 3 CDs and allow those friends to use the new key. I don't see how this is different as long as the person I want to give it to signs the NDA and I don't use the software anymore.<br>
<br>
A: It is different because this new friend that you want to give it to has *not* signed an NDA and there's no provision for them to do so. And again, it's simply not allowed, so don't do it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: I've been accepted into the beta, but I don't know where to download the game from. Where can I get it?<br>
<br>
A: Your acceptance email will have a link to the beta page where you can sign the NDA and pay for shipping charges on the Beta CDs. Once you have paid for shipping the CDs, you will get a CD Key and a download link.<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: Since I can download the game, do I have to pay for the CDs?<br>
<br>
A: Yes. Paying for the CDs covers the charge for the bandwidth you'll use downloading it, as well as a nifty set of CDs for your collection.<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: Isn't there some way to avoid paying to participate in this beta? We're doing them a favor, after all, helping them out. Why should I pay?<br>
<br>
A: This topic has been discussed ad nauseum since before the beta started. It's not going to change and there's no way around it. Please don't start new threads asking about it because it just makes people angry and wastes time and space.<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: I tried to use the forums search option, but it says the search is busy. What do I do? Is it broken?<br>
<br>
A: It's not broken, it's just busy. Only so many searches can be done at a time to prevent slowing down the database too much. Try again later.<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: I have a question for the developers. When I post it in the forums should I precede the title with &quot;Devs:&quot; or &quot;Devs, please read:&quot;<br>
<br>
A: Putting &quot;Devs&quot; in your title won't generally make it more likely to be read by the devs. Having a descriptive title and a sensible, well written question will do better. And if it's something that gets a lot of activity from other forum members because it's a good question it will probably be more likely to be noticed. But remember, there is a lot of activity on the boards and the devs can't watch every single message that comes in all day every day. You are more likely to have a question answered by another forum member. <br>
<br>
<br>
Q: The profession I've chosen has something wrong with it, or it isn't balanced, or it just plain sucks. What's up with that?<br>
<br>
A: The devs are still working hard to balance the game and the many professions. If you have a specific complaint, try first doing a search on these forums to see if there is a thread on it you can add your comments to. If not, feel free to start a new thread to voice your concerns. <br>
<br>
You can avoid the appearance of &quot;whining&quot; and help reduce the number of troll responses to your thread if you take some time beforehand to compose your thoughts and concerns, write clearly and succinctly, and try not to be demeaning to the devs or other players. Calling the devs stupid for doing something you don't like is a sure way to not have your issues considered.<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: I saw someone selling an SWG Beta account on ebay. Is that ok?<br>
<br>
A: No, this is a violation of both the NDA they signed and of ebay's selling policies, which prohibit selling beta software. Please report the URL of the auction to the developers on these forums. If you are ambitious you could also report them to ebay.<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: Do I have to pay a subscription fee for the beta?<br>
<br>
A: No, the only thing you have to pay is the shipping costs of the beta CDs.<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: How do I take a screenshot in the game?<br>
<br>
A: Hit the Print Screen key (default). There is also a key binding for taking a 360-degree panoramic screenshot. You can set that in the Options/Keybindings menu<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: Ok, I have my screenshot. Can I post it to my private web site to share with you guys or maybe some close friends?<br>
<br>
A: No and No. Posting screenshots on any web site would violate the NDA, even if you only post the URL here. Web sites can be found even if you don't post the URL, or someone else here could post the URL on a public site.<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: So what can I do with my screenshot?<br>
<br>
A: Admire it in the privacy of your own home, by yourself. Alternatively you can use it to report a bug by attaching it to a bug report that you submit through the launchpad.<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: So I took a screenshot. Where is it?<br>
<br>
A: It's saved in the main Star Wars Galaxies directory. By default they will be TIF files. You can change this in the game's options screen to be compressed JPG files and save some space.<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: I am having trouble logging into the servers. Is anyone else having this problem?<br>
<br>
A: Yes. If you are having the problem, odds are someone else is too. To see how common it is, join a chat channel in the launchpad. If there are over 100 people in the general or beta status rooms, there is probably a server problem and you will need to wait for it to be fixed.<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: EBGames/Amazon/ lists a release date that seems too soon for the state the game is in. Is the game going to suck on release?<br>
<br>
A: Any release dates you see before seeing one posted here by the official folks or on LucasArts.com is pure speculation. Ignore them. We do not anticipate the game sucking on release <br>
<br>
<br>
Q: Will I get to have two characters per server once the game releases?<br>
<br>
A: Currently the plan is to allow only one character per server. This too has been discussed to exhaustion in the forums and it's more likely you'll get to fly the USS Enterprise in-game than have a second character on the same server. <br>
<br>
Note this doesn't apply to the Force Sensitive slot, which actually is a second character on the same server. Again, your odds aren't good for getting this either <br>
<br>
The second character capability was only added to the beta to allow you to continue playing if your first character gets bugged and isn't playable. <br>
<br>
<br>
** Gameplay Related Questions and Answers **<br>
<br>
Many of these should be answered in the manual, but they get asked a lot here anyway. <br>
<br>
<br>
Q: Something I own/crafted/bought disappeared! What can I do?<br>
<br>
A: Nothing probably. This is the nature of a beta test. Weird stuff happens, things disappear, etc. Sometimes the item(s) will show up in your inventory later, but don't count on it. You just never know.<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: Why are we cloned after death instead of being healed in a bacta tank? It's not correct in the Star Wars storyline.<br>
<br>
A: This is a decision the devs made for gameplay reasons. It doesn't look likely to change, regardless of the hundreds of impassioned, well thought-out pleas. There really are very good reasons on both sides of the argument, and they've already all been laid out here, numerous times. I wouldn't suggest bothering to beat this dead horse any longer, but I can't stop ya. <br>
<br>
<br>
Q: Why should I pay medics to heal me? Don’t they get XP for doing it?<br>
<br>
A: The resources used to make medicines aren’t free or easy to get for a medic. They either have to also become an artisan and/or scout to get them, or they have to buy them from others. Recent increases in the amounts required for low-level healing items has unfortunately made the small stacks of single bio-bits medics used to get worthless for crafting medicines. Finally, medicines above the most basic ones take a long time to craft. If medics can’t make some money at healing, they will probably stop doing it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: Why won't certain items, like things I craft, stack in my inventory?<br>
<br>
A: Different instances of crafted items will have different statistics based on the materials used to create them and a variety of other factors. There won't be any way to stack them because each item is unique. Stacked items must all be exactly the same for the database to keep track of them with only one description and a number representing the stack size. Since no two crafter items are exactly the same, they can't stack.<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: How do I use the public crafting stations? When I click them the only option I get is &quot;Examine&quot;.<br>
<br>
A: To use a public crafting station, just stand very near it and use your specialized crafting tool (not the generic tool). You will get extra options during the crafting process.<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: What are Certifications? How do I get them? How do I use them?<br>
<br>
A: Weapon certifications are gained with certain skills. These allow you to use different types of weapons. You get them automatically as you gain new skill boxes.<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: How can I /tip someone if I have no money on me, but it's in the bank?<br>
<br>
A: You can usually use this command:<br>
<br>
/tip bank  100<br>
<br>
This will transfer money from your bank account to theirs. Note there may be a service charge for this transaction, especially if they are offline at the time. It will warn you before charging you.<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: I've come to a new planet, but I can't get a safety deposit box at the bank! Why not?<br>
<br>
A: Currently you can only hold a safety deposit box on one planet at a time. You have to join the bank to get access to a box. You can only be a member of one bank at a time. To quit your current bank you must travel to that planet, remove everything from the deposit box, then select &quot;Quit Bank&quot; from the bank's menu. then you can go to the new planet and join their bank, giving you access to a deposit box.<br>
<br>
Feel free to complain to the devs about not being able to join more than one banking system at a time.<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: How do you form a PA?<br>
<br>
A: I’ve no idea. I know there are /guild commands, so you’d use those. Anyone want to explain it?<br>
