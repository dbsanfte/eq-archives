This information is available elsewhere on the web (see <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://swvault.ign.com">swvault.ign.com</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> for source version which will soon be updated to the version listed below).<br>
<br>
I am going ahead and posting the updated version here as well, because the most important thing in my view is to get the info out to the folks who may need it. And given that release day is just around the corner, I'm going ahead and putting the revised version up.<br>
<br>
So if you need it, here it is <br>
<br>
CHARACTER CREATION—RACE INFORMATION<br>
<br>
You can have a lot of fun creating your character, as Star Wars Galaxies allows for literally thousands of different combinations based upon race, physical appearance and starting profession.<br>
<br>
But before you select the appearance, profession, and name of your character, you should know a bit about the races you can play, and their histories. <br>
<br>
When scrolling through the race selection, you will see a detailed description of each one. Be sure to scroll down in the text box so you can see that each race has attribute bonuses based upon its inherent strengths and weaknesses.<br>
<br>
Don't worry though, as these points can later be redistributed based upon your chosen starting profession…but we'll get to that later on.<br>
<br>
BOTHAN<br>
Bothans originate from the metropolitan planet Bothawui, and are slightly shorter and stockier than Humans. Averaging a height of about 1.4 meters, they have fur-covered faces and are most well known for their impressive spy network and keen intelligence. Members of this race must be very focused, not only in order to keep the secrets necessary for their spy trade, but also because their facial fur can sometimes ripple based upon their mood changes…an indicator that could give a Bothan's true feelings away if he isn't careful. While some might say Bothans have a reputation only for sly dealings, this race is in fact made up of an incredible loyal people. So while they are perhaps best known for their extensive information network, Bothans also excel in many professions, as they are adaptable, skillful and highly intelligent. But given their impressive use of information, it's not uncommon to find a Bothan in politics. After all, one of the more noteworthy politicians, Borsk Fey'lya, is Bothan. Despite the neutrality of Bothawui, its race's extensive intelligence network has been rumored to be a great asset for the Rebellion. Yet not all Bothans support the Rebels…or the Empire, and not all are drawn to espionage. Many follow their home world's lead, and choose to remain Neutral, or they support the side of their clan. A Bothan's loyalty to his family is also evident in his chosen surname, a combination of family and clan names, separated by an apostrophe. They speak their native language (Bothan) as well as Basic, and have a natural skill bonus in Camouflage and Cover. <br>
<br>
HUMAN<br>
No one quite knows which planet Humans originated from, but everyone agrees that this race is now the most numerous people in the known Galaxies. Their native tongue is Basic, a language all races understand. Unlike Bothans, Humans are not credited with any one over-arching accomplishment, but their versatility has had both positive and negative impacts on the Empire, including profound advancements in space travel, technology and politics. There are many famous Humans, but perhaps none so much as the Jedi Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia Organa, and the smuggler-turned-hero, Han Solo. Of course Humans hold some of the most powerful seats in the Empire as well…. And while a large percentage of current Imperial forces are Human, this race also has a strong presence in Rebel and Neutral factions. Slightly taller than a Bothan, a Human averages 1.8 meters in height, and has a natural skill bonus in Leadership and Artisan Experimentation.<br>
<br>
MON CALAMARI<br>
Taller than Bothans and even some Humans, the Mon Calamari have colorful skin and markings, and are adept swimmers. They are also very empathetic to their surroundings, and prefer watery environments to hot, dry climates. Hailing from the planet of Mon Calamari, this amphibious race is best known for its peaceful nature and impressive mechanical skill. While many Mon Calamari support a non-violent lifestyle and choose less combative roles (engineer or crafter, for example), the war has brought some drastic changes to this traditionally peaceful race. While there are sure to be many Mon Calamari who remain neutral to the conflict of the Galaxies, more and more seem to be embracing an active role in the Rebellion. Perhaps this new role stems from not only their innate sense of maintaining peace and justice, but also their home world's suffering at the hands of the Empire. A well-known Mon Cal who has embraced the Alliance's cause is Admiral Ackbar, a fleet leader in the Rebel army. These squid-like people are about 1.7 meters tall, on average. They speak their native tongue, Mon Calamari, as well as Basic. Mon Calamari have a natural skill boost in Alertness, Weapon Assembly and Structure Assembly. <br>
<br>
RODIAN<br>
Averaging a height of 1.5 meters, Rodians are smaller than Mon Calamari, and have a slighter build than Bothans. Rodians have an almost insect-like appearance with skin tones that range from whitish-blue to green, and two smallish sensory-organs protruding from the head. This race hails from Rodia and is best known for its harsh glorification of violence. Many are adept bounty hunters, and are often most loyal to the highest bidder. Perhaps the most notorious Rodian is Greedo, the bounty hunter sent by Jabba the Hutt to capture Han Solo. The Rodian culture teaches its members from a young age how to build and wield weapons and other necessities of war. As such, this race is made up of natural killers, who often work in secret. And yet not all Rodians act upon their race's romanticism of violence; many Rodians are natural performers, as they can easily channel their immense passion of war into a passion of performing. Rodese is the native tongue of this race, though all understand Basic, and many are fluent in Huttese as well. Rodians have a natural bonus in their skills for Defense Vs. Blind, One-Handed Weapon Accuracy, Two-Handed Melee Accuracy, and Weapon Assembly. <br>
<br>
TRANDOSHAN<br>
These lizard-like people are larger than Humans, and second in size only to Wookiees. Native to the planet Trandosha (also called &quot;Dosha&quot; for short), the Trandoshan are a formidable race made up of fearless warriors who do not injure easily. Their size (average 2.2 meters) and sharp claws also make them excellent at hand-to-hand combat. Like the Rodians, many Trandoshans exalt violence, yet with an almost terrifying zeal, and it's not uncommon for them to become bounty hunters or fighters. Yet while the less violent Rodians gravitate towards the dramatic, more passive Trandoshans are often found in scientific professions. Unlike the other races in the known Galaxies, Trandoshans' reptilian nature means they not only have a scaly appearance, but they hatch their young from eggs. Unfortunately this race is not often well-received, simply by their fearsome appearance, yet their courage can at times find them in the role of reluctant hero. Perhaps because of their intimidating reputation, or their tendency to keep to themselves, the Trandoshan do not seem to have any one individual who has stood out in Galactic history. Yet as a race, they are unconcerned with reputation beyond accolades earned in their own culture. Trandoshans speak their native tongue of Dosh, as well as Basic, and have a skill bonus in Unarmed Accuracy, Unarmed Speed, Unarmed Damage, Melee Defense, Creature Harvesting, and Regeneration.<br>
<br>
TWI'LEK<br>
Native to the planet Ryloth, the Twi'lek race is easily distinguished by its thick tentacle-like appendages (known as &quot;lekku&quot;) protruding from the head. At an average of 1.8 meters, these people are close to Human in size. Yet the Twi'lek are not particularly known for exploration nor mechanical skill. Indeed, perhaps their most popular attributes are their rare beauty and ability to move gracefully. Unfortunately this has resulted in Twi'leks being among the most sought-after captives in the slave trade. Given their culture's inability to sufficiently protect its citizens, many Twi'lek have migrated to other planets, in hope that they can escape the fate of being victimized. Many have found refuge in the larger cities of the inner rim, and are employed as Entertainers in the cantinas. While this race may not be known for scientific or military advancements, don't be fooled into viewing them as a simple people. Their impressive intelligence and innate ability to communicate using a combination of Twi'leki and lekku movement, have allowed them to quickly adapt to constantly changing situations, including the recent Galactic upheavals. Perhaps the most famous of the Twi'lek is Senator Orn Free Taa. Yet there are those who would argue it is actually his stunning assistants, Pampy and Supi, who steal the show. After all, other famous Twi'leks seem to be known for their beauty above all else. Though traditionally found in passive roles, Twi'leks also understand that survival requires a keen awareness of events and information. So while the role of Performer exposes them to a great deal of knowledge-exchange, and affords them the opportunity to observe and communicate with many, some Twi'leks are now gravitating towards more violent professions. Their skill bonuses are Wound Heal and Battle Fatigue Heal (in both Dancing and Music).<br>
<br>
WOOKIEE<br>
These towering people are easily recognized by their great stature and fur-covered bodies. They are unique to the known races in that they lack the physical ability to speak Basic. There has been some speculation as to possible physical modifications, yet none are known thus far. Wookiees' inability to speak languages other than their own has resulted in many species learning to understand Shyriiwook, the language of the Wookiee race. Like the Mon Calamari, Wookiees have a deep affinity for nature. Although their size naturally makes them powerful fighters (they average about 2.2 meters in height), this race (like Humans and Twi'lek) is not by nature overly violent. However, once a Wookiee has dedicated his life to the art of war, he can become a near-unstoppable fighting force. While many well-known Wookiees were berzerkers in battle, the most famous Wookiee, Chewbacca, is rumored to be an incredibly loyal fighter who only shed blood when necessary, most often in defense of those he called friends. Unassumingly intelligent and resourceful, these natives of the planet Kashyyyk are still viewed as among the most loyal peoples in the known world. Although some Wookiees are feared (based upon their size alone), this race is also one of the gentlest by nature. Although they have a natural propensity towards mechanics, many Wookiees find themselves in the role of Scout and have skill bonuses in Trapping, Creature Taming, Rescue, Warcry, and of course, Wookiee Roar.<br>
<br>
ZABRAKI<br>
There are some who mistakenly assume that the Zabrak is simply a Human with horns. This is absolutely not the case, as the Zabraki have (among other things) an amazing aptitude for mental focus, unlike Humans who tend to be more easily distracted. It is rumored that the most famous Zabrak was an incredibly powerful Sith apprentice, known simply as &quot;Darth Maul.&quot; For him to have been Zabraki is no surprise, as (like a Jedi) a Sith must maintain an incredible amount of mental concentration. Yet despite their most infamous member being a tool for evil, many Zabraki choose peaceful professions. Natives to the planet Iridonia, this race is among the earliest of space explorers. The untenable environment of their homeland has resulted in many Zabraki settlements elsewhere, and this survivalist attitude lends itself naturally to a highly independent people. Like the Twi'lek, the Zabraki have faced great hardship at the hands of the Empire, and yet not every Zabrak supports the Rebellion. Indeed, many of these proud people view the Galactic War as yet another obstacle in the true purpose of life, which is surely exploration and adventure! Each Zabrak speaks her native tongue, Zabraki, as well as Basic, and has an average height that can range from 1.6 to 1.9 meters. Although not warlike in nature, the Zabraki are natural hunters, and have a skill bonus in Defense Vs. Dizzy, Defense Vs. Stun, Defense Vs. Intimidate, Anti-Shock, Equilibrium, and Vitalize.<br>
<br>
Even though each race has a natural affinity for certain skills, you are by no means bound to any one profession, regardless of the race you choose. Also, you decide whether or not your character will become involved in the Galactic War. So even if your character's race has a history with one side or the other, you as an individual are free to choose for yourself…and you can change your mind later if you like!<br>
<br>
The important thing is to create a character you will enjoy playing. And while an Image Designer can help you change your appearance in game later on, your race is something that cannot be changed. So choose carefully, and have fun!<br>
<br>
<br>
CHARACTER APPEARANCE—SOME HINTS<br>
<br>
Now that you've chosen the race of your character it's time to create the perfect look!<br>
<br>
Many players prefer to simply select Random until they find the form that best suits their character. But if you want a more personalized appearance, then all you have to do is experiment. Unlike other MMORPGs, the character appearance options for Star Wars Galaxies are simply amazing, as they offer such an enormous variety of looks, you can try on as many different combinations as you like.<br>
<br>
We won't go through all the possible combinations of looks, as the character appearance process is very intuitive, but there are a few things you might want to know ahead of time. You will see options on the left, some of which have left/right arrow bars. You can either slide the bar, or you can click on the arrows. If the options are incremental (like eyebrow shape, for example) then using the arrows is easier than simply sliding through all the choices. On the right, you will see many color selections. These are great fun to play with for the many different looks. Does your character need bright green lipstick? Go for it! <br>
<br>
But, not all races have all the same options. For example, Twi'lek and Mon Calamari characters do not have hair, yet they do have the option to personalize skin designs and color. Likewise, Zabraki have a facial tattoo selection; other races do not. And only humanoid races have the &quot;Age Slider&quot; which can make them appear young…or old. When you think about it, it makes sense! How could you see the wrinkles on a Wookiee's face through all that hair? <br>
<br>
There are two screens where you can select Skin Color. This allows you a closer look at the skin tone you've selected for your character. If you change the color on the close-up facial screen, it will change the overall skin tone—not just facial.<br>
<br>
If at any point you are unsure of the look, you can always go back to the body type screen to see the full figure and appearance of your character.<br>
<br>
NOTE: If, after experimenting with the appearance of your character, you are not happy and want to try a new race, you can simply select the Back option and you will see a confirmation notice that you are discarding the avatar (figure). If you wish to start all over again, then accept the confirmation. If not, cancel it.<br>
<br>
Once you are satisfied with your character's race and appearance, it's time to select a profession!<br>
<br>
<br>
PROFESSIONS—SOME HINTS<br>
<br>
Some people think this is the most important part of the character creation process, but in actuality it's not! Why is that? Because Star Wars Galaxies is not a class-based game. It's professions-based, and many people choose to have hybrid (combined) professions, rather than merely sticking to one.<br>
<br>
So read through the descriptions carefully (and watch your avatar's reactions!) to see which starting profession looks the most intriguing, but don't worry, as you can always train in another profession should your starting one no longer appeal to you or if you want to add another profession later on.<br>
<br>
Be sure to click on the tabs to see more information about each profession and how it affects your character's attributes, or Stats (statistics). Remember, no race is impaired by its stats, as these numbers change based upon the profession, and each race starts with 300 base points in each stat, with bonus points assigned based upon race. Each stat falls under one of three overarching categories: Health, Action and Mind, also known as HAM. To see detailed descriptions of each stat category, simply click on it and an explanation will appear in the text box.<br>
<br>
NOTE: Health secondary stats are Strength and Constitution. Action include Quickness and Stamina, and secondary Mind stats include Focus and Willpower.<br>
<br>
You have a total of 5,400 stat points, but regardless of your chosen starting profession, you can choose to migrate, or exchange, your stat points. But if you wait to do so in game, it will take a while for the change to take effect.<br>
<br>
NOTE: Each profession is in some way dependent upon other professions (some more so than others), so if you want to be entirely self-sufficient, be prepared to train in several professions. Otherwise, you will find yourself meeting new people and interacting with many players to give and receive the services your character needs in order to advance in your chosen professions.<br>
<br>
Remember, just like appearance, you are not hemmed in by your profession choice(s). You can always surrender a profession's skill (or skills) in order to free up points you wish to spend in another profession. There are enough skill points allotted to each character to potentially master up to three professions.<br>
<br>
<br>
NAMING YOUR CHARACTER<br>
<br>
So you're almost finished creating your character, all you need now is to pick a name! Many players choose to accept an auto-generated name, and this is a great move if you are unsure how to create a name that is appropriate to your character's race and chosen profession.<br>
<br>
If, however, you wish to create your own name, then please remember that Star Wars Galaxies is a role-playing game, and as such has a fairly strict naming policy, as detailed in the Star Wars Galaxies site:<br>
<br>
<br>
SW Official FAQ<br>
&quot;3.05 What rules will you allow for character names?<br>
For most species, we allow a first and a last name-the first name has to be unique. Some species only have first names, and some species are allowed to have hyphens or apostrophes in their name. Numbers and other punctuation are not allowed, and we will also follow strict capitalization rules. We will enforce name constraints to help promote a Star Wars atmosphere. You will not see LuukSkywalker777 running around.&quot;<br>
So remember, if you are in doubt as to whether your desired name is appropriate to the Star Wars setting, ask yourself if George Lucas would allow such a name for one of the characters in his films. If the answer is YES! Then you've got your name and it's time to log in to the tutorial and learn how to get around the game, so you can PLAY!<br>
<br>
<br>
GETTING STARTED—AFTER THE TUTORIAL<br>
<br>
<br>
MOVEMENT <br>
As you saw in the tutorial, SWG has a unique keyboard command list (also known as keymap, or keybind) that controls everything from movement to chatting. Some players prefer to use the game's existing keymap, as it is designed for the most ease of use in this game. Yet others may prefer a more personalized layout of key functions, and luckily SWG allows for this—and it's easy to do!<br>
<br>
This ability for complete personalization of playing preferences is something that sets SWG light-years apart from other online games. If you want to see a detailed layout of your keymap, simply open your Options screen and you will see a Controls option. Click on this and you will see &quot;Keymap.&quot;<br>
<br>
Select this option and the list of functions and their corresponding keys will be displayed. You will also see a drop-down menu to &quot;Load a Standard Keymap.&quot; This allows you to select from other game-style keymaps, like EQ (EverQuest) style, for example. If you are an EQ or DAoC player, then the EQ-style keymap is probably closest to what you're used to. There is also a First-Person Shooter style and an Isometric (UO) style to choose from.<br>
<br>
NOTE: If you choose to select a keymap other then the SWG one, you may still need to re-map (clear and re-bind) some keys to suit your personal preferences.<br>
<br>
Look at each function (they are separated by category tabs) to see if the key(s) bound to the functions are what you want, If not, you must clear the current binding before re-mapping it. If you do not do this, then there will be multiple keys mapped to the same function, something that can cause frustration later on. Once you're satisfied with your keymap, select OK, then DONE.<br>
<br>
NOTE: There are some preferences that need to be reset each time you enter the game, if you so desire. These include enabling your Lamp, turning Chase Camera on, and tabbing off mouselook.<br>
<br>
WHAT IS MODAL CHAT?<br>
The SWG keymap is set up so that as soon as you begin typing, the text automatically appears in your chat window. This means that your function keys will nearly always be preceded by another key, such CTRL or SHIFT.<br>
<br>
If you remap your function keys so that there is no preceding keystroke (simply using &quot;L&quot; for Lamp, rather than &quot;CTRL+L&quot; for instance) then you will need a keystroke to precede anything you wish to type in chat. For most players this keystroke is the ENTER key. So modal chat means you hit ENTER (or another designated key of your choice) then you type what it is you wish to say. <br>
<br>
If you are emoting (indicating an action rather than speaking) then you will type a forward slash (/) followed by the word, &quot;emote&quot; then the action you wish to perform. Therefore if you type &quot;/emote cheers wildly&quot; then others around you will see your character cheering wildly!<br>
<br>
BUT WHAT EXACTLY IS AN EMOTE?<br>
An emote is an action your character performs to indicate movement or emotion. In SWG, emotes usually carry a visible movement. Not all games have a visible movement or action associated with each emote. However, Star Wars Galaxies has unique ability to infer movement based upon keywords you type.<br>
<br>
NOTE: If you do not wish your character to move based upon what he says or does, then open your Options screen and under the CHAT tab you will see an option to enable or disable &quot;Perform actions while speaking.&quot;<br>
<br>
Many players will find themselves automatically typing an emote simply out of habit, but in actuality this may be unnecessary! SWG has perhaps the most extensive list of pre-set emotes to choose from, than any other MMORPG. To view your list of emotes, select your Abilities and Commands option, and a window will open with a detailed list (again, separated by categorized tabs) with the entire list of actions your character can perform.<br>
<br>
HOW CAN I QUICKLY ACCESS AN ACTION OR EMOTE?<br>
You can always drag an icon from your Abilities and Commands screen to your Toolbar (also referred to as &quot;hotkey bar,&quot; or simply &quot;hotkeys&quot;), then all you have to do is click on the hotkey in order to perform the action.<br>
<br>
NOTE: If you place your cursor on the bottom line of your Toolbar, you will see an up/down arrow appear. If you click and drag downward, a second row of hotkeys will appear. This effectively doubles your toolbar!<br>
<br>
Remember, when in doubt, use your Holocron! When you are first starting out, this is your best friend in game, and greatest teacher, so use it lots!<br>
<br>
<br>
GETTING AROUND—EXPLORATION AND THINGS TO DO<br>
<br>
So you've created your character, gone through the tutorial, and personalized your game settings…now it's time to explore!<br>
<br>
CITIES<br>
At the end of the tutorial, you selected a starting city and planet. Now that you are in your starting city, it's a good idea to do a bit of exploring and familiarize yourself with that city, as you will be there at least until you've run to another location, or earned enough credits to transport elsewhere.<br>
<br>
NOTE: Not every planet was listed on your destination screen, and for good reason, as some planets are very harsh and have nasty critters that can easily incapacitate or kill a Novice. These planets are better for exploring with groups, or when you have a bit more experience in your Profession(s).<br>
<br>
In your keymap list (found in your Options screen), you may have noticed a function called Radar Map. This is your overhead (or overlay) city map, but it is called radar because it is really a larger-scale version of the tiny radar compass located in the bottom-left of your screen. To view your Radar Map, simply press the key assigned to it (default CTRL+M), and you will see a large overlay map showing green buildings and tiny arrows. These arrows indicate players, NPCs and MOBs.<br>
<br>
NPCs are Non-Player Characters, and are represented as white arrows in your city map, unless they are attackable, in which case they are red. MOBs (also known as Mobiles, or Mobile Objects) are creatures that are attackable. NPCs that are unfriendly or attackable are also called MOBs. Like NPC MOBs, creature MOBs are represented in red on your city map. Other Player Characters (PCs) are shown in light blue.<br>
<br>
When you open your city map, you will see a small, darker blue arrow in the middle, directly over your character. This represents you. When you move, you will see the blue arrow move along the city map. Some buildings will have names displayed next to them—this is very handy when you want to find a particular place, like a Bank or a Cantina, for example. Each building's entrance or door is represented by a small blue line. Some buildings have more than one entryway, and any closed doorways will automatically open upon your approach, if that building is accessible to you. When you enter a building, you will notice your overhead map changes to a smaller map that only shows the interior of the building and any characters in that building.<br>
<br>
NOTE: If at any time you wish to zoom in or out on your overhead city radar map, you need only to hold down your CTRL key and scroll with your mouse wheel.<br>
<br>
THINGS TO DO FIRST<br>
Once you're familiar with using your overhead map, it's time to find the cloning facility. Cloning is a great way to safeguard your character's health and possessions. When you clone in a city, you are effectively binding your character to that location, which means that if you were to die (and as a Novice, you receive three freebies, meaning you will not have to activate a clone until your third death), you will return to your city's cloning facility, with more health than if you were to clone to another location.<br>
<br>
In addition, you will see there are Insurance Terminals in the Cloning Facility. You do not have to insure your beginning items (such as clothing and weapon, for example), as you can see by selecting to insure one item at a time. The beginning items will have a credit cost of zero, meaning they are already insured.<br>
<br>
NOTE: Each time you activate a clone after death, you will need to re-insure items in your inventory that you wish to keep. Any items not insured will remain on your corpse.<br>
<br>
Once you have bound your clone and double-checked your insured items, you can choose to either remain in the city and explore some more, or you can start earning some credits!<br>
<br>
<br>
MAKING MONEY—MISSIONS AND TASKS<br>
<br>
Now that you've learned how to navigate your way around and done a bit of exploring, it's time to learn how earn some cash!<br>
<br>
MISSIONS<br>
In every city you will find small terminals with red screens, called Mission Terminals. Often, there will be two or more terminals clustered together, or located in close proximity to each other (one on the left side of a building, another on the right side, for example).<br>
<br>
When you find a mission terminal, target it, click and hold to display the radial menu, and select the Use option. After loading, the list of missions will be displayed. You can choose between the Destroy and Delivery tabs on your mission screen.<br>
<br>
Destroy missions involve locating a MOB or an NPC which must be killed. Delivery missions involve traveling short or long distances to deliver a package or message to an NPC. Characters with strong combat skills may prefer Destroy missions, whereas characters not focused in combat often choose Delivery instead. Remember though, that neither type of mission is guaranteed to keep you safe — but the Delivery missions tend to keep you within city limits, which is sometimes a safer place to be.<br>
<br>
You can select the Mission Details option to learn more about a mission before you choose to accept or decline it. Keep in mind that the larger the reward, the more difficult the target or the farther you must travel to complete the mission. At least in the beginning, it is better to run several smaller missions to begin earning money than to risk incapacitation or death by selecting a high reward. <br>
<br>
NOTE: Remember that you are only allowed three freebies as a Novice. After that, a death will mean clone-activation, and retrieving uninsured items from the corpse you left behind can be time-consuming.<br>
<br>
Should none of the missions listed intrigue you, simply select the Refresh option and a new list of missions will be presented. Once you find an appealing mission, click Accept Mission, and your Datapad will automatically open on your screen, with a waypoint for that mission highlighted.<br>
<br>
NOTE: Performing a Mission as a group results in faction and credits being distributed evenly among the group members.<br>
<br>
Both Destroy and Delivery missions follow the same steps once you've accepted:<br>
<br>
1. A waypoint appears within that city and an orange arrow will appear on your screen to lead you to your waypoint. <br>
<br>
NOTE: If you have a difficult time seeing the beacon to your waypoint, pan your camera up, as sometimes taller building can obscure your view. If it is still not visible, you may be out of range.<br>
<br>
2. This waypoint will lead you to the NPC who listed her mission in the terminal system.<br>
<br>
3. When you locate the NPC (don't worry as she'll be in the same city as the terminal), simply target, click and hold for the radial menu and select Converse.<br>
<br>
4. The NPC will speak to you, and once finished, a new waypoint will appear in your Datapad and on-screen, with another orange arrow. <br>
<br>
NOTE: Open your planetary map (default CTRL+V) and it will show you where your new waypoint is located. If it is nearer to another city on that planet, you may want to take a shuttle rather than running. Some missions that involve travel to another city will compensate you with a few more credits than you spent on taking a shuttle. Check the reward before you purchase a ticket, though. For more information on shuttles, see the TAKING A TRIP section.<br>
<br>
If you are on a Destroy mission, you must target, attack, and kill the MOB or NPC that is highlighted within your waypoint. If you are on a Delivery mission, you must target and converse with the highlighted NPC.<br>
<br>
If there is no NPC in the highlighted waypoint, he may have wandered off. Try conversing with NPCs close to the waypoint. If none of them are your target, then disable and re-enable your waypoint. If this still does not work, you may need to try logging out and logging back in. This will automatically re-set your waypoint to the NPC's current location.<br>
<br>
You do not have to return to the original NPC, city, nor mission terminal to receive your reward. Your mission is completed as soon as you have interacted with (Delivery) or killed (Destroy) the target. The credits you earned as a reward are automatically deposited into your bank account, and a message verifying this will appear on your screen once the mission is complete.<br>
<br>
NOTE: You can accept up to two missions at once. Highlight which mission's waypoint you wish to use, and only one orange arrow and one waypoint will be visible to you.<br>
<br>
In order to quickly locate mission terminals, you may want to set a new waypoint at each mission terminal location. To do so, simply open your datapad and choose the &quot;Set New Waypoint&quot; option. Once the waypoint is created, click and hold to display the &quot;Set Name&quot; option on the radial menu. This way you can name your waypoint with the terminal type and city of origin.<br>
<br>
IMPERIAL MISSIONS<br>
In some cities where the Empire's presence is strong, you may find Imperial Mission Terminals. These are similar to standard Mission Terminals, but have blue screens instead of red, and are a slightly different shape.<br>
<br>
NOTE: Accepting and completing a mission from an Imperial terminal will give you points towards your Imperial Faction. If you wish to remain Neutral to both sides, or plan to join the Rebellion, you should consider carefully before accepting Imperial missions.<br>
<br>
Sometimes you will see an Imperial Recruiter (NPC) stationed nearby these terminals. If you are interested in joining the Empire's fight, simply converse with the recruitment officer to learn more.<br>
<br>
REBEL ALLIANCE MISSIONS<br>
Scattered throughout some cities, you may find Rebellion Mission Terminals. These too have blue screens instead of red, but are shaped differently than Imperial Terminals, and often have Rebel flags hanging over or near them.<br>
<br>
NOTE: As with Imperial missions, completing a Rebel mission will give you points towards your Rebel Faction. If you want to remain Neutral or plan to join the Empire, think twice before you accept a Rebel mission.<br>
<br>
As with Imperial Mission Terminals, sometimes there is a Rebel Recruiter (NPC) stationed nearby Alliance terminals. Converse with the recruitment officer to learn more about joining the Rebellion.<br>
<br>
NOTE: If you choose to save a waypoint to a Rebel terminal or base (especially outside a city's limits), be warned that when you return, it may no longer be there, as the Rebellion is constantly shifting locations in attempt to escape detection by the Empire.<br>
<br>
BOUNTY HUNTER MISSIONS<br>
Looking for a Bounty Hunter Mission Terminal? These are scattered sparingly throughout the cities, and have green screens instead of red. Accepting a Bounty Hunter Mission will give you experience towards this skill.<br>
<br>
DESTROYING (DELETING) MISSIONS<br>
No matter how far you've gotten in a mission given to you by a terminal, you can always choose to &quot;destroy&quot; (decline) the mission. Simply open your Datapad, highlight the mission on your waypoint list, and select Mission Details. There you will see the option to Destroy Mission. After you select this, a confirmation window will appear asking if you really want to delete this mission. <br>
<br>
NOTE: There is no penalty for destroying a mission, though you will no longer be able to finish and collect your reward.<br>
<br>
TASKS<br>
There are NPCs in the cities, and some out in the less-populated areas, who can give you missions which are called Tasks. These are sometimes also referred to as &quot;Gopher Missions&quot; or &quot;NPC Missions.&quot; <br>
<br>
When you click on an NPC, hold your mouse button to activate the radial menu. If you see the option to Converse, then the NPC may have a task for you. Oftentimes these NPCs' names will be displayed in yellow (and are attackable). Do not choose the Attack option if you wish to obtain a task. Converse with the NPC and if you wish to do so, you can choose to help him. When performing a task, you may be required to kill a MOB, run an errand, or even scout (recon) or survey an area. <br>
<br>
Be sure to read carefully what the NPC has to tell you, as you may not be able to complete the task. For example, if you are unable to use a /survey skill, then accepting a task from an NPC to survey an area would be useless to you.<br>
<br>
Once you've accepted the task, a blue arrow will appear on your screen, pointing you to your target waypoint. Unlike missions, tasks do not always have preset monetary rewards; that is, you may receive credits—or—item(s) from the NPC once the task is finished, but you may not find out precisely what the reward is until you've completed your task. Also unlike standard missions, completing a task often involves returning to the NPC in order to receive your reward.<br>
<br>
NOTE: If the NPC is flagged as Rebel or Imperial, your task will earn you faction points.<br>
<br>
If after accepting the task you decide that you no longer wish to perform it, simply destroy the waypoint in your datapad.<br>
<br>
NOTE: As with Missions, there is no penalty for destroying a task, though you will no longer be able to finish and collect your reward.<br>
<br>
So if you want to learn your way around cities and earn credits at the same time, accept Delivery missions from the terminals. If you want to explore the lands outside, try a Destroy mission. And if you want to be a bit more adventurous, then try tasking, as you'll never know what you might discover! <br>
<br>
Plus, there are many places in the Star Wars Galaxies (like Jabba's Palace, for example) that are only accessible through tasks.<br>
<br>
The bottom line is there are entire galaxies out there to explore, all filled with innumerable surprises, and missions and tasking are great ways to get started in your journey through the Star Wars Universe.<br>
<br>
<br>
VENTURING OUT—LEAVING THE CITY<br>
<br>
Whether you're leaving the city to perform a mission, do a bit of exploring, or earn some experience in your chosen professions, there are a few things you should know ahead of time.<br>
<br>
<br>
MAPS AND MOBS<br>
When you leave a city's perimeter, you can rely on three maps to help you navigate your way around. The Radar (overhead) Map (default CTRL+M) gives you an overlay of objects (including players, etc.) around you.<br>
<br>
The Planetary Map (default CTRL+V) will show your location on the planet. You can use the slider bar to zoom in and out. If you have a waypoint activated, this will show up on the planetary map.<br>
<br>
Your Compass Radar in the bottom-left corner of your screen is a great static tool for exploring, as it not only tells you which direction you're heading (the three lines symbol indicates what we would traditionally think of as North), but it shows characters and structures as well.<br>
<br>
You can zoom in or out by pressing the (+) and (-) buttons on the compass. The numbers on the compass indicate your latitude and longitude on that planet, and are helpful in communicating to others where your loc (location) is.<br>
<br>
NOTE: If you like, you can set a waypoint to your location and then email (default CTRL+E) that waypoint to another player, so that he can find his way to you.<br>
<br>
As with your overlay radar map, the compass indicates (in dots rather than arrows) other characters as light blue, friendly NPCs as white, and MOBs as red. But unlike the radar map, the radar compass shows structures and MOB lairs as well. If you see a yellow square on your compass, this represents a dwelling where MOBs live. Sometimes it is an old log or a mound, for example, and (like you did with the debris in the tutorial) you can shoot at a lair to destroy it. Be warned, however, if there are MOBs in close proximity to the lair, they are protecting it, and all the MOBs will aggro you (i.e., attack in force).<br>
<br>
If you are alone and not very skilled at defending yourself, there's a good chance you will be incapacitated, or killed if a MOB strikes you a deathblow. If several come at once, it's wise to use your /burstrun to escape them.<br>
<br>
Structures you may see include Rebel or Imperial bases, player-made harvesters, factories, or even player houses. If you see a structure with red dots nearby, this could be an unfriendly NPC camp, and these will often KoS (Kill on Sight) and will aggro you. When in doubt, skirt around the red dots, unless of course you are hunting, in which case, it's best to evaluate, or con (consider) the MOB before attacking it.<br>
<br>
CONSIDERING MOBS<br>
When you click on a MOB, you will see a tiny icon next to its name. The color of this icon indicates the MOB's ability to defend itself against you, should you attack it. If you are not yet familiar with what the colors mean (or you are colorblind), you can always target the MOB and type /consider. <br>
<br>
NOTE: Unlike other MMORPGs, con color in SWG is not based upon your character's &quot;level&quot; (as SWG is not level-based). Rather the color of the MOB is based upon the weapon you have equipped, as well as your skill in using that weapon.<br>
<br>
While using the /consider command gives you a definite idea of how difficult the MOB is, the icon color can be a quick reference tool as well:<br>
Green - Very easy to kill, near 100% chance of success<br>
Blue - Not as easy, but still doable (high probability of success)<br>
White - Even with you, about a 50/50 chance of killing it<br>
Yellow - Stronger than you, bring along a friend to help<br>
Red - Do not attempt this alone, as you will most likely die<br>
<br>
NOTE: To learn more about Combat, refer to that section in your Holocron.<br>
<br>
FINDING RESOURCES<br>
There are three ways to find resources: Surveying for a particular resource (the /survey skill is used by members of the Artisan profession to find both organic and inorganic resources needed to craft various items and their components), Foraging in an area (members of the Medic profession use /medicalForage to acquire organics), and lastly by Harvesting the corpse of a MOB (Scouts can use this skill to acquire many organic components).<br>
<br>
NOTE: Harvesting is not to be confused with Looting a corpse, as not every class receives the option to /harvest when a corpse is targeted and its radial menu appears.<br>
<br>
To learn more about the ways to find (and gather) components, see your Holocron's section titled Resources for details.<br>
<br>
PLAYER-MADE CAMPS<br>
In addition to /harvesting, players who've trained in the Scout profession also have the ability to make Camps, which is a nice place to rest after hunting. And if you have a Medic along, she can heal your damage and wounds while in a camp. Or you can just rest a bit and socialize after the hunt. If you like, you can even target a chair, and use the /sit command to have your character actually sit in the chair!<br>
<br>
Camps are great places to regroup and med (meditate, or rest so that your character can start to &quot;feel better&quot;), plus, much like when you use stimpacks from a Medic, or you consume food an Artisan crafts for you, a Scout gains experience for camps he builds, which helps him advance in his profession! The bottom line is that you don't always have to return immediately to the city after a hunt. Oftentimes you can rest up in a camp, then head back out again until you are ready (or have incurred enough injuries) to return to town.<br>
<br>
When you are ready to return to town, use your planetary map to see which direction you need to go. Be sure to keep one eye on your compass, though, as you may not want to run into a bunch of aggro MOBs on your way back!<br>
<br>
<br>
AFTER THE HUNT—HEALING<br>
<br>
Tired of hunting? Ready to head back to town? Feeling a bit fatigued from the battle, or perhaps you've got some pesky wounds that need tending? It's time for some healing! <br>
<br>
There are three different types of maladies that require healing: Damage, Wounds and Disease. In the upper left corner of your screen is your HAM bar (Health, Action, Mind). If you see white at the ends of any of the three bars, then you have Damage. This can be healed anywhere by anyone (including yourself) with a stimpack. You can either purchase pre-made stimpacks from players, or someone with Medic skills can make and use stimpacks to heal you. <br>
<br>
But if there is black on any of the bars, then you have Wounds and these can only be healed by Entertainers and Medics. If you suffer damage at regular intervals and healing doesn't help, then you may be diseased. This can be healed only by a high level Medic, known as a Doctor. <br>
<br>
Sometimes you may be find yourself in a camp with a Medic, which means you're in luck for any HA wounds. But if like most players, you need to go to town to be healed, then don't fret—it's easy to do.<br>
<br>
ENTERTAINERS<br>
There are areas in the cities called Cantinas, where Entertainers perform. While sometimes these cantinas are hidden in hotels, most of the time they are in stand-alone buildings that will show up on your city map. There are also some outdoor performance areas in the larger cities, but when in doubt, find the cantina. When you return to town from a hunt, check your character stat page (default CTRL+C) to see how much Battle Fatigue and/or Wounds you've suffered.<br>
<br>
Each time you are hit in combat, you incur Battle Fatigue and Health, Action or Mind (HAM) damage. When you are incapacitated or require cloning, you can suffer from secondary HAM damage (like Strength or Constitution, for example). When you open your character stat page, you will your Battle Fatigue see in large print. If it is zero (0) then you're fine. If not, then you'll need to see an Entertainer for healing. Look at your Mind bar (it's the blue one). Is there black showing at the end of the bar? Then you have Mind wounds, and only an Entertainer can heal them.<br>
<br>
Head into a cantina and you will see performers playing music and/or dancing. Simply sitting in a cantina will not heal you. You must click on an Entertainer and select either Watch or Listen from the radial menu that appears. Once you do this, sit back and enjoy the show! In no time your Battle Fatigue and Mind wounds will heal.<br>
<br>
NOTE: While you're being healed, look through your Macros sheet (default CTRL+A), for some fun emotes you can use while in a cantina enjoying the entertainment.<br>
<br>
Please remember that the Entertainers don't work for free. Before you head to the cantina, you might want to stop off at the bank so you have plenty of credits in-hand and can /tip the performer(s) who take the time to heal you.<br>
<br>
NOTE: For more information on paying Entertainers for their services, see the TIPPING &amp; TRADING section.<br>
<br>
When your Battle Fatigue and Mind wounds are back to zero (0), it's time to head to a Medical Facility (sometimes called a hospital) to have your Health and Action wounds healed.<br>
<br>
NOTE: Always have your Battle Fatigue and Mind wounds healed before you head to the hospital, as your Health and Action wounds will heal much faster if you do!<br>
<br>
In the same way that only Entertainers can heal your Mind wounds and Battle Fatigue, only members of the Medic profession can heal your Health and Action wounds.<br>
<br>
<br>
MEDICS<br>
Once you find a Medical Center or hospital, head in and you will see player Medics. As with everything else in game, using the services of other players helps not only to boost the player-driven economy and interaction of the game, but it also helps others increase the skills in their professions. In most medical facilities, you may find other players ahead of you in need of healing. While at the moment there is no set standard for being healed, it is usually done on a first-come, first-served basis. And as with any service, it is best to ask politely and then be prepared to wait your turn. Remember that Medics have to pay for and/or craft their supplies, so you should always offer to pay them for their heals.<br>
<br>
NOTE: For more information on paying Medics for their services, see the TIPPING &amp; TRADING section.<br>
<br>
When a Medic targets your character, she will see your HAM bar displayed. If there is any Mind Damage, more than likely she will ask you to visit the cantina and have it healed first. By doing so, it not only speeds up your healing time in the hospital, but it is more economical too. If you like, you can /tip a Medic or offer to trade some supplies or even services in exchange for heals. Oftentimes Medics are happy to receive organics or inorganics as payment, in lieu of cash. But you should never assume this to be the case—always offer her the choice if you can afford it. Once a Medic has acknowledged you and agreed to heal you, all you have to do is sit and wait. It's that easy! <br>
<br>
NOTE: Remember, you may have to wait in line, or wait for the Medic to craft the medical packs needed, but being polite will make your time in the hospital more pleasant, guaranteed.<br>
<br>
If you have secondary Health and Action wounds from cloning, you should tell the Medic ahead of time, as she will not see secondary wounds from your HAM bar. If you are unsure about secondary wounds, then open your character stat sheet to see if there are any wound numbers listed. Most Novice Medics cannot heal secondary wounds, and will tell you they lack the skill. If this is the case, then you can seek out a higher-level Medic or Doctor in that facility or elsewhere, if none are available.<br>
<br>
You do not have to have only one Medic heal you either. Several may work on you at once. You will know this is the case when you see different names appear on your screen with the notice that you are being healed. If the Medics have agreed to share heals, it's nice to split the /tip or payment between them. If however only one agreed to heal you and does the majority of your healing, then you are only obliged to /tip him. It's always nice to have a clear understanding of who will be healing you, so that you can offer to pay ahead of time. This will also help the Medics, as it can get confusing when a hospital is crowded.<br>
<br>
Should you have a Disease, you will have to find a very high level healer to cure you. Usually you can just ask if there are any healers who can cure disease, and if so, one will take care of you. If not, then you may have to just wait it out.<br>
<br>
If there are no Medics in the facility, just sit awhile, and your wounds will begin to heal very slowly.<br>
<br>
NOTE: Remember that Entertainers can perform in cantinas, some hotels, and select outdoor stages; Medics can heal in medical facilities, hospitals, camps, or when accompanied by a medical droid.<br>
<br>
So explore and hunt all you like, because even if you require cloning, you can always visit your local Entertainer and Medic for some healing to get you back on your feet quickly and easily.<br>
<br>
<br>
INTERACTING WITH OTHER PLAYERS—TRADING AND TIPPING<br>
<br>
Have an item you no longer need? Want to tip your healers? Trading and tipping are very easy to do, and are a necessity in the Star Wars Galaxies' trade-oriented culture.<br>
<br>
TRADING<br>
If you wish to Trade with another player, simply target and hold your mouse on his character to access the radial menu, until you see the Start Trading option. Select this option (or choose the corresponding number) and a notice will automatically appear on the other player's screen letting him know you wish to trade with him.<br>
<br>
When the player sees this notice, he then must target your character and select the trade option before a trade window is activated between you. Once the trade window appears, this lets you know that he has agreed to trade.<br>
<br>
If you wish to give him an item from your inventory, open your inventory (default CTRL+I) and drag the item to your side of the trade window.<br>
<br>
NOTE: When you drag an item from your inventory be sure to do so quickly, as clicking and holding the item before dragging will cause the radial menu to appear. Don't worry, as it only takes a few tries to get the hang of it.<br>
<br>
If you wish to give the player credits, place your cursor in the Credits box and type the number you wish to give. Once you've finished placing the items and/or credits you wish to trade in your window, check the OK box.<br>
<br>
NOTE: Any credits you give another player must come from the amount of money you have in hand. If necessary, you may have to first withdraw some from your bank to complete your trade satisfactorily.<br>
<br>
If the other player has any items/credits to give you, he will do the same. Once you're both satisfied with the trade, and both of you have checked OK, then click the Accept Trade button to complete the trade. Remember, you can only trade with one player at a time.<br>
<br>
While it may initially sound a bit complicated, trading with others is really a simple process and one you'll be comfortable with in no time. Sometimes players may not see the notice that you wish to trade with them (especially if they are busy crafting, for example). Because of this, it's a good idea to let them know via /tell or /say that you wish to trade with them. Don't assume that a player's lack of response to your offered trade means he is not interested.<br>
<br>
TIPPING<br>
If you do not need to trade items, but only wish to give someone credits, you can do so using the /tip command. This is very handy, especially when you wish to give a healer some credits in exchange for his service, or when you wish to pay someone quickly for an item. Type /tip to give someone a monetary tip. It's that easy!<br>
<br>
NOTE: As with Trade, using the /tip command only works for cash-in-hand, unless you type: /tip bank. Be sure to include the word, &quot;bank&quot; at the end of the command line if you do not want the credits to come out of your cash in hand.<br>
<br>
Say you have Battle Fatigue and you go to a cantina to have it healed. While there, you /listen to an entertainer named Nighten, and this removes your Battle Fatigue, healing your Mind Damage. As payment for her services you decide you want to tip her 100 credits out of pocket. Rather than opening a trade window with her (she's busy dancing, after all), type this: /tip Nighten 100 (remember to leave a space in between each word). This will automatically deduct 100 credits from your inventory and add it to hers. A message will appear on her screen letting her know that you have tipped her 100 credits. <br>
<br>
Because players may sometimes be busy performing other tasks, they may miss your tip notification on their screen. While most people will offer thanks for tips, if one doesn't, it may mean she simply did not realize you tipped her. If this happens and you want the player to know you did in fact tip her, this is where role-playing can come in handy. You can always /emote that you offered her a tip in exchange for her kind healing, etc., in a manner that confirms you did in effect pay her for her services. Responding in this way also promotes the role-playing atmosphere that is inherent to the game.<br>
<br>
HOW MUCH TO TRADE OR TIP?<br>
There are many different views on what an appropriate trade or tip is for the services of others. While many Artisans, for example, will tell you up-front how much they want in exchange for a crafted item, not all professions have this option.<br>
<br>
Healers, for example, do not have a set system in place for requiring payment up front. So oftentimes Entertainers or Medics may find themselves performing a service for free, and yet they (like all professions) can use credits or items in order to advance further in their trade. While you are not required to pay in advance for heals, you should (as with any service) always offer to pay for any healing you receive, and it's good to offer before you are healed, as this assures the healer that his services are valued.<br>
<br>
The amount you offer can be credits (as in a /tip) or items. Many Medics, for example, prefer organic or inorganic materials to credits, and so offering these items in trade for being healed is often a very good way to pay your healer. If you do not have any materials, or are low on credits, you can always offer other items or even services in trade. Use your skills when possible—if you are an Artisan, then perhaps an Entertainer would accept a brightly-colored jacket in exchange for healing your battle fatigue.<br>
<br>
Perhaps a Medic would like some rejuvenating food or drink in exchange for his services. Or, if you are healer, then you can offer to heal others' wounds in exchange for their services. Same goes with all professions. Trade or tip when you can, but using your own skills can often work as well! <br>
<br>
NOTE: Don't forget about players who are kind enough to train you in your profession. These folks should not be expected to assist you for free, so be sure to offer them a tip or service whenever you can.<br>
<br>
While the possibilities of payment are endless, the most important thing is to tip what you can, and if you have nothing to give then it's common courtesy to let others know up front, and to always offer thanks if they are willing to serve you for free. So ask nicely for the services of others, offer to pay them however you can, and remember to thank them afterwards. This way everyone wins! <br>
<br>
<br>
TAKING A TRIP—WHAT TO BRING AND HOW TO GET THERE<br>
<br>
So you’ve seen all there to see in your starting city and surrounding areas? Time to take a trip!<br>
<br>
BANKING BEFORE YOU GO<br>
Planning a quick vacation? Want to travel light? Then join a bank in your starting city and deposit into the bank’s Safety Deposit any items you don’t wish to carry in your inventory (default CTRL+I).<br>
<br>
To join a bank, simply target one of the terminals until you see the radial menu. Select the option to join the bank and once you have done so, you will see a new option on the radial menu for the Safety Deposit.<br>
<br>
NOTE: If you have already joined a bank but can’t recall which one, simply open your character stat sheet (default CTRL+C) and select the Personal tab. Your bank will be listed there. You cannot join a new bank until you have quit your old one.<br>
<br>
If you are just planning on taking a shuttle to another city on the same planet, you need not worry about quitting your bank. But if you leave the planet (even to travel to its moon, for instance) you will not be able to access any of your stored items unless you have quit the bank. So remember, while credits are automatically available from any bank terminal regardless of planet, items stored in a safety deposit are only accessible while on that planet.<br>
<br>
When you leave a bank, all items stored in your safety deposit box must be carried in your inventory in order to transfer them to a new bank on another planet. If you do not have immediate space in your inventory to carry your stored items with you, there are several things you can do:<br>
<br>
1. Don’t quit your bank, just leave all non-essential items stored until you are able to return to that planet.<br>
<br>
2. Buy some satchels, cargo pockets and/or backpacks and load these up with the items you wish to transfer to a new bank.<br>
<br>
3. If you run out of room, then you can try to talk a friend into helping you carry some of your items to the planetary destination of your choice.<br>
<br>
4. If you have packed everything you need to take on your trip, and still have some items left over, you can sell them to other players, give them away, or simply destroy them.<br>
<br>
So if your trip is a quick one, or you don’t think you’ll need the items in your bank, don’t worry about it! But if you are unsure about how long you will be gone, then it’s a wise move to quit your bank and join a new one at your arrival.<br>
<br>
NOTE: There are no fees for joining or leaving a bank.<br>
<br>
All packed? Ready to go? Now you need a destination!<br>
<br>
SHUTTLE PORTS<br>
When you open your radar (city) map, you will see two transportation stations: the Shuttle Port and the Star Port. While you can use a star transport (also called a space transport) to travel between cities on the same planet, many players find it more convenient (and less expensive) to use a shuttle instead.<br>
<br>
A shuttle port is a bit like a bus station. There’s a Travel Terminal on one corner that sells tickets, and a droid (known as the Ticket Collector) on the other. To purchase a ticket, target the travel terminal and a planetary map will load, along with a drop-down menu of destination choices.<br>
<br>
NOTE: Remember, shuttles only travel from city to city; if you wish to travel to another planet, you must use a star port terminal to do so.<br>
<br>
You will notice that you can choose either shuttle port(s) or star port(s) as your destination. Traveling to a shuttle port may be cheaper, but not necessarily more convenient. It really depends upon where you need to go and how much you want to spend.<br>
<br>
Once you’ve selected your city of destination (either via clicking the city or selecting from the drop-down menu), you will get a confirmation message of your purchase, and a ticket will appear in your inventory. Next, target the ticket collector and select the Use option from the radial menu. You will receive a message letting you know when the next shuttle will be ready. There is a ten-minute wait between shuttles, so if you buy your ticket immediately after the last shuttle has departed, you will have plenty of time to socialize, get a quick drink, craft a bit, or even survey.<br>
<br>
NOTE: You are under no obligation to use your ticket immediately. You can save it for later use, if you so desire.<br>
<br>
You will be able to see your shuttle when it lands, and the last minute or so of your wait allows the shuttle crew time to clean and ready their ship for its new passengers. Once the shuttle is ready for take-off, target the ticket collector again and select your destination. You will immediately be transported to your destination of choice. So although there is sometimes a brief wait for the transport to arrive, the journey itself takes mere seconds.<br>
<br>
STAR PORTS<br>
While you can use the space transports to travel between star ports, most often than not they are used for inter-planetary travel. When entering a star port, wind your way to a main room where you will see rows of travel terminals along the wall. These ticket terminals work exactly as the ones at shuttle ports, and you'll notice they too have an option to view a Galactic Map.<br>
<br>
If you are traveling off-world, select this option and you will see all the planets, including those that may not be accessible from this star port. Like a planetary map on shuttle terminals, you can select your destination by targeting a planet on the galactic map, or by selecting from the drop-down menu. Depending upon your destination, you should see several city (and port) locations you can choose from. Select one and purchase a ticket. If you do not see your planet of choice, then it is not accessible from that star port, and you must travel to another planet closer to the one you want to visit, in order to get there.<br>
<br>
NOTE: A moon is only accessible from the star port of its planet, so if you are not able to access the galactic map while on a moon, it simply means the only off-world destination you can select is the moon's planet.<br>
<br>
Once you've decided upon a ticket to buy, a message will appear verifying the price and ticket sale. When you are ready to go, follow the hallway until you reach the open entryway to the launch pad. Like shuttles, star transports can take up to ten minutes to arrive, so take advantage of your wait, when there is one. Once your ship arrives, select the Use option on the droid then your destination, and you will be immediately transported to your city of choice.<br>
<br>
NOTE: If you are flagged as having overt faction, watch out! There are some players who would take advantage of new arrivals in cities.<br>
<br>
So now you've packed, taken care of your banking needs, and know the ins and outs of space travel. Enjoy your trip, and Bon Voyage! <br>
