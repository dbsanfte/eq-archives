FAILURE TO ACT RESPONSIBLY AND COMPLY WITH THESE RULES WITHIN STAR WARS GALAXIES AND THE OFFICIAL STAR WARS GALAXIES FORUMS MAY RESULT IN THE TERMINATION OF YOUR ACCOUNT WITHOUT ANY REFUND OF ANY KIND.<br>
<br>
Rules of Conduct <br>
<br>
1. You may not harass or threaten other players. <br>
2. You may not use any sexually explicit, harmful, threatening, abusive, defamatory, obscene, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive language. <br>
3. You may not impersonate any Sony Online Entertainment, Sony Computer Entertainment of America, LucasArts, or Lucasfilm Entertainment Company employee, past or present, including any Customer Support personnel. <br>
4. You may not violate any local, state, national or international law or regulation. <br>
5. You may not modify any part of the Star Wars Galaxies client, servers, or any part of the Star Wars Galaxies website located at www.starwarsgalaxies.com. <br>
6. You may not arrange for the exchange or transfer of any pirated or illegal software while on Star Wars Galaxies or on the official Star Wars Galaxies website. <br>
7. You will follow the instructions of authorized personnel while in Star Wars Galaxies or the official Star Wars Galaxies forums. <br>
8. You may not organize or be a member of any player association or groups within Star Wars Galaxies that is based on or espouses any racist, sexist, anti-religious, anti-ethnic, anti-gay or other hatemongering philosophy. <br>
9. You may not give false information or intentionally hide any information when registering for your Star Wars Galaxies account. <br>
10. You will not upload or transmit , in Star Wars Galaxies or on the Star Wars Galaxies website, any copyrighted content that you do not own all rights to, unless you have the express written permission of the author or copyright holder. <br>
11. You will not attempt to interfere with, hack into or decipher any transmissions to or from the servers running Star Wars Galaxies. <br>
12. You will not exploit any bug in Star Wars Galaxies, and you will not communicate the existence of any such exploitable bug either directly or through public posting, to any other Sony Station member. You will promptly report such bugs via the /bug command in-game or by emailing SWGSupport@soe.sony.com. Exploitable bugs include, but are not limited to bugs that grant the user unnatural or unintended benefits in-game. <br>
13. You will not attempt to play Star Wars Galaxies on any server that is not controlled or authorized by Sony Online Entertainment, Sony Computer Entertainment of America, or its designees. <br>
14. You will not create, use or provide any server emulator or other site where Star Wars Galaxies may be played, and you will not post or distribute any utilities, emulators or other software tools related to Star Wars Galaxies without the express written permission of Sony Online Entertainment or Sony Computer Entertainment America. <br>
<br>
In addition to the general guidelines listed in the aforementioned article, players are also subject to these supplementary rules while playing Star Wars Galaxies. While by no means an all-inclusive list of the do's and don'ts in Star Wars Galaxies, it provides a suitable foundation by which the player can determine what activities are appropriate:<br>
<br>
1. Again, foul language is not permitted, in any language.<br>
<br>
Excessive use of foul language in an inappropriate context, including swear words, real-world racial slurs, and other language that is not consistent with the fantasy environment and designed to hurt, will be considered a disruption. The existence of any chat/text filtering function is not a license to be profane. <br>
<br>
2. To expound upon the general guidelines, you may not harass other players. <br>
<br>
Harassment is defined as specifically targeting another player or group of players to harm or inconvenience them. Harassment can take many forms, as it goes to the state-of-mind of the person or Squad on the receiving end of the action. However, in order to account for those who are more sensitive than others, the CSR involved will make a determination as to whether or not the reported issue would be considered harassment and act accordingly. <br>
<br>
3. You may not disrupt the normal playability of a game world area. <br>
<br>
Area Disruption is defined as any activity designed to harm or inconvenience a number of groups rather than a specific player or group of players. This includes things such as: <br>
<br>
 Deliberately blocking a doorway or narrow area so other players cannot get past.  <br>
 Making excessive and inappropriate use of spatial communications. <br>
<br>
4. You may not defraud other players.<br>
<br>
Fraud in all transactions between players will result in disciplinary action when confirmed by a CSR. Fraud is defined as falsely representing one's intentions to make a gain at another's expense. Examples of this activity include but are not limited to offering to drag the corpse of another player to safety but instead hiding it deeper in an area unknown or dangerous, as well as using flaws in a secure trade window to deprive someone of one or more of their items. <br>
<br>
5. You may not operate a Player Association (Guild) that habitually violates these rules. <br>
<br>
Disciplinary issues involving Player Associations will also be addressed on a broader basis. Player Associations whose members habitually violate any of the Rules of Conduct or Play Nice Policies may be disbanded. In addition, monopolizing numerous spawn areas with the intent to exclude other players will not be permitted. If investigated and verified by a CSR, monopolizing will result in the disbanding for the Player Association.<br>
<br>
6. You may not intentionally circumvent the player-versus-player combat features and cause another player to die, such as by &quot;training&quot; them. <br>
<br>
Training is defined as pulling/leading a hostile NPC or creature along behind you and attempting to get it to attack another player who does not desire that engagement. <br>
<br>
The intentional training of NPCs or Creatures will result in immediate disciplinary action when witnessed by a CSR. We are aware that accidents often happen causing unintentional trains, and will scrutinize each report of this activity closely. <br>
<br>
7. You may not abuse other players, customer service representatives, or the game system. <br>
<br>
Though some of these actions are covered in part by other rules, they deserve their own note here. The following things would be considered an &quot;abuse&quot; in game: <br>
<br>
 Hate Mongering - participation in or propagation of Hate literature, behavior, or propaganda related to real -world characteristics. <br>
 Sexual Abuse or Harassment - untoward and unwelcome advances of a graphic and sexual nature. This includes virtual rape, overt sexual overtures, and stalking of a sexual nature.<br>
 Attempting to Defraud a CS Representative - Petitioning with untrue information with the intention of receiving benefits as a result. This includes reporting bug deaths, item loss, or fraudulently accusing other players of wrongdoing. <br>
 Impersonating a Customer Service Representative - falsely representing yourself to another player as a SOE CSR or other SOE/Lucas employee. <br>
 CS Personnel Abuse -- sending excessive unsolicited tells to a CS Representative, excessively using say or other channels to communicate to a CS Representative, making physical threats, or using abusive language against a CS Representative. <br>
 Using Threats of Retribution by CSR Friends - attempting to convince another player that they have no recourse in a disagreement because favoritism is shown to one of the parties by the SOE or Lucas Arts staff. <br>
<br>
8. &quot;Roleplaying&quot; does not grant license to violate these rules. <br>
<br>
Though Star Wars Galaxies is a roleplaying game set in the Star Wars universe, the claim of &quot;roleplay&quot; will not be accepted in defense of any of the anti-social behaviors mentioned above. As an example, you are in no case (PvP or otherwise) allowed to &quot;train&quot; a guard onto an enemy in protection of your homeland. In another example, a bounty hunter is not allowed to steal someone's corpse under the guise of roleplaying a villain. <br>
<br>
By all means we want to encourage you to play your role, we just cannot allow that role-play to be done at another's out-of-game expense. <br>
