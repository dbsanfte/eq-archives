An ability is any new command or ability that a player can acquire as they advance their character. For example, a Novice Medic has the ability to use stimpacks to heal damage on themselves or other characters.<br>
<br>
Action<br>
An action is simply a command that you can use within the game. You can access a fairly comprehensive list of actions by using the Actions screen. You can reach this by pressing the Actions button on your button bar (it's the one that looks like little lightning bolts), or by hitting CTRL-A.<br>
<br>
Advanced profession<br>
An advanced profession is a profession that you can only reach if you have unlocked it by learning other skills first. This is in contrast to &quot;starting professions&quot; which are available to anyone at any time.<br>
<br>
Attributes<br>
Attributes refers to the nine statistics that make up the definition of a character: Health, Action, Mind, Strength, Constitution, Quickness, Stamina, Focus, and Willpower.<br>
<br>
Badge<br>
A badge is a text string that shows up in your profile, indicating that you have accomplished some particular task. Certain quests in the game might grant you a badge, as might merely exploring, fulfilling some game objective, or in fact, pretty much any circumstance that we feel is worth recognizing. You can see your badges on the Personal Status page of your Character Sheet.<br>
<br>
Bank<br>
The bank is a location where you can leave items and deposit money. The Galaxy largely runs on a credits system, whereby money is transferred electronically when you purchase something. However, you might also have money on hand (perhaps you, uh, liberated some credits from someone). You can deposit this money in the bank for safekeeping.<br>
<br>
You can also leave items in the safety deposit box at a bank. You can only have one safety deposit box in the entire Galaxy.<br>
<br>
Battle fatigue<br>
As you accumulate wounds, you also accumulate Battle Fatigue. Battle Fatigue makes it harder for Medics to heal your wounds. You can erase your battle fatigue by watching entertainers.<br>
<br>
Bazaar<br>
The Bazaar is an auction system that uses the HoloNet to link disparate worlds together in open commerce. You generally find Bazaar terminals near spaceports, and you can use the terminals to browse listings locally, on the planet you're on, or even on distant planets. Some items are sold at auction, and others are sold in instant sales.<br>
<br>
BH<br>
An abbreviation for &quot;bounty hunter.&quot;<br>
<br>
Bind<br>
A slang term for setting the location you'll return to when you die. See &quot;Cloning.&quot;<br>
<br>
Bio<br>

<br>
Black rot, Black crud<br>
Slang terms for wounds. See &quot;Wounds.&quot;<br>
<br>
Blue Glowy<br>

<br>
Borked<br>
A slang term popular during the SWG beta. It means &quot;messed up&quot; or &quot;non-functional.&quot;<br>
<br>
Burst run, BR<br>
An ability that all players have, burst run lets you run at an accelerated speed for a short period of time. The tradeoff is that it will damage your health, action, and mind a fair amount. It is often used for quick escapes. By default, Burst run is mapped to F5 on your toolbar.<br>
<br>
Camp<br>
Scouts and Rangers in SWG have the ability to create camps or campsites. Camps have a variety of special characeristics: medics and entertainers can heal wounds in them, you can log out safely in them, and advanced camps will keep creatures away.<br>
<br>
Cantina<br>
A cantina is a generic term for a structure that allows entertainers to heal wounds and battle fatigue. The most obvious of these places is, of course, an actual cantina, but other places such as theaters also permit entertainers to ply their trade.<br>
<br>
Capacity<br>
Capacity is a measure of how much stuff can fit inside a container. It is displayed as a bar graph and as a number at the bottom of your inventory window and your datapad.<br>
<br>
Cash, cash on hand<br>
Although most of the Galaxy runs on credits and wireless transfers, in many locations of the Galaxy, the use of hard credits is still common. You can go to a bank to get cash, or you may, uh, &quot;find&quot; it on corpses. (We're sure you weren't involved in the unfortunate victim's demise, of course). In general, terminals and other commercial establishments will draw from your cash on hand first, and then draw from your bank account.<br>
<br>
CH, CT<br>
Abbreviations for &quot;creature handler&quot; and &quot;creature tamer&quot; respectively. Both refer to characters who are engaged in the Creature Handler profession.<br>
<br>
Chat tab<br>
Your chat box can have multiple tabs on it, letting you switch between different panes of the chat window. Each tab displays a different sort of chat (or a mixture of different types of chat--it's very configurable. See the Holocube topics under &quot;Communicating with Others&quot; for further details). You can also drag these tabs off into their own chat windows. Slang, however, still calls these &quot;chat tabs&quot; for some reason.<br>
<br>
Clone, cloning<br>
When your character dies, the game isn't over! Instead, we let you pick up where you left off, placing your character at a cloning facility. You can clone yourself for a fee at any cloning facility, and then from then on, the default location where you reappear after a death will be that cloning facility. See also &quot;Bind.&quot;<br>
<br>
Combat fatigue, Fatigue<br>
Fatigue is a measure of how much combat fatigue you have accumulated as you've been wounded. The more you have, the harder it is for medics and entertainers to heal your wounds. You can relieve your combat fatigue by listening to or watching entertainers in cantinas. Combat fatigue is displayed on your Character Sheet.<br>
<br>

<br>
Covert<br>
Players can join the Rebel or Imperial faction in order to participate in the Galactic Civil War. Once they sign up, however, they can be Covert members, or Overt members.  Covert players are &quot;hidden,&quot; undercover members of that faction, and have reduced faction perks--they cannot place down factional structures, and cannot wear factional uniforms.<br>
<br>
Coverts cannot be attacked by enemies, because the enemy does not know that they are members of that faction. Because of this, Coverts can also not attack players of the enemy faction. <br>
<br>
Coverts can attack NPCs of the enemy faction, and can heal or otherwise assist fellow members of their faction, but this will publicly reveal them as members of the Alliance or the Empire, and then they can be attacked by enemy players for a period of a few minutes. This is known as a &quot;temporary enemy flag.&quot; See &quot;TEF&quot; for more details.<br>
<br>
CR, corpse recovery<br>
When you die, it is possible for items to be left on your corpse, at the location where you died. The act of going to recover the items is generally termed &quot;corpse recovery.&quot;<br>
<br>
Crafting station<br>
A crafting station is a device that allows you to craft more complex items with your crafting tool. In order to get the benefits of a crafting station, you merely have to be near the crafting station at the time that you boot up the crafting tool.

<br>

<br>
Draft schematic<br>
A draft schematic is a recipe for building an item. As you acquire new skills, these skills may grant you new draft schematics. As you advance, you can also lose access to draft schematics--this is done according to the rules of the various trade organizations in the galaxy, to ensure that lower-level crafters are guaranteed a market for their goods. <br>
<br>
There is a tab on your Datapad where you can view all the draft schematics you have. You may also want to check out the entry on &quot;Manufacturing Schematics.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dynamic POI<br>

<br>
Faction, faction standing<br>
There are two meanings to the term Faction in SWG. One of them refers to the two warring sides in the Galactic Civil War, the Rebel Alliance and the Empire. Players can join these factions and engage in player vs. player combat with one another, as well as advance in standing with the faction. See also &quot;Faction Points.&quot;<br>
<br>
The other type of faction is simply the game tracking how various groups of NPCs feel about you. If you are consistently mean to Jawas, eventually Jawas will come to hate you, and may attack you on sight.<br>
<br>
Faction points, faction perks<br>
Faction points are acquired by doing actions for the Rebellion or the Empire. If you acquire enough faction points, you can join that faction (see also &quot;Declared,&quot; &quot;Overt,&quot; and &quot;Covert.&quot;). <br>

Once you are a member of a faction, you can spend faction points to acquire faction perks, which are special benefits that are only granted to members of the faction. Examples of faction perks include special structures you can build, uniforms to wear, and titles.<br>
