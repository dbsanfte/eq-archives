            <p>Well I have been slacking on updates, but it is all same stuff
              mostly. Quarms, KT groups, Ikkinz farming and of course cybering.</p>
            <p>Tonight Talons beat Ikkinz 4 raid. We have also played some in
              Yxxta and will now move on that some more as well as Uqua and Ikkinz
              farming/keying to finally get us into Qvic!</p>
            <p>I have a special something coming in a week or so for everyone
              to look at so stay tuned.</p>
            <p>Special grats to our two new officers Craszs and Zzednax and Sobillak
              has once again stepped up to be the offical beer drinker of the
              guild.</p>
            <p>No picture yet. Not that you would need one if you ever did Ikkinz,
            it is the same damn zone for all 4.</p>

              Hail Circle<br>
              Well last night was the weekly Kael raid for xp and armor drops. <br>
              We had a fairly good night although no armor dropped to loot we
              did get some good xp.<br>
              There were six of us last night including two players in their
              30s. Doomes at 30 and Gordu at 37. <br>
              We started with just myself(Lios), Doomes, Malvron and Keniah.
              We didn't get far however before adds wiped us out, all except
              Mal who was able to gate.<br>
              Well it was regroup and start again. By this time Mal had logged
              to V and Goste and Gordu had arrived so we did much better. With
              V pulling and Goste as main tank things went fairly smooth for
              the rest of the night the only draw back was the fact that Lios
              ( a druid) was main healer so we had a bit of down time when I
              was oom and needed to med. <br>
              However we had some realy good battles with every one contributing
              to the good of the group.<br>
              Ken started to heal the lower levels so I could concetrate on Goste
              and V. This allowed me to conserve manna and we didn't need another
              med break untill it was time to leave.<br>
              Thanks to all who showed.<br>
              This weekend the raid should be on Friday and there are several
              other events scheduled for the month so check out the calender
              to see where you can help the Circle .<br>
              Untill we fight again...<br>
              May the Circle be unbroken

              It was 20s xp night and we went to Hollowshade moor to fight the
              owlbears.<br>
              There were five of us in the group with Canor along to help out.<br>
              Gohome (myself), Shortugly, Snakevenom, Redhemma, and Ewe(something)
              who showed up a little late. We decided to set up camp at the cave
              and start to work. <br>
              After a few kills the group went inside the cave, all except Go
              who was a little slow on the follow and got jumped by three summoning
              bears and didn't last long although I yelled for help twice. As
              there were three of them I never had a chance to gate out so died
              in short order. Red who answered my call for help also was no match
              for the three. After they finished with Red they went after the
              rest and Short came up on the &quot;short&quot; end of the stick.
              However Snake made it out alive this time ( yes I know you find
              that hard to believe). It is true none the less. Oh yeah Ewe whatever
              that name is had not gotten to us yet so was not involved in that
              fight.<br>
              Well after rezes and the addition of the forgotten namede monk,
              we began again. This time we also had a warrior in the group. a
              new member just added during this nights activities. Once again
              I can not remember the name. [Sorry guys I am verry tired as I
              have been up since 4:20 am and it is now nearly ten pm. ] So to
              continue, we went back inside and had better luck. We mowed down
              the bears quite easily with the added man power and with Can lending
              a hand now and then. Things were moving along nicely till Can went
              afk and the monk whom shall be nameless pulled 4 bears at once.
              He paid the price of his foolishness though and Snake returned
              to form and followed the monks lead into oblivion. as did Red again.
              I had enough mana to take a cue and gate out before the bears got
              me a second time and Short was able to out run them to the Zone
              line. Our newest member had gone LD and when he got back he had
              to good since to hightail it out when he saw he was alone.<br>
              It just so happened that it was then 8:50 and since we had little
              time left Short and I bid the group a farewell and gated back to
              PoK to log off for the nite.<br>
              All in all it was a fun night with good xp for all even with the
              deaths thanks to the rezes from Canor. Snake also got an owlbear
              claw earring and an owlbear feather cap, both items with +mana
              and + int and wis.<br>
              Next week we will do it again with whomever shows up. SO lets all
              check the calander and see who you need to bring. I would like
              to see a large turnout. It has been several weeks since we had
              to go to raid format on TNH and I would like to see that again.<br>
              Untill we fight again.<br>
              May the Circle be unbroken</p>
            <p>Edited by Nianque: The monk was Eeowyn and the new member was
              Doomes who is a barbarian beastlord, not a warrior. What musta
              been really tired not to have noticed the white wolf running around.<br>

              Well.. It was a cool and chilly night, as a group of friends, and
              family gathered. The place of interest drawing folks together,
              was the Permafrost Caverns. Within them lay one of the most well
              known Dragons of all time &quot;Lady Vox&quot;. As the gathering
              grew, and sprits rose, the group of friends headed into the Caverns
              saying good bye to the daylight of the new day that had dawned.
              Deep the group went, killing all in their path. Gaints fell all
              around. Nothing stood in their way. Then they finally reached the
              place that demands respect from all...The Lair of Lady Vox. Well..
              As none had fallen up to to this point, spirits soared, and the
              trash talk begain. Buffs flowed like water from the heavens. Then
              the long awaited battle begain. As the battle insued many began
              to fall to the power of the beast. As the battle raged the rest
              of them Fell. Vox stood over them with a smirk that Just BEGGED
              to be removed. So the travelers gathered their dead, and wounded,
              and regrouped with the help of some brave souls that Had heard
              of the plight that Had befallen them the first time. So with the
              last time behind them, they all gathered. Having learned what went
              wrong, they fixed the errors headed back in to meet the beast &quot;Vox
              Herself&quot; once again. SO.. the second battle raged with the
              few falling. Then.... as if she was toying with us all along, they
              started falling in ones and twos. The ones left standing Had not
              wavered in their duties as they battled the beast when with one
              sweep, she sent most of them running. After she picked off the
              runners she then turned towards the last few remaining friends
              to try and get them to fear her as well. As THEY stood there not
              backing down, she begain to worry. Then as more started to fall,
              the beast reared her ugly head again, and again until ultimately
              she looked face to face with a Cleric... &#8220;the last solo survivor
              of the group... The cleric fought a valiant fight, but was no match
              for the power of the beast. The death toll rose to be more than
              40 deaths by the time the dragon had her full. So inconclusion...
              The score stands at: Vox 2 Raiding Party 0.</p>

              Well, we had a good night. Tonight we went to KC to get some xp
              for the 50s level characters. We met at the main bank in POK, and
              just ran there as that is just as fast as porting to DL, and running
              from the Druid ring. There were eight of us that stayed for a big
              part of the night. <br>
              Doyan, Whatsisface, Snakelord, Canor, Quelar,(sp) Malvron, Mezzerina
              and Jamimie. With a short appearance from Jaroni. We first decided
              to camp the Left Courtyard, but found that way to easy, so moved
              upstairs to the jail.<br>
              Things went pretty smooth untill we were all sitting around during
              a lull in the action, when from around the corner.. 6 skellies
              jumped Q and he died before we could react. There were skellies
              all over the place, and we had no idea there were any around. Oh
              well, it is head for the hills at this point. Or maybe the Zone
              line. Mezzerina also bought the farm, while Snake went the wrong
              way and also died. Mal was not grouped with us at the time, and
              Jam had not yet arrived. <br>
              That was the only real problem with the night. There were a couple
              other deaths, but they were dealt with by rezzes from Canor. No
              real damage done. Q pinged, and also got to do a turn in for his
              epic. Every one got some good XP. <br>
              Q also got a nice Supple Scale Armband off the Drolvarg Warlord. <br>
              All in all it was a fun night. We had a great time. I look forward
              to Tuesday's Vox raid with Dragonwrath.<br>
              Hope to see you all there.<br>
              Untill then <br>
            May the Circle be unbroken</p>

              <br>
  Okay, so it was technically Backflagging, but we got some nice upgrades and I
  am personally one hell-uv-a grateful Monk for getting flagged Sol ro and Elemental
  in one shot. I believe a dozen or so hailed each Zek, (whether guest or alt I
  have no idea).
            <p> First Vallon Zek felt the Wrath of Crimson Talon and rewarded
              us with:<br>
              Zanci: Pendant of the Triumphant Victor<br>
  Aorthin: Pendant of the Triumphant Victor </p>
            <p> Then after some Monk nearly wiped us at the entrance...er Pull?
              Hotkeys? Pacify? - Ooo I got two AE Casters, that is not good,
              but were okay - Gee I have been in the air a Very long time( I
              sailed literally from wall in front of the raid across the hallway
              behind us and into aggro range of respawn - though I did not know
              it of course - idiot.) We lost several folks to them and for that
              I deeply apologize to the raid.<br>
              <br>
  But then we came back and of course kicked Tallon Zek in the teeth, and took
    his lunch money:</p>

              A few members decided to take a casual trip into Sanctus Seru
              and, low and behold, they found the master of the house at home.
              After
              a most unfriendly welcome, three of our members left with some
              rather nice parting gifts:</p>

            <p>Backflagging Break - But Still on the Warpath <br>
              Posted by: Thespis on Friday, August 13, 2004<br>
              <br>
              This past week has been a bit of a break from our raiding regimen.
              Earlier this week, we took down Xuzl in Sol Ro and finished off
              some Sol Ro access flags for a few members. We then had a few relaxed
              nights, followed with a SmackDown Laying on Lord Inquisitor Seru.
              There were a few small rough spots, but overall the fight went
            very smooth. 3 very nice upgrades were the result. Grats to...<br>
            <br>
            Kelmor
            - Heavy Yttrium Chestplate</p>

              <br>
              The flagging process continues with more and more members getting
              ready for our inevitable attempt at Solusek Ro. Xuxl was the playmate
            of choice and a small raid force was up to the task.<br>

            <p>Everyone has been doing a wonderful job of leveling/AA and farming
              mobs when the numbers are solid. With summer time on us many of
              us have been taking the families out on the road so this means
              we havent been in game as much as we normally are. Still mobs are
              dropping like sweat from a working mans brow, so without further
              BS I'll try to list up the most recent winners of the Ubber pixels

            <p>Grokworth, Dreggo, Vilvandre, Gaarbage, Dizok and Balazar where
              able to attend a T.T. beat down and Balazar walked away with his
              Nightmarish Bone Ring. Unfortunetly someone screwed the pooch on
              the projection and Grokworth wasnt able to get his flag but Im
              sure we will be seeing her laying face down or as Dizok likes to

    August News</p>
              <p>It&#8217;s been a while since our last update but plenty has
                happened in the life of our guild!</p>
              <p>Guild groups have taken advantage of fewer raids due to vacationing
                by working quite heavily on GoD flags during August. It hasn&#8217;t
                taken long to see the first KT flagged members begin to appear.</p>
              <p>Raids since the last update have focused on Backflagging in
                PoP and a dozen or so VT hits to gear up. Along with a few Emp
                Ssra kills, and GoD raids.</p>
              <p>We also enjoyed 2 successful joint raids with The Relentless
                on Smith Rondo.</p>
              <p>The guild happily welcomes the following people as full members
                into Exhumed since our last update;<br>
                Kriis, Sangeren, Wilbus, Niteshade, Sinful and Grogz.</p>
            <p>As summer draws to a close and numbers begin to pick up we can
                only look forward to OoW, further progression in GoD and PoP
              and a bunch of promising new applicants to get to know.<br>

Sunday, August 22, 2004 - Illusion of Apathy took a step back in time today as
we ventured to NToV for a fun-raid day. As many of you may recall our drunk tree
house races and our all out arena wars this was one of our off the wall days
to kick back, relax, and kill dragons for sport! Many of us logged in our alts
for a chance at some loot, (grats guys!) Hopefully a good time was had by all,
I didn't get any beer though, did someone forget to bring it? =P</p>
                    <p>(I didn't get any pics from todays NToV event, but heres
            a couple shots from recent PoEb farming!)</p>

                      In other IoA news, we continue to move forward in our journey
                        to PoTime. At only 2 kills (and a few council men!) away
                        from our goal, the excitement is rising, we know TRC
                        and Coirnav's days are numbered, and our dedication and
                        hard work continues to pay off. Keep it up guys!</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile while continuing to move through PoP we are
                      also working on our Kod'Taz flags. Smith Rondo proved to
                      be an easy target for IoA and he fell on our first attempt.
                      Soon we will be finished with our Tipt and Vxed trials,
                      way to go folks!</p>
                    <p>Congratulations go out to everyone who has received gear
                      upgrades, and to all the applicants who have been accepted
                      into IoA as full members in the last month, well done!
                      In regards to recruiting, anyone who is interested in becoming
                      an applicant to IoA please take a look at the App Requirement
                      link and the Application link to the left. To learn more,
                      feel free to send either myself (Sveva) or Annattek a /tell
                      in game or a PM here at the site.</p>
                    <p>(PS. To those of you who are still looking for &quot;Waldo&quot; hes
                      not really there - gl anyway!)<br>

  Xegony - Queen of Air Falls to IoA! | <br>
  Posted by: Sveva on Tuesday, July 20, 2004 - 04:21 AM <br>
  <br>
  Monday, July 19, 2004 - Illusion of Apathy is now only two kills from Plane
  of Time. Today marks yet another grand victory for us as we all participated
  and watched as Xegony, Queen of Air died flawlessy, in house, to IoA at approx
  1:15am EST. </p>
                    <p>I got a little peak of Xegony as she flew by, tanked by
                      Gwendle!</p>

                      Congratulations go out to everyone who received the flag
                        tonight, also grats to Qelyn who was awarded Exquisite
                        Puresteel Wraps, Kronas was awarded Rosrak's Greaves
                        of the Primal, and Annattek who was awarded Vest of Phoenix
                        Feathers! Woot!</p>

                      <br>
                      Tonight was truely impressive, as many of IoA's nights
                          are. We have the ability to defeat obstacles in a very
                          short time with fewer people, while keeping ourselves
                          focused and having an awesome time! The dedication
                        and cooperation of our leadership and our members combined
                          will see this guild straight into Time and beyond.
                        Its
              not that far off folks, keep up the GREAT work!</p>

              Mortal Omen News VOLUME 6 AUGUST 12, 2004
              <p>In the News<br>
            Congratulations to Thyseasn on his new Bard Epic!<br>
            <br>
                Gratz to LoT and MO on finally taking out Kuanbyr Hailstorm
                        in Bastion of Thunder. We have now taken all 4 tower
                        bosses and only Agnarr remains. Our first attempt didn't
                        go so well but we learned from our mistakes and the 2nd
            time execution was flawless.<br>
            <br>
                Gratz to Tanson who only has the UDB and Trak to complete
                        his Bard Epic! Too bad Tanson had to buy his WDS after
            a soloer KS'd the raid on Gorenaire.<br>
            <br>
                Xorex now has all 4 Orbs needed for the Key to Saryrn's
                        Chambers but Baraguj Szuul still stands in our way. We
                        moved through Baraguj's stomach with ease but wiped on
            the final attack on Baraguj himself.<br>

                        Saturday we dropped by Ssra and killed our old mate the
                        emperor for sport and a handfull of rifts. After we went
                        to PoI and killed Behemoth and the day ended with Vallon
                        Zek going down too. Sunday we experimented some more
                        with Rallos Zek and his friends and learned some important
            details which should insure his imminent downfall.                    <br>

                    <p>Inktuta is one of the more entertaining GoD zones we have
                      been in so far. From Keledrix to Noqufiel we've played
                      on the golem bowling alley, squashed the bugs and ducked
                      curses. Best part of the zone - it can be done in a SWISH.</p>

                      The Relentless have been busy through the raiding season
                        of July! The Qvic Resort, Zoo and Cynosure's Arbitor
                        Fun Rides have been fully booked. We have scored over
                        320 loots this month of which roughly 70 are from Plane
                        of Time and the rest are just simply better. We're taking
                        the quick tours in Time clearing it all in one night's
                        non-stop raid with still room for some Qvic. There goes
                        phase 4 loot rotting, going to neighbor's dog, Dannbu's
                        feelers and twinks.</p>
                    <p>A few quick visits to good old Skyfire Mountains yielded
                      the new Veeshan Peak keys for the guild. Even if the loot
                      and the encounters are not exactly quite exciting we are
                      looking forward making a stop here soon. Part of being
                      Relentless is winning every zone in the game.</p>
                    <p>The Inktuta Club is an exciting break from the Qvic zoo
                      and golf course. We're past the Keledrix disco and we've
                      squashed the mites (server first naturally). We'll be soon
                      done with the Cursecaller's bowling alley and heading to
                      Txevu for completion of the current expansion. Dare we

            <p> Tuesday, August 17, 2004 - WoW CS Hype <br>
              - by Pirotess on Aug 17, 2004 - 12:27 PM <br>
              <br>
              You know all the hype about WoWs customer service is bullshit.
              They are just as incapable of helping us as SoE guides were. My
              last two petitions have been failures. I recently wanted to put
              a new tabbard in place so I went to Ironforge to design the tabbard
              and purchase it. I spent a good 5-10 minutes getting it just right
              and went to click accept and found that I couldnt. Why? Because
              we already had a guild tabbard from a previous push. So I look
              around for a way to delete it and cant find a way. I petitioned
              and a GM answered pretty quickly. The GM then proceeds to tell
              me that the only way to change the tabbard is to reform the guild.
              What kind of crackerjack solution is that? That would mean I'd
              have to reguild over 140 characters. I ask if they can guarantee
              that the guild will disband properly since we had trouble with
              that back when Beta started as our guild name is very important.
              The GM says he cannot guarantee that either. The phase &quot;We
              dont have the tools to do that&quot; got dropped a few times. Ok
              thats frustrating and disappointing since we're coming down the
              line to release pretty quickly here but I guess we can deal with
              our old black and red tabbard with the flame icon through beta
              right?</p>
            <p>Wrong</p>
            <p>Somewhere along the line the tabbard got munged and now we have
              red gears on a puke yellow background. I wouldnt be caught dead
              wearing that. So no tabbard for SS till release. Strike one.</p>
            <p>Today I finally scraped together 100g to purchase a mount thanks
              in large part to Muffinheads generosity and alot of auction work.
              I was really excited to finally be getting a mount and thought
              long and hard about which color I wanted. Finally I decided on
              the black panther and made that fateful click. The purchase went
              through after a second or two but I didnt think twice about it,
              I was so excited to mount up and run around. I hit ESC as usual
              to close the vendor interface and B immediately after to open my
              backpack then right clicked my reigns to mount up. It was with
              horror that I noticed my latency bar was red and the cursor was
              still showing as a $ sign instead of a hand. So in the ensuing
              lag I sold my panther I had just purchased back to the damn vendor
              who gave me 20g for the reigns I just spent 100g for.</p>
            <p>Now this pisses me off for quite a few reasons. First of all the
              lag in WoW is unacceptable. I logged in from work during my lunchbreak
              around noon eastern and had 14633ms lag (yes 14k) on a multiple
              T1 connection in Stormwind. It gradually settled down to around
              1200ms lag by the time I got to Darnassus but thats still ridiculous
              for a MMORPG where reaction time can make or break an event. This
              is not an isolated occurance either its constant. All this weekend
              both Sat and Sun I was getting spikey lag where the entire group
              and instance would lag for about 20 seconds and then snap ahead.
              Often times I would just barely keep our tank or mages from dying.
            To put it plainly Alpha was 100x mo...</p>
