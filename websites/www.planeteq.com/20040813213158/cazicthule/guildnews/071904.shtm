              WOW what a night. <br>
              It was Ldon night and we set out to complete two crawls in a three
              hour period. There were six of us so it was perfect. Full group
              but no one was turned away. <br>
              We met at the Everfrost camp to begin our first crawl. There were
              Whatsisface, Doyan, Eili, Eih, Daimeon, and Findyin. That's two
              warriors, a rogue, two clerrics and a chanter.<br>
              We were all set. The first crawl was a collect 23. So it was off
              to the races with the first crawl. We had no trouble with these
              mobs. I was puller and it seemed that every room I entered I was
              jumped by at least three mobs.<br>
              Thankfully we had Daim with us to mez the extras. We were able
              to complete the first crawl in less than an hour. So now it is
              time for round two and off to Nro. Again we chose a collect 23.
              And we were off again. Same song second verse. We were plowing
              through the mobs and moving right along when someone took a wrong
              turn. I won't mention names but it was the only frog in the group.
              We were fighting in one room when the afore mentioned frog went
              into the wrong room and pulled 3 or 4 with no one around to help
              him. Fortunately we noticed the error and rushed back to lend a
              hand. Eih was able to gate out and we were again able to clear
              the room. Thanks for two clerics. Eih returned and we continued
              on our way. With only one more item to collect I pulled a single
              mob. Unusual for the night. This mob however at like 6% gated,
              and while we were looking around for her we were trained.<br>
              Suddenly there were 5 mobs where a moment before there were none.
              It was exhilerating. Constant fighting for a good ten minutes for
              as soon as we wiped one group another took its place. We acctually
              for the first time in the night saw the OOM warning from our clerics
              as well as our chanter. Fortunately the last mob fell with no others
              coming in to take up the fight. We took a few seconds to catch
              our breath before we went back to the camp to split the take for
              the night. <br>
              All in all it was a lot of fun with good xp and a few good drops.
              I was lucky enough to get a Stamina augment and I think Findyin
              got a wisdom augment. Only two augs in as many crawls was a little
              disapointing but it was far outweighed by the fun.<br>
              Next week I believe it is again 20s night but on Sunday there is
              the Kael raid to join in on. <br>
              Every body check the calander to see what is going on.<br>
              Untill next time...<br>
              May the Circle be unbroken

                        <p>(Begin dramatic music)...ok so it sounds scarier than
                          it really was. Stuuge asked if anyone wanted to head
                          to the grey to work on getting some EB items. Some
                          people showed interest so Stuuge logged on Merryln
                          and waited at the bank in POK. Lios, Gogandantess,
                          Lenson, Eihdger and myself showed up for the ride.
                          We journeyed our way through to the grey, and zoned
                          in holding our breath (ok so Mer casted a spell on
                          all of us so we didn't really have to hold our breath).
                          We made our way to the temple and set up camp. We came
                          to get 3 organs a piece from those snake like things,
                          but first things first, we had to kill off a golem
                          or too to be sure the area was safe. Gogan did the
                          pulling. We decided it would be best if 1 person looted
                          until they got their 3 organs and then we moved on
                          the next person instead of having everyone loot 1 at
                          a time. </p>
                        <p>We rolled to determine loot order Lenson, me, Lios,
                          Eihdger, Merryln, Gogandantess. We continued to pull
                          snakes and luckily Merr was able to mez....because
                          we only got a single pull occasionally. After awhile
                          Gog had to leave for an hour so he camped at the site
                          to be able to come back to group when he got back on.
                          I took over the pulling. Merr also decided to make
                          a golem a pet..that was interesting especially when
                          we had it fighting another golem....SUNDAY SUNDAY SUNDAY
                          in the middle ring...GOLEM VS GOLEM ahemm..where was
                          I? Ok so Lenson and I both got our set of 3 Lios passed
                          and offered Merr to take his place who also passed
                          so eih was up next..The drop rate on these things is
                          kind of slow going..Eih got his 2 and then all heck
                          broke loose with like 4 pulls and golem became uncharmed
                          and the health bars started dropping and everyone was
                          running...eih zone into the temple..the rest of us
                          got evaced to the succor point...Gog logged in at that
                          time...ran to temple, we decided to make a trip for
                          the two of us that did get complete sets to go get
                          the EB necklaces eih ran like a madman err frog through
                          the zone to catch up with us because he wanted to see
                          where to go when he got his full set. </p>
                        <p>We waited in the POK while Merr logged on Dadz and
                          went and got Gog out of the temple. Then with the help
                          of Dadz Lenson and I got our EB necklace. We went back
                          to the POK and disbanded...I ran off to use the EB
                          item to practice my swimming (up to 90 now yaa) and
                          Dadz decided that it was a shame that Eihdger was only
                          one away so the two of them ran back out there..I eih's
                          comp from across the room ....I think the drop rate
                          got considerably worse...but after awhile they did
                          get the last organ to drop and then Dadz took Eih to
                          go get his necklace too. Thanks everyone for a great
                          group and thanks Dadz for taking the time out to help
                          Eih get his last organ. We even managed to get some
                          EXP out of it as well..I say we should go back again
                          sometime and get more guildies the EB necklace! :-)</p>

                            It was a glorious battle! The mobs fell like rain.
                            Nothing could stand before the group as it mowed
                            down all in it's path. Awe and fear gripped the vermin
                            no matter their color as the group approached. Many
                            turned and fled rather than face the might of the
                            assembled comrads.</p>
                        <p>Then of course their was our group in a different
                          zone. I wish I was in the first group but such was
                          not the case. We went to PoD tonight and diseased is
                          what we fought like. I could not for the life of me
                          pull single mobs more than two times in a row and if
                          I pulled a rat with even one other mob it spelled doom
                          for the group. Canor was valient in his attempt to
                          keep us alive. Doyan fought with skill and cunning.
                          Snake and Goste with the aid of their warders battled
                          inexhaustabley. Ketahs and I taunted and bellowed as
                          well as slashed and bashed beyond the kin of mortal
                          man. Ashelia did with seeming disregard for her own
                          life nuke and snare as well as root mobs that came
                          within range. All with little success. C and I died
                          four times and none escaped death except Goste. </p>
                        <p>However all is not vain for Ketas did level up to
                          50 and somehow we gained enough xp for him to keep
                          it. Thanks to C and Eihdgar for rezes of 96% to keep
                          the night from being a total wash.</p>
                        <p>Any way Saturday is the Kael raid at 5:00 central
                          time I think. Be sure to check the events calander
                          to confirm the time. Next Thursday is 20s night again.
                          Lets all grab our alts and see if we can turn some
                          20s into 30s. </p>
                        <p>Until we fight again...</p>

                          Hail circle<br>
                          We had a nother good night of hunting. We did low lvls
                          tonight with everyone in their 20s. We met at the felwith
                          stone and ran to MM. Those in attendance were Gohome
                          (myself) Farriie, Litldeath Doyans alt Snakebait and
                          Soulrez. We got some support from Zabrae who provided
                          rezes and Bettyann came along and provided heals and
                          buffs later on. Eihdgar made an appearance early to
                          help with our first rezes.</p>
                        <p>Ok to the story. </p>
                        <p> We got to MM with the five of us and made our way
                          to the graveyard. Things went ok at first then we got
                          hit with a lot of adds at once and had a total wipe.
                          I yelled for help from Eihd and he came to do some
                          rezes. Unfortunately he was in an Ldon group and couldn't
                          stay. Zabrae logged on and after we finaly got all
                          the corpses to ZI we got our rezes and made our way
                          back to the GY. While we were waiting for rezes we
                          picked up a chanter for crowd control and things went
                          much smoother. Betty came on the scene at about 8 or
                          so and helped out with needed buffs and then stuck
                          around for support and to give me a hard time.</p>
                        <p>Things went real well untill about 8:45 and then we
                          got trained and I died again although I was the only
                          one to die twice I think. Except maybe Snake as he
                          went LD and had not returned by the time we left. I
                          hope you had gate up wnen you came back in Snake.</p>
                        <p>Next week we will do the 50s thing and tomorrow night
                          is the Kael raid. SO every one come on down and join
                          the fun.</p>

                      Congratulations on a successful Xanamech
                      raid last night in Plane of Innovation. House Zebulon and

                      really starting to come together and work as a seamless
                      team, according to Talios and that is great to see. I wish
                      I could have been there to see it, but real life duties
                      had me busy Friday evening. Let's keep up the good work,
                      and get ready for next week's raids. May they be as successful

            Posted by: Sveva on Tuesday, June 29, 2004<br>
            <br>
Illusion of Apathy continues to move forward as an unstoppable force. Tonight
was another fantastic raiding night which began with Blazzax the Omnifiend dying
yet again in PoFire. </p>
                    <p>Immediatly following Blazz's death we quickly moved to
                      PoEarth where we proceeded to kill the earth rings to spawn
                      A Mystical Arbitor of Earth, which we defeated, giving
                      IoA entrance to Ragrax, Stronghold of the Twelve or otherwise
                      known as Plane of Earth B, and putting IoA at only 3 kills
                      away from Plane of Time! Congratulations guys well done!</p>

                    <p>Did we stop there? No, of course not! We quickly ran back
                      to PoFire, reformed, and sent Criare Sunmane, Jaxoliz Dawneyes,
                      and Quavonis Firetail (all 3 birds) back to thier firey
                      graves....and our night continued on! Why leave mobs up!?</p>
                    <p>Next on the IoA death list was Terris Thule and one of
                      her friends, Grummus. Both mobs dropped very quickly and
                      provided us with some backflags. Good job guys and grats
                      on the flags!</p>

  Fennin Ro Dies to IoA with 43 people @ 4am! | <br>
  Posted by: Hideto on Saturday, June 19, 2004<br>
  <br>
  Its been a long time since my last update, but this one is well deserved. On
  Friday night at 4:30 am with 43 members on we engaged and defeated Fennin Ro
  for the first time (we lost our first attempt 2 weeks ago with 55+ on). It
  comes as no suripse to anyone that our victory would come with only 43 people
  on and so late at night, true IoA style...basically night crew &gt; all. When
  we focus and really put our hearts into we can accomplish anything....no zerg
  needed.</p>

                    <p>Not only did we win with only 43 people online but at
                      least 8 people where bots and 2-3 were afk and we KILLED
                      HIMFLAWLESSLY (qelyn bot doesnt count, ok?). Once again
                      IoA goes against all odds and comes out victorious. We
                      sure have a knack for the dramatic. The fight went very
                      smooth, and we won for the first time! Grats on Xethle
                      on your New mask and Illlalalala on your new earring!</p>
                    <p>Here is the death shot:</p>

                    <p>Lastly I wanted to thank those of you personally who stayed
                      out way past your bed times and had faith in your fellow
                      member to defeat this vile beast...without you guys I would
                      be lost....here is a listing of the 41 dedicated individual
                      who logged on or stayed on to kill FRO: (gwendle/rakhal/jaskur

                      One god is now dead, 3 to go. I&#8217;m confident will
                      be in Time very soon, in fact I guarantee it. Xegony is
            next up on our plate, that bitch better be nervous!<br>

  On the way to PoTime... | <br>
  Posted by: Sveva on Thursday, June 03, 2004<br>
  <br>
  IoA is on a wild ride through the Elemental planes! May turned out to be a
  very successful month for us in many ways. First off we more than doubled April's
  elemental mold drops, in April we collected 17 molds, and May brought in about
  38, this is not counting the many other numerous peices of elemental gear that
  are not patterns/molds.</p>
                    <p>Also this month IoA brought Fennin Ro to about 50% before
                      he got lodged in a wall due to an SOE bug...However, bugs

            <p>The Relentless has found many recreational activities in Qvic.
              The pool games have proven a big success. We decided to go on a
              Qvic Tour to see what else is there to do!<br>
            </p>

            <p>The zoo has the largest critters of Taelosia and they come in
            a bunch. Big lizards! Big hogs! Big turtles!</p>            <p><img src="file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/m-miron/My%20Documents/My%20Pictures/guildnews/tr704d.jpg" width="600" height="576"></p>
            <p>The circus is in town and The Arbitor Show was not to be missed.
              Up to four clowns did their juggling and The Relentless did the
            looting.</p>

            <p>So, can we clear it all? Yes we can. Welcome to Inktu'Ta! Cynosure
              and his entire resort has now been done on Cazic-Thule server.
              Lots of Muramite armor has been dropping and here's a couple of
              new drops we got:<br>

            <p>This is true tropical splendor. Brilliant sunbeams glint off aquamarine
              seas and warm the alabaster sand. Locals exchange dialogue in an
              exotic tongue. The scent of eucalyptus hangs in the air while guava,
              pineapple, and other fruits of indescribable sweetness tempt the
              palate. And, in the middle of it all lies Qvic. Located amid the
              tropical mountain splendor and breathtaking scenery of Taelosia's
              masterful Uqua and Ikkinz resorts, Qvic's elegantly appointed vacation
              villas combine privacy and seclusion with every amenity for your
              convenience. Just 25 minutes from the Kod'Taz zone in on the northwest
              coast of Natimbi, Qvic has been voted &quot;The Game's Phattest
              Lewt&quot; for two consecutive days.<br>
            </p>

            <p>Qvic intoxicates the senses like few other places, luring couples,
              families, solo travelers, and large groups alike, offering a refuge
              perfectly suited to each. From beachside to courtside accommodations
              and everything in between, the choice is yours. Whether you enjoy
              sightseeing, sipping Halas Heaters, or simply relaxing, pristine
              beaches, challenging pulling, world-class looting, renowned cuisine,
              and endless activities await your arrival. It's no wonder the beauty
              of Qvic is called paradise.<br>

            <p>Holy Cow It Worked! <br>
posted on 06-14-2004 09:47 PM by Thornsong </p>
            <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
              Well, as many as you know, I was one of the lucky attendees who
                got to go to the summit SOE threw down for us in San Diego. </p>
            <p>Anyway, tonight we had the opportunity to see if any of it actually
              worked. We finished doing Ikkinz Raid #4 and the end result was
              bugged as it didn't drop the pieces we needed for progression --
              no slivers.</p>
            <p>We actually called the raid and was beginning to bail when someone
              suggested we try the new guild critical petitioning system they
              mentioned at the summit. Could SOE really get us an answer in a
              timely manner?</p>
            <p>Well, within SEVEN minutes of petitioning, Lead GM Altazar responds
              and announces that he will give us the slivers that were supposed
              to drop. Less than 15 minutes, the problem has been resolved.</p>
            <p><img src="file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/m-miron/My%20Documents/My%20Pictures/guildnews/tr704k.jpg" width="600" height="373"></p>
            <p>Let's hope this isn't a fluke and SOE plans to continue this level
              of customer service. At least one thing from the summit has held
              true so far; I look forward to future changes. <br>

            Wednesday, July 7, 2004 - Membership Announcement            </p>
            <p>What a wild ride we've had the last few months, especially for
              our applicants. We've spent time flagging them for the elemental
            planes, Time, and now KT!!!<br>
            <br>
              Please welcome Mistre, Adjanti, Atrahasis, and Ianya, the newest
            Full Members to the Shadowed Soul family.</p>
            <p>Saturday, July 26th, 2004</p>            
            <p><img src="file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/m-miron/My%20Documents/My%20Pictures/guildnews/ss704c.jpg" width="520" height="460"></p>
            <p>Well, like it shows, Phases 4 and 5 bite the dust en toto. We
              went back in on Friday and cleared them both out. Other than one
              bad pull on VZ that we aborted before he hit 95%, each mob died
            first time.</p>
            <p>We then moved on up to Quarm. Friday night we tried a different
              engagement method we heard of a few other folks using and though
              we gave it two shots, we couldn't get it to really work for us.
              Astroglide really pissed the sheep off and not only did THEY become
              hard to handle....frankly we didn't have chains strong enough to
              keep Carrot, Cmgal, Trast, Blacktalun, Faerus and even (to our
              surprise) Chionia off of them. Evidently greased sheep is a warrrior
              mating thing. It was sad and pathetic. Even with Quarm in camp,
              all they wanted was the sheep...and with THEM on it, Quarm ignored
              it and that was the ballgame.</p>
            <p>So, we came back today and lined up Qdiddy in our regular fashion.
              It was a great fight, fun and psychotic as always and we came up
              just shy...9% ain't dead, but it ain't shoddy for our first pass
              either. We all had the Sam Jackson wallets out, swinging them for
              all the mojo we could muster, but Quarm lived to fight another
              day.</p>
            <p>Next time, he won't be so lucky. Hastur la bye bye!<br>
