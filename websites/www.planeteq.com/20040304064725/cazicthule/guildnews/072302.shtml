              Manelanau ) after the rezzes Daemonwulf left to play Arnica and 
              we continued to hunt on floor 2 ( the Library ). We had a great 
              time. We got several oif the 1st and second floor keys. There was 
              some lower lkevel armor that dropped but everyone had better that 
              they were weraing and most of what was dropping was lore no drop.

              ), several got much closer to dinging. We all discussed comming

              July 16th
            <p>Okay after the AL, we needed to set our sights higher! So we killed 
              Vyzh'dra the Cursed on the first attempt. It was a long fight, but 
              one that was enjoyable! Grats go out to Tarisk on his Vengeful Mail 
              of the Void, Cammillion, on her Opaline Charm and to Jozz for his 
              new Claw of Vyzh'dra.<br>
              <br>
              July 15th</p>
            <p>Tonight we decided to see if the AL was a fluke and we killed him 
              easily on the first try. Who knew there is such a word as strategy. 
              Congratulations to Tazzor on his Sleeves of Elemental Auras and 
              to CC on the Sword of Lost Crusades and <br>
              Shield of Vigor.<br>
              <br>
              July 13th</p>
            <p>Today, the Talons decided to challenge ourselves by killing Cazic 
              Thule with only <br>
              32 people. We brought the great ugly down almost too easily. Congratulations 
              to Oscarr on his Halo of the Enlightened and to Bildaen on his Bile 
              Etched Obsidian Choker. After CT, we ran over to DN and promptly 
              dropped Zlandicar.<br>

              July 12th</p>
            <p>Arch Lich Rhag Zadune</p>
            <p>Tonight through trial and error we were able to successfully kill 
              this mob for the first time. Thanks everyone for sticking with it 
              and working through different strategies. The AL dropped a Great 
              Helm of Vision that was awarded to Kaylynne, a Faded Skull Medallion 
              that Purefaith looted and Mogaba received the Savage Lord's Pitchatka. 
              Congratulations to all on a well fought battle!</p>
            <p> <br>
              July 8th</p>
            <p>Tonight we headed over to kill our favorite dwarf (and no not Rasten!) 
              Congratulations to Rounlin on looting the Dain's head, Stonedealer 
              on his new cloak, Glaiden on the crown and Kajawana on her hammer. 
              After Dain, we headed to the Deep and killed the burrower again. 
              Congratulations to Fellus on his ore ring and CC on theirs and to 
              Mildaan on the Stone ring. <p>

              Friday night we spotted Rumblecrush up, so we headed to Umbral Plains 
              to kill the overgrown earth elemental. </p>
            <p>Being BG's first encounter with Rumble we weren't completely sure 
              what to expect, but when our first ever attempt took him down to 
              R, we knew we were on the right track. We reset, made a couple of 
              adjustments, and made swift work of him.</p>
            <p>Grats to Promissqus on Breastplate of Integrity, grats Minuvil 
              on Ethereal Silk Sleeves, and grats Enchantrianna on Threaded Platinum 
              Bracelet. WOOT!</p>

              Last Friday we hit Velks hard with Illusion of Apathy. We managed 
              to clean out the named, Lord D and Velk the Sorcerer DOWN.</p>
            <p>Monday the two guilds made a quick clearing of Fear, but were sad 
              to see Mr. Cazic wasn't around for some lovin. :)</p>
            <p>Grats to all who got loot from the raids.

            <p>After this week, our bloodlust (or is it lewt lust, heh) wasn't 
              sated, so we went to Fear with the late night crew. 2 hours to clear

            <p>A surprise patch meant a slight change in plans. We hit the basement, 
              and knocked the Vyzh'Dhra the Cursed down again with our friends 
              in Talons. Faster fight this time, and one I think we have down

              we went to velks lab in hopes that velks would pop, but he didn't

              early, we pulled out and killed him anyway, in-house, and just 1

              Took a long tour tonight of Siren's Grotto. We crawled around the

              of us and few of us had seen all the sights. Gem drops were excellent

              Its been an awesome week of hunting, killing, and pillaging. Gratz 
              to Ghob, Hekter, Aliciarose, Krakinz, Uldarian, and Kithov for hitting 
              some new levels this week.<br>
              <br>
              We pounded our way into City of Mist on two different nights this 
              week and had great success each night. Grats to Kalander on picking 
              up his books, Sacrelig and myself each snagged a Jade Reaver and 
              can progress on our epics. We also dropped the mage epic mob there 
              but alas poor Balazar was not with us.<br>
              <br>
              Picked the wrong day to go into Kael, 150+ peeps in zone made for 
              a bad lag issue. We decided to hit the King Tormax area and pushed 
              around the giants for a few hours there. Gratz to Kalander on chain 
              gloves, Krakinz on leather boots, and Drizo for a modest upgrade 
              on his cloak, which dropped off some silly level 63 named giant, 
              Dallirizo or some such. Scuse the poor memory but ive been up late 
              the last few nights taking down mobs for my epic and getting alot 
              of sleep.<br>
              <br>
              A few groups of us have seen raping mobs in Velks and the Forager 
              Rotation in Traxx.<br>
              <br>
              Welcome aboard to Malom, Krakinz, and Celtin. Glad to have ya.<br>
              <br>
              Submitted July 13<br>
              Started out with our normal Kael raid with LoN and again no drops 
              as Kael seemed to be bugged. We heard VSR was up so moved over to 
              Karnors asap. After a few pick ups of more guildies, we moved in 
              and quickly took down the resurrected VR with not a problem. A bit 
              of over kill but its always better to have more than not enough 
              :). Grats to Sacrelig and Ligoris on picking up their stones.<br>
              Raided Chardok with Legion of Nox and came away with the norms for 
              drops. Sarnark Battle Shields, one to Andorean one to Kalander, 
              a nice ring that is slated for the hands of Ligoris and a few spells.</p>
            <p>Exp has been flowing nicely for many peeps and some nice levels 
              where attained recently. Most noted was Balazar who can now CoH 
              our raids, very nice indeed and welcome relief for those of us who 
              work late and cant make the raids when they start. Now no excuses 
              will be accepted. Shadowrose, Amadaus,Swadi, Badexposure, Kithov, 
              Rosaran, Uladarian and yours truely all found a few new levels.</p>
            <p>Groups of us have raided Howling Stones and 2 groups plunged into 
              Dragon Necro for a fun time. Jonzer, Xmortis and Houfter have found 
              a home in Scarlet Desert and have initiated a few of us to this 
              nice zone.</p>
            <p>Grats to everyone in DoKR as we all pooled our resourses and picked 
              up the Blessing of Aegolism for Andorean. This spell will cut down 
              on dot costs and raid set up time. Very nicely done everyone.</p>
            <p>Welcome aboard to Quecheng and Ghob. Glad to have both of you in 
              the family of Defenders of Kerra Ridge.</p>

            <p>K, that was my rant for the day.</p>
            <p>Oh, but we did get a couple of new members into the guild, welcome 
              aboard Buhf and Omnislash. I'm sure we'll corrupt you soon enough.</p>

              ....and so I've been slacking off for about the last four hours 
              or so trying to think up something for the News page. We really 
              didn't do a whole heck of a lot today, as most everything was, and 
              is still dead. Maybe something interesting will spawn overnight, 
              or else we'll be doing nothing but lame exp camps... and well that 
              doesn't really make for entertaining news.<br>

              <br>
              Well IoA did it sorta, our goal was to bring this bad boy down and 
              we did it. After many attempts 4th time was our lucky number for 
              the night. We teamed up with a handful of Forgotten Destiny at the 
              end to help bring this Mooo foo down. Nothing exciting dropped other 
              than the Cheastplate of Vindication, nobody wanted so we passed 
              it on to FD, Gratz Kitiella on the Vindi head I hope those PoG quest 
              gloves prove real handy. Necro spell: Conglaciation of Bone, gratz 
              bank. </p>
            <p>Well other than the small incident of a ninja looter we did have 
              a pretty good time. As the old saying goes try, try, try, try, try, 
              try and try again you will succeed. As for the others, neener neeener 
              you should not have logged we got lots of grats from the zone. Well 
              off to other things to dominate. </p>

              Well we were going to start the day off by Killing Vindicator, but 
              somebody got to him first. So we headed down to trash the next best 
              thing, Velketor. He was a good fight, he brought 2 of his friends 
              in and killed us before we could land the finishin blow, so we rezzed 
              up and pulled him again. This time his buddies were not there, becuase 
              we killed them bawahahahha. He did have some good loot and nice 
              spell drops. Gratz Manadar on that nice Vermilion Robe of Torrefecation, 
              Stretch on the Spell Book </p>
            <p>Afterwards ee headed to Griegs for some fun, changed into monsters 
              and eventually killed the dude in the black robes, Servitor of Luclin, 
              on the first try. He did not drop much Gratz Devulla on Wand of 
              Musing and Rado on Somberous Claidmore, and to the lucky winner 
              of the Vex Thal ore, just need about 40 more Servitor Kills now.

              From Casters Relm... </p>
            <p>This from the scheduled downtime page: <br>
              On Wednesday, July 24th, at 3AM PDT, (10AM GMT), all EverQuest servers 
              will be brought down for a scheduled patch. The estimated downtime 
              is 5 hours. <br>
              - The EverQuest Operations Team </p>
            <p>We asked Alan VanCouvering if this patch would put the new User 
              Interface and the Bazaar on the Live Servers. Here was the response: 
              <br>
              Yes - As a part of the rollout for the new interface, Beta Two of 
              the new UI and the Bazaar will begin on the Live servers as of the 
              next patch. <br>
              It's had an excellent few weeks overall on the Test Server and we'll 
              be running it on the Live servers in an optional mode until we're 
              satisfied with it. We'll give details about how to turn these options 
              on in the patch message. </p>
            <p>- Alan </p>
            <p>Should be a great day for EQ'ers if all goes smoothly! </p>

              <br>
              Well we started the day off with finishing up our first Beastlord 
              Epic, Grats Skyth on those neeto Backscratchers. Soon after we followed 
              up by heling Faya with her final 8th shawl quest, some extra booty 
              dropped grats Fanorn and Kitiella on those nifty hammers. </p>
            <p>Later Friday evening Lodizal made a suprise appearance <br>
              and was the guest of honor at our turtle soup dinner. He drop 2 
              shields, Grats Gine and Stretch; a Belt of the Great Turtle, Grats 
              Azune; Knotted Turtlebone ring, Grats Snoopz and the map piece, 
              Gratz Kuryl on the Eyepatch of Plunder. </p>
            <p>Well we attempted Vindi later that day and did not fair so well. 
              Somebody trained the lag monster on us several times and Ko'ed some 
              poeple with LD. So we licked our woulds shook hands with Vinid and 
              called it a night. We well try agian later when the LD monsters 
              stop aggroing the clerics. </p>

              <br>
              Well Wednesday sure made up for those dry days we had earlier this 
              week. All in a days work we made a real menace of ourselves and 
              unleashed apathy all over those dragons in Velious. Starting the 
              day off with a nice Wuoshi kill set IoA/ and PE off in the mood 
              to Down Telk later that day. Grats to Azune on emerald scale ( You 
              will look good in green) and Flintaar on Skydarkener Bow( p.s. bro 
              I will always be better then you on archery). </p>
            <p>Telkenor must have been on welfare becuase he only dropped 3 things 
              and no spells, bummer :( . Grats to Fadari on the Lance of Thunder 
              and to Flintaar on Emerald Bastardsword of Purity, PE recieved the 
              Necklace of Nightstalking. During the down time between dragon deaths 
              we did manage to scrape up a few SS armor pieces that rarely drop 
              Plate BP and Plate Legs. Grats Saphfyre on the Plate BP , Flintaar 
              on the plate Legs, and Hachidan on silk hat. </p>
            <p>All in all it was a better day that made up for the downtime. Gwendle 
              manage to find the woman of his dreams at Telkenor killing, hope 
              you two kick it off :) . In closing Bob, Velks, Vindi start washing 
              your asses, becasue we plan to hand them back real soon. </p>

              weekend was upon us. Down go the dragons, along with some of us. 
              I want to say that after the first day things seemed to go smoother 
              on the killings. Congrats on a job well done to all and for the 
              teamwork shown among all of us. </p>
            <p>Congrats Bergin on Shadowfang from Beldion Icewind <br>

              belt and Gardaor was in need of a new eye, Lady Nevederia gladly

            <p>News: AoW dominated by a single guild on the Cazic-Thule server? 
              <br>
              posted on 07-18-2002 10:16 PM by Magnuss Surestab<br>
              You guessed it - Tonight, Thursday July 18th 2002 was the first 
              time the Avatar of War has been killed by a single guild on the 
              Cazic-Thule server. </p>
            <p>The night started off rough, having to airdrop Woushi on the way 
              in, which now, looking back at it, seemed a harder task then taking 
              down AoW himself. Not many people were on the same page, which was 
              a worrysome thing at first, only because of the huge task ahead 
              of us.</p>
            <p>We got together, pulled our collective heads out of our asses, 
              and set up for the fight. It seemed like seconds passed and the 
              Idol was pulled...and again, in my opinion, struggled with the mob. 
              Things weren't looking too good from my perspective - for good reason. 
              And with just enough time to take a short breath and in the blink 
              of an eye, the Avatar of War was charging our camp.</p>
            <p>Now, personally I have high expectations of my guildmates, and 
              our earlier performance wasn't our best show...but nothing could 
              prepare me for what I was about to witness... </p>
            <p>The Avatar of War was completely owned - FLAWLESSLY. Superb tanking 
              by the TRULL himself, Foulbreath (only tank to take beats the entire 
              fight), flawless healing by the BEST FUCKING CLERIC CREW IN THE 
              GAME, and no deaths. </p>
            <p>Relentless 1, Avatar of War 0</p>
            <p>Loot was monk legs, ring, and sword, huge grats to Mintern, Thornsong, 
              and Rabrak on your phatty stuffs. Congratulations to every member 
              of this guild on that AoW kill, you are truely Relentless.</p>
            <p></p>

              to kill CT.<br>

              Drove My Chevy To The Levy But The Levy Was Dry.....<br>
              This week it happened, and I feel kinda good about it, so I will 
              let you in on it...<br>
              The major target for the week was Cursed. We had looked at him twice 
              before and not quite gotten it done. So, we consulted the brain 
              trust for a plan. We asked throughout for ideas on what we needed 
              to get over the hump and the resounding cry was &quot;Paint Tha 
              Mother Pink&quot;. None of us knew what the hell that meant, but 
              we stepped up and took our swings at Cursed anyway.</p>
            <p>Sure enough, the paint it pink plan worked. We don't know why, 
              but Cursed died the big death and there was rejoicing. Unfortunatly 
              there were no Ranger loots, so we hadda let it all rot (stupid guild 
              bylaws).</p>
            <p>Oh, and before we move on to other news, I wish to share my new 
              favorite quote, stolen from freely from Boanerges and modifed to 
              fit my humor....</p>
            <p>&quot;Let's say there are 200 people in Ssra. No, wait, that's 
              unrealistic. Let's say there's 300 people in Ssra....&quot;</p>
            <p>Anyway, moving on....</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>In the &quot;also killed&quot; category for the week, we have a 
              pretty fast move through PoF with a whack on Cazic, the AoW, Arch 
              Lich, a nice and tidy NToV clear and a couple other things I am 
              certainly forgetting....</p>
            <p>The AoW is an &quot;Also Killed&quot; now, how cool is that?</p>
            <p>So....you might think somethin in there is what I am feelin good 
              about, but you'd be wrong. What has got me happy? My pavlovian conditioning 
              has finally broken and I can spill the beans on how we kill what 
              we do....</p>
            <p><br>
              Ya see, back long ago in ages past, Piro saw the movie &quot;A Clockwork 
              Orange&quot;. Might seem innocent enough but it was a sad, sad day 
              for us. Ya see, it gave Piro an idea that lead to the secret behind 
              DA/SS.</p>
            <p>Every person that joins the alliance is given weeks of intense 
              response/reward conditioning. Then a small appliance is attatched 
              to the members PC. It's really quite simple.</p>
            <p>Each time the person does something they are supposed to do (heal, 
              taunt, cast DS on a ranger) a small bell rings by their monitor 
              and a Cheeto rolls down a food dispenser next to their keyboard 
              and the member is allowed 1 second to eat. If we DON'T do it, we 
              don't eat. Remarkably effective.</p>
            <p>They are likely gonna cut off my supply for squealing, so if ya 
              don't mind, please save any Cheetos ya come across and email them 
              to kyrthor@shadowedsoul.com, I could really use them....</p>

              Note to Verant Interactive:</p>
            <p>If you ask your high end players to stay in the same zone for months 
              on end, please make sure the zone is populated completely by frogloks. 
              That is the only monster we wanna kill, anyway.</p>
            <p>Hope everyone had a happy holiday.</p>
            <p>Now shut down yer web browser, get back in the game and head to 
              Ssra, ya slackers.</p>
