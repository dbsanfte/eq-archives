              Mar 5 2002 12:47AM - Dragons Volkaran <br>
              Visited ST today <br>
              Grats to Andreas on Primal Bow and our new melee Chanter Emmuno 
              on Primal Brawl Stick 
            <p>Lendinara died short after, grats Darstardly of PE on Sleepers 
              Key. <br>
              Also thanks to Lendinara to drop 3 !!! Helms of Truesight. <br>
              Leafric got one, Hedda and Melk of PE the others. Grats. </p>
            <p>We where short on Clerics so waited 2 years to fly them in from 
              the moon :( <br>
              Still killed Sontalek...so Grats Woker on ST key. <p>
              Mar 4 2002 5:24PM - Dead Giant Volkaran <br>
              Yesterday as our friends from PE where busy on some Guild Event 
              we looked around to find something killable. </p>
            <p>We ended in Velks Labyinth moving up to Castle to remove the Boss 
              of this Dungeon from his room. <br>
              Nice fight, Velketor went down without problems. <br>
              Andreas head still hurting, but who cares p </p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Grats to Iluvatar on Vermillion Orb of Torrefaction, Alex on Crystal 
              Crown of Confusion and destroy button on Shield of the Freezing 
              Winds. </p>
            <p>After Velk we moved to Burning Woods and killed Cleric Epic Mob 
              Ixblast for Pargal, grats. <br>
              <br>
              Mar 2 2002 9:40PM - Killed some stuff Volkaran <br>
              CT server crashed on us as Myga was at 40%, rude Verant. </p>
            <p>Went to Hate then for Aaniniel and got a nice little Staff of Magi, 
              Aedra some Dust and Teeleaf a great Book. <br>
              Was fun clear. </p>
            <p>After that cleared Fear to get it ready for CT later. </p>
            <p>Then moved to Kael and killed Vindi with PE, grats Hazh on BP. 
            </p>
            <p>After Vindi was down we decided to visit The Statue of Rallos Zek 
              in her Temple, bringing her down easy. <br>
              Grats Torut on Scroll, Grip on Cloak. </p>
            <p>Headed to ToV and killed new buffed Telk. <br>
              He droped kickass Paladin Weapon grats Leafric and PE Twink on new 
              SK Weapon. </p>
            <p>Then finally CT showed his ugly face and we all headed to Fear 
              again. </p>
            <p>First try was bad, second too. <br>
              But he died on second, so who cares p <br>
              To be honest, a normal kill where no one dies, Ch Chain works like 
              it should, Tanks tank, Casters nuke and Mob dies is boring. <br>
              Nothing against the fun on an crazy kill people die all over, aggro 
              control goes to hell, CH Chain breaks here and there but Mob still 
              dies and drops a nice Robe for Kiviran, Eye for Vesuv and Cloak 
              for Kemuvirion. <br>
              Grats to all who got loot today :)<br>

              The elusive Zordak Ragefire finally showed his face, but he didn't 
              last long. After waking a few people up, CoG thrashed him soundly. 
              Very big Gratz to Sereta for getting her clicker. Gratz to Ensidious 
              for her new Gauntlets of Fiery Might. Gratz to Tyelia on her new 
              Treasure Hunter's Satchel. Gratz to Maulder on his new Bracer of

              Risk Versus Reward - Merauk (3/7/2002 3:12 AM) <br>
              <br>
              Last night we killed The High Priest which in his newest form is 
              arguably one of the harder mobs in EQ land. He dropped loot I wouldn't 
              give to Laans pet goat. Tonight we killed the Arch Lich and got 
              two tendon slicers (crap loot but the mob is pretty sad to begin 
              with so won't bitch much).</p>
            <p>After AL we took a late night trip to Greigs End and wasted the 
              big man himself with 14 people (and probably could have done it 
              with 6) and he dropped loot which is 10x better.</p>
            <p>What is wrong with the balance in this game after three months 
              that loot drops are still entirely out of whack in SOL.<br>
              <br>
              The unfolding story - Merauk (3/5/2002 11:58 PM) <br>

            <p>Couple weeks ago I posted this nice picture of our High Priest 
              fight.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Tonight BFA is proud to finally bring you this picture which you 
              won't see in to many other places around EQ land. Notice everyone 
              rallying around The Rauk and Skimmins bowing to my greatness.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Luckily we don't kill mobs for l00t's because this mofacka dropped 
              worst crap ever.<br>

              Tunare dead - Merauk (3/3/2002 3:33 PM) <br>

              First fight we were still sleeping. Second fight only death was 
              Gabantik :-(</p>
            <p>Everyone agreed that The Rauk showing up right as the battle started 
              was the key to our total victory.<br>

              Tuxy writes &quot;Spent the night in the Hole for some fun last 
              night. <br>
              First up on the menu was Master Yael, and an almost flawless fight 
              saw him die after only getting off one real death touch on our favorite 
              pally Sparty. Grats Surreall on the ore. <br>
              Next up was The Ghost of Kindle who even Fendos could've tanked, 
              grats Cerebral on his epic piece. <br>
              We then ploughed our way through a few ghosts before nailing the 
              coffin on Keeper of the Tombs. <br>
              Finally we made one attempt at Scalekeeper but wiped after Tuxy 
              died and we couldn't switch heals and runes fast enough. <br>
              Fun night, good work all!&quot; <br>

              Dragons owned ! <br>
              Made our ways to Temple of Veeshan and paid Lendi a visit. Had a 
              warping mob there which resulted in a brief wipe. Got up and running 
              again and killed Lendi in a furious and really close battle. Lacking 
              clerics there made it really hard, but we won ) Sontalak was a pain, 
              only 38 people there and whiped in 1. try. Killed him in 2. nd try 
              thou. Awesome job all. Grats to Melk on BP of Superiority, Arrynean 
              on Ranger Ring and Lilcure on ST key. <br>

              February FACTS! (No, really...) <br>
              Posted By: Etiena on 07 March 2002</p>
            <p>51 mobs butted heads with The Relentless in February, who felt 
              the wrath the most is debatable.<br>
              We attempted 15 mobs in house.<br>
              36 mobs were attempted by the BFA.<br>
              There were 28 days in February.<br>
              We had 4 EXP days.<br>
              2 days no-one has a clue what we did <br>
              We attempted 2.3 mobs per day.<br>
              In my logs, Teufle said &#145;I &lt;3 you&#146; to 49 different 
              people.<br>
              12 mobs were in Ssra, we spent the most time in Ssra.<br>
              We killed Glyphed/Exiled 3 times and attempted Cursed once (then 
              ran away crying).<br>
              Soel fell asleep at a raid once in Feb.<br>
              We attempted Creator 3 times, Arch Lich twice, and killed Rhags 
              twice.<br>
              Tunare felt our wrath the most, we killed her 5 times.<br>
              Browny sent me the most &#145;&lt;3&#146; after receiving Shissar.<br>
              We were in Kael for 9 mobs, attempted AoW 2 times in Feb.<br>
              We cleared Temple of Veeshan twice, once being the quickest clearing 
              of any server. (I believe)<br>
              We killed Thought Horror Overfiend only once, tried Burrower twice, 
              got owned twice. <br>
              We killed Klandicar 4 times, Zlandicar once, got 5 ST keys.<br>
              There were 14 more &#145;F Ziths&#146; than &#145;F Soels&#146; 
              in Feb.<br>
              We cleared Sleepers 3 times, got 3 10th Dain rings, and got smoooshed 
              by Dozekar once. <br>
              We took a trip down memory lane and cleared Veeshans Peak we also 
              reminded Trakanon who was boss once.<br>
              Thornsong died in 5 different AND incredible circumstances, blamed 
              Mandaloran twice.<br>
              We killed Itraer Vius twice and finished the month with Shei Vinitras 
              dying to The BFA with a server first.<br>

            <p> From :~) to :~( in 30 seconds <br>
              Posted By: Zith on 06 March 2002</p>
            <p>After getting High Priest to 20% last night, only to have him CH'd 
              to 100% health in a few seconds (keke) we knew we had to come back 
              tonight and destroy his sorry ass.<br>
              So tonight we came back. After a cluster of a first attempt (seems 
              a reoccuring theme) we dropped his ass.</p>
            <p>There was mass :~) as everyone saw:</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Another first for us and Cazic Thule as High Priest of Ssraeszha 
              sent to Freeport.</p>
            <p>But.. the :~)'s suddenly turned to mass :~('s as the loot was revealed 
              to us.......</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>This absolutely INCREDIBLE piece of hardware plus a bunch of SPELLS!!!</p>
            <p>Mass tears were shed as BFA members understood that we got screwed 
              over yet AGAIN by Verant's Vision(tm).</p>
            <p>Risk vs Reward? Good one!</p>
            <p><br>
              After High Priest bit it, we took out Zlandicar (Grats Valinor on 
              ST key), and then did another Ring War. Grats to Faolan on his shiny 
              new Ring of Dain.</p>
            <p></p>

              Posted By: Thornsong on 01 March 2002, at 09:48 AM </p>
            <p>Started off the day with an early slaying of Klandicar. Grats Merwyn 
              on the Sleeper's Key.<br>
              Then we moved to Akheva and took down that wimp Itraer. Then, feeling 
              good about ourselves with our previous nights kills of Archlich 
              and Creator, we decided to lower morale by getting owned by Shei. 
              But, instead we got a server first:</p>
            <p>Click here for pic: http://www.kidsville.net/sports/bonbon/Shei.jpg 
            </p>
            <p>Now on a real high, we busted down to Great Divide and took out 
              Narandi with the late night crew earning Faen -- who we failed last 
              week for -- his 10th Ring. Grats Faen.</p>
            <p>A Good Day to be Relentless.</p>

              Wednesday, March 6th, 2002. <br>
              Workin In A Coal Mine, Goin Downtown....<br>
              Last week, we kack'd the Thought Horror Overfiend (new version) 
              one day, and the Burrower Parasite the next. Well.....doin it that 
              way again is so....well....last week!</p>
            <p>This week we hadda kill both on the same day, and kill them we 
              did. We zoned into the deep, plowed to the bridge, leaped off the 
              bridge, dragged some corpses, leaped off the bridge again, waited 
              while the late arrivals showed up, laughed at them as they almost 
              died making it to the bridge only to watch them leap into space 
              and miss the bridge, and then for good measure we fell off the bridge 
              again. After that stupid *@^%@$#@^ing bridge, the Parasite and the 
              THO are cake in comparison.<br>
              Not buying the cake theory? Bah! Ok, so they ain't cake, but they 
              ARE fun as hell (Note to VI, more like these, plzthx). They are 
              a sort of beautiful chaos of a fight, and if you can't react, you 
              get wiped....AWESOME. You don't need 80 people to do them (hell, 
              we had 37 fot THO....well....36 if you don't count me from fallin 
              asleep) and they are certainly not based around main tanking, are 
              MTs exploits yet?<br>
              Welp, kiss kiss, time for Rangers to go sleepy-bye with dreams of 
              big nasty Avatars...</p>
