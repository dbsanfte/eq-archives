            <p>Every game has it's own language used by players, which evolves
              over time. If you have played other online games with people, you
              probably know
              much
              of
              the abbreviations
              and terms
              develop with the idea of 
              typing as
              little as possible in a short time to communicate what you mean.
              Sometimes all the shorthand can get confusing, so here's a start.
              Each day
              new
              terms
              and abbreviations
              come into play, so this list is
              as
              current
              as
              it
              can be, given
              the lightning speed of communication on the net, but it certainly
              won't be complete. Send in your abbreviations and add to the list!</p>
