              Comments </font></b></p>
            <p> Hello and well met, my main avatar's name is Kolanin, and I'm 
              glad to be known by that name here. Before I go on to the topic 
              I plan on exploring in this, my first article to be posted on Planet 
              EQ, I would like to share a little about myself and my history in 
              the lands of Norrath as a player.<br>
              <br>
              After playing every kind of First Person Shooter and computer Role 
              Playing Game, I tripped upon Everquest. Friends warned me that I 
              could become a hermit thanks to the amazing game and even the box 
              echoed the warning with a quote from a reviewer that said; &quot;Buy 
              this game for someone you love if you never want to see them again!&quot; 
              I looked at the check out girl after chuckling and showed her the 
              quote. She nodded solemnly and admitted that her boyfriend played. 
              I laughed when she said; &quot;See you when the next expansion comes 
              out.&quot; Little did I know the correctness of her statement, as 
              just a few weeks later I found myself in her check out line buying 
              Scars of Vellious. <br>
              <br>
              My entrance into the world of Norrath is remembered fondly. Guild 
              less and for the most part clueless I was surrounded by my fellow 
              newbie's in the Greater Faydark, thrilled by the continuous war 
              of Orc Hill and Crushbone, and enjoying myself immensely as I role 
              played my heart out.</p>
            <p> Weeks passed in real life, and a role playing romance was developing. 
              It was a great deal of fun, and the hunting partnership was near 
              perfect. My cleric and her bard fought side by side, shared long 
              boat trips across the Ocean of Tears, and discovered new and challenging 
              zones. I shudder at the corpse runs I had to endure at times. The 
              role playing aspect of our hunting partnership eroded and the veil 
              of fantasy lifted, revealing what I had suspected all along. My 
              male cleric had been flirting with a female bard avatar, who turned 
              out to be played by a married man with two children.</p>
            <p>If I wasn't so busy laughing myself into hysterics along with my 
              cousin, who was sitting right beside me when the discovery was made, 
              I would have been disturbed by the revelation. Quickly realizing 
              that a friendship emerged out of the whole ordeal, things righted 
              themselves very well and the hunting partnership, changed forever, 
              continued. <br>
              In real life a couple of months passed, and I was invited to another 
              server by local friends, where I began playing a Druid named Kolanin, 
              and an entirely new role playing experience began. The quest for 
              levels and the equally important quest for equipment.</p>
            <p> Role playing was a novelty on this new server, and there were 
              so many high level characters everywhere that it was staggering. 
              After a few weeks I had met some very good players, and after becoming 
              a friend to one woman living far south of myself, our characters 
              were married. The union wasn't made to last however, and the guild 
              we were members in was rocked by a fairly civil Everquest divorce. 
              The friendship between the other player and I remains, however, 
              and that's something I am very grateful for. <br>
              <br>
              Over a year has passed since that particular episode in my Everquest 
              experience and Kolanin the Druid has been a member in three different 
              guilds, each with different ideas about how the game should be played. 
              Since I began playing this game, it has changed so drastically, 
              that I sometimes feel like it's not the same game I purchased at 
              all. I know this is partially due to the fact that I'm on an old 
              server, but some of the same sentiments are shared by many players.</p>
            <p>With the addition of the new, many things become suddenly old, 
              and there has been a lot added to Norrath since I began playing. 
              In the next two articles I'll explore some of the key changes I've 
              found, and how this has become one of the key parts of ongoing discussions 
              on the bulletin boards, especially with regard to the ongoing Everquest 
              II debate. </p>
