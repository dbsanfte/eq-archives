              Jan 9 2003 6:07PM - The last time in Band camp... Deacis <br>
              For me anyway... signing off EQ for my part, but wont matter much, 
              since Anavon will be alive and kicking more than ever ;) 
            <p>We did a lot of stuff the past few days, including a lot of VT, 
              which for all parts, was very very nice :p But thats not why I am 
              posting some news ;) </p>
            <p>Finally got the chance to browse through my screenies, and well... 
              Anavon is still a pretty wierd place to be in... see for yourselves... 
              <br>
              <br>
              Yup... thats right... Bloodrack is definitely not a pornstar... 
              Not so sure about banno though... </p>
            <p>But we dont always talk about sex in Anavon... Well... ok... we 
              do... <br>
              <br>
              So whats up with being horny? <br>
              <br>
              Ok ok... </p>
            <p>But at least I am not the only one trying to get down on... <br>
              <br>
              See, no sex... </p>
            <p>We also have this rogue named Balak... He is very bright, sharp 
              and immensely intelligent... <br>
              <br>
              Just too bad he has the memory of a fortune cookie... <br>
              <br>
              Thankfully he is a rogue... Or... </p>
            <p>He could be playing Pepi as well... <br>
              <br>
              Who knows? </p>
            <p>We had this Dorf Pally around for a bit as well, nice chap and 
              all... just had no fashion sense... <br>
              <br>
              But he was very enthusiastic though! <br>
            </p>
            <p>During our adventurers we tend to bump into very wierd people... 
              Elcaboom knows this first hand... <br>
            </p>
            <p>And while we have akp to handle loot, Hazh knows what the real 
              rewards are... <br>
            </p>
            <p>And while Hazh wants gold medals, our greedy dorf clerics tend 
              to... well... spend too much cash on pearls for their hair, or something... 
              <br>
              <br>
              The nerve of those dwarves! </p>
            <p>Did I mention that they were also very skilled? <br>
            </p>
            <p>Seen here as well... <br>
            </p>
            <p>We also have some very very very intelligent wizards around... 
              <br>
              <br>
              Nothing like running past Rumble into VT, then trying to open the 
              door with your old trusty seb key... </p>
            <p>At least we have some pretty decent monks... <br>
              <br>
              Just too bad the clerics are too busy eating pop corn... ;) </p>
            <p>The clerics are perhaps not the sharpest tools in the shed, but 
              they sure know their medieval english accent... <br>
              <br>
              At least they fart... <br>
            </p>
            <p>From time to time, we also get tells like this... <br>
              <br>
              Yes of course I do... When hell freezes over and a pig pops by asking 
              me to eat its bacon fast... </p>
            <p>We dont dapple much in tactics and such, but we do set up some 
              rules on raids... <br>
            </p>
            <p>At least we treat eachother good <br>
            </p>
            <p>And we are very very close <br>
            </p>
            <p>But again... not the sharpest tools around... <br>
            </p>
            <p>But sure do get some wierd tells when doing CoH... <br>
            </p>
            <p>But then again Torut has always been a good focused shaman... As 
              seen in PoG... <br>
              <br>
              And helped by his side kick Uros... <br>
              <br>
              When he died to tunare as only one... </p>
            <p>Uros is the devil though... <br>
              <br>
              Now he made me hungry twice with that remark :/ </p>
            <p>Speaking of AKP, which we take very very seriously... <br>
            </p>
            <p>But at least Anavon members always went out of their way to make 
              me happy... Well, not all... but Teeleaf did... Several times a 
              day... <br>
              <br>
              fun fun fun ;) </p>
            <p>See you lot in another game in the future ;)<br>

              Even though we collectively hate Ssraeshza Temple, we decided to 
              spl0itZzZ our way into doing Arch Lich Rhag`Zadune twice today. 
              Various people asked me if we used SK aggro spl0itZzZ to kill him 
              as well, and no, we didn't. </p>
            <p>Well, why not? Doing Arch Lich Conquest style has never hurt before!<br>
              One reason: Verizon.</p>
            <p>Usually I am the flagship of the fleet of aggro exploitation, but 
              today my DSL decided that mid-raid would be a good time to die on 
              me. Much like Gallagher TV specials, my DSL's bizarre behavior shows 
              up way more than you'd expect, or desire, to see. Thanks, telecom 
              monopolies that encourage mediocre service for making it impossible 
              for me to get screenshots for my guild news page. </p>
            <p>Something else people were asking is is why we spent our time slumming 
              in Ssra today when there were all sorts of powerful planar things 
              in the Planes of Power to overpower, planarlike. Well, to be perfectly 
              honest, PoP is conceptually idiotic. PoP advancement is surprisingly, 
              quite similar to having Attention Deficit Disorder. First you're 
              off engaged in a deep, meaningful plot line to help Thelin Poxbourne 
              overcome Terris Thule and eventually confront Saryrn -- hey, we're 
              tired of that, let's go see what the forces of Bertoxxulous are 
              up to! After we're done avenging the souls of many by finally destroying 
              Bertoxxu -- hey, let's go ride our bikes! <br>
              Just like ADD, folks, and Ssra was our Ritalin. <br>
              <br>
              Whatever. </p>

              We did Trials in Halls of Honor today for flags to HoHB.</p>
            <p>Trial 1: Dragon or Something</p>
            <p>The fight looked like this to me - it was a very challenging encounter.

            <p>Trial 2: Villagers? I think?</p>
            <p>Another grueling trial (probably). </p>
            <p>Trial 3: Madmen? Who cares</p>

              Bertox Dead <br>

            </p>
            <p>For the first time on the CT server, Bertoxolus, God of Disease 
              (and Kela's father, some say...) died to the combined forces of 
              CC and Talons.</p>
            <p>On our first attempt. We'd never done the ring event before (thanks 
              to Overcrowded Thule), never popped the big guy, nothing. </p>
            <p>He's dead, though. And all we have is this crappy screenshot. Why? 
              Because someone skellyformed the corpse. $&amp;$*(#</p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Congrats to Furran of CC on his Circle of Rotting Flesh, and Rikkir 
              on his Slippers of the Plaguebringer.</p>
            <p>Since the last update, we also knocked down Talon Zek, Agnarr (again), 
              Behemoth (F* zone crashes), Aerin Dar, and more HoH trials than 
              you can shake a stick at.</p>
            <p><br>
              Only Marr stands in our way to Sol Ro's Tower - and thank god we're 
              about done with trials.</p>
            <p><br>

              Happy New Year! <br>

            <p>Yeah, its been a while since we've had a &quot;Meat and Potatos&quot; 
              update - mostly due to the holidays, and the fact that we've spent 
              most of our time farming &quot;old&quot; content, and/or flagging, 
              rather than trying new encounters.</p>
            <p>However, we did manage to knock this sad fella down:</p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>First try, too. Yet another well designed, fun encounter. VI has 
              done a fantastic job, so far, making the boss fights of the new 
              expansion challenging, without resorting to being &quot;cheap&quot;.</p>
            <p>So, after he fell, we were able to introduce many of our rangers, 
              druids, and other Queernos citizens to their gimp god. We also put 
              a set of Stormriders Gauntlets on Warlor, and Saze of Talons picked 
              up a Ubah new earring.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>We've also killed the behemoth a time or two, and gotten access 
              into Tactics. Killed Aerin Dar, and gotten the alliance into the 
              Halls of Honor. Done the chapel in CoD so many times the 5k procs 
              don't phase us anymore, and killed Terris Thule and Grummus a couple 
              more times as well.</p>
            <p>Killed a bunch of old world stuff (emperor 5 or 6 times, cursed 
              3 times, burrower beast a lot, that sort-of-stuff).</p>
            <p>Anyway, now that the holidays are over, we'll be back into the 
              swing of things, I'm sure.<br>
              <br>
              Edit - in house late night AoW killing, zero deaths. Huzzah! <br>

              ARENA BASH - DEATH TO THE DRUIDS <br>
              Posted by Grasnalg On Jan 13 2003 At 05:15:39 AM <br>
              Thanks to all that came out to the Arena Bash and making it a hit. 
              Great time was had by all. 
            <p> </p>
            <p>After a while of everyone running rampant, we finally got a couple 
              Royal Rumbles going and the druids came out on top.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>The first Royal Rumble was held on the platform and the only rules 
              were self buffs only and no leaving the platform. After the weaker 
              links were weeded out, it came down to *cough* a druid and a pally. 
              Ciladin and Kestriala slowly battled wits with Kestriala finally 
              putting Cil to his miserable end. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Gratz Kest on being the Royal Rumble champ and taking home a 1k 
              purse as your prize.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Our second Royal Rumble was much the same, but this time was not 
              excluded to the platform. With everyone running around the arena, 
              it took quite a while to finish up. Kest after winning the first 
              round was a target off the start, so she didn't last long this time 
              around. The melee seemed to do better with the space to get away 
              from the casters as Engress, Varner and Leita all hung in till nearly 
              the end(I think that was the last 3 melee). In the end however, 
              the druids would prevail again as it came down to Zoehi and Battleskar. 
              Skar let down, not only the brotherhood of shaman, but all men alive 
              as Zoehi smoked him down and took the prize.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Gratz Zoehi on being the champion of the Full Arena Royal Rumble 
              and taking home the prize - 2 shiny Blue Diamonds.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Thanks again to everyone that came out and hopefully we can do 
              it again soon with a few more events planned. Congratulations to 
              our female druids who showed us what an angry woman with snare can 
              do.<br>
              <br>

              Posted by Pheign On Jan 11 2003 At 03:37:40 AM <br>
              started early and killed Zlandicar. Gratz Minuvil of BG on ST key, 
              Tariff on first brood talisman, and varrak on frakadar's talisman</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>then went to Akehva to kill IV. Gratz lowkii on IV Insignia, BG 
              on nice range item and 1hb weapon</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>we had planned to do walk the gnome in PoI, but luckily, it was 
              taken, so we decided to do a first ever Alliance kill of Cazic Thule. 
              we started out nervous, but when it came down to it, he was such 
              a wuss. dropped CT brains that went to blackmagic of BG and nice 
              caster robe went to Mayu.<br>

              Another shawl quest this evening. Gish assembled a few groups to 
              help protect the dwarf and we were able to finish the quest with 
              ease. Grats Gish on the shawl!

              With a few recent mini raids on PoS giants and the PoI dragon with 
              folks from SA, we decided to familiarize ourselves with one another 
              a bit better. What better way than to use the command that every 
              guild leader has been itching to try. Yes. Drumroll.... \GUILDWAR!</p>
            <p>The forces of Crimson Talon will take to the battlefield against 
              the forces of Second Age. The clash will be in WC, EC, NRo, Oasis, 
              and SRo. The war will be judged based on confirmed kills and/or 
              the death of the guild leader. SA will defend SRo and CT will defend 
              WC. Guild leaders will remain in these zones.</p>
            <p>The war will be an entertaining event for all of us and should 
              be an all-around entertaining event. Win-or-lose, this Jan 16th 
              should be an exciting time.</p>

              Went up to Hate this evening to bash Inny once again. Complete and 
              utter decimation is an understatement. Inny was killed so cleanly 
              by our top-notch raid force that we didn't lose a single person. 
              Odd racial loots as usual, but we also came away with an eye.</p>

              it was beautiful in it's own way. Beautiful, like, well, that hot 
              chic passed out on the bathroom floor with vomit drooling out of 
              her mouth. It's time like this that I find myself exuberant, joyful, 
              happy beyond words. Happy, like, well, like finding another can 
              of Mountain Dew in your refrigerator at 3 AM when you're getting 
              an AA every half hour so long as you can stay awake. When it came 
              time to look at the loot though, it made me sad. Sad, like, well, 
              like someone who finds that they've just wasted three years of their 
              life on EQ, they have no job, their wife left them, and theirs kids 
              call them by their avatars name because they don't respond to anything 
              else. I thought they got rid of druid only loot in kunark? Alas, 
              Grumpyleaf found it a remarkably easy way to get something good. 
              Grats Bkua as well on his uber new range item.</p>
            <p>In the end, I'm proud. Proud, like, well, when you find out your 
              kid can box a cleric on the computer next to you. And he's only 
              3 years old.</p>
            <p>Lastly, I fear for Mithaniel Marr. Fear for him, like, well, the 
              way that twinky feels when you haven't eaten food in twelve hours 
              and don't have time to make anything nutritious. Mith's going to 
              get gang raped by hordes of people who don't respect the finesse 
              of the encounter. To some it's all about the flags. FINESSE MY DEAR. 
              He desires FINESSE and a hug.</p>
            <p>Good day, once again, too much has happened in one day to truly 
              tell you all of it. Adieu!<br>

              Before I get to the Nyene stuff, I'd like to clarify my last update, 
              in that when talking about the orgy in Hawaii, I was referring to 
              being after Sithray's butthole, not his wife's. I mean, pssh. Why 
              would I want anyone BUT Sithray's?. </p>
            <p>Anyway, we decided we'd get together since Nyene wanted her epic, 
              and well she's the only female member of the guild(without a penis 
              anyway), so we all follow her around like zombies chanting for boobs. 
              So naturally, we pulled the mantrain in Timorous Deep. Faydedar 
              didn't know what to do when confronted with the mantrain power. 
              So naturally he died in about 15 seconds(WTG Verant on having a 
              15 second encounter in a place it takes 500 years to get to). Here's 
              the good juicy stuff, Nyene cyber0red us all long and good after 
              this: </p>

              Ever want to get freaky? Do the things you can only do in your wildest 
              fantasies? If you do...then for God's sake go someplace else sicko.
            <p>Being the guild that we are, feeling the need for some exploration 
              regardless of the consequences (no matter how odd), set off in the 
              Plane of Passion...errm...Torment. The place had a pretty steep 
              cover charge, but I don't think anyone missed the dorf. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Even after that we still had to deal with some back talk from the 
              bouncers, they sure didn't have much experience in the PR department.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>After a few warping mini-bosses and some other random nonsense, 
              we had no choice left but to take things up with the manager.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Browny will atest that true to her dominatrix style outfit, she 
              hit just hard enough to make you grin but not enough to kill you. 
              But as you can see, she wasn't much help.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>So if you're checking out the nightlife in the Planes, just remember 
              that while whips and chains can be fun they just aren't all they're 
              cracked up to be.</p>

              This creative piece of modern art (I think) represents the server 
              activity last night.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>The constant up and down shows just how it went when PoP zones 
              went up and down and up and down. If you watch carefully you can 
              see the Emperor's corpse poofing because officials at VI still cannot 
              count past 3 (ever notice there are no GM Clerics?). </p>
            <p>After it steadied out a bit we killed some stuff in VT, I'd tell 
              you what it was but they all look the same anyway. <br>

              Ok so maybe we don't all wear a sparkling glove, have a pet monkey 
              and grab ourselves while singing catchy 80's tunes, but we did a 
              fair job of searching out Luclin for a few targets last night.</p>
            <p>First up was our good friend and royal pain in the bum, Seru. It 
              had been awhile since we last killed him, but I'm pleased to report 
              that he still dies in the same position.<br>
            </p>
            <p>The next stop on our tour was the cut-n-paste temple, VT. Both 
              KTX Aten Ha Ra's were dispatched of, can we please get those things 
              some more hp Afterwards a small crew stuck around and dropped Diabo 
              Xi Xin, he was not available for comment at press time.</p>

              posted on 01-08-2003 01:45 AM by Torinn<br>
              Mithaniel Marr is dead. No catchy phrases and no flashy intros, 
              he is dead. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Tonight after a very questionable start, followed by a failed run 
              that got Mith down to half, we all had some soul searching to do. 
              Some have questioned if the fire has gone out of The Relentless, 
              that we have grown soft and weak. After rezzing and rebuffing, we 
              all took just a few moments pause to reflect and to think to ourselves. 
              How would we respond to this? Only two words can sum up the transformation 
              that took place between fights...Game On.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>It was an intense encounter that pushed everyone to their limits, 
              it was shape up or ship out, and most of all...it was damn fun. 
              Remember the warm feeling of accomplisment you get when you do something 
              new, or complete a long desired task? This certainly produced that, 
              and more. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>And of course, who doesn't like to see more of this </p>
            <p>A hearty thanks and congratulations to everyone who answered the 
              challenge and rose to the occasion. I would also like to give our 
              pull crew a well deserved pat on the back, you guys did an amazing 
              job. </p>
            <p>The best is yet to come.<br>

            <p>Welp, with the whole server up from the patch, we decided that 
              it was time to put a beatin on ol Mithaniel Marr. The reason's weren't 
              exactly clear, but our leadership assured us that they had satellite 
              images of Marr stockpiling swords of mass destruction somewhere 
              out in back, just beyond what anyone else can see....and well, like 
              everyone else, we don't need a REAL reason to rain fire on a mob's 
              head, just an excuse....so we headed in grouped up and started fightin 
              old Mith and it was goin real well until</p>

              Well, the holidays are ending....time to get back to work. Yah know 
              what that means....time to make sure that folks remember how to 
              play this game after spending a couple weeks with the family, playing 
              GTA Vice City, havin big get togethers, playing GTA Vice City, goin 
              on vacation, and playin GTA Vice City.</p>
            <p>To this end we took a mini tour of the towers in BoT. After the 
              monks finally remembered to FD instead of pullin over to &quot;pick 
              up da ho's&quot; we moved on to Vex Thal, which we found marvelously 
              sittin on a full spawn. To make life interesting, not only did we 
              perfect our secret GatePull(tm) techniques, we also completed a 
              Royal Fizzbin playin 4ThallClericPong. We moved through from stem 
              to stern on a nice pace and took 'ol Aten herself. What more could 
              you want?</p>
            <p>Later, campers!</p>
