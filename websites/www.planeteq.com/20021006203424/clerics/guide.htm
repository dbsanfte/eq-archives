This guide is written as a general discourse over the strengths and weaknesses of playing a cleric. These are the opinions of one, so you may choose to play your cleric differently. This is the path that I have chosen for myself and offer it to hopefully better the community of healers. Keep in mind that a lot of what I say is over the length of a lifespan of a cleric, beyond the first 20 levels, and sometimes beyond the first 50 levels.
<p>
Please do not use any part of this guide without the consent of the writer. I’ll probably give it out to openly, but do give credit where it’s due.

<dt><b>Creating a Cleric</b>
<p>
<dd>This topic has been done to death. To summarize, first and foremost, wisdom is the attribute from which your mana is based. Though it doesn’t impact you as much in the lower levels, by the time you reach level 50 and beyond, each point of wisdom represents approximately 10 points of mana. Keep in mind, however, that that rate of mana to wisdom gain caps at 200 <i>(Yumanea's Edit: this has changed since date of writing, mana to wisdom gain now caps at 255. However, 1 - 200 wis = 12 mana per wis at level 60, 201 - 255 wis = 6 mana per wis at level 60)</i>. Beyond that primary attribute, your physical attributes (most importantly strength and agility) are most beneficial at the lower levels. Agility will help you dodge which is useful, but since our skill in dodge does cap out, you won’t be dodging nearly as often as your melee-class friends.
<p>
What race of a cleric should you be? In the long run, I don’t think it really matters. With the amount of equipment that you can get in your later levels, your stats can be as good as any other race. But by far the most popular cleric race is dwarven followed by the elven races.
<p>
<dt><b>What is a cleric?</b>
<p>
<dd>A cleric is fundamentally a healer. We heal better than anybody else, hands down. In addition to having a larger repertoire of heals spells to draw upon, clerics have a 15% bonus in their healing. But that is simply the textbook definition of what we can do. We also offer a variety of buffs that can keep a tank slashing and bashing longer than anybody else. With an array of stuns at our disposal we can bring a mob to its knees as it gets beat upon. We do have some limited ability to do direct damage to Undead as well as living, but that should not be what clerics should focus upon.
<p>
As a cleric, you really aren’t a front line player. Though a cleric can wear a full suit of platemail, the cleric will find himself sitting down and meditating during battles. Though your god has blessed you with the power to smite down those you feel are unfitting, smite does little compared to the raw abilities of mana/damage output of a wizard.
<p>
Being bound with a weaker set of offensive abilities, clerics tend to not do as well when left to fend for themselves against the harsh world of Norrath. In a group is where the cleric is at home. Clerics often will bark orders to groups in earlier levels since he is directly connected to the lifeline of a group. He is always watching the battle from behind the wall of his spell book, but nonetheless just as involved. Ensuring that others will survive their battles is a cleric’s call.
<p>
A cleric is one of the classes that takes skill to play and an incredible amount of patience. Clerics have an incredible of array of spells where many require practice. Learning timing and pace of battle is absolutely critical to a cleric’s success.
<p>
<dt><b>What makes a cleric absolutely critical beyond level 39?</b>
<p>
<dd>Many clerics find some hardships in levels before their 30s. First off, the perception is that any priest class heals as well as others. In addition, we lack the utility spells that many people focus on (Spirit of Wolf, for example). However, into the 30s people begin to realize that nobody can rival the cleric in pure healing. With a good warrior, their HP can and will exceed 2000 buffed. A 300 point heal will hardly make a dent in heavy fire. With Complete Heal, clerics become exceptionally efficient and few groups will travel without one.
</dl>

<p>
<dl>
<b>The Life of a Cleric </b>
<p>
<dt><b><i>Melee</i></b>
<p>
<dd>Clerics wear the cleanest armor around.
<p>
<dd>There’s a reason why a cleric’s armor remains well polished. A cleric doesn’t like to get hit. Though we have the strength to don the heaviest of armor, clerics by no means can withstand the damage that a warrior or a paladin can. That’s not to say that clerics should never join in a battle. There are always exceptions to every rule. Of all the caster classes, the cleric has the highest armor class. If necessary, a cleric can stand between a raging monster and a robed caster. With more hit points, you can take a few more hits buying your casters enough time to get off that Ice Comet that will turn the tide of battle. Of course, don’t be stupid. Don’t get yourself killed. Do this only when absolutely necessary.
<p>
A cleric can wield most blunt weapons. However, our skill advances at a much slower rate than any of the melee classes at 4 points per level. Also, our skill caps out at 175. Without any other offensive skill (such as double attack), by late levels you are not even 35% as effective offensively as a paladin wielding the same weapon. In the early levels (less than 12), indeed the cleric will often bring down his hammer upon his opponents, but that will not be the way of the cleric as he gains in his career. By the late levels even using the Warhammer of Divine Grace, a cleric may only end up doing 300-400 damage in melee to a mob that has 5000+ HP. If by level 40 the group is depending on you to melee a mob to death, there is something seriously wrong with that group. You are much better off spending the time on meditating for more mana.
<p>
Many clerics have even accepted the fact that they will not actually enter into physical combat and will carry a shield in one hand and a Paw of Opolla (or in Kunark there are books that can be held in the primary hand) in the other. This actually eliminates any ability for the cleric to do physical damage.
<p>
A cleric can do much more damage through his spells. Though not as efficient as a druid or even a shaman, it a much better alternative when there is mana to spare.
<p>
<hr align="center" size=2 width=175>
<p>
<dt><b><i>Group Dynamics</i></b>
<p>
<dd> A Cleric will realize his ultimate potential when gathered among his friends.
<p>
Where a cleric is most at home is within a group. Though clerics wear plate, they still lack in the defensive skills and powers of any melee class. Though clerics are bless with offensive damage skills, every other priest and caster class can easily out damage a cleric. This is not to say that a cleric is a weak class. Clerics are often cast into a support/utilitarian role. As one of the more specialized classes, it is more important to know how to work with other classes.
<p>
First, a cleric’s mana is the lifeblood of any group. If the group’s puller runs off before the cleric is comfortable with the amount of mana at his reserve, then the cleric must say something. Though clerics will meditate between fights, this will often not be enough to cast two or three heals that would have been available had the puller waited one extra minute.
<p>
When mana begins to reach critical levels, often a cleric will have to decide who lives and who doesn’t. This is by far the hardest decision for a cleric. If everyone is out of mana, casters die first. This may seem like a shock to some, but if the fight is getting close, an OOM caster is little more than a mana drain. Your tank will still be able to continue to deliver damage regardless of their mana. At the point where the fight has turned so poorly, your fellow casters should also be considering either evacuating or gating away anyway. Unless OOM, a cleric will most often be around until the last person leaves since a cleric can always cast gate himself or be able to run away with a casting of Divine Aura.
<p>
There are exceptions to what is stated before, but these are suggestions, not rules. For example, an enchanter is always somebody that a cleric wants alive. Enchanter’s key ability is to buy a group time to deal with each mob individually. Warriors also have many hundreds of hit points more than a caster. Leaving the warrior at 2 bubbles to heal the wizard and then meditating might still be enough time to get back to the warrior before he is dead.
<p>
The key skill above is mana management. A cleric must always know how many heals he has with the amount of mana at his reserve. At the same time, a cleric must learn to watch the rate of hit points dropping in relationship to the amount of time required to cast a spell and meditate enough mana. This becomes a critical skill when the cleric receives Complete Healing. Learning how quickly a warrior’s hit points will drop in 10 seconds will be the difference between a full health warrior and a dead warrior.
<p>
A good cleric will keep his group apprised of his mana, more specifically how many heals he can provide. Most often clerics will say to the group, “30%.” This may be fine when a cleric is at 80% where the mana is being used for rooting, or stunning, or fearing. This is not fine when a cleric is in the heat of a battle with 30% mana. It is not the responsibility of the warrior to know what 30% translates into. Depending on your wisdom and your total overall amount of mana, this can mean one SHeal or one Divine Light and one Remedy. A cleric should tell groups how many heals are left because when it is truly important, that is the only spell that will be cast.
<p>
Because a cleric’s mana represents the life of the group, many clerics do not loot often sitting back down immediately after a fight. A cleric is equally entitled to the same loot as everybody else. It only takes a few seconds to loot and as clerics level, reagents become much more expensive. Many clerics will loot more than the rest of the group since they need to cover the cost of reagents. A cleric should not be shy to what he is deserved.
<p>
Working with another cleric can be the best thing or the worst thing to happen to a cleric. Unless a system is established early on, confusion between clerics can lead to wasted mana or even death. There are many things to consider with multiple clerics.
<p>
First, buffing. This is a task best spread out among multiple clerics. This will prevent anybody bearing the full responsibilities. Since the take on mana is distributed, the efficiency is always higher since clerics are all regenerating mana. This is provided that all the casting of buffs can be shared. If one cleric is sufficiently higher in level, it does not behoove the group to have less than optimal buffs.
<p>
Second, healing. This is where most confusion lies. There are multiple systems that work. These examples are based on a two-cleric group.
<p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Division of labor. Each cleric will heal two people in addition to the other cleric. Each cleric is then allowed for some mana to cast alternate spells such as DD’s, or stuns, or roots. The downside to this system is that both clerics have to be actively watching health bars, leaving less attention to the mobs being attacked. Also if Cleric A is busy healing his warrior, but his caster’s hp’s are dropping quickly, Cleric B may not know whether or not the situation is under control.
<li>Primary and secondary. Cleric A is primary healer, and Cleric B is secondary healer. This is the most common system in place. Cleric A behaves as he normally does regardless of the fact that there is another cleric in the group. Cleric B reserves half of his mana for healing. As Cleric A becomes stressed, Cleric B steps forward and picks up the slack. The key to making this system work is to for Cleric B to call out who he’s healing. The benefits to this system allow for Cleric B to cast his alternate spells. However, this causes more of a discrepancy between mana levels of the clerics and puts more of a dependency on Cleric A and his mana. A good way to solve some of these problems and reduce down time is for Cleric B (assuming he has more mana) to play primary healer for the next fight while Cleric A meditates so he can re-assume his original role.
<li>Call it out. This is probably the most inefficient system, but should be a part of any system. Since Cleric B will never know exactly what Cleric A is doing (casting, interrupted, etc), good communication can solve that problem. Each cleric heals as he sees fit as long as he calls out who he is healing. To make this system work, each cleric must not go crazy by casting alternate spells. Each cleric should reserve at least 50% mana for healing. This is the most flexible system, but allows for the highest margin of error and confusion.
</ul>
<p>
The key to success in any group, regardless of make up, is communication. A group should generally be aware of each others mana. When somebody needs help, it should be cried out earlier than later.
<p>
<dt><b><i>The Spell Book</i></b>
<p>
<dd>Within this tomb lies great power.
<p>
For the first 34 levels of a cleric’s career, he is forced to stare at the spell book during meditation (<i>Yumanea's Edit: you no longer have to stare at the spell book no matter what your level</i>). Considering how a cleric meditates through most battles, this is not very acceptable to many people. However, this is a great time to learn group management. Since a cleric must watch very closely his own mana bar and the health of his mates, having to stare at the spell book does give him some advantages for battle management. He can evaluate when a situation is turning for the worse since he knows how much health he can restore with the mana reserves he has. Without visual distraction, a cleric can watch the flow of battle much more analytically. A cleric tends to remain much calmer in battle since they are not completely caught up in the excitement. A cleric tends to read the majority of the text area while meditating while tanks and other casters look down occasionally just for their own key bits of information. A cleric will know who’s casting what when.
<p>
Indeed staring at the spell book is not an entirely pleasing experience. However, using this time to hone the skills of watching a battle without actually being in battle will have many great rewards down the road.

<dt><b><i>Pulling</i></b>
<p>
<dd>The best puller is an invincible puller.
<p>
Many clerics enjoy playing the role of a puller for a group. Though in many situations clerics are ill suited for this task, there are a few tools at the cleric’s disposal that help it perform this task: high armor class, lull, and divine aura. Though clerics may not be the strongest fighters, clerics do wear exceptionally strong armor. Having a high armor class helps reduce both the number of hits taken and the amount of damage taken. The lull series of spells is almost always used only for pulling. Having these spells helps a cleric be able to separate out mobs to reduce the number of incoming targets. Divine Aura and Divine Barrier are shields of invulnerability. Even though they work as a negative taunt, if pulling, a cleric is the only one on their hate list. The mob will more than likely continue to chase the cleric but unable to do any damage to him. 18 seconds should most often be enough time to get back to the group.
<p>
<hr align="center" size=2 width=175>
<p>
<dt><b><i>Specialization</i></b>
<p>
<dd>Casting spells is not a trivial task.
<p>
At level thirty clerics gain the ability to specialize in a circle of magic. Assuming the roll against specialization is successful, specialization will reduce the amount of mana that is required to cast the spell. Keep in mind that the specialization check is against the amount of required mana before the roll against specialization is made. For example, even if specialization will reduce the required mana by 15%, a 600 mana spell will require that the cleric has 600 mana before casting. But it will leave him with 90 mana.
<p>
Though debatable, I personally feel that specialization has some effect on my ability to recover from interrupts. I can cast heals having been beat upon by many more mobs than I can with an offensive spell.
<p>
The only three for consideration is Alteration, Abjuration, and Evocation. Alteration is used for healing, gating, and resurrections. Abjuration is used for all buffing. Evocation is used to deal damage.
<p>
Alteration is by far the most common choice for clerics. Alteration summarizes what a cleric spends most of his time doing… healing. Alteration reduces the amount of mana that is required to heal and therefore will give you more heals in the long run.
<p>
Abjuration, though useful, is really only used during down time, the time between battles. Though it does reduce the mana used for all buffs, most clerics feel it is more important to have mana in an emergency rather than when the group is sitting around.
<p>
Evocation is the other popular choice for clerics. Many clerics have chosen the path of battle. This is a good choice for them since it makes cleric damage spells slightly more efficient. However, choose this specialization carefully. In the heat of a battle you may not have the extra heal that may save the group from an untimely death.
<p>
To choose a specialization, a cleric simply has to ensure their chosen specialization passes 50 points of skill. Though a cleric must train in all fields of specialization, only one field may surpass a skill of 50.
<p>
Specialization can be reset back to 50 in the Temple of Solusek Ro, if one feels they have chosen the wrong specialization.
<p>

<p>
<dt><b><i>Direct Damage</i></b>
<p>
<dd>You have been blessed by your patron deity to bring forth judgment upon your opponents. Don’t abuse it.
<p>
With undead DD spells at their disposal, many clerics believe that they are the supreme destroyed of the undead. This is not a good assumption. First off, this line of spells is shared with the Necromancer. Between their larger array of spells on top of the undead DD spells, they can take down undead many times faster than a cleric. What clerics do have is a highly mana efficient line of DDs against undead. Banish Undead’s damage/mana ratio is approximately 2.6 with a relatively descent casting time and cycles almost instantly. This can be an important asset since this means that the cleric can also double as a major damage contributor in any group. However, unlike wizards or many other casters that primarily focus on damage output we have other tasks at hand that require a lot of our attention (and mana) as well. A poor cleric will expend all of his mana on nuking a mob leaving little to no mana left for the healing of his team. If a cleric spent all of his mana taking down a mob, what will happen to a group while they are recovering from the rigors of a battle and a spawn drops right on top of them? If a cleric can’t keep a group alive, he is not a good cleric. (I’ll be beating this point into the reader’s head throughout this guide.)
<p>
A similar line of spells to our undead spells is our ability to cast against summoned creatures. We get these spells about one or two circles after our undead spells so they really aren’t efficient at the level that we receive them. At times they are more efficient than the general-purpose damage spells, but overall, they tend to not be used as often as a cleric’s undead and general-purpose damage spells.
<p>
Strike, Furor, Smite, Wrath, Retribution, and Reckoning are the clerics’ line of dealing damage to any mob, living or undead. These spells as they grow in strength and efficiency, they grow in casting time. By the time of acquiring Reckoning, the casting time is 7.0 seconds with a higher efficiency than Banish Undead. This entire of line of spells suffers from a relatively poor casting time. After casting, each spell has approximately two to three seconds before it cycles back into use again. As previously stated, it is an useful spell, but not one that should be used to sway battles. Putting the same 250 mana into healing can be used to keep the tank alive long enough to out do the damage that a cleric could’ve done directly.
<p>
In a typical fight will I keep a DD mem’d? Or even cast it? The answer to both is yes. If I am well over 70% full of mana, then I will more often then not elect to throw one or two spells into the fray. Though my damage may not be enough to out right kill the mob, it is enough to at least make a dent. Besides, if I’m sitting through a fight at full mana the entire time, I’m not being completely efficient with my mana. Ideally, I’d like to have my mana regenerating at all times so I like to stay at a max of about 90% mana. After a nuke, I can be at 80% leaving me with plenty of room to work my healing magic.

<dt><b><i>Area Effect Damage</i></b>
<p>
<dd>With a yell, a boom shakes the ground beneath the cleric.
<p>
Clerics actually have two separate lines of dealing damage across multiple mobs. The first centers about the caster in a point-blank range. If you can reach out and touch someone, then they will more than likely get hit by this spell. This spell is useful for trying to gain some attention from multiple targets onto one’s self, but it is one of the many spells that most clerics have deemed to be little more than a novelty.
<p>
An alternate area effect spell line, we have inherited from our fellow priests, the druids: Tremor, Earthquake, and Upheaval. We receive these spells approximately one-spell circle after they do. Like the above, this spell series centers about the caster. However, these spells have a much larger radius ensuring the likelihood of hitting more targets.
<p>
In most AE spells (both offensive and defensive), the point of efficiency is three. That is to say that these spells are efficient when one can hit three or more targets. For two or one targets, then some form of direct spell is optimal; be it healing or dealing damage.

<dt><b><i>Stunning</i></b>
<p>
<dd>Blown back by the force of the cleric’s spell, his opponent is paralyzed.
<p>
Stunning is a task that is shared by clerics, paladins, enchanters, and wizards. This is one of the more useful lines of spells in a cleric’s repertoire. A cleric’s job is to keep his group alive. One of the ways of doing so is to prevent damage done to the group. Most of the stuns do some form of minimal damage, knocks the mob back 1 foot, and have a very quick casting time. Though most of the cleric stuns do some minimal amount of damage to the mob, the damage is not the important attribute of the spell.
<p>
Clerics and Enchanters have the greatest number of stuns available to them at any given level. With 4 stuns by level 49, a cleric can come close to maintaining a mob completely stunned. Completely stunning a mob can begin once the cleric has three stun spells. The order of casting always begins with casting the lowest level stun first. The lower spells tend to cycle faster. By the time the cleric has cast his highest-level stun, the lowest level spell will be available at his disposal again. This will also stagger the cycling time of each spell. Conversely, had a cleric started casting the highest level stun first, there is a much larger amount of time that a cleric has to wait to start his stunning cycle again.
<p>
In addition to the obvious benefits of a mob not moving nor attacking, the stun will make the mob easier to hit, prevents ripostes, dodges, parries, etc. A stun will also interrupt casting. This is particularly useful to prevent an AE spell being cast on a group (such as dispel).
<p>
The spell also has a knock back factor. This can be dangerous in areas with cliffs where the mob maybe pushed over. If it stays pissed off, then it will probably bring a few friends along the way.
<p>
The one major caveat to stunning is that it is a major taunt. If you are within range, the mob will more than likely very angry at the cleric casting the stun.

<p>
<dt><b><i>Divine</i></b>
<p>
<dd>Surrounded by the aura of the gods, a cleric stands invulnerable.
<p>
Clerics have two “UH OH” spells. Divine Aura and Divine Barrier will prevent ANY damage done to caster during the length of the spell effect of 18 seconds. (Everything in EQ works on a multiple of a six second timer.) Divine Aura casts exceptionally fast (1.0 second) for very little mana. From the middle levels on, a cleric can be OOM but still actually have enough mana to cast Divine Aura. This is the cleric panic button. When one is getting hit and the mobs are not getting taunted off quickly enough, DA will first give one a safe protective shield and about 2 to 3 ticks of meditation time. Also it works as a reverse taunt so the mobs will often leave the cleric alone… at least for the duration of the spell. This spell prevents any damage done to the cleric but does not prevent stuns. A hard bash to a cleric is still enough cause him to stand still for a few seconds. One must be very careful with this spell since it shields you from damage and spells, it will also prevent beneficial spells as well. So if the group is evac’ing, the cleric must drop Divine Aura or the gate will leave him behind. In the same vein, heal spells will not pass through the protective shielding of Divine Aura either. The shielding works both ways, however. A cleric can neither cast spells nor attack while invulnerable. Nonetheless, the cleric can run… hopefully to the zone.
<p>
Divine Barrier is the only upgrade to Divine Aura. It lasts just as long as DA, but suffers from a higher casting time and a ten-fold increase in mana. Divine Barrier, however, restores a small amount of HP and MP during the period of invulnerability. If a cleric has sufficient mana, but needs to cast a reverse taunt, this is the better spell. With higher mana usage, it usually means that the cleric is not quite panicking yet.
<p>
Both of these spells take approximately 10-15 minutes to cycle. That means from the moment that it is memorized, the cleric cannot cast it for that length of time. Many clerics have made permanent homes for at least Divine Aura if not both spells.
<p>
The classic heroic cleric story usually involves the cleric taunting all the mobs on to him, casting DA buying the rest of his group enough time to escape. As the spell drops, the cleric immediately casts gate to hopefully save his own hide.

<dt><b><i>Buffing</i></b>
<p>
<dd>Clerics are the de facto kings of HP & AC buffs.
<p>
At certain levels, other casters may have equivalent sometimes slightly better HP or AC buffs. This is true. However, consider the mana usage. The cleric line, Center, Courage, Bravery, Resolution, etc., almost directly parallels a druid’s skin series of spells. Until level 52, a cleric’s HP/AC buff spell will not overwrite a druid’s Skin spell of an equal level. The benefit of choosing the cleric spell over a druid spell (in a group) is mana usage. A druid’s skin line costs approximately three times more mana per cast. To buff an entire group, a druid will drain himself completely of mana where the cleric may have only spent one to two bubbles. In the levels beyond fifty, druids find themselves without any more skin buffs and must rely on a cleric for Heroism and beyond. At no point should the cleric in a group ever let this primary buff drop. It’s cheap and exceptionally effective.
<p>
Clerics and Shamans also have a line of pure AC buff spells. It’s a bit more questionable whether or not to keep this spell up at all times for the entire group. Clerics tend to be a little bit more selective about whom to cast this on or they stagger it out. Most often, though, a cleric will want to keep this spell up on his tank and his enchanter at the very least. The shaman line of AC buffs is not quite as powerful as the cleric’s.
<p>
Later in levels, there is a lot of confusion for clerics over the advantages of Armor of Faith versus Shield of Words. AoF costs half as much as SoW, and the only difference in AC gain is approximately 6 AC. The reason why a cleric would use SoW on his group is because it lasts about twice as long as AoF. This is a long-term mana saver and a better spell. If downtime is a major issue, many clerics cast SoW on only a few members of the group while giving AoF to the others.
<p>
For a pure HP buff, clerics have their symbol line of spells. When a cleric first receives this spell it offers a slight bonus in HP for a relatively cheap gem. Clerics most often only cast symbol on request since the costs do add up over time. By the time a cleric reaches 50 and beyond a symbol spell costs more than 10.5pp. In the beginning, a few extra HP might not make a difference, but beyond level 50, 700HP can make the difference. Again, shamans also have a line of HP buff spells, however, their spells do not add nearly as many HP, but they do it without a gem component.
<p>
Clerics also get the full line of resist buffs until level 44 where resist spells start becoming more specialized. Enchanters get a group magic resist that is more powerful than a cleric’s resist magic. Beyond level 50, druids get a group resist line for heat and cold. But resists are exceptionally useful when fighting against mobs with special effects. A cleric should try and maintain resist magic when he can since it’s a relatively cheap spell.

<dt><b><i>Healing</i></b>
<p>
<dd>A cleric is the definition of a healer. He is the spinner of life.
<p>
One of the reasons I save this section for later is because this is where the bread and butter of the cleric career. Clerics are expected to do one thing: keep the group alive. Most often through healing. Clerics get all of their heals at least one spell circle before anybody else. In addition to having the heal spells earlier, on the same spells, clerics get a 15% healing bonus.
<p>
A cleric truly separates himself from his other priestly brethren when he reaches level 34. With Superior Healing, a cleric can heal for approximately 600HP per cast. The other classes are left with only greater healing which only has half that healing potential. Many groups at this point will specifically look for a cleric for druids and shamans simply don’t have the ability to keep a well-buffed warrior fully healed. This is to really pay back for the first 33 levels when clerics were overlooked for the other classes that have Sprit of the Wolf and Snare.
<p>
From level 34 through 50, a cleric will also have both Greater Healing and Superior Healing memorized: GHeal for casters and SHeal for tanks.
<p>
At level 34 a cleric is also introduced to his first area effect heal spell. Like the previous mention of AE spells, Word of Health becomes efficient at trying to heal three or more people with Greater Healing. Often a cleric will use this spell to cap off the little bit of remaining hit points for his group. This spell also casts relatively quickly so many clerics have used it in combat as well.
<p>
From levels 39 to 50 will see an upgrade in his AE heal and more importantly Complete Heal. Complete Heal changes the dynamics of a group a lot. Around 39 and above, a cleric will find that healing a fully buffed tank takes 2, 3 or more castings of SHeal. CHeal is mana efficient when the target has about 1600 HP or more. This spell also takes a fair bit of practice since it takes 10.0 seconds to cast. A cleric must be able to judge the rate at which their target’s HP will drop and know where they will be 10.0 seconds from the moment he starts casting. Also during this time, the cleric must not get hit. If this happens, immediately cast a GHeal on your target and switch to SHeal. A cleric will end up wasting a bit of mana but it saves him the critical time which he needs to get things back under control.
<p>
CHeal requires some practice, which can’t be emphasized enough. I won’t give you a certain point for which to cast CHeal because it does differ for each occasion. I have started casting it when the warrior was at four bubbles of health, and I have started casting it when they were below one bubble of health. So practice and learn to watch the rate of which your group’s HP falls.
<p>
Beyond level 50 there are two primary heal spells Remedy and Divine Light. Remedy replaces both Superior and Greater healing at the same time. It is more mana efficient than both and heals more HP/sec than either. However, there is the standard spell cycling time of 1 second to take into account if one desires to chain cast the spell which is not given any consideration. In some cases, clerics still maintain SHeal next to the very fast and long range Remedy. Beyond 51, clerics look forward to Divine Light. DL has the same casting time as SHeal but only costs 50 mana less than CHeal. This spell completely replaces SHeal and should be used when the cleric can’t spend 10 seconds casting CHeal. At level 59 clerics receive Celestial Elixir which is a slightly different line of healing. It heals for a much larger amount of HP and cures, however, the HP is restored over time much like a regeneration spell.
<p>
At level 44, some clerics have taken to use Resolution as a quick way to heal instead of using Greater Healing. When the numbers are crunched, the result does lean in favor of using Resolution. However, that is not the full story. By level 44, most clerics will have a very high specialization in Alteration. The specialization will reduce the mana cost of a GHeal, but not that of Resolution. Personally, I have seen approximately a saving of approximately 15% in mana in my healing. Also the numbers do not include healing bonus of clerics. Though it also has yet been proven, I believe that my fizzles as well as my interrupts have been greatly reduced due to high skills in Channeling, Alteration and Specialize Alteration.
<p>
At Level 56, clerics gain the power to cast Mark of Karn. Casted on a mob, each time a player hits this mob, their hit points will be restored by a small amount. This is fairly well resisted and may cause the mob to aggro on the cleric.

<p>
<dt><b><i>Atone</i></b>
<p>
<dd>With a wave of the cleric’s hand, his opponent blinks a few times and forgets that he was ever in battle.
<p>
This is one spell for which clerics never receive an upgrade. Clerics receive Atone at level 34. Atone behaves identically to an enchanter’s memory blur series of spells. This allows a cleric to reset a mob’s damage history table and clears out its hate list. This is a spell with a potential of abuse and ultimate utility.
<p>
Wiping the hate list and damage history does a few things to a mob. When awarding kills to a group or person, the system looks at the damage history. Whichever group does the majority of the damage, the kill is award to them. So if a mob is down to 5% health and the cleric casts Atone (and assuming it worked) whoever does the majority of damage of the remaining 5% will receive the kill. This can be either a good thing or a bad thing. First, it means that if somebody can deal a quick amount of damage right after the mob has been Atoned they will receive the kill. This is a potential for kill stealing (which is bad, bad, naughty, naughty). In the same vein, this can be exceptionally useful if a cleric is power leveling somebody else. They are more likely to ensure that another group will receive the kill when they begin attacking a nearly dead mob.
<p>
Atone can also be used to save lives as well. Mobs will most often chase after whoever is doing the most amount of damage to them within a short range. Dealt enough damage and a mob may hate a caster so much that it may even go beyond its near range. A quick way to get a mob off of a caster is to Atone the mob. With a clear hate list, a mob will quickly turn to the taunting melees and forget about the caster.
<p>
Root and Atone combined are also a great way to escape. First cast a root and get out of sight to cast Atone. A mob will simply forget about its targets and wait until the root wears off when it returns back to its spawn point or its original path.
<p>
Atone can also be used to quickly dispatch caster pets. When NPC casters die, their pets remain on the last target it was on. To save a group from the hassle of dealing with a pet, a cleric can simply Atone the pet after its master has fallen. With neither a target nor a master, the pet will simply suicide.
<p>
Atone has a slight bug in that regardless of its success, it will always say that the target has calmed down. The cleric will just need to learn to use the con system and visual cues to see if it was a success. The con system will display the target’s level of aggression. Attacking an indifferent mob will most often cause it to glare at the cleric threateningly. Casting Atone and con’ing the mob will reveal if the mob has forgotten about the cleric and returned to its initial disposition. A rooted mob will also turn towards the target it currently hates most (assuming that nobody else is around). Usually a successful cast of Atone will cause the mob to turn slightly to the direction of its spawn point.
<p>
<hr align="center" size=2 width=175>
<p>
<dt><b><i>Fear</i></b>
<p>
<dd>Glaring at the monster, the cleric lets loose a cry that causes the monster to flee away in terror.
<p>
Clerics, necromancers, and enchanters have a great ability to make mobs go away. Most often clerics will only use fear in case of emergencies. When a mob is feared it will run away from the caster. However, should it run by any of its friends, its friends will know who feared the mob and come after the caster. This will more than likely start trains in any dungeon zone. There are cases where fear can be very useful if the caster is ready to deal with the consequences, and most often in an outdoor zone where the caster can usually be sure of not causing many trains. Fear casts very quickly. Fear can be used to drive a mob away so the cleric can get a chance to cast a gate spell to safety. In the same vein, an AE fear can be used to drive away a large number of mobs, sometimes buying time for an evac’er to do his job.
<p>
Clerics have AE fear, undead fear, and general-purpose fear. The undead fear is slightly harder to resist and lasts a little bit longer and costs fewer mana. The only limiting factor is that it can only be cast upon undead.
<p>
In outdoor zones, being paired with either a ranger or a druid, a cleric may find himself casting quite a few fear spells. A common tactic is to snare a mob and then immediately follow up with a fear spell. This tactic has many names, fear kite and snare/fear, for example. This is a very powerful combination since a mob will be trying to get away, therefore neither attacking nor casting, while the tank and the other members of the party are casting and attacking it. In addition, damage over time spells work at their maximum efficiency when they are trying to run away. This is the reason why necromancers are so powerful. They have both a fear spell and snare-type spell at their disposal. There is an item available for dark-elven clerics that allow them to cast a snare-type spell.

<dt><b><i>Yaulp</i></b>
<p>
<dd>The cleric lets loose a mighty yaulp as his muscles bulge stretching his armor.
<p>
Paladins inherit our spells as they level. This is the reason for the Yaulp series of spells. For a short duration of time, the caster’s physical abilities are dramatically improved. At very low levels where skill is not the major factor of damage, the effect of this spell is very prominent. However, by the time a cleric receives Yaulp II, he really doesn’t have a spell slot to waste on it. More importantly he should be meditating and healing the members of his party.

<dt><b><i>Root</i></b>
<p>
<dd>Calling upon the strength of the land beneath him, the cleric summons the earth to surround his opponent.
<p>
Simply put, the root series immobilizes the movement of the target. They can still attack and cast spells, however they cannot move from their location. Doing damage to a mob will give it a chance to break the effects of the spell. Often times casting a direct damage spell on a mob will guarantee that the target will break the root.
<p>
Clerics gain four root spells throughout their career. Based off of Root, each spell has a slightly better effect. Enstill has the potential to last twice as long as root. Immobilize has a faster casting time and a potential for a longer duration. Paralyzing Earth has the potential to last four times as long as Root. Since the root has a potential to break when the mob takes damage, Immobilize and Paralyzing Earth are most useful for rooting a mob and keeping it out of the way. Root and Immobilize are much better during combat or when a mob is trying to run away.

Lull, Soothe, Calm, Pacify, and Wake of Tranquility are all used in the same way. They each reduce the target’s aggression radius such that you can pull a mob that is standing next to them or even walk past without them going aggro on a PC. The puller when trying to separate out multiple mobs in a close local area will most often use this spell. This spell gets resisted fairly often, and there are two effects when it gets resisted. One, nothing happens. When the puller tags a target, the “lulled” mob will come with the target mob. The other resisted result will aggro the mob and its surrounding friends.

<dt><b><i>Resurrection</i></b>
<p>
<dd>Hovering over the corpse, the cleric prays to his deity to restore the life of the fallen.
<p>
Clerics, paladins, and necromancers are the only class able to restore life to a corpse. However, clerics do it better than the other two classes. Paladins inherit our spells many levels after clerics do so by the time a paladin can cast a certain resurrection, a cleric will have a better resurrection at the same level. Necromancers can restore life to a corpse only at the cost of a death of another high-level character. Many clerics have found themselves hiding in anonymity because this is a highly sought after service at high levels.
<p>
All resurrection spells will cause resurrection effects that reduce health by 60%, reduced attributes. These effects go away over time. There is currently no way to remove those effects. Players with resurrection effects cannot have a strength buff cast on them while under the effects.
<p>
Players who duel can be resurrected back to their corpse for up to 6 minutes after the conclusion of the duel. On most servers and in most situations, no experience is lost when killed by a player so a revive will often suffice to bring the player back to his corpse.
<p>
All of the spells will bring the player to their corpse regardless of distance or location. These spells are particularly useful when their melee classes have fallen but their homeport is far away. Revive only returns a player to their corpse even though a message may display that some experience was restored. Resuscitate restores approximately 50% of the lost experience. Resurrection restores approximately 90% of the lost experience. Reviviscence restores up to 96% of lost experience.
<p>
By design each corpse can only receive an experience restoring resurrection once. Therefore, going link dead after somebody has casted a resurrection spell is a bad idea. All of the spells are also bound by a 3-hour limit. That is to say, a corpse may only have resurrection cast upon it within three hours of playtime after death. Playtime includes time spent on the character selection screen and time spent playing another character. Beyond that limit, a message will display telling you that the corpse is too old and cannot be resurrected.

<p>
A new spell series from Kunark, Death Pact and Divine Intervention have the potential to save the target from certain death. Cast as a buff and lasting approximately 10 minutes, when the target gets sufficiently low in health, the target will have a chance to complete the death pact. If successful, the target will gain a substantial percentage of hit points. The only caveat to this spell is the cost of the reagent and the short time span that it lasts. This spell is best cast upon a puller and an enchanter who both fulfill high-risk roles.
