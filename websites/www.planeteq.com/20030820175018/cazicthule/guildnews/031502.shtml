              Ventured to ToV
            <p></p>
            <p>Which on a sidenote left us dancing with Lendianara on a pretty 
              much picture perfect kill...Just a shame I didnt get a picture...

            <p>After finishing our tango for two with Lendi, we decided to pop 
              out to Sontalak, for a wee bit of salsa training... </p>
            <p>It was a messy, semi slimey affair, but in the end we ended pulling 
              off what in the dancing world would be called... a huge mess...Needless 
              to say... </p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Wasnt pretty, wasnt perfect, but...it was a good chance for me 
              to dance with Skoenne in Nexus, after dying 3 seconds into fight... 
            </p>
            <p>Grats Xeryus from PE on his new St key and our clerics on more

              we killed him on first try. <br>
              Fight was messy, but we still made it. </p>

              The elusive Zordak Ragefire finally showed his face, but he didn't 
              last long. After waking a few people up, CoG thrashed him soundly. 
              Very big Gratz to Sereta for getting her clicker. Gratz to Ensidious 
              for her new Gauntlets of Fiery Might. Gratz to Tyelia on her new 
              Treasure Hunter's Satchel. Gratz to Maulder on his new Bracer of 
              Fennin Ro. What a long strange trip its been.<br>

              night! Our epic rampage continues! </p>
            <p>MAR 10, 2002<br>
              The royals of Chardok were trash-talking once again, and we decided 
              to end their reign. In quick order, we dispatched, the prince, king, 
              and even the queen. Great job by everyone and congrats to all the 
              people who got epic items.</p>
            <p>Grats to Zionmaster for making 60! </p>
            <p>MAR 09, 2002<br>
              Lot of news and epics this week!</p>
            <p>Grats to Khallin for making 60!</p>
            <p>Trip to Hate resulted in mage staff for Immolar and Klaminar finishing 
              the second ranger epic Earthcaller!</p>
            <p>Trip to Fear to kill the broken golem resulted in Silvercaster 
              finishing her wizard epic!</p>
            <p>Trip to Hole, for 2 enchanter epic items, 1 paladin item, and Tenara 
              finishing her first ranger epic, Swiftwind! This after, a quick 
              trip to CoM and luckily getting a jade reaver to finally drop.</p>
            <p>Killed General in Kithicor to get Dreamthief to within one item 
              of rogue epic, just need to get an SMR now.</p>
            <p>Slayed the dragonfish again, resulting in Azenyth getting a druid 
              epic!</p>
            <p>Biggest news of all, was Crimson Talon leading a raid on Gorenaire 
              herself with just 33 people (some close friends helped us a lot) 
              and completely owned her with just 2 deaths. This, with limited 
              cleric and bard support. Solid tactics and smart playing - the Crimson 
              Talon way. Drops were: Frost Book [Chadmoe] and White Dragon Scale 
              [Devaberiel]. Chadmoe is now in homestretch for paladin epic!<br>

              Finally... - Xate (3/14/2002 11:09 PM) <br>
              <br>
              Quite a few weeks ago this picture was framed on the EOD front page 
              and everything looked promising for our next AOW attempt:</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Well attempt after attempt came by and his health pretty much stayed 
              the same throughout the weeks.</p>
            <p>In what has proved to be our toughest Scars of Velious challenge 
              (probably the toughest encounter ever for BFA) even though it seemed 
              to be very simple, the Avatar of War was finally put to rest tonight.<br>
              /burp - Merauk (3/14/2002 12:54 AM) <br>
              <br>
              Well after running about 90 people to Kael so we could die once 
              again to AOW (this mob reminds of all the trouble we used to have 
              with Queen in Chardok back in the day) somebody finally figured 
              out Statue wasn't up. Guess that clears up all the misconceptions 
              that we are a bunch of ShowEQ using gimps.</p>
            <p>So we split to the four winds. Some of us did some more CT which 
              I have to say has the gayest aggro ever. 3 taunts, 2 sod procs, 
              hate buff, and memory flux later mobs still beat the shit out of 
              enchanters. Nice they decided to change blurs around on test hopefully 
              they actually do something on live server for a change. Nothing 
              more refreshing then watching a cleric atone a mob for 60 mana and 
              have it work when a 350 mana flux consistently does dick. NERF clerics 
              only!<br>

              Cleared TOV 1.5 times this weekend, killed Grieg, killed Burrower 
              Parasite, and probably some other stuff.</p>

              <br>
              While we killed Tunare yet again with a flawless victory (well almost 
              I saw at least one pet die). We failed to make it to the top of 
              the temple in CT. Not because we suck but because losers like Gaef 
              and Naeen have to sleep. Just remember you can't get fat l00t's 
              sleeping.</p>
            <p>Grats Brackon on his fat Tunare Belt and Srotzu on her fat Tunare 
              sap.</p>
            <p>To Naeen and Gaef I only have h8, h8, and more h8.</p>
            <p>PS I waited for Xate to post his fat pictures cause he always whines 
              about how shitty mine are. But he had to sleep to so no new posting 
              for him, lazy prick only.<br>

              Risk Versus Reward - Merauk (3/7/2002 3:12 AM) <br>
              <br>
              Last night we killed The High Priest which in his newest form is 
              arguably one of the harder mobs in EQ land. He dropped loot I wouldn't 
              give to Laans pet goat. Tonight we killed the Arch Lich and got 
              two tendon slicers (crap loot but the mob is pretty sad to begin 
              with so won't bitch much).</p>
            <p>After AL we took a late night trip to Greigs End and wasted the 
              big man himself with 14 people (and probably could have done it 
              with 6) and he dropped loot which is 10x better.</p>
            <p>What is wrong with the balance in this game after three months 
              that loot drops are still entirely out of whack in SOL.</p>
            <p> Tunare dead - Merauk (3/3/2002 3:33 PM) <br>
              <br>
              First fight we were still sleeping. Second fight only death was 
              Gabantik :-(</p>
            <p>Everyone agreed that The Rauk showing up right as the battle started 
              was the key to our total victory.<br>

            <p>Well the Designers have been at it again. This time their evil 
              plan is to put us all to sleep with endless rattling bones and cackling. 
              The good news is I got to read half of my new PCGamer; the bad news 
              is that we spent a whole night in a little room filled with lag, 
              attacking LD mage pets and a dull throbbing pain of my fun dying. 
              Our reward for the night was an uber ten-slot backpack that is an 
              85% weight reduction!!! No pictures because I nuked them from my 
              harddrive in protest. </p>
            <p>In recent news, we snuffed out the Exiled. This raid could be titled 
              &quot;Twenty ways to pull a win out of your rear&quot;. Not sure 
              if we were asleep or if it was just one of those nights, but towards 
              the end with few to no melee left and a sliver of health left, someone 
              shouted &quot;Screw it! Nuke him down!&quot;. The few clerics, shaman, 
              mages finished him off with only two people left to spare. Hello 
              rear.. yeah im doing good.. just wanted to say thanks for the win. 
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>We also waxed the Arch Lich for the first time with only one LD 
              death. The strat was beautiful and worked to the last detail after 
              an initial attempt. Now if we can get the other Commander to cooperate 
              we can try out some more fun in Ssra Temple. I was asleep when Arch 
              Lich died so here's my version of him:</p>

            <p>Last week, we kack'd the Thought Horror Overfiend (new version) 
              one day, and the Burrower Parasite the next. Well.....doin it that 
              way again is so....well....last week!</p>
            <p>This week we hadda kill both on the same day, and kill them we 
              did. We zoned into the deep, plowed to the bridge, leaped off the 
              bridge, dragged some corpses, leaped off the bridge again, waited 
              while the late arrivals showed up, laughed at them as they almost 
              died making it to the bridge only to watch them leap into space 
              and miss the bridge, and then for good measure we fell off the bridge 
              again. After that stupid *@^%@$#@^ing bridge, the Parasite and the 
              THO are cake in comparison.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Not buying the cake theory? Bah! Ok, so they ain't cake, but they 
              ARE fun as hell (Note to VI, more like these, plzthx). They are 
              a sort of beautiful chaos of a fight, and if you can't react, you 
              get wiped....AWESOME. You don't need 80 people to do them (hell, 
              we had 37 fot THO....well....36 if you don't count me from fallin 
              asleep) and they are certainly not based around main tanking, are 
              MTs exploits yet?<br>
              Welp, kiss kiss, time for Rangers to go sleepy-bye with dreams of 
              big nasty Avatars..</p>
