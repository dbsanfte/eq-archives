            <p>Wednesday night after the servers came back up, CC/Talons went 
              for our attempt on the AoW. After taking out Vindicator and Statue 
              (grats to Kikak and Valorath on their new bps!), we encountered 
              a new mob: </p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>He went down easily but the AoW despawned after we didn't kill 
              him. After that Tormax had to die, grats to Allroy on his crown, 
              Kaylynne on her gloves and Whopper on his boots! </p>
            <p>Last night was Valentine's Day...it was also a patch night! We 
              decided to go for Yelinak. Grats Motu on Yeli's head, Urgoth on 
              the Dragon's Blood Earring and Lorraine on the mask!<p>

              Posted by Grasnalg On Feb 12 2002 <br>
              Well, we went into ToV HoT last night with PR and didn't get far 
              before the lag monster attacked. Soon after the lag monster, we 
              found ourselves without a chanter so we had to leave earlier than 
              expected, but not before we had won a few loots.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Gratz go out to:</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Bromm - Warrior bracrer</p>
            <p>Rayn - Wizzie gloves</p>

            <p>and to PR on their Plate bracer.<p>

              Posted by Naezariit On Feb 11 2002 At 01:02:49 AM <br>
              Well, the mighty Council strode boldly into Tunare's very home, 
              yet again today, and unleashed mayhem of immense proportions. Congratulations 
              to all the people who were lucky enough to get drops. We saw two 
              Stonewood Mail(Samn, Jilted) Sorceror's Robe(Mayu) Vambs of Stability(Weally) 
              and a lot of other drops. We got wiped out once, and while a temporary 
              setback, suffice to say that Tunare's minions were unprepared to 
              face the might of even equipmentless CoG!! Great teamwork, awesome 
              atmosphere to raid in, great attitudes, CoG. The Church of Hate 
              thanks you all!!<br>

              Night of the Link Dead (PoG - Day 2) <br>
              Posted by Grasnalg On Feb 10 2002<br>
              Well, aside from our problems with LD's last night, we did pretty 
              well in PoG on day 2 of our raid. For most our time there we had 
              2 groups give or take a couple people and came out with alot of 
              spells, trinkets and gems and a few pieces of armor.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Gratz on the armor winners goes out to:</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Samn on her new sk boots and bracer.</p>
            <p>Ensidious on her new rogue boots and hat.</p>
            <p>Naezariit on his new cleric arms.</p>
            <p>Khaymus on his new wizzie robe(finally in a dress. He said this 
              day would never come).</p>
            <p>and last but not least, the big winner of the night----</p>
            <p>Bregga on his new cleric BP.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Gratz again on the loot winners and great job on handling PoG with 
              all the LD's and low numbers while we were there. <br>
              <br>

            <p>FEB 14, 2002<br>
              Crimson Talon was just starting to assemble for guardian wurm killing 
              in Skyfire Mountains when we quickly realized that something was 
              amiss. &quot;Who will challenge me?&quot; boomed an NPC wurm named 
              Scales. &quot;Who is brave enough to fight me?&quot;. We opted to 
              take on the dragon runt and make him pay the price of his empty 
              boasting. A few seconds into the fight, however, something was really, 
              really wrong. People were vanishing virtually every second and appearing 
              in random, mob-infested areas of - drumroll please - The Deep. After 
              a few GM rezzes and some teleportations, we were back in Skyfire, 
              attacked again (sans buggy summoning), and dispatched this wurm. 
              Drops were molten cloak, diamondine earrings, and 2 non-magical 
              swords.</p>

              evening we went to the Hole and killed Master Yael in addition to 
              getting some epic mobs along the way. </p>

              EQ managed to boot me when I was on my baking spree, and login is 
              down, so you all get an update.</p>
            <p>Let's go back to last Thursday. The server crashed (apparently 
              the new hamster didn't work out), so we took advantage of a few 
              spawns.</p>
            <p>First stop, Akheva, where we managed to be mildly retarded and 
              train ourselves during the Itraer Vius fight. But, being the badass 
              killing machine we know the DA/SS alliance to be, we killed him...eventually:</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Grats Raelene on your insignia, and Awein on your new crown.</p>
            <p>It was late, but our bloodlust wasn't satiated with just one kill 
              for the night. Off to the Deep and death to the Thought Horror Overfiend!</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Sanuvin sports a new belt courtesy of THO, and we all became feeble 
              and inbred:</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Then they were cured, and the wedding was called off :(</p>
            <p>We had to wait until Sunday morning until we could kill big mean 
              things again. The locale: Ssra temple, land of f'd up snakes.</p>

              The patch - ShadeStorm (2/14/2002 9:54 AM) <br>
              <br>
              Been hearing tons of bitching going on about the new patch and the 
              random spawn timers. I for one like the new patch. I like the fact 
              they upping the level some on some mobs, while keeping others the 
              same.. Does random spawn timers help the casual gamer? No evidence 
              yet, but I will throw it out first, no it doesn&#146;t. Why? Because 
              unless the casual guild can sit in some area for a few hours(depending 
              on the timer of that spawn), that guild(s) still will lose. The 
              basic reason is simple. Everybody will have alts around the zones 
              and checking on the spawns. This means if a spawn pops while an 
              alt is checking the zone(or even fding near the spawn spot), the 
              guild who spots it basically will win. If the casual guild isn&#146;t 
              set up, I highly doubt they will be able to have everybody rush 
              someplace and beat uber guild 01. But the spawn timer wasn&#146;t 
              truly designed to help the casual gamer.....it was to help certain 
              time zone advantages, which although on our server doesn&#146;t 
              really exist, on others...this patch helped them a lot. </p>
            <p>If the upping of mobs is starting, that&#146;s needed as well. 
              But certain things need to be changed. One the loot on some sol 
              mobs, well sucks. The risk is actually better to stay in SOV for 
              the most part and get better items. Not saying sol mobs aren&#146;t 
              worth it, but if one decides on NTOV, AOW, Tunare, Tormax, or something 
              vs. Creator, Glyph, Exiled, or something, the risk is better to 
              stay on a SOV mob. Hopefully this will get changed soon. </p>
            <p>The quests in sol are pretty good. Hopefully more will come, and 
              hopefully Katta and Sseru will have competing quests that makes 
              guilds decide on faction and thus somewhat slow the bumping of heads. 
              I could see a huge ring war on these two factions, and if you throw 
              in the cat people, that&#146;s a nice three way fight that could 
              be very interesting in the long run. </p>
            <p>Some zones still need upgrades though. I still say Sseru is way 
              too big to have everything concentrated into one small area. Katta 
              seems the same way. Greigs could use another 1-2 mini bosses as 
              well. The deep surely could use 2 more mini bosses. Akheva needs 
              to kill the traps. It would help people spread out for exp which 
              is a very good thing seeing the biggest factor that will always 
              happen is people are constantly moving to 60 or are doing AA points. 
            </p>
            <p>There are actually a lot of mobs out there, but because of how 
              some mobs risk vs. reward sucks, it gets very crowded very quickly. 
              Change this on some SOL mobs and you'll spread the guilds out further 
              which in the long run helps the smaller casual guild(s) to get things 
              instead of having to wait forever and more people will be happy 
              ;&gt;<p>
              Lootikus Whorikus strikes again! - Xate (2/13/2002 6:32 AM) <br>
              <br>
              : Tyranadin : Greetings Norrathians! We are aware of the issues 
              with connectivity and zoning. To fix this problem, all servers will 
              be coming down in 15 minutes. There is no ETA at this time.<br>
              : Tyranadin : We apologize for the inconvenience, and will keep 
              everyone updated. Thank you.</p>
            <p>So after the servers come up and we do couple sloppy attempts at 
              Tunare before layin the smack down once and for all, netting the 
              BFA alliance 3 new shields and another 2 handed sword, it's getting 
              pretty late...but we decide what the heck, and head for TOV. The 
              Lootikus Whorikus virus which was described on Legacy of Steel's 
              website just so happened to pay us a visit the moment we entered 
              the Temple of Veeshan.</p>

              <br>
              Popped Tormax, moved to PoG. Dropped Tunare, 3 deaths, then onto 
              Ssra basement to kill Glyphed/Exiled, and a fun little shot at Cursed. 
              Much better then last few days, but still need some work ;) I'd 
              post some pics but I'm to cool for pictures. Oh hell, this is what 
              happens when Merauk tries to tank Tunare.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Edit (The Rauk): The only reason we defeated Tunare was my fantastic 
              save after Xate totally failed to position mob on pull. Using my 
              mad enchanter aggro skills I ganked that bitch and tanked her ass 
              (with my 1047ac) into position. Proving pretty much once again that 
              while EOD may be #2, The Rauk is still #1!<br>

              Posted By: Crover on 13 February 2002</p>
            <p>Tuesday started out sloppy but luckily we finished up strong. We 
              started out by dropping Tunare. However, prepping for Tunare turned 
              out to be more of a chore than the fight itself. During the pull 
              someone managed to re-agro her, causing the entire zone to come 
              crashing down on us. To make matters worse, it seems as though every 
              mob in that zone likes to path past our Tunare pull spot. 30 minutes 
              later we finally got PoGs dead and everyone rezzed, and we were 
              ready to rock again. It took forever to get Tunare into position, 
              but once we did she dropped like a rock. I've never seen her health 
              drop as fast as it did that fight. We literally took her from 100% 
              to 50% in maybe a minute and a half. GG~<br>
              Grats Eti and Choter on FT5 shields.</p>
            <p>Since the other guilds in the ToV N rotation were kind enough to 
              give us another North spawn due to the emergency downtime, we felt 
              obliged to take a little jaunt. Well, there are only two words to 
              describe what happened.</p>
            <p>&quot;ToV what?&quot;</p>
            <p>We literally destroyed every dragon in the place, and at the end 
              of 5 hours there wasn't a boss mob to be found. Vulak gave up the 
              goods this time around with a Vyrrin's earring, McLaer's boots, 
              and Vilk's pauldrons. Props to everyone who banded together to fight 
              until 5AM EST to see it through to the end, in what turned out to 
              be our fastest ToV clearing yet, that started at 12EST on a weeknight 
              no less.</p>

              Posted By: Zith on 08 February 2002</p>
            <p>Started off on Thursday in Kael. Figured Tormax was due a spankin, 
              and boy did we give him one. This pud doesn't put up nearly the 
              fight he used to, pity Grats to Grizumpy on gettin some head and 
              Omalley on a ring.<br>
              After Tormax we moved into POG. Gotta love only having to zone twice 
              and being ready to rock again. After a quick clear, and a 6 minute 
              fight, only three alliance members were dead, and one hot goddess. 
              Yes, she is my goddess. No I did not help kill her. F you all who 
              did! F you all to hell!</p>
            <p>Grats to Zippe on the phat earring, and Teufle (a.k.a. Captain 
              Oatmeal) on the whip.</p>
            <p>We also learned another thing in POG last night.. Monks are INSANE. 
              Our buddy Sgt. Soy Sauce (xate) parsed the log, and our rogues did 
              about 32,000 damage to Tunare. You figure that's about normal, rogues 
              are pretty nuts... but our Monks did almost the same exact damage, 
              30k+. WTF? The rogues had Tunare's back the entire fight, backstabbin 
              away.. and the damn Monks still almost outdamaged em. What can ya 
              do =\</p>
            <p>After POG we headed to Ssra. I hate this zone, it could be so cool 
              but typical verant pathing issues make some of it the stupidest 
              sh*t ever. We went into the basement, and for whatever reason the 
              Glyphed decided he wasn't gonna flee and warp around and train us 
              with the entire first floor this time! Grats us! He dropped some 
              lame cleric mace. &lt;3 clerics. Killed Exiled after (of course), 
              and he dropped a pretty phat enchanter wand -- grats Tdill!</p>
            <p>After that we figured, hey why not.. we've had a good day so far, 
              let's see what we can do to the Cursed. If any of you reading this 
              have ever fought the Cursed, you will understand the following:</p>

              AoW kill not a fluke! =)</p>
            <p><br>
              After a rather lengthy delay waiting for the servers to come up 
              from the &quot;emergency maintenance&quot; SS and DA moved on Kael 
              to do battle with Tormax, The Vindicator, The Statue and the Avatar 
              of War. Lag started out pretty rough during Tormax and we had a 
              fair amount of deaths while we killed his guards. Things seemed 
              to settle down as the night wore on though and our Tormax fight 
              had about 4 deaths total, 3 of which where wizzies. Back to aggro 
              school my fellow nukers! Drops were a head for Binmold, Belt to 
              Doggle, Boots to Soulvoid, Ring to Tarrath and Horn to Burton.<p>
              I have to say the most memorable thing about the Tormax kill was 
              the fact that someone decided to ninjaloot the horn as people were 
              snagging their gear off the corpse. Pretty surprised that people 
              havent learned their lesson after repeated stompings by the GM staff 
              on ninja looters. Petition is in so hopefully we'll get that horn 
              to Burton shortly. GM's been pretty good about looking that type 
              of stuff up for guilds so we should get it back.</p>
            <p>Moved over to the arena right after Tormax and found the lag to 
              be much improved which is pretty much opposite of most of our lagfests 
              in Kael. The Vindicator dropped with no effort and only a couple 
              wacky deaths from a nice warp lag and a early chain of crits. Grats 
              to Tangor on his boots and Mort on his Vindicator head of no one 
              else could possibly need. It would be really nice if the head didnt 
              drop every damn time. I think we've only seen one or maybe 2 earrings 
              from the bastard.</p>
            <p>After Vindi, we started working on the Statue pull when he just 
              decided to warp in on Raelene after warping past Kalorn and beat 
              her down for healing a touch early. We took revenge on The Statue 
              and dropped him with no other deaths. Grats to Jenka on her Breastplate 
              of Eradication, Pistov on his Cloak and Gage on his new Reaver. 
              Can we get a nice double BP drop like everyone else seems to get 
              from time to time? Bleh.</p>
            <p>Finally we got to the Avatar of war and had one of the best fights 
              we have ever put in the books. With 67 attendees we put the Avatar 
              to rest in 11 minutes exactly with only 7 deaths total. Thats some 
              pretty decent damage output but we should be able to get that even 
              lower in the future. We had some amazingly good MT transfers and 
              only lost 2 MT during their tanking phases. Our first MT even went 
              LD so we transfered without killing him and had just 2 other deaths 
              during the transfer. Great reaction times on everyone involved and 
              great job on paying attention to directions. Congratulations to 
              Aliudyen on his Ring of Destruction, Cerrasu on her Flayed Barbarian 
              Hide Mask, Kerlen on his War Bow of Rallos Zek and Slamm on her 
              Blade of Carnage.<br>
