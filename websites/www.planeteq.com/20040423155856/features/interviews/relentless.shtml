            <p><b class="heading">The Relentless: A Thriving Guild on Cazic Thule Server
</b>
            <p> The Relentless is one of the oldest guilds on the Cazic Thule 
              server, and one of the most successful if you consider longevity 
              and routine high level encounters to be a measure of success. The 
              Relentless is not the biggest guild on the CT server, but it is 
              well respected by the CT server population as being a tough guild 
              with successful players. The guild leader is Thornsong, a 65 druid, 
              who has been playing since May 1999. The guild has been around since 
              May of 1999.<br>
            </p>
            <p>The Relentless can boast that only five members have ever left 
              the guild to join others since it began to raid high end encounters. 
              Thornsong attributes that loyalty to the fact that the guild distributes 
              desirable loot to all members, rather than to a top tier of officers, 
              and the friendships that evolved in real life -- they were a softball 
              team and played Magic: The Gathering together -- before the guild 
              played as a group on the server, solidifying the bonds between the 
              members.</p>
            <p>Thornsong and I discussed the guild over an email interview:</p>
            <p><i>Kwill: How many members does the Relentless have? </i>
            <p> We have probably 120 members in The Relentless. Of those about 
              20 are retired but active on the boards, another 20 are semi-active 
              and 82 log on at least 4-5 times a week.
            <p> <i>Kwill: How many officers does the guild have?</i></p>
            <p>Eleven:<br>
              Thornsong Guild Master<br>
              Omalley Internal Relations<br>
              Lyddea Board Records<br>
              Grizumpy Guild Treasurer<br>
              Rjey Forum Guru<br>
              Shokwaav Seargeant of Arms<br>
              Zith Tactics Coordinator<br>
              Mintern Trade Skills Officer<br>
              Zaero Webmaster<br>
              Samirah Recruiter<br>
              Shizda Small Camp Coordinator<br>
              Athren Catch up Coordinator</p>
            <p>Thornsong, who has a professional career and family outside of 
              EverQuest, feels that his delegation of tasks within the guild makes 
              it possible for him to play less and the members to achieve more.</p>
            <p><i>Kwill: When did the guild actually start?</i></p>
            <p>May of 99. It started as a group of real life friends, mainly a 
              softball team combined with some friends who would casually get 
              together at Robb's house to play Magic The Gathering. </p>
            <p>It's kind of interesting as of those 10 people who created our 
              guild, at least half have played dramatic key roles in the history 
              of the server. First there is me, who has built the Relentless up 
              to the guild which was the first to kill Aten Ha Ra on this server. 
            </p>
            <p>Then you have Robb aka Kenji who left us to join Cohort [Chalybeuis] 
              and is now their GM. Larry aka Remyth left our guild to join Shadowed 
              Soul, and became an officer there. In fact, he was the swing vote 
              which ousted Shadestorm out of SS, which caused the rise of Element 
              of Darkness. </p>
            <p>Then you have the brothers Felix and Ken, probably best known for 
              their toons Solknar and Assassin, who left us to help build STK 
              and left them and came back, left again to help build EA [Erudinum 
              Arcanium], came back, and left again to help the Masks (and are 
              presently back with us). </p>
            <p>The Masks splintered on their own to form the Talons. Saze, the 
              main puller and [their] GM, was taught his class by Ken and Felix. 
              So we have been a big part of this server's history.<br>
            </p>
            <p><i>Kwill: What are your recruitment policies and minimum requirements?</i></p>
            <p>We have always been a mesh of casual players and power gamers, 
              but once we went solo from our alliance with Element of Darkness, 
              have been adding only power gamers to our mix. We are big enough 
              and only want to fortify our raid counts so that we can continue 
              to do things to make our membership happy. We require A LOT of AA 
              to get in our guild. We want people to come in &quot;done&quot; 
              from experience and ready to raid. That is our guild's function 
              now. We raid hard and we raid relentlessly.<br>
            </p>
            <p><i>Kwill: What is the most difficult thing about leading a guild? 
              </i> 
            <p> The most difficult thing about leading a guild is getting off 
              and doing your own thing. It's hard to level and to play my class 
              well when I constantly get interrupted with problems. The running 
              joke in my guild is that when you have Thornsong in a group, you 
              need another snarer as I will get wrapped up in a tell and will 
              inevitably miss one.
            <p> <i>Kwill: What is your proudest accomplishment?</i></p>
            <p>The proudest accomplishment for me would be waking the Sleeper. 
              Some people look at that as I ruined the game for others, but I 
              look at it as fulfilling a quest that I saw as gamechanging. One 
              that no one else could repeat. I still consider my Primal Velium 
              Battlehammer looted off Ventani as my favorite item.</p>
            <p><i>Kwill: What are your goals for the guild? </i> 
            <p> Our goals is to kill everything that Verant has put in our way. 
              We want to see every zone, defeat every mob and glory as conquerers. 
              On a personal note, I want my guild to be respected and not hated 
              for walking over people. In the past, some of our greatest achievements, 
              have been acts of kindness, like call of heroing in someone to loot 
              an item that would rot. I hate to see loot rot, we have given items 
              like that to our competition over and over again.</p>
            <p>In the past, a guild war of sorts on the server for the right to 
              hunt Trakenon created a conflict between The Relentless and other 
              guilds that wanted the dragon. Thornsong comments, &quot;This was 
              the beginning of us being strong. CC [Cohort Chaylbeuis] and EOD 
              [Element of Darkness] were the two guilds who forged an alliance, 
              and they brought us in as the third. They fought CN [Coterie Nocturn] 
              to a standstill before inviting us. We just pushed them over the 
              top.&quot;</p>
            <p> It is a tradition with The Relentless to fight for what they think 
              is theirs; early in the game they fought it out with another powerful 
              guild in the Plane of Fear when the other guild zoned in and insisted 
              they couldn't have Cazic Thule. Instead of giving up, they engaged 
              Cazic Thule with the entire temple still up. They died, the other 
              guild died, but so did Cazic Thule at the hands of The Relentless.</p>
            <p><i>Kwill: How would you compare the Relentless with other guilds 
              on the server?</i></p>
            <p>I would say that we are in the top tier of the guilds on the server. 
              I wouldn't say we are better than them skillwise or accomplishment 
              wise, but on par. We all have our good days. The other top guilds 
              are the SS/DA alliance, the CC/Talons alliance, Element of Darkness 
              and Anavon.
            <p> <i>Kwill: What other guilds do you admire/respect and why?</i></p>
            <p> What guilds do I admire? I admire guilds like Crimson Talon. This 
              is a small up and coming guild who has managed to keep their core 
              together despite the consistent pressure of members to want to jump 
              to the end game. Of the uber guilds, the one I admire most is The 
              Divine Alliance. I have had some real good friends in that guild, 
              unfortunately most have retired.<br>
            </p>
            <p><i>Kwill: What would you want someone reading this article to know 
              about the guild?</i></p>
            <p>I hope [our reputation] is a positive one. That has always been 
              one of my goals. I really feel good when I hear stories from my 
              members of being handed 100k to hold for someone as they transfer 
              it to another toon. The reason given, &quot;I know I can trust you 
              cause with your tag I know you wouldn't screw me over.&quot;</p>
            <p><i>Kwill: What makes it unique on the server as compared to the 
              other guilds there?</i></p>
            <p>We have a lot of working adults. We probably have less power gamers 
              than several of the other uber guilds out there, BUT, we focus. 
              That there is hard to explain. Let me give some examples. We try 
              to make it so that our members lack nothing and can focus on getting 
              the most out of the game. Any droppable item the guild can afford 
              that would better someone in our guild we will buy it. We try to 
              give them the best gear possible so they don't have to spend time 
              getting it. For example, back before run speed 3, I probably bought 
              30 pairs of JBoots for guildmates via multiquest. That way they 
              could concentrate on leveling rather than camping a rare spawn. 
              I want productive time out of my members when they are online. <br>
            </p>
