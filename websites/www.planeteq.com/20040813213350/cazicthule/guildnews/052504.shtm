            Rallos Zek: The Enigma <br>
            Posted by: Chantress on Thursday, May 20, 2004<br>
            <br>
              The elemental planes lay before us with only one barrier to entry...Rallos
              Zek the Warlord. You may think that Crimson Talon has been latent
              in its activity as we have posted no news lately, but we have not.
              We have been hitting the usual backflagging targets. Can anyone
                  say three cheers for killing Grummus for the 27th time? along
                  with a
              cornicopia of other targets as well. There stands only one that
                  has gotten the best of us three time thus far. Let me tell
                  you about
              it.
            <p>Rallos Zek #1- Recipe for disaster: Take one game that has been
              in beta testing for about 5 years. Sprinkle in 72 highly trained
              people at dealing with said beta version of the game. Sprinkle
              in one DX9 upgrade. Results should be explosive and unpredictable
              at best. Such was the case on the first RZ attempt. We get everything
              in place. Everyone is set up perfectly. The pull is executed flawlessly.
              Tallon Zek warps on the pull into the casters, thanks a million
              Sony. Wipe raid number 1 in 5 seconds flat. His AE sucks....hardcore.</p>
            <p>Rallos Zek #2- After working with the same effeciency, and this
              time without the warp, we easily kill both the brothers and the
              fake RZ. Mind you, most guilds take months just to get this far.
              72 casual players that have RL lives and dont raid hardcore got
              to the real deal on the second attempt. Now let me tell you a little
              about that. We get in the pit and get set up. We get enchanters
              with pets. We are ready to rock and roll. Rallos Zek INC!!! For
              some odd reason he eats the first enchanter he sees(me) so that
              puts one hasted pet onto the raid. Then we get him positioned and
              start to rock his world. All said and done...Rallos Zek the Warlord
              was trembling at 24% health on only our second attempt.</p>
            <p>Rallos Zek #3- Pets are the Suck! Read everything about attempt
              number one setting up. That all happened again. Long story short.
              Pet owned us and pulled TZ into the casters. Guess what....we didnt
              live through it. OMG that are the suck!!!!!!. Anyhow. He will be
              roadkill before long. We will see to that. Stay tuned for more
              RZ action as we add him to farmed status in the VERY near future.</p>
            <p>Backflagging Fun... <br>
              Posted by: Thespis on Thursday, May 06, 2004<br>
              <br>
              While continuining our backflagging efforts, not one, but two PoP
              targets fell before us Wednesday night. After a night off on Tuesday
              and a &quot;learning experience&quot; on Monday, we once again
              tested the machine and reduced it to scrap fairly quickly. In addition
              we moved on from there to present ourselves before Vallon Zek who
              was not up to our challenge. Congratulations to Genkakushi on his
              new weapon, Innovators Hammer and grats to Khallin on his new cloak
              to keep from getting dusty, Protective Dust Drape. Congrats to
              Perpetuary on his new 2 hander, Resplendent War Maul and grats
              to Thespis (happy warrior) on his shiny new Obsidian Scimitar of
            War.</p>
            <p>Crimson Talon - 2; Lord Mithaniel Marr - 0 <br>
              Posted by: Thespis on Friday, April 30, 2004<br>
              <br>
  We came, we saw, we left bodies everywhere. Round 2, DING DING DING! Gathering,
  prepping, and clearing into LMM went much smoother this go around. We had a
  few of us dropping while clearing his kittycat guards before and after the
  fight against him. However, during the big bad Pally slaying, the fight went
  very smooth until he got around 10%. After the MT died, a few got spanked a
  bit, but we hung in there and gave Mr. Marr the deathblow. Congratulations
  to the newly flagged. Also congrats to Dreamthief on his newDart of Immobility,
  and grats to Kelmor on a fine new belt, Valiant Belt of Fallen Heroes. </p>
            <p>Is it quiet? - Not! <br>
              Posted by: brewall on Thursday, April 29, 2004<br>
              <br>
              The last few days may have seemed quiet on the webpage, but it
              has been anything but in-game. We have been back-flagging a number
              of people trying to get everyone caught up. In the process, we
              have helped quite a few other non-Crimson Talon guildmembers with
              their flags if we have had room. A number of guilds have benefited
              from this, and we trust they will return the favor in the future.</p>
            <p>Some of the raids of late:</p>
            <p>Saryrn. Guildmembers did an excellent job on this raid working
              their way up the tower to her lair and was a fantastically smooth
              kill. We did have a few guests that managed to get lost, fall of
              bridges, and do some other things, but we managed to deal with
              all these issues and still kill her in record time. Aegis of Gloom
              [Winderi], Black Cloak of Malise [Justan], Whip of Unending Pain
              [Klaminar], Battlecloak of Lost Souls [Romell], Band of the Adorned
              [Ikana], Miserable Bauble [Dunskye], Twin-Blad of Sorrow [Niklas].
              Whew!</p>
            <p>HoH Trial 1. Halgoz Rellinic and Freegan Haun fell quickly yielding
              an Intricately Inscribed Band [Missycat] and a Warder's Ornate
              Broadsword [Celeste]. We also rolled off some ornate armour that
              was donated by generous guildmembers that have been spending time
              in Sol Ro's Tower. Ornate Silk Robe Pattern [Darkenloth], Ornate
              Chain Coif Pattern [Florain], Ornate Silk Sleeve Pattern [Aniin],
              Ornate Chain Glove Pattern [Ruzamm], and a Cloak of Greater Pernicity
              [Wynndy].</p>
            <p>Aerin'Dar and Rydda'Dar. Definitely a dragon bashing mode this
              evening when we mericilessly killed two of these beasts in one
              night. Yielded a number of flags to those that were missing these
              annoying flags. Some nice loots: Valorous Quarterstaff [Jkar],
              Honorable Longsword [Pizacatto], and Ivory Etched Aegis [Valtyr].</p>
            <p>Terris Thule. We hadn't done her in a while and she was due for
              a dirt-nap. Not the smoothest kill, but she fell to us never-the-less.

            <p>TZ &amp; VZ Meet the Crimson Talon... Again! <br>
              Posted by: Thespis on Sunday, April 25, 2004<br>
              <br>
  A few days ago, the Crimson Talon mobilized to make a visit with the Zek brothers
  TZ &amp; VZ. After a fairly fast mobilization, we quickly plowed our way to
  TZ's room. With 8 wizards and arrows flying all over the place, Tallon did
  not stand a chance. After that we moved back to the zone in area and then made
  our way to VZ's room. All of his fake reflections did not avail him either.
  After a smooth fight, Vallon joined his brother Tallon in the Zek tomb. Congratulations
  to Greymask on Tallon's War Charm, and grats to Brutish on the Visor of Endless
  Sight. Congrats to Awll and Winderi both on a pair of cleric hammers, Furious
  Hammer of Zek. Also, grats to Tigermane on his new pants from an Ornate Greaves
  Mold dropped by Anival The Blade, Kizrak's Greaves of Battle. </p>
            <p>CT Invades CoD! <br>
              Posted by: Thespis on Thursday, April 22, 2004<br>
  In an effort to continue our backflagging push, CT invaded the Crypt of Decay
  and laid waste to all in our path. It was a long night of raiding by our standards,
  but in the end both the High Priest and Bertoxxulous gave up the ghost. Many
  flags were obtained from this event. Congratulations to Infernostar on Decayed
  Shoes of the Plaguebringer. Grats to Altus on a well deserved Radiant Mask
  of the Disease Lord. </p>

Our little family guild has grown a little bit more in the past few weeks. Would
like to welcome Vennomous to the family and look forward to hanging out. With
our numbers stabilzing we have been able to hack down some pretty decent mobs
on a regular basis now. Our latest kill was the little dragon in PoI. Its a pretty
good event and he does put up quite a fight but after a strange event last week,
we teamed up with a force from HoA and took him down.</p>
            <p><img src="file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/m-miron/My%20Documents/My%20Pictures/guildnews/dkr525.jpg" width="450" height="338"><br>
              <br>
              Of course like many of the EQ quests this one was just as buggy
                and the little gnome simply walked away before we even had a
                chance to finish it off. Next time
  the little gnome may not be able to walk away.</p>            <p>When we have been able to catch them up, Doomshade and Rumblecrush
              have been stretched out horizontal in between our other farming
              sessions. We have also been slapping this guys phat man boobies
              around for loots as well. Another decent event with plenty to keep
              ya busy while ya prep for Paffa's funeral pyre.</p>

  <p>Congrats go out to Aliciarose for finally finishing up her epic.
              She managed to catch out ole VS up and with the help of Maubdib's
              borg, took him down like a solid pair of knickers. Good job everyone
              who helped along the way. Finally shut down that constant nagging
              noisy porter for a week. )p /wink </p>
            <p>We cruised into Fear a couple of Sundays ago to help Ali and many
              others aquire their epic pieces. Grats to Noca who took a huge
              step in her epic, Sadi the chanter epic piece and Katina and Kats
              both picked up their balls on this outing.</p>
            <p>No update would be complete without a little bump from the past.
              Found this old pix and figured Id share it with yas. Our original

                        Fates Defiance -- a guild with a rich history and many
                        faces. Sometimes a raiding powerhouse, sometimes an LDoN
                        XP factory, always a group of friends dedicated to having
                        fun in Norrath. </p>
                    <p>Are you looking for a large guild? One that is so overpowered,
                      that even though most of its members play poorly, they
                      can defeat the elemental planes? A guild where your own
                      skills will be hidden by so much battle spam that nobody
                      can tell if you're doing your job or not? A guild where
                      you know the person that invited you to join, and not many
                      other people know who you are? </p>
                    <p>If all of that appeals to you, you're on the wrong website. </p>
                    <p>Fates Defiance is a guild based on fun and friendship.
                      We are a medium sized guild that is growing slowly but
                      steadily. We are small enough that everyone must play their
                      role well if we are to be victorious, but large enough
                      that we can take on some of the toughest mobs in the game.
                      We are small enough that your talents and shortcomings
                      will be noticed, and large enough to have many excellent
                      players you can learn from. We are small enough that people
                      notice when you come and go in Norrath, and large enough
                      that there will be a friend online to help you with what
                      needs doing. </p>

                      Excellence in raiding <br>
                      Past successes include sub-elemental Planes of Power, taking
                      our &quot;twink brigade&quot; and whooping on old world
                      dragons and planes, and the Halls of Testing in Temple
                      of Veeshan. </p>
                    <p>Our current mission is to gain access to Vex Thal in Luclin.
                      To be successful there, we need more people than we currently
                      have in the roster. </p>
                    <p>We need.... YOU. </p>
                    <p>If you're reading this page, it's probably because you
                      know someone in our guild, or because you were directed
                      here by one of our members. This means you've already cleared
                      the toughest hurdle to becoming a member -- we only recruit
                      people that impress us with their play and attitude in
                      game. </p>

                    <p>Ckhom and Lilwenea got some epic drops in Burning Woods.
                      Thanks to everyone for coming out and giving a hand. Did
                      I mention I hate Skyfire? Bleah.</p>
                    <p> </p>
                    <p>The Fear raid was a great success. Though we did not get
                      any epic drops, the experience was fun. And how often do

                    <p>After a raid smoother than silk on Saturday night that
                      cleared the Chardok Royals, and also got epic drops for
                      our own Eildiar and Logeric, Mystechx was able to get her
                      Water Sprinkler. Ragefire went down faster than a ranger
                      on a raid, giving some good drops too. </p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>Thanks to all those that assisted her on this journey.

             must admit - my update is a tad late, however, we have been very
             busy raiding! Looking back at the last two weeks we have pretty
             much spent most of our time in the Elemental Planes which included
             PoFire farming, PoE rings, and PoAir farming/keying for Xegony.
            We also made our first attempt at Xegony herself!</p>
              <p>Also in the last couple weeks we were able to complete some
                much needed backflagging events. Mithanial Marr, VZ, TZ, HoH
                trials, AD, Sol Ro minis, and once again Sol Ro himself met his
                flawless death once again to IoA - awarding some needed PoFire
                flags! TY Sol Ro! We even managed to fit a short run to VT in
                there =)</p>
              <p>Gwendle clicks us up to Xeg!</p>

                Loot from the last two weeks include approx. 80 peices of loot,
                  with the majority of those being from the Ele Planes, and many
                  of them being molds/patterns. Some of the highlights of the

  Dust Down, Xeg cowls in fear! | <br>
  Posted by: Hideto on Wednesday, April 14, 2004 - 02:33 AM <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, after a long weekend of holiday festivities, a bunch
                  of us were itching to raid (well maybe just me since I been
                  on vaction for over a week). We decieded to go back to Air
                  and finish off what we started with the Avatar of Dust and
                  this time we finally opened the pathway to Xegony. The fight
                  was much cleaner this time, and we got Sigismond up with time
                  spare. He gave us a bit of trouble to in the end it was IOA &gt; Sigismond
            and Dust.</p>
              <p>The bard goods were looking out for us and left Shadow song
                with The Rhythm of Xegony and Lortan with the uber Rune Stamped
                Blade. Also, Braivheart got a Puresteel Mantle and we got two
                more ele patterns, Fllux on Silk Sleves and Xethle with Leather
                Helm. Grats guys! Xegony only has a matter of days before she
                surcome to IoA.</p>

                very much up so we decided to do some backflaging. Due to the
                recent influx of apps, this painful process must continue. So
                first off was RZTW. This was our first RZTW in a while, and let
                me say I AM IMPRESSED. You did it start to finish in a little
                over 1hour 20mins...pretty good for a first time ina while and
                with a bunch of new apps. After RZTW bit it, we headed over to
                CoD and clear'd through Carp and Bert. Grats to all the new ele
            flag'd peeps!</p>

                We have advanced through the first Uqua boss Tqiv Araxt the Enraged.
                  It appears that the hardest part of Uqua for us has been the
                  time it takes to learn about traps and how the event script
                  works. Making bad choices or not being aware of the trap setup
                  in most cases fails hours of work. We expect rapid advancement
                  through the zone due to very short lock out time on the first
            boss.</p>

            <p> Thursday, May 18, 2004 - Recruitment Update <br>
              - by Pirotess on May 18, 2004 - 9:58 PM <br>
              <br>
              Tired of dying night after night to PoP bosses in EQ? Hate being
              classmember_011? Sick of your leadership making poor, knee-jerk
              decisions? Maybe you have a different problem of sitting around
              with nothing exciting to do.</p>
            <p>We can help! We have the proven knowledge to get through these
              events quickly and efficiently and have been a consistantly successful
              guild for over 4 years. Currently we field about 35-40 people on
              any given night but could use a few more as we re-enter the elemental
              planes to take down their bosses. It is our goal to be back to
              Time in the next 3-5 weeks since our new recruits are now almost
              entirely backflagged. </p>
            <p>The guild is also expanding! We just recently started a WoW chapter
              that some of our members were given the chance to jumpstart. What
              this means is this is your chance to get in on the ground floor
              as we rebuild! We're a tight knit, mature group of gamers that
              buckles down when the going gets tough and keeps on pushing until
              we succeed.</p>
            <p>Currently we have the following positions open and will accept
              cross server recruits with items. Former members of our alliance
              will be given accelerated status through our applicant system as
              we have already gathered all of the information typically needed
              in the candidate phase of the system.</p>
            <p>Bard (2 positions)<br>
              Beastlord (2 positions)<br>
              Berserker (2 positions)<br>
              Cleric (4 positions)<br>
              Druid (1 position)<br>
            Enchanter (1 position)</p>
            <p> Thursday, May 06, 2004 - There are many RZ like it..... <br>
              - by Pirotess on May 06, 2004 - 10:41 PM <br>
              <br>
              ...but this one is mine. This marks the first in house kill of
              a decently difficult mob for SS. We started clearing to the triggers
              with about 20 people and popped RZ into the pit with 39. The final
              count on RZTW was 43 when he died. It was a big step for us and
              very satisfying. It was immensely rewarding to see the guild pull
              together and play with the skill and attention we drilled into
              ourselves over the last 4 years. We'll be hitting another round
            of backflags here soon so stay tuned!</p>
            <p> Thursday, May 06, 2004 - Recruitment Status <br>
              - by Pirotess on May 06, 2004 - 12:32 AM <br>
              <br>
              Contrary to rumored belief we are not folding up shop in Everquest.
              Last night we held a guild meeting and the end result was that
              we will be running an active WoW chapter and an active EQ chapter.
              Both chapters are now recruiting.</p>
            <p>As you may or may not know we are now operating as a solo guild
              instead of as part of an alliance. At the moment we have about
              10 candidates working through the application system which is the
              upper limit that I feel comfortable with at one time. We will however
              be moving another class of applicants through the application system
              in a few weeks time. For those who have asked we do accept cross
              server applicants. In fact we have one working through the system
              right now. Our primary goal is to return to Time status. Later
              we will return to GoD, hopefully after its unbugged. </p>
            <p>If you are interested in joining our EQ chapter please submit
              a lead form here.</p>
            <p>If you are interested in joining our WoW chapter please submit
              a lead form here.<br>
