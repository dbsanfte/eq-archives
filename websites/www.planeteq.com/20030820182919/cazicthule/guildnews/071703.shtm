              It has been an eventful couple of days!</p>
            <p>Started by killing Rumblecrush in UP, following up with Itraer
              Vius in AR soon after (man, I was proud of our rally time for IV,
              it was awe inspiring, only 3 minutes from call up to formation
              of raid groups...of course, we already had the raid going in Umbral,
              so I guess it's not all that amazing hehe)</p>
            <p>Next day, server resets, so we take the opportunity to clear out
              the first couple of bosses in Sleepers Tomb, good job getting out
              there and taking care of business!!</p>
            <p>Nice work all, good job and lets keep up the good work!!<br>
              <br>
                Get some FT on that guy, PLEASE! <br>
                Posted by Loadan On Jun 12 2003 At 09:02:46 AM <br>
  We took out IV with our BG buds last night, and managed to finally get some
  flowing thought on Thooven! He's been avoiding FT items like the plague, but
  we finally managed to force him to take one! heh</p>
            <p>Grats to Thoov on his insignia, and to Topsy for her mace of crunching
              baddies!</p>

            Posted by: brewall on Monday, July 14, 2003 <br>
            <br>
            Our second foray into Sleepers Tomb went very well, even though we
            had just come off another raid and only had one cleric. Managed to
            kill the Master of the Guard: Ancient Prismatic Axe [Khandrahcir],
            Velium Fraught Shackles, and Primal Avatar. Also killed the Projenitor:
            Ancient Prismatic Mace [Valstorm] and an Ancient Prismatic Claymore
            [Tico].<br>

  Congratulations to Dragu and Furies on completing their epics tonight!<br>
  Two new Water Sprinkler of Nem Ankh for the guild. Good job on all your hard
  work!</p>
            <p>Also Congratulations to Keyra on her Red Dragon Scale and Zoranna
              on her Runed Bolster Belt. After taking down the pansy Zordakalicus
              Ragefire we moved on to some better dragons in VP.</p>
            <p>Phara Dar was nice enough to drop 2 Robes of the Azure Sky for
              us, Infernostar and Sneeky really appreciated it. Not to mention
              the many spells for the guild bank.<br>

  Grats to Tippe for finishing the 8th Coldain shawl. An excellent turnout of
  guild support to help protect the dorf. </p>

              <p>We want to welcome all the new additions that have signed on
                lately. As a family guild we dont activly recruit, instead we
                count on our members to refer members. What this means is that
                every member is very valuable to our guild and is treated with
                respect. Welcome aboard Grokworth, Taylon, Nado, Gaarbage and
                Vilvandre. Please forgive me if I have missed anyone.</p>

              <p>We have been alternating between Kael and Tov the past few weeks.
                Both of these zones have been very generous lately. Grats to
                both our long time clerics Andruew and Andorean on their Thurg
                BP's. Grokworth picked up some boots, Andruew some plate gloves,
                and the bank grabbed another pair of boots from last nights action. </p>

              <p>The exp camps for the past week have been PoI and Cazic. Many
                peeps have showed up enmasse to both zones and we have had some
                pretty good times blazing away on mobs and sometimes wrecking
                the occasional trains that seem to occur in PoI. Ive always said

              Merril writes &quot;Most of our raids go as planned. They may run
              over on time due to real life concerns, silly mistakes, or random
              miscommunication... but the objectives we set out to accomplish
              are normally achieved. This night's raid was something noone could
              have anticipated: That the object of our raid would be suddenly
              switched at the last minute for something else ... ENTIRELY. 
            <p>During a very run-of-the-mill Undead Bard Trakanon
                          raid for Nandial's epic, we had finished clearing to
                          the lair and were set up and buffed to engage a dragon.
                          And engage a dragon we did. It seemed somewhat odd
                          to me that Trakanon spawned closer to the entrance
                          to the lair than to where the undead bard normally
                          spawns, but it didn't seem to be the opportune time
                          to make that observation publicly. Given the size of
                          our raid force, which was all anticipating congratulating
                          one of our long term members ... now an officer ...
                          on a very well deserved and long awaited final epic
                          battle, Trakanon died in about 6 seconds flat. </p>
                        <p>Then the drops were announced. 5 Trakanon Teeth, 1
                          Jaundiced Bone Breastplate, 1 Mrylokar's Breastplate,
                          and 2 spells. Yep... the game pulled a bait-and-switch
                          on us. I cannot begin to express how much of a let-down
                          this is for the dozens who turned out to witness a
                          bard finishing his epic. I can't convey with words
                          the shock of everyone there. </p>
                        <p>All I can say is this: /arnold voice on &quot;We'll
                          be back&quot;. </p>
                        <p>Congrats to those who will be recieving their Veeshan's
                          Peak Keys soon. Congrats to Barehouse on the Jaundice
                          Bone Breastplate, Congrats to Drizsit on Tolumpajs
                          Robe, and a heartfelt congratulations to all those
                          who recieved spells... which included such rare finds
                          as Flaming Sword of Xuzl and Sunstrike. </p>
                        <p>But... we're gonna have to go back and do it all OVER
                          AGAIN... Tommorow.&quot; <br>

                            <br>
                            Merril writes &quot;Patch days are always a flurry
                            of activity. Plans made days in advance fall by the
                            wayside and rare opportunities get pursued fully.
                            This patch day was little different from any other
                            ... but something very interesting did happen at
                            the end of it. </p>
                        <p>At the end of it all, this is how things turned out.
                          Phinegal Autropos dead for the ninety-eleventh time
                          (congrats Dropshadows on the epic staff). Venril Sathir
                          dead again (congrats Derack on that epic staff), not
                          that anyone cares. Yay more kunark legs and trash loot
                          cluttering my vault space. Gorenaire apparently enjoys
                          her status as a farm spawn and we farm her. Congrats
                          bazaar mules on another White Dragon Scale, a couple
                          of other useless drops. People seemed to like the spells
                          tho, so no complaints. Kelorek'dar falls again. Congrats
                          a pair of lucky monks on some orbs. </p>
                        <p>Last but certainly not least? We find Klandicar up
                          and looking lonely in Western Wastes. And after a fun
                          little fight, the dragon dies almost uneventfully to
                          a 23 person first attempt. Congrats Right on the talisman/Sleeper's
                          key piece, and congrats Mordeeper on the Dragonhide
                          BP. Zlandicar, you're on borrowed time. Expect it soon.
                          After so long, our time in East Wing of Temple of Veeshan
                          is finally drawing to a close. I, for one, couldn't
                          be happier. &quot; <br>

                            Merril writes &quot;After a long (and make no mistake
                            5 minutes can seem like an eternity) fight Gorenaire
                            gave up the ghost. I know you're all thinking &quot;5
                            minutes?!? You must not have had enough nukers.&quot; Well,
                            we had exactly 2 wizards there. But the most surprising
                            thing of all is who got the killshot. The person
                            who got it didn't even realize it at the time, but
                            it should incite more than a little laughter. </p>
                        <p>Drops included yet another White Dragon Scale, 2 Heirophant
                          Crooks, a Dragon Bone Hero Bracer, spells: Torpor,
                          Winds of Gelid, Mask of the Hunter, Spirit of Oak.

              [Sat Jul 12 00:29:32 2003] Ethereal mists gather at the far wall,
                causing it fade in and out of focus.<br>
              [Sat Jul 12 00:29:36 2003] A bright aura streaks through the sky.
              The power of it sends a surge through your body that makes your
              hair stand on end.<br>
              [Sat Jul 12 00:29:38 2003] The Triumvirate of Water speaks as one
              voice. It says, 'Now step up to the chambers. Give a part of yourselves
              to the bind on Zebuxoruk. Through our power, the bonds on him will
              never be broken. He will be eternally placed in stasis.'<br>
              [Sat Jul 12 00:29:41 2003] Saryrn says, 'What of our weakened state.
              I refuse to return to my realm without the power to rule over my
              minions.'<br>
              [Sat Jul 12 00:29:43 2003] Terris Thule says, 'Yes, how can I spread
              my touch over my lands if I lack so much of myself?'<br>
              [Sat Jul 12 00:29:45 2003] Cazic Thule says, 'Do not worry daughter,
              we shall stay here until we are able to recover our strength.'<br>
              [Sat Jul 12 00:29:48 2003] Rallos Zek says, 'Our armies shall serve
              us as we regenerate our abilities. We have nothing to fear.'<br>
              [Sat Jul 12 00:29:52 2003] Bertoxxulous says, 'My soldiers of pestilence
              shall watch over us. Let us return to our chambers now.'<br>
              [Sat Jul 12 00:29:55 2003] Innoruuk says, 'Are you enjoying watching
              this Hammer of the Tribunal? I hope your petty report will show
              my disdain for the Tribunal having no hand in this.'<br>
              [Sat Jul 12 00:29:58 2003] The Seventh Hammer says, 'Do not waste
              your energy Innoruuk. You know they are eternally preoccupied with
              their trials. Surely even you understand many of these trials exist
              because of the hate you instill into the population of Norrath.'<br>
              [Sat Jul 12 00:30:00 2003] Innoruuk says, 'Do not mock me! I shall
              seek you out after this is done and my power is restored. You will
              not be so smug after our next meeting.'<br>
              [Sat Jul 12 00:30:03 2003] With a sudden jolt the wall comes into
              crystal clear focus.<br>
              [Sat Jul 12 00:30:03 2003] As the path before you opens up in a
            swirl of mystical energy, the faded image of an hourglass appears </p>

              [Wed Jul 09 21:48:04 2003] Shadow of Anar's corpse says 'Your efforts
              are commendable, but you will not get far. By Coirnav, you are
              doomed to failure.'<br>
              [Wed Jul 09 21:48:04 2003] Ethereal mists gather at the far wall,
              causing it fade in and out of focus.<br>
              [Wed Jul 09 21:48:07 2003] Solusek Ro says, 'This is absurd, why
              are we wasting our time and energy on this!? Direct action is needed,
              now! Banishing Zebuxoruk will not stop the mortals from entering
              into our planes. Their greed for power will have them soon trampling
              through our realms!'<br>
              [Wed Jul 09 21:48:09 2003] Rallos Zek says, 'On this I agree! We
              must take action and the time is now. I will not have these mortals
              achieving the powers that we hold.'<br>
              [Wed Jul 09 21:48:13 2003] Fennin Ro says, 'Calm yourselves, you
              need to appreciate the situation that is at hand.'<br>
              [Wed Jul 09 21:48:16 2003] Xegony says, 'Please listen to reason,
              we are doing what we must. The mortals possess a direct tie to
              Zebuxoruk. If his stasis is finished their link will dwindle as
              well as their powers and knowledge.'<br>
              [Wed Jul 09 21:48:19 2003] Rathe says, 'The knowledge that was
              given to them by Zebuxoruk will fade from their minds. We must
              do this now, for if they were able to translate the divine language
              all existence would unravel. The balance of power in the universe
              would be destroyed.'<br>
              [Wed Jul 09 21:48:21 2003] Solusek Ro says, 'This is exactly the
              point that I am making! So you agree we must show them now that
              we are the power above them, and not to be questioned!'<br>
              [Wed Jul 09 21:48:24 2003] Rallos Zek says, 'You must see what
              he refers to; we must turn to Norrath and show them our power.
              What they are trying to accomplish cannot be allowed to come to
              pass.'<br>
              [Wed Jul 09 21:48:27 2003] Fennin Ro says, 'My son, please understand
              we must stop this advancement of mortals without halting their
              existence. The balance of power must be maintained. Without the
              mortals the balance would fade.'<br>
              [Wed Jul 09 21:48:29 2003] Solusek Ro says, 'So they have made
              your decision for you too father. You are all wrong, this will
              only bring them further into our realms seeking answers! We must
              take action now. Have at your foolish games, I will not allow them
              to obtain my power.'<br>
              [Wed Jul 09 21:48:34 2003] You look up and see a meteor burning
              through the sky; Solusek returning to his tower to brood over the
              matters at hand.<br>
              [Wed Jul 09 21:48:36 2003] Rallos lets out a sigh of frustration
              that vibrates the ground at your feet.<br>
              [Wed Jul 09 21:48:39 2003] Rathe says, 'Rallos still your warring
              heart. This is what must be done. We must place him in a stasis
              from which he will not be released. Come share your power. We must
              commence now.'<br>
              [Wed Jul 09 21:48:42 2003] Xegony says, 'Mithaniel, Karana please
              record what you see here. With your good nature I am sure that
              your records will be impartial to any side. We must record this
              for the ages and learn from our mistake of allowing Zebuxoruk to
              gain so much power that is easily passed on to mortals.'<br>

              Its no secret that the Plane of Time is probably the last big Raiding
                zone for a while, maybe forever in EQ. The next expansion is
                being designed for 6 man groups doing dungeon crawls.</p>
            <p>In the plane of time we get a lot of time to think about where
              we are and how we got here. Honestly I do not know what the future
              holds for Everquest. I know SWG, WoW and EQ2 will all take their
              toll on an already frustrated player base. I know a lot of people
              view clearing the Plane of Time as &quot;winning the game&quot;.
              Where will we be a year from now? I really do not know.</p>
            <p>What I do know is that it has taken A LOT of work, sacrifice and
              dedication to get where we are today in this game. Looking at our
              Roster you will see some of the most talented and dedicated gamers
              that play on our server. What you do not see are the many, many
              people who have helped us get to where we are today through blood,
              sweat and tears.</p>
            <p>I would like to take this time to honor those people. Regardless
              of why or how each of these people left, they all gave everything
              they had to help build this guild to one of the best guilds server-wide.
              I extend a heart felt thank you to our fallen comrades and hope
              life is treating each and everyone of you well. After four years
              of staring at a computer screen, my memory sometimes slips, so
              although this may not be a complete list, it near complete and
              I apologize if I forgot anyone.</p>
