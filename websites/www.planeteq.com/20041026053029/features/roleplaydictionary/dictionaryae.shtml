              Role Playing Dictionary<br>
              By Kwill Heartfyre, Scholar Magician of Felwithe</p>
            <p>My friends, I write to you with earnest hand of the information 
              I have collected from scholars scattered over the four corners of 
              the land. Much work by many wise and brave souls has gone into the 
              gathering of lore and artifacts to uncover the history of Norrath 
              and the peoples who live there. I hope my humble effort will advance 
              the knowledge of all peoples, to bring peace and prosperity to all 
              the races that must live together in our fair world. <br>

            <p> <b>Abjuration</b><br>
              One of the several skills related to the art of magic, abjuration 
              deals with defensive magic; for example, a spell that enables the 
              magic user to take less damage from extreme cold.</p>
            <p><b>Ages of Norrath</b></p>
            <p><i>Age of Scale</i><br>
              Veeshan the Mother Dragon deposited her brood on the continent of 
              Velious, which began the Age of Scale when dragons ruled the earth.</p>
            <p><i>Elder Age</i><br>
              The age of the alliance of the gods and the creation of the races 
              of Norrath. </p>
            <p>During the Age of Scale, Brell Serilis met with The Great Mother 
              Tunare, Prexus, The Oceanlord, and Rallos Zek, the warlord. Brell 
              told of Veeshan's discovery of the new and potentially powerful 
              world and he proposed that they accept an alliance of sorts, to 
              which all save Rallos Zek agreed, ignorant of the fact that Brell 
              had already released some of his creations into the Underfoot of 
              this new world.</p>
            <p>The planet that would be called Norrath was divvied up between 
              these beings of power for the purpose of keeping the Wurmqueen in 
              check. Each would create a race of beings to watch over Norrath 
              and keep a vigilant eye on the schemes of Dragonkind. Brell claimed 
              the bowels of the planet and created the Dwarves, stout and strong, 
              deep beneath the mountains of Norrath. In the abysmal depths of 
              the oceans Prexus left his children, the Kedge, hearty aquatic beings 
              of great mental power and stamina. And on the surface of Norrath 
              did Tunare create the Elves, creatures of limitless grace and beauty, 
              and Rallos Zek the Giants, fierce and formidable beings, intent 
              upon the defense of their lands.</p>
            <p><script type="text/javascript" src="http://ads.gamespyid.com/ad.aspx?S=planeteverquest&A1=NONE&G1=RPG&T=3&P2=0&A2=0&A3=300x250?unique"></script>

			<i>Age of Monuments</i><br>
              The rise and fall of the creatures of Rallos-Zek, the coming of 
              the last of the gods, and the creation of the Barbarians.</p>
            <p>Rallos-Zek's creations, the ogres, became a powerful race and challenged 
              the world of Norrath. When they eventually knew defeat, the Warlord 
              himself led a second invasion. The war that ensued shook the heavens 
              and angered the greater gods. Through their combined might, Rallos 
              Zek was finally thwarted and forced back to his domain, after which 
              a great barrier to the Planes of Power was erected, denying entry 
              to both the lesser gods and mortals as well. And then, in what some 
              view as spite and others justice, the gods cursed the Warlord's 
              creations. Thousands of Ogres were slain and their empire collapsed 
              around them. The Giants were spread from one end of the earth to 
              the other, forced to flee their homes as the gods brought snow and 
              ice to their previously lush lands. And the goblins were also cursed, 
              but no writings remain of their punishment as they no longer keep 
              records of their history (which is perhaps some indication as to 
              the severity of their curse). [Ed. Note-see Ankexfen for more information 
              on Goblins]</p>
            <p>The last of the gods came to Norrath. Mithaniel Marr, god of Valor, 
              and Erollisi Marr, goddess of Love, created the Barbarians, a hardy 
              race who settled the cold and rugged northlands, near the ruins 
              of the Giant empire. Being the youngest race, they were generally 
              unwashed and rugged, possessing very few social graces. And while 
              they too had a warlike culture, there were those amongst them who 
              began to believe in something more.</p>
            <p><i>Age of Blood</i><br>
              The last of the ancient elven cities.</p>
            <p>By this time the other civilizations of Norrath had either long 
              since declined, or were well on their way, and this small minority 
              of Barbarians saw an opportunity to triumph where the others had 
              failed. Perhaps this was a seed of wisdom planted by the Marr Twins, 
              or perhaps it was only by chance, but as the Barbarians spread out 
              across the lands, warring with both each other and any other race 
              encountered, this tiny movement continued to grow. And so even amidst 
              desolation and war, there was hope. </p>
            <p>During the Age of Blood came the last curse of the gods, as Solusek 
              Ro, Lord of Flame, arched the spine of the serpent mountains, bringing 
              heat from the burning sun to the ancient forest. The rivers ran 
              dry, it rained less each year, and while the great elven druids 
              fought long and hard, using their powerful magics to combat the 
              change, they could only delay the inevitable. Slowly the forest 
              gave way to desert, and eventually even great Takish-Hiz crumbled 
              and the elves were forced to flee Tunaria, leaving much of their 
              greatness behind.</p>
            <p><i>Lost Age</i><br>
              The rise of the Combine Empire and the founding of Erudin, home 
              to the magical arts.<br>
              <br>
              This next period of Norrathean history as it relates to many of 
              the races is the least known. It is surmised by the more knowledgeable 
              historians that while the elder races regrouped and reestablished 
              themselves, a small group of Barbarians were suddenly transformed 
              both physically and intellectually. Most believe this to be the 
              last major and direct act of divine intervention, and perhaps the 
              reason so little is known about this period is that the gods wish 
              it to be so, deciding afterwards that they would have less to do 
              with their creations. In any case, this small and enlightened group 
              were the fathers of the Human race, and they rapidly gained a foothold 
              throughout the lands, studying the lost art of geomancy. The Combine 
              Empire, as this lost race of Humans is called, spread throughout 
              the known world, but then died even more quickly than it grew, and 
              for reasons still unknown. And while they are the ancestors of every 
              Human on Norrath and their relics and ruins still litter the lands 
              from Odus to Faydwer, little history of this period remains.</p>
            <p>After the fall of the Combine Empire, the remnants of mankind dwelled 
              mostly in the center of Tunaria, inhabiting primarily the vast and 
              fertile plains of Karana. Villages appeared and prospered, several 
              reaching the size of towns, and two even became cities. To the west 
              a strong and noble band of Humans, lead by Antonius Bayle the First, 
              founded Qeynos under the lofty principles of law. Freeport, to the 
              east, became an active and dangerous port of call for all who dared 
              to venture into the Ocean of Tears. Humanity, much to the disdain 
              of the elder races who watched from afar, remained strong, even 
              daring to rename their home after one of their own instead of one 
              of the gods. The great continent of Tunaria would forever more be 
              known as Antonica. This is not to imply, however, that humanity 
              was at peace. Competition was fierce, and when resources grew scarce 
              for one reason or another many groups abandoned the promises and 
              alliances of their past and fought. A few leaders spoke out against 
              the violence, urging the masses to remember why they had fled the 
              cold north. Others reminded them of their former glory and the might 
              of the Combine Empire. These leaders insisted that humanity adhere 
              once again to those principals to which all had agreed. Explorers 
              and adventurers returned from afar with tales of elves, dwarves, 
              and other strange creatures, as well as descriptions of ancient 
              abandoned cities. A few even came back with limited knowledge of 
              sorcery and the mystic arts. And when that discontent minority of 
              leaders heard all of this, they became both jealous and determined.</p>
            <p>A small, frail man of great intellect called Erud led this group, 
              and he formed them into a council. They quickly became irritated, 
              even disgusted, by their fellow man. Leaving a small network of 
              spies behind, the remainder of Erud's followers fled the city of 
              Qeynos and boarded a small fleet of ships. They sailed to the west 
              and landed upon the barren coast of the island of Odus. The land 
              was sparse and uninhabited and quite appealing to the council and 
              their people. They quickly built a city of their own, dissimilar 
              in almost every way to both Qeynos and Freeport, for it was almost 
              entirely a towering castle. Erudin it was called, and within it 
              the scribes and scholars, who called themselves High Men, gathered 
              and analyzed reports, captured books and scrolls, and other artifacts 
              brought to them by their spies. The first human mages since the 
              Combine Empire were born - wizards, sorcerers, and enchanters occupied 
              the great halls of Erudin and grew immensely in both power and knowledge.

            <p>It came to pass some years later that a small group of Erudites 
              discovered the lost art of Necromancy. They were branded heretics 
              and great conflict arose. For the first time in several hundred 
              years, the Erudites fought. They engaged in a civil war not entirely 
              dissimilar to that which they had loathed and fled from back on 
              the mainland. But there was one very significant difference - they 
              did not use swords and bows, but rather magic, and the result was 
              terrible. Lives by the hundreds were lost, great buildings and structures 
              destroyed, and eventually the heretics were forced to flee Erudin, 
              to hide and regroup in the southern regions of Odus. In one final 
              battle, great mystic energies were released and an immense hole 
              leading to unknown depths beneath the earth was created. Into the 
              sides of this chasm the heretics built their own city which they 
              called Paineel. And while both sides still seethed with anger and 
              hatred towards one another, their fear of what the last battle had 
              wrought has kept any further conflict at bay. Thus began the Age 
              of Turmoil.</p>

              The gnome city, located in the Steamfont Mountains on the continent 
              of Faydwer. Known in ancient times as the Fortress Mechanicus, it 
              is both fortress and laboratory. The gnomes are known for their 
              tinkering skills in making mechanical machines. Gnomes have been 
              developing their clockwork machines and defenses here for generations. 
              The machines now do much of the work in the city, and serve as merchants. 
              The guards in the city are called &quot;watchmen.&quot; The rumor 
              is that in ages past, the gnomes were so powerful they defied the 
              gods and built their own clockwork dragon to protect the city, but 
              it went rogue. No one knows the fate of this dragon.</p>
            <blockquote>Ever the since the first days of the elven rebellion, 
              it had been decided by the emperor of Felwithe that the gnomes would 
              be a free race allied with the elven empire and able to live on 
              elven lands, much unlike the almost slave-like persecution the little 
              tinkers suffered under the rule of the dark elves. The gnomes had 
              been granted lands surrounding the fertile Elizerain Lake and there 
              existed for a century or more in peace with their elven neighbors. 
              However, being on elven lands also meant the gnomes would have to 
              follow elvish customs, and increasingly the gnomes began to feel 
              out of place. The gnomes were builders, not artists, and they could 
              not sing or dance or play musical instruments. Elves prided themselves 
              on their use of the bow and their long, graceful blades but gnomish 
              arms couldn't support the lengthy elven weaponry. And while the 
              elven language was meant to be spoken in long, descriptive, and 
              fluid verse, the gnomes were always prone to speak in jittery and 
              incredibly fast sentences. Slowly, a general concensus began to 
              form among the gnomes that someday a separate gnomish kingdom would 
              have to be formed. The gnome most responsible to bring about this 
              change was named Biddyn. 
              <p> Biddyn was born the fourth son to a poor farmer on the east 
                of the Elizerain Lake, the gnomish territories closest to the 
                heart of the empire. Almost immediately he recognized how much 
                he, and even his brothers and father, hated farm work. The most 
                joyous times in his life, as he later wrote, were the monthly 
                festivals the gnomes held where they would gather and build all 
                manner of fascinating machines. This, he thought, is what gnomes 
                should be doing and he bestowed upon himself the responsibility 
                to make sure this came to pass. Studying elven mannerisms and 
                rhetoric on his market voyages to Felwithe with his father, Biddyn 
                soon became a speaker the likes of which no gnome has ever equaled. 
                His very charisma charmed everyone around him into the idea of 
                a separate gnomish kingdom, and he soon was ready to bring his 
                demands before the emperor. The emperor at this time was none 
                other then Carandril, past lord of Kelethin, who had appointed 
                the warrior Edril as his first soldier long ago and also as the 
                head of the imperial army. Edril had served loyally and skillfully 
                as Carandril's guard for more then a hundred years, the warrior 
                elf being only a little more then middle-aged for his race. 
              <p> Charmed by his determination and skillful speaking, Edril supported 
                Biddyn for a separate gnomish kingdom. Even the emperor was attracted 
                to the proposition, as a new allied kingdom would open new opportunities 
                for trade while the gnomish loss would not be a big drain on the 
                imperial economy. After only six days of deliberation, Carandril 
                granted Biddyn's request and plans were immediately formed for 
                the creation of a new gnomish homeland. 
            </blockquote>
            The emperor severed the southern part of his empire, mostly unused 
            and barren fields beyond the steamfont mountains, and gave it to the 
            gnomes.The land was renamed &quot;Akanon&quot; which is elven for 
            &quot;Gift&quot; and ten gnomish settlers as well as five elven guards 
            were prepared to make a journey into Akanon and chart the lands. 
            <p> <i>Of the plague dragon and the formation of Akanon: </i> 
            <blockquote> The fifteen settlers rode out surrounded by the cheers 
              of elves and gnomes alike, but were not heard from for many months. 
              Finally after the fifth month of their disappearance, only one elven 
              soldier, his clothes torn to pieces and his weapons shattered, rode 
              solemnly through the gates of the empire. He was the last of the 
              settlers who remained alive, and recounted his tale before an astonished 
              imperial council. A plague dragon, with scales of an oozing black, 
              had attacked the party soon after they had crossed into the southern 
              lands and had claimed that the lands of Akanon were his own. For 
              months the plague dragon chased them and hunted the gnomes and elves 
              down. The soldier had watched each man die a slow and horrible death, 
              and believed the dragon only let him go to give this message to 
              the elves. 
              <p> The gnomes were instantly furious that Carandril had given them 
                cursed lands to settle, and the emperor immediately ordered the 
                death of the dragon. Frightened by the terrible story of the soldier, 
                most of his warriors were reluctant to volunteer, as Carandril 
                would not force anyone to fight such a terrible beast. Edril, 
                however, immediately offered his services as a personal favor 
                to the gnomes. When Biddyn himself volunteered five more gnomes 
                joined the hunt, and together with his gnomish friends, Edril 
                rode to the Steamfont Mountains to meet the terrible beast. What 
                happened next is best summed up by Biddyn's own &quot;The History 
                of the Gnomes&quot;: 
              <blockquote> &quot;I admit as much, that even my legs were shaking 
                when we approached the mouth of the demon's great cave. From our 
                previous encounters, and from the memories of our lost friend 
                Dolyn, we were all terrified of the beast. All of us, that is, 
                except for Edril, but I don't think Innoruk himself could scare 
                that elf. He thrives from fear as much as I do the tobacco in 
                my pipe, it is to him as some sweet nectar that clears his thoughts 
                and hones his blade. So while we trembled before the plague dragon's 
                domain, Edril simply lifted his sword to his shoulder, looked 
                back at me, and said &quot;wait here.&quot; With a proud determination 
                he marched toward the black cave entrance, a portal to the lower 
                planes if ever there was one. He marched to his death, or so we 
                thought. But when we saw him next in two days time he pulled behind 
                him the head of the evil beast, which left thick trails of a green 
                poison behind it. He breathed heavily, and painful scars covered 
                his body. I laughed, thinking that while Edril was obviously hurt, 
                the dragon must have felt much worse before his death. Anything 
                that inflicts that much pain to the elf must be prepared to receive 
                the same thrashing tenfold.&quot; </blockquote>
              The skull of the dragon sits still on the entrance to the gnome's 
              own Fortress Mechanus. Edril and his band of gnomes would be written 
              into gnomish lore forever as for the next weeks they rode tirelessly 
              through the lands of Akanon, fighting back fierce creatures and 
              charting the perfect hillside location for the first ever kingdom 
              of gnomes. Edril spent much more time in Akanon then originially 
              expected, personally overseeing the kingdom's construction. When 
              the first houses were made and the first gnomish settlers came pouring 
              in, Biddyn was selected as the first king of the gnomes and he in 
              turn erected a statue in honor of Edril. The statue depicts Edril's 
              battle with the great plague dragon, and gnomish craftsmanship made 
              it enormous and actually useful: it sits in the heart of Akanon 
              even today, acting as the central part to Akanon's extensive irrigation 
              system. When Edril returned home to Felwithe he was greeted by hundreds 
              of proud soldiers and again proclaimed a hero. </blockquote>

              adventurers to continue this research. Al'Kabor requires a few components. 
              He cannot be bothered with the menial task of retrieving his own

              of adventurers to retrieve four gnoll teeth. With these in hand, 
              he dispatches a group to retrieve an aviak charm from South Karana. 
              Finally, Al'Kabor needs something with a little more staying power,

              from Butcherblock to Freeport during some of the worst storms that 
              ocean had yet seen. Despite being crewed by rough and seedy veteran 
              seaman, none of whom were strangers to travel in treacherous conditions, 
              the voyage turned disastrous. 
              <p> Upon reaching the Ocean of Tears, the ship's captain determined 
                it would be prudent to seek refuge at the Sisters of Erollisi 
                Isle. His order to the tillerman to steer hard to port was met 
                with no response. Turning, he watched as the poor soul was swept 
                over the rail on the crest of a wave. The captain scrambled toward 
                the rigging. A second wave breached the starboard side. The captain 
                shut his eyes tightly and prepared for the impact. When none came, 
                he opened his eyes. A muffled screamed escaped him as he watched 
                the wave, now standing impossibly on the deck, sprout great arms 
                and reach for him. The cacophony of snapping timbers and the thundering 
                of water were all that bespoke the final voyage of the &quot;Shark's 
                Bane&quot;.

              The elder race that predates the goblins.</p>
            <p>Long ago, there existed a race known as the Ankexfen, after their 
              progenitor Hazeg Ankexfen, created by Rallos Zek during the Elder 
              Age. This race was quite intelligent and cunning. They quickly expanded 
              their knowledge of magic and the other planes, yet constantly yearned 
              for more power. So, along with their ogre counterparts, they set 
              out to master the Plane of Earth. Alas, their attempts proved futile 
              and the combined might of the other gods forced Rallos Zek back 
              to the Planes of Power, leaving his creations to the whims of the 
              other gods. </p>
            <p>The wrath of the unnamed gods was grim. Thousands of ogres were 
              instantly slain - their empire left to crumble under the hand of 
              retribution. The giants were flung across the face of Norrath like 
              seeds to the wind. The Ankexfen's fate was more severe. The entire 
              race was exterminated, but from the ashes were born the four goblin 
              races. Exactly how this happened is unknown. But what is known is 
              that each goblin clan was stripped of any knowledge and was neither 
              informed of the other clans nor of their origins. Each clan was 
              then transported to a separate environment to help preserve the 
              gods' will. However, the gods were not without mercy and each clan 
              was granted a section of the staff. Upon each staff, a crystal was 
              adorned. These staves served to aid the goblin clans in understanding 
              their environment. These remnants of the Staff of Ankexfen combine 
              to create the fabled and powerful Staff of Ankexfen.

              to have acquired the lost scroll of the royal guard that tells the 
              secrets of Charasis. They are said to care for the crypt of the 
              late Emperpr Sathir.</p>
            <p><b>Armor:</b><br>
              <i>Leather:</i> Leather armor is the easiest to manufacture and 
              is usually taken from livestock, cut to the desired pattern and 
              then boiled and shaped to fit the wearer. It provides moderate protection 
              from thrusting weapons and can be excellent against the slash attack. 
              It protects and warms the wearer and gives good protection. </p>
            <p><i>Chain:</i> The standard in armor protection throughout Antonica, 
              chain mail and ring mail provide much better protection than leather 
              but are also a magnitude more difficult to make and far more expensive. 
              Chain consists of thousands of small links of wire, each shaped 
              into a ring and riveted together to close the ring. Each ring is 
              then knitted together in either a three link, four link or five 
              link configuration and then these are joined to make a coat. The 
              more links in a given section the stronger the mail will be. Chain 
              gives relatively good protection against all types of attacks. </p>
            <p><i>Plate: </i>Plate is the best type of armor available. It is 
              made of sheets of steel shaped to fit the wearers' body through 
              forging, and tempered to a tough hardness. Plate is extremely hard 
              to make and much more expensive than chain. Few items can match 
              the status one enjoys when wearing a breastplate. Many are lovingly 
              crafted with designs and fluting, but whether fancy or plain, this 
              is the armor to stop your enemies cold in their tracks.</p>

            <p><b>Barbarian</b><br>
              During the Age of Monuments the last of the gods who came to Norrath, 
              Mithaniel Marr, god of Valor, and Erollisi Marr, goddess of Love, 
              twin brother and sister, created a hardy race who settled the cold 
              and rugged northlands, near the ruins of the Giant empire. Being 
              the youngest race, they were generally unwashed and rugged, possessing 
              very few social graces. And while they too had a warlike culture, 
              there were those amongst them who began to believe in something 
              more.</p>
            <p>While the elder races regrouped and reestablished themselves during 
              the Lost Age, a small group of Barbarians were suddenly transformed 
              both physically and intellectually. Most believe this to be the 
              last major and direct act of divine intervention, and perhaps the 
              reason so little is known about this period is that the gods wish 
              it to be so, deciding afterwards that they would have less to do 
              with their creations. This small and enlightened group was the origin 
              of the Human race, and they rapidly gained a foothold throughout 
              the lands, studying the lost art of geomancy. </p>
            <p>In the present age, Barbarians are a hardier variety of the human 
              race that comes from the cold and rugged northlands. Though referred 
              to as barbarians by the rest of the world, these proud people refer 
              to themselves as &quot;Northmen.&quot; Because of the harsh environment 
              and their warlike culture, they are better suited to being warriors, 
              and are generally unwashed and rugged - possessing very few social 
              graces. Hailing from the city of Halas in the mountains of Everfrost, 
              barbarians take great pride in their clan's lineage. Eating, drinking, 
              and battle are their preferred pastimes.</p>
            <p>Although the vast majority of barbarians become warriors for the 
              great honor that will bring to their clans, some feel the mystical 
              call to serve as clan shamans, lending their magical abilities to 
              further their clan's standing. Yet, there is one more class that 
              a barbarian may become, and that is the class of the rogue. Barbarian 
              rogues are usually loners who have decided to bring their clan honor 
              through less respectable methods. Achieving honor is what is important, 
              not how it is achieved.</p>
            <p>No matter their chosen profession, barbarians are a force to be 
              reckoned with. The very love they have for a fight is what makes 
              them a true danger. (The History of Norrath, Verant International)</p>
            <p><b>Bard</b><br>
              Life would be so boring without a bard around. The only fun people 
              would have would be watching ogres trip over their own feet. Bards 
              do it all. They sing, dance, play musical instruments, fight and, 
              on occasion, help relieve overburdened purses. Their artistic talents 
              stir a party into action, or cause enemies to rethink attacking.</p>
            <p>A bard may believe in various causes, but one thing they all have 
              in common is the love of their art, to forever be guided by their 
              muse. (The History of Norrath, Verant International)</p>

              Befallen was once the site of a wonderful temple, a reclusive home

              it has become, but whatever the cause, Befallen is now a home to 
              the undead its inhabitants used to hunt and destroy.</p>
            <p><b>Bertoxxulous: The Plaguebringer </b><br>
              Followers of Bertoxxulous believe the only truth on Norrath is that 
              everything dies. They view the decay of flesh as a thing of ultimate 
              beauty. The subtle purples of a fresh bruise, the almost irridescent 
              yellow green of an infested pustule, are but a few of the things 
              that His followers relish. It is not suprising that many of His 
              followers pursue the dark art of Necromancy, for to them nothing 
              is more desirable than to be surrounded by beings who, even in unlife, 
              continue to rot and decay. Do not take this to mean that His followers 
              are suicidal or seek a quick death. To the contrary, they wish to 
              live long, painful lives, spreading their dark, diseased stain across 
              all of Norrath. (The History of Norrath, Verant International)</p>

            <p>B<b>rell Serilis: The Duke of Below, Duke of Underfoot</b><br>
              Brell Serilis was first to come to Norrath during the Age of Scale, 
              and from his Plane of Underfoot, a dark realm of vast caves and 
              endless tunnels, he quietly created a magical portal to a cavern 
              deep in the belly of Norrath. Through this portal the Duke of Underfoot 
              seeded the depths of Norrath with all manner of creatures. Brell 
              then returned home, sealing his portal within a labyrinthine chamber 
              of mystical Living Stone. During the Elder Age, he created the Dwarves 
              as part of the gods' plan to keep watch over the dominant dragonkind.</p>
            <p>Later, Brell returned to create the gnomes, resembling dwarves 
              to some extent, yet more wiry and gnarled, consumed with tinkering 
              with devices more so than their cousins.</p>
            <p>Followers of Brell Serilis believe that the surface world is a 
              waste of space. They find true happiness in the caves, caverns and 
              tunnels that perforate the belly of Norrath. But this is one of 
              few points that all followers of Brell can agree upon. There are 
              many different factions who all worship Brell. The Runny Eye Clan 
              of Goblins claim he is their father much to the disgust of the Dwarves 
              of Kaladim who know that the Dwarves are the true children of Serilis. 
              But the vicious Gnolls of Split Paw disagree entirely. For was it 
              not Brell who sculpted them out of the sacred Clay of Cosgrove? 
              Followers of Brell Serilis in one form or another can be found nearly 
              anywhere you enter the Underfoot of Norrath. (The History of Norrath,

              Cabilis, or New Sebilis, as it is often called, is the new heart 
              of the Iksar Empire. The Iksar recaptured the city long ago and 
              have since made it their new home. Theirs is an ongoing effort to 
              tame the surrounding areas to ensure the safety of the city. The 
              traveler can find all the castes of Iksar here: crusaders, hierophants, 
              kloks, vessels, keepers, nihilists, troopers, and monk trainers. 
              One can even find the occasional froglok slave. The area around 
              Cabilis is a swamp, with giant mosquitoes, scorpions, and leeches.</p>
            <p>The Iksar have, for centuries now, focused internally on rebuilding 
              their culture and society, to be stronger and to be able to face 
              the outside world again. That time has come, and the Iksar are now 
              pushing back into the lands where they once ruled supreme. There 
              are four areas immediately surrounding the city that are of intense 
              interest to the Iksar. First is the Field of Bone, a barren area 
              that contains the ancient remains of Kurn's Tower and Kaesora. The 
              Iksar are focusing many of their broodlings in this area in order 
              to tame it. The Swamp of No Hope is an area that the Iksar currently 
              are letting run wild, despite maintaining a small outpost to protect 
              their walls. Warsliks Wood is similar, as the Iksar have met much 
              resistance from both the goblins and the forest giants within during 
              their attempts to control the area. There is also a strong outcast 
              presense there. The Lake of Ill Omen, however, is another area that 
              the Iksar are very focused on regaining control over. A new enemy, 
              the sarnak, have established a fortress within this region and are 
              expanding their range slowly, coming into conflict with the residents 
              of Cabilis and also the goblins of the region.</p>

                valuable possesions within the library of Charasis. 
              <p> Emperor Sathir's beloved, Drusella, rests within a grand crypt 
                in Charasis' depths. After her funeral and burial, Emperor Sathir 
                cast all citizens from the cliff city. Only the royal guard and 
                servants where allowed to stay, forever. 
              <p> These Iskar were never again to feel the warmth of the sun or 
                bask in the moonlight. It is written that Emperor Sathir crafted 
                a spell to hide the entrance of Charasis from raiders and those 
                who dared to steal his knowledge and defile his beloved Drusella's 
                crypt. Emperor Sathir would visit the cliff city frequently. What 
                he would do inside is not known. 
              <p> Upon the death of one of Emperor Sathir's royal guard was revealed 
                the secret to gaining entry into Charasis. Upon a tattered scroll 
                did the guard record the secret. The scroll is now lost to the 
                world. Taken as pure babble by the mortician, it was cast aside 
                and lost to time. 
              <p> After Emperor Sathir's death his son and new emperor, Rile is 
                the last to hold the secret of entry. The ancient cult of Emperor 
                Sathir known as the Arisen are rumored to have acquired the lost 
                scroll of the royal guard. They are said to care for the crypt 
                of the late Emperor Sathir. 
              <p> It was during the time known as the End Days that the spirits 
                of Tunare, Underfoot and the Rainkeeper destroy most of the great 
                cities of the ancients. Charasis and its guardians and treasures 
                are lost forever. May those entombed within guard her secrets 
                from invaders. 
              <p> So let it be known that Darkmask and Pizo have found a secret 
                treasure, hidden in the Overthere, a land of many dangers, but 
                apparently it yields quite a reward. To the library we must recover 
                these lost items.

              A cleric is a healer devoting his or her life in service to a god. 
              Many races have members whose entire lives are dedicated to devotion, 
              and although anyone can worship in his or her own way, only those 
              who have fully committed themselves to the prayerful life of a cleric 
              are granted a god's great favor in the area of healing. With daily 
              prayers, worship, and meditation, clerics receive their powers in 
              order to aid others in defense, protection, or healing. Clerics 
              are forbidden to shed the blood of others and so have skills only 
              in blunt weaponry. While they cannot compete with the sheer force 
              of a warrior's attack, clerics are certainly able to protect themselves

                in rubble and our people are divided yet again. The once grand 
                city of Sebilis is claimed by the one who decimated it. <br>
                The remaining Iksar are scattered among the outlands of Kunark. 
                Their places of refuge are now the dwellings of dark denizens. 
                In the wilds, a few castes come to unite. One of these is the 
                remnants of the Crusaders of Greenmist. They are lead by a powerful 
                shadowknight named Rok Nilok. <br>
                The army of shadowknights number in the hundreds. Within their 
                ranks are a few mystics and legionnaires. The tribe names itself 
                after their leader, The Crusaders of Rok Nilok, and they shall 
                purge the lands of Kunark. </p>

                many goblins. There shall be no prisoners or slaves. The empire 
                shall be rebuilt by the hands of the Iksar. All others shall perish.

                It has now been taken over by goblin clans. The Goblins soon find

                flee. A swift battle ensues and the castle is reclaimed. </p>

                Little more then three months after their betrayal of Dagnor and 
                their march to the east, the newly freed orcan slaves were left 
                stranded with no place to call home. None of the orcs had ever 
                lived without the watchful eye of an ogre master looking over 
                their shoulder, so now they were like children: wandering without 
                knowing exactly what they were to do. The dwarves had made it 
                clear in their pact that, while the kingdom of Kaladim was responsible 
                for freeing the orcs, they were still very much enemies. It was 
                not an option for any of the orcs to return west, so they eached 
                began plotting for a new place to live. </p>
              <p> The decision was split three ways and the orcs began to revert 
                back to the methods of their ancestors: splitting into three differing 
                clans. One clan marched north, taking residence in the familiar 
                northern peaks of Rakthok's ridge and away from the careful eyes 
                of the dwarves. The second clan decided to make the grassy fields 
                of the loping plains their home. Even today this clan remains 
                there, looting and plundering any caravans who happen to pass 
                by. The third, and the largest clan, was lead by a young orc named 
                Gharol. He convinced the majority of the orcs that true riches 
                lied to the fertile lands of the east. There, he said, the orcs 
                would find their new home and the crushbone clan, as he called 
                his followers, would grow strong. </p>
              <p> It was at this time, as the crushbone clan started making their 
                way further east around the Wayunder lake and straight for the 
                greater Faydark, that the elven lord of Kelethin began to take 
                notice of their advancement. </p>

                <p> The first elf to take interest in Kelethin's request was a 
                  young soldier named Edril. Edril had lived his entire life in 
                  Felwithe, schooled by the best teachers and raised in a wealthy 
                  family. Around his 30th birthday, young by elven standards, 
                  he admitted himself into the imperial school of soldiery where 
                  he impressed his teachers with both his knowledge of military 
                  science and his deadly accurate fighting skills. After graduating 
                  and performing many deeds of merit in the imperial army of the 
                  elves, he was chosen as a personal guard of the emperor at the 
                  unprecedented age of 50. What brought him everlasting fame among 
                  the elves, however, was not how he excelled in schooling but 
                  what he chose to do for Kelethin. Going straight to the emperor 
                  himself, Edril asked that he be allowed to lead the attack against 
                  the orcs. When the emperor granted his wish, Edril hand picked 
                  100 of the best elven warriors and the best horses, and rode 
                  quickly to the woodland kingdom of Kelethin. </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> He was met at Kelethin with a large reception, but decided to 
                ride through quickly. He was there for only one purpose: to make 
                a name for himself by destroying the orcs. Little more then two 
                days after arriving in the city, Edril and his men rode outside 
                the greater Faydark and headed directly for the first orcan encampment. 
                It was the middle of the night when Edril made his first strike, 
                and the orcs were completely caught off guard. Edril's men rode 
                straight over the orcs, slaughtering every clansmen they saw with 
                little casualties of their own. Edril is said to have fought like 
                a madman, tallying over 20 kills himself. Without even stopping 
                to catch their breath, Edril's soldiers rode for the next camp 
                so as to keep the element of surprise. </p>
              <p> One by one the camps of the crushbone orcs were destroyed quickly 
                and brutally. The orcs, still preparing for their second assault 
                on Kelethin, were always caught by surprise. Edril and his men 
                moved from one battle to the next so quickly, the elves called 
                them the legion of wind. The strategy worked perfectly: Gharol 
                was never able to get word of the new attackers in time to plan 
                a defense and so most of the orcs were slaughtered. The final 
                battle, lasting longer then the rest, was against Gharol's own 
                camp. Many of Edril's warriors were killed in this fight but all 
                of the orcs, including Gharol, were driven away to the deep growth 
                of the wild Greater Faydark. Here they have made their makeshift 
                kingdom. When Edril returned to his kingdom, he was proclaimed 
                high protector of Kelethin with over 150 kills to his name alone. 
                This would not be the last time Edril's name was written into 
                elven history, however. It is believed that only weeks later after 
                their retreat, Gharol was killed by his own followers. </p>

            <p><b>Dabner Drednever</b><br>
              Dabner Drednever is a cleric of Brell Serilis. He is a compassionate 
              and simple man, light of heart and jovial in spirit. He does not 
              share the intelligence of his close friend Ognit, nor the physical 
              strength of his sworn protector, the barbarian woman Dagda. He is 
              generally an air-head but this is off-set with a natural wisdom 
              that shows itself in the form of the occasionally profound and significant 
              insight. He is most comfortable in a nice cavern with some good 
              solid earth over his head. As fate would have it, this is seldom 
              possible. He takes this in great stride though. As long as he is 
              with his friends, his inherent agoraphobic, gnomish nature usually 
              does not bother him. </p>
            <p>Dabner views Ognit as a role model. He wants to be more like Ognit 
              but realizes that he lacks the intense schooling that Ognit has 
              had. Indeed, he knows he is too old to pursue those things and he 
              also knows that he lacks the mental acuity that Ognit possesses. 
              He is comfortable in that knowledge, however. Dabner is the stereotypical 
              side-kick to Ognit. He marvels at his ability to channel great magical 
              energies in a most efficient manner (Ognit speaks often of efficiency). 
              He will go along with just about anything that Ognit does and he 
              trusts his judgement implicitly.</p>
            <p>Dabner has convinced Ognit to show him a bit of tinkering. The 
              reason for this is both a means for him to be more like his role 
              model Ognit, and also as a way to impress Dagda, upon whom he has 
              a crush. Dabner is taken by Dagda's raw strength and physical prowess. 
              She is his Knight in Shining Armor, in a manner of speaking. A word 
              of encouragement from her ignites a spark within him that sets him 
              aflame with unparalleled courage. Yet as much as he loves her, his 
              nature prevents him from making even the slightest sort of statement 
              of desire towards Dagda.</p>
            <p>In an odd way, a way that he does not acknowledge in a conscious 
              manner, he views himself as solely responsible for the welfare of 
              his companions. He has occasionally brought down the wrath of Brell 
              upon a foe in order to call its attention upon him and to draw the 
              enemy away from its target. This fact has garnered him great respect 
              with Dagda and she does view the small gnome as one who is surprisingly 
              brave for his size.</p>
            <p>Though Dabner is completely devoted to the worship of Brell, he 
              also has studied, and is quite knowledgeable about, the religions 
              of other cultures in Norrath, as well as the lore of the gods they 
              worship. He finds that by studying and understanding the beliefs 
              of others, they are not as scary to him.</p>
            <p><b>Dag the Blaspheme</b><br>
              An evil sorcerer, he forged an enchanted blade that became cursed. 
            <blockquote> 
              <p> <i>From the Forbidden Scribe in West Cabilis</i><br>
              <p> Long ago in the time of Emperor Ganak, Scholar Dag did walk 
                with the Great Master Atrebe. After the unfortunate dusting of 
                Atrebe did Dag begin his Study of the forbidden circles, Wizardry, 
                Enchantry and Magic. It was soon that he took a liking to the 
                ways of Wizardry. His studies were kept to himself as he ignored 
                the laws of Kotiz. He became the Blasphemere of the Brood. Most 
                of his studies were held in private, only his Sarnak slave named 
                Kly was allowed to assist in his blasphemous studies. His secret 
                was soon to be revealed to all. 
              <p> Dag was commissioned by Klum Machata to create a magical dagger 
                for his personal use. It was to only be wielded by one of his 
                ilk. Dag travelled to Kum's outpost to begin his work. His slave 
                went along, pulling behind him a special forge which belonged 
                to Haggle Baron Dalnir. 
              <p> While Dag was away the Brood stumbled upon his journal and his 
                secret obsession. The Brood sent word to Kum to have Dag deconstructed. 
                Dag was in the final stage of enchantments. Kum let him proceed 
                and when the dagger was complete, Kum shackled Dag and used the 
                dagger upon the belly of Dag, the Blasphemere. 
              <p> The Dagger was found to be very effective, but lacked a few 
                more spells and so it was returned to the Brood. It never made 
                it back. The Crusaders sent, as well as the Sarnak slave who was 
                pulling the Dalnir Forge, all vanished without a trace. Only the 
                Dalnir Forge remained. Surely the gods cursed the blade by the 
                hands of the Blasphemere. To avoid the wrath of the gods, all 
                of Dag's property and creations were burned as was the memory 
                of his blasphemous studies.

              A barbarian warrior hero of Norrath, friend of Firiona Vie.</p>
            <p>Dagda is a strong woman, firmly rooted in the physical world. She 
              is most comfortable dealing with things she can touch, hear, and 
              smell. A follower of The Tribunal, she believes in the tenants of 
              absolute justice, but, for the most part, has little use for the 
              gods. The realms of spirit and magic are best left to those who 
              have the time to worry about such intangible things. The extent 
              of her mystical experiences consist of a single dream she received 
              from Tunare, though she never knew nor cared about its source, that 
              foretold her meeting the gnomes, Ognit and Dabner. Other than this, 
              she has found that obstacles are best met head-on where she can 
              see them face to face, smell their breath, and hear the crunch of 
              their bones. </p>
            <p>Dagda saved the gnomes Ognit and Dabner in Everfrost many years 
              ago when raiders attacked them. She has grown very fond of, and 
              indeed loves, them both. She respects them for their inherent mystical 
              and spiritual abilities, but she is keenly aware of their physical 
              frailties. She vowed to defend them both, and does so with the ferocity 
              of a bear defending her cubs.</p>
            <p>Dagda is by no means simple, and is truly a genius in the realm 
              of tactics and combat. She is literate enough to read the common 
              tongue with little difficulty, and speaks both the common tongue 
              and her native tongue fluently. Her knowledge of other languages 
              is generally limited to curses and taunts, of which she has gathered 
              quite an arsenal. She generally communicates in a short and very 
              direct fashion, leaving no room for misinterpretations.</p>
            <p>Dagda knows that Ognit is very intelligent and respects his knowledge, 
              though she sometimes questions its use. She is most impressed and 
              thoroughly fascinated by his ability to tinker and create wondrous 
              things. Indeed, this is the medium through which she can relate 
              to him best. The useful objects he builds allow her to perform any 
              number of tasks, so useful, in fact, that she thinks he would be 
              better off giving up the study of wizardry to become a full-time 
              tinker. After all, it's just fine to call down the very fire of 
              Fennin Ro upon the mighty Glacier Bear at 300 yards, but when it 
              is mauling your head off it's of little use. </p>
            <p>Dagda shares a healthy sibling-like rivalry with Ognit. Being an 
              accomplished tactician, she is aware of the simple fact that at 
              a distance Ognit would have the clear advantage, and would win were 
              they to ever do battle. However, she also knows that if she got 
              her hands upon him, she would be the victor. Despite being quick 
              to anger at times--and she and Ognit have often exchanged heated 
              words--Dagda would never raise a hand against either of the gnomes 
              she has sworn to protect.</p>
            <p>Dagda views Dabner in a much different light. She has on countless 
              occasions felt his healing touch as a cleric. For one who is so 
              firmly rooted in the physical world, he is a very compassionate 
              and loving soul. She loves him as a brother, and treats him in a 
              somewhat patronizing manner. She would never consider speaking an 
              unkind word to him, nor will she tolerate those that might. She 
              is aware of, and also a bit saddened by, a crush Dabner has upon 
              her. Dabner is simply too short for her tastes. She would much prefer 
              a man of might with whom she would not worry. However, as a warrior 
              she respects his raw courage in battle and his unfailing loyalty 
              to his friends.</p>
            <p>Though she is closest to the gnomes, Dagda also shares a strong 
              respect for her companions. It is Firiona Vie, Sir Jevik, and Thubr 
              Axebringer she most deeply admires. They are all mighty warriors 
              in her eyes. She acknowledges the skills of the rogue Dreezil Pocketdip, 
              and views him as a skilled fighter. His ways of stealth are an effective 
              way of dealing with his natural halfling handicaps in her eyes. 
              Though she is not a warrior and not as skilled as the others with 
              a sword, the bard Sionachie is a valuable asset to the group. Her 
              rousing battle songs inspire a zeal that makes combat that much 
              more exciting.</p>
            <p>For the wizard Al'Kabor, Dagda has little love. Respecting the 
              immense power he wields, she has a healthy fear of him. After his 
              recent threats against Ognit, however, her opinion of him has since 
              plummeted.</p>

            <p><b>Dagnor</b><br>
              Ogre and Warlord, known as the destroyer of the five kingdoms. 
            <blockquote> 
              <p> <i>Of the Rakthokian Kingdom and General Dagnor: </i><br>
                For centuries while the elven empire grew to the east, the dwarves 
                and ogres had thrived in the mountains to the west, surrounding 
                the forest presently known as &quot;Lesser Faydark.&quot; The 
                dwarves settled into the jagged cliffs of what is known as the 
                butcherblok mountains and there had established their golden kingdom 
                of Kaladim, &quot;The forge of Norrath.&quot; The ogres were able 
                to wrestle control of nearby lands from the orcan hordes of Faedwer 
                after a decade of warfare and established the first ogreian kingdom 
                in the nearby Rakthokian ridge mountain range, named after the 
                first ogre leader &quot;Rakthok the Warlord.&quot; There in the 
                Faydark west the dwarves and ogres lived in an uneasy peace. 
              <p> While the immense empire of the elves could have easily crushed 
                either one of the kingdoms, the ogres saw the dwarves as a primary 
                concern. Raised in a culture where only the strength in your arms 
                and the size of your weapon mattered, the ogres of the kingdom 
                of Rakthok considered only the dwarves to be their equal and thus 
                a very large threat. The ogres were also greedy of the gold-rich 
                mountain mines and the stone cutting skill of the Kaladim kingdom, 
                and to make matters worse, the friendly disposition of the dwarves 
                did not agree with the savage and chaotic tendencies of the Rakthokian 
                ogres. What resulted was an intense racial hatred and many small 
                fights between the two kingdoms. 
              <p> In the beginning of the second age, when the elven rebels against 
                the god Innoruk began to surface, Dagnor the Butcher was chosen 
                as the 5th warlord of the Rakthokian Kingdom. Clearly the most 
                ambitious of all the previous Rakthokian kings, Dagnor was the 
                first to realize that the small skurmishes between dwarves and 
                ogres would never solve anything and that for the ogres to gain 
                anything substantial, the dwarves would have to be completely 
                overcome or slaughtered. He saw the mines of Kaladim as an infinite 
                source of limitless wealth and power. Almost immediately after 
                he seized the throne Dagnor began to assemble the largest combined 
                army of ogres since the orcan clans had been overthrown. Dagnor 
                was held in check for a long time, however, because Kaladim was 
                a chief source of gold and weapons for the elven empire and the 
                dwarves would find the elves a strong ally if war broke out. The 
                ogre king was smart enough to realize that his kingdom could not 
                survive an attack from both sides and so he did not advance and 
                the dwarves did not regard him as much of a threat. While the 
                indomitable elven empire loomed over western Faedwer, war was 
                not an option for either the dwarves or the ogres. 
              <p> <i>Of the attacks on Northern Kaladim: </i><br>
                Dagnor is sometimes referred to as the destroyer of two empires. 
                When he began his campaign against the dwarven kingdom of Kaladim 
                he began the fall of his own kingdom of Rakthok, but also he stopped 
                the dwarves from giving aid to the elven empire against the ever 
                increasing elven rebel armies. Many historians surmise that if 
                the dwarves had not been pulled into war with the ogres, their 
                help would have caused the downfall of the rebel army and the 
                old elven empire would still be in existence. <br>
                In any case, with the war of the broken crown raging to the east, 
                Dagnor knew the elves could not afford to lend aid to the dwarves 
                and he took the opportunity to launch his own campaign against 
                the kingdom of Kaladim. The warlord knew that the key to beating 
                the dwarves was through the less guarded lands of northern area 
                Kaladim where the dwarves had primarily established trading centers 
                and peaceful mining villages. So in the middle of the second age, 
                the 5th warlord of the Rakthokian kingdom marched his army of 
                ogres and orcan slaves west across the hills of shade directly 
                to northern Kaladim without fear of elven intervention. <br>
                Old dwarves still tell the horrible tales of the first ogre attacks. 
                Ill prepared to meet such an invasion force, the peaceful cities 
                of northern Kaladim were swept over with tremendous speed. Ogre 
                warriors burned everything they could put a torch to and killed 
                every dwarf they saw be it man, woman, or child. In little less 
                then a week the forces of Dagnor had surprised Kaladim and caused 
                the deaths of hundreds of dwarves. The warlord had found the weakness 
                in the impenetrable kingdom of Kaladim and now marched directly 
                for the capital. <br>
                Of king Grimmly Fireforge, and the battle on the hills of shade: 
                <br>
                It was Dagnor's unnecessary need to stop and make sure everything 
                was dead in the wake of his army that gave the time the dwarves 
                needed to prepare. Word reached the capital city of Kaladim days 
                before the ogres arrived. Hearing the startling news of the advancing 
                army, the 12th dwarven king Grimmly Fireforge, an excellent fighter 
                and brilliant military tactician, began to assemble a defensive 
                force. Dagnor also did not anticipate the speed by which the dwarves 
                could gather into a force large enough to repel his own. It was 
                the warlord's first mistake. <br>
                When the army of ogres reached the Crakthorn ridge, just one mile 
                from the capital city of Kaladim, they were met by an equally 
                large force of dwarves lead by king Grimmly. The fighting on the 
                ridge was savage and brutal, but being less skilled at fighting 
                in tight tunnels and with low light then the dwarves, the ogres 
                were forced to flee. Dagnor ordered his army into the hills of 
                shade where the dwarves and ogres could fight on equal ground. 
                <br>
                Day and night the battle raged across the hills of shade above 
                the lesser faydark and the grass was bleached red with the blood 
                of the fallen. Both armies were fueled by soldiers from their 
                respective kingdoms and soon the war had ground into a stalemate. 
              <p> <i>Of the orcan betrayal and the battle of the shattered spear: 
                </i><br>
                Thinking that the war would either be won or lost on the hills 
                of shade, Dagnor ordered his southern most forces guarding the 
                forest of lesser Faydark to move north and add more strength to 
                the army in the hills. He left instead a handful of ogre soldiers 
                and mostly a host of orcan slaves. It was Dagnor's second and 
                most fatal mistake. </p>
              <p> For the first time in history dwarves and orcs came to an agreement 
                and entered in on an alliance. The dwarves promised the orcan 
                slaves of the defeated orcan clans their freedom if they would 
                not interfere in the war in favor of both sides. Completely in 
                favor with the plan, which gave the orcs freedom but did not require 
                them to fight, the orcan slaves retreated from lesser faydark 
                to the east, deserting the armies of Dagnor and leaving the southern 
                hills wide open. King Grimmly took this opportunity to assemble 
                a second force to the south and then attacked Dagnor's army from 
                both the front and the undefended flank. The ogre forces on the 
                hills of shade were demolished. Dagnor fled with few others and 
                the Rakthokian kingdom was now completely vulnerable. Grimmly 
                gathered his remaining forces and headed straight for the ogre 
                capital, leveling any fortresses he came to and burning Rakthok 
                to the ground. The Rakthokian army had been broken. 
              <p> The last official battle took place beneath the forest of lesser 
                Faydark as the remaining ogre forces, lead by Dagnor, attempted 
                to flee to the south. They were met there by a small force of 
                vengeful dwarven soldiers who were able to hold them off until 
                the arrival of the main dwarven host. When King Grimmly and his 
                army arrived, the forces of Dagnor fought viciously and were able 
                to kill many, but were ultimately defeated. A story tells that 
                Grimmly and Dagnor met eachother face to face on the shores of 
                a lake to the south of lesser faydark during one of these fights, 
                and that Grimmly stabbed Dagnor with a spear with such intensity 
                and ferociousness that the weapon shattered into thousands of 
                pieces even as it cut straight through the ogre lord's chest. 
                The story goes on to say that the warlord fell to his death immediately 
                in that same lake and that the evil in his blood made the water 
                boil and turn red. Thus the dwarves mockingly renamed the lake 
                Dagnor's Cauldron and thus the final battle of the ogre-dwarven 
                war was called &quot;the battle of the shattered spear.&quot;

              An ancient Erudite heretic, he was imprisoned in Paneel, but managed 
              to escape. </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><i>From a letter from Al`Kabor, Master of the Arcane to Earron 
                Huntlan :</i><br>
                After many grueling hours of attempting to restore the ruined 
                page of the diary that you did give to me for research, I was 
                unable to return the penmanship to a more legible standard or 
                to interpret the writing to any large degree. As unfortunate that 
                may be, I was however able to brush away most of the fluids that 
                stained the page to see a quite remarkable and rather curious 
                symbol stained into the parchment itself. I furthered my studies 
                in regards to the symbol and found that it was an ancient Rune 
                that has since fallen beneath the ways of our modern magical practices. 
              </p>
              <p>Despite the Rune's disappearance from our arcane methods, I myself 
                was still able to translate the Rune and find exactly its purpose 
                if used within a spell or research. This Rune in particular dates 
                back to the Heretic Revolt and the forming of the first Paineel, 
                which I am sure you know has since fallen into rubble beneath 
                the hands of Master Yael. I have had brief introductions to ancient 
                lore in the evolution of our magic and after some further research, 
                I was able to pinpoint the exact creation and original purpose 
                of this rune's creation. </p>
              <p>One known as Dartain created the rune. An ancient Heretic who 
                should be nothing more than dust within his grave, he somehow 
                remains alive and well. His time shall soon come, but that is 
                not the tale that we are discussing. Dartain created this rune 
                and two others that would assist him in one of his many studies 
                and experiments with death and life in attempts to create a spell 
                that would summon a rather powerful undead servant. The project 
                fell away as the Necromancer found an easier way to forge the 
                spell, which to this day is used by those Necromancers who have 
                the power within them to conjure such a powerful Servant of Bones. 
                Due to this research, I am quite determined to think that the 
                diary itself is one of the many that Dartain did keep before his 
                exile to the Plane of Underfoot.</p>
              <p>With the Runes no longer able to assist Dartain's research, he 
                returned them to the pages of his diary where he is famed for 
                holding most of his meaningless ramblings. If the diary were to 
                be recovered one would notice that there are failed attempts to 
                inscribe these runes upon pages 19, 23, 29, and 37 of the diary. 
                It is rumored that if these runes are combined with the words 
                of the same context, a flawless incantation would be created and 
                thus the effect which Dartain was striving to obtain with his 
                original creation of the Runes. Due to the more powerful nature 
                of these incantations, I would assume the effect to be on a larger 
                scale than that of a simple pet. I would have liked to take a 
                look at the diary in full to perhaps find the other Runes and 
                further my study. </p>
              <p>Despite the absence of the other runes, I was able to discover 
                the names of three inscribed upon the pages of that ancient diary... 
                The first Rune that was created was that of Servility; the second 
                Rune, the one that I held for some time in my possession, is that 
                of Entreaty; and the third and final rune is that of Dominion. 
                For each of these Runes there are a set of words that compliments 
                the meaning and purpose of the Rune's names, unfortunately I can 
                not provide the exact names of these words as they were a well 
                kept secret from the likes of &quot;goodly&quot; scholars. </p>
              <p>How this could possibly relate to the problems you have observed 
                within your tavern and city are beyond me. This diary is meaningless 
                as a whole and the runes inscribed upon these ancient illegible 
                pages are useless without the words, which have been lost for 
                centuries. With what has been evident within these past few days 
                in regards to these disturbances, we can clearly eliminate the 
                possibility of the heretic's involvement. This display is much 
                too sloppy for their style in oppression, and they are currently 
                too tied up with the Council at Erudin to attempt to control such 
                a city as this. </p>
              <p>There is one thing, however, that has disturbed me and has led 
                me to believe that your thoughts of conspiracy are correct, but 
                I still do not know what the diary or the runes have to do with 
                any of this outbreak of petty street crimes. Last night as I was 
                preparing myself to retire for the evening, a rather polite knock 
                came to my door. To my surprise, an elderly erudite, as you had 
                described to me when pleading for my assistance with the diary 
                page, appeared at my door asking for the diary page to be returned 
                to him. Immediately, as instinct would have, I dismissed him without 
                the object of his desire and he turned away without another word. 
                When I awoke this morn I found that the page was no longer in 
                my possession, which leads me to think that it has some importance 
                to this man. Never the less, I shall handle the situation on my 
                own, if of course he has not retreated back into Paineel. </p>

              Nature is a druid's ally. Druids are in tune with nature; thus, 
              their magics are nature based, drawing from the spiritual forces 
              of both plants and animals. From calling forth roots to entangle 
              an enemy, to using nature's life giving essence to heal themselves 
              or others, druids are the masters, and servants, of the natural. 
              Druids have a love for all animals, but that does not mean all animals 
              love druids. Although a druid will do what he or she can to avoid 
              harming one of nature's beasts, many animals see a druid as just 
              another source of food. This has no negative reflection on the piety 
              of the druid, mind you, but on the simple minds of beasts. Druids, 
              like shamans, have the capacity for aiding others in many ways, 
              causing both to be desirable members of hunting parties. (The History

              The Champion of the Dwarves and the Defender of Butcherblock's Hammer. 
            <blockquote> 
              <p> <i>The Hammer of Dagnor (Butcherblock Hammer, Dagnor's Fist)</i><br>
                Butcherblock, the first dwarven king, appears before the dwarven 
                rogue Duskan Hammerhand and a dark elven cleric named Teuil N'Mar. 
                In the vision, the hammer is revealed, secreted beneath the murky 
                waters of Dagnor's Cauldron within a barnacle-encrusted tower, 
                and guarded by aqua goblins. Duskan recognizes the holy relic, 
                and immediately makes a foolish attempt to retrieve the hammer 
                alone, desiring the glory of the successful deed solely for himself. 
                He fails, narrowly escaping the aqua goblins with his life.</p>
              <p> Crawling along the shore, barely coherent and near death, Duskan 
                manages to convince a party of passing adventurers to escort him 
                to his King. When Duskan is brought before King Kazon Stormhammer 
                and reveals his story of the vision and his botched raid, the 
                King organizes an expedition for the recovery of the Butcherblock 
                Hammer, known among the dwarves as Dagnor's Fist. Three dwarven 
                champions are chosen to head the effort: Boris Stormhammer, the 
                King's nephew, Kalek Orefinder, and Fenric Ogrebane, son of the 
                legendary Furtog Ogrebane. These three, aided by the adventurers, 
                easily cut down the aqua goblins guarding the hammer. As the goblin 
                Tidal Lord is dying, Phinigel Autropos himself appears. He stymies 
                the dwarves and adventurers, driving them back. Then, as swiftly 
                as he appeared, he disappears. The dwarves and adventurers finish 
                off the last goblin and rescue the hammer.</p>
              <p> As they march victoriously back to Kaladim, a dark elven raiding 
                party ambushes and slaughters them. In the fight, the dark elven 
                wizard perishes, preventing the raiders' return to Neriak. The 
                leader, Valkis D'Vinn, carefully seals the captured relic in an 
                enchanted adamantium chest, and orders his group to march to Crushbone, 
                where another dark elven wizard awaits. Fenric, thought dead but 
                actually feigning, overhears these plans, and immediately seeks 
                help once they leave.</p>
              <p> The dark elven raiding party discovers upon returning to Crushbone 
                that the wizard they sought, Szasi R'Alis, is dead, along with 
                Grak Crushbone, who died defending her. Valkis attempts to bargain 
                with the adventurers who surround them, but is quickly cut down. 
                The sealed Adamant Chest of Thex passes into the possession of 
                the adventurers, who return to Kaladim to deliver the chest to 
                King Kazon. The Dwarven King declares the dwarf in the party of 
                adventurers his champion, and instructs him to return with the 
                key to the chest.</p>
              <p> The adventurers travel to Nektulos and slay Captain Na'Var, 
                holder of the key. The Captain struggles, but is outmatched. The 
                adventurers take the key back to the King, who rewards them with 
                baubles from his treasury. The King then declares the dwarf adventurer 
                who was integral to the success of the mission to be Champion 
                of the Dwarves, and Guardian of Butcherblock's Hammer.</p>

            <p> <b>Dwarf</b><br>
              Dwarves are short but extremely strong (much more so than humans) 
              and dexterous. They appear to be small, burly humans, and are never 
              seen without beards and mustaches. Of course, dwarves do not see 
              their lack of physical height to be a disadvantage. To them, it 
              is just the way it is. Besides, it is just as easy breaking the 
              kneecaps of a larger race and then punching them in the nose.</p>
            <p>Dwarves believe in many different things. Each, always willing 
              to die for that belief. But, one thing all dwarves have a common 
              belief in is a good, strong, ale. It would not be a strange sight 
              to see a dwarf in battle, a weapon in one hand and a frothing mug 
              in the other. Taverns across the lands have specially constructed 
              stools that can take a beating. Their innate infravision allows 
              them to be able to see if a mug is half empty or half full in even 
              the darkest of rooms. For the safety of those around, the mug better 
              be half nothing and always full!</p>
            <p>Dwarves have such a neutral character that even the Teir`Dal will 
              allow them into Neriak, to a point. Of their professions, dwarves 
              may choose to serve their god as clerics, take on the mantles of 
              paladins, harry the enemy as warriors, or pursue the refined arts 
              of the rogue. (The History of Norrath, Verant International)</p>

              <p> <i>Of the forming of Akanon and the Plague Dragon:</i><br>
                Edril had served loyally and skillfully as Carandril's guard for 
                more then a hundred years, the warrior elf being only a little 
                more then middle-aged for his race. Charmed by his determination 
                and skillful speaking, Edril supported Biddyn for a separate gnomish 
                kingdom. But the kingdom was overrun by a deadly dragon&#133;.</p>
              <p> The gnomes were instantly furious that Carandril had given them 
                cursed lands to settle, and the emperor immediately ordered the 
                death of the dragon. Frightened by the terrible story of the soldier, 
                most of his warriors were reluctant to volunteer, as Carandril 
                would not force anyone to fight such a terrible beast. Edril, 
                however, immediately offered his services as a personal favor 
                to the gnomes. When Biddyn himself volunteered five more gnomes 
                joined the hunt, and together with his gnomish friends, Edril 
                rode to the Steamfont Mountains to meet the terrible beast. What 
                happened next is best summed up by Biddyn's own &quot;The History 
                of the Gnomes&quot;: </p>
              <blockquote> 
                <p>&quot;I admit as much, that even my legs were shaking when 
                  we approached the mouth of the demon's great cave. From our 
                  previous encounters, and from the memories of our lost friend 
                  Dolyn, we were all terrified of the beast. All of us, that is, 
                  except for Edril, but I don't think Innoruk himself could scare 
                  that elf. He thrives from fear as much as I do the tobacco in 
                  my pipe, it is to him as some sweet nectar that clears his thoughts 
                  and hones his blade. So while we trembled before the plague 
                  dragon's domain, Edril simply lifted his sword to his shoulder, 
                  looked back at me, and said &quot;wait here.&quot; With a proud 
                  determination he marched toward the black cave entrance, a portal 
                  to the lower planes if ever there was one. He marched to his 
                  death, or so we thought. But when we saw him next in two days 
                  time he pulled behind him the head of the evil beast, which 
                  left thick trails of a green poison behind it. He breathed heavily, 
                  and painful scars covered his body. I laughed, thinking that 
                  while Edril was obviously hurt, the dragon must have felt much 
                  worse before his death. Anything that inflicts that much pain 
                  to the elf must be prepared to receive the same thrashing tenfold.&quot; 
                </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The skull of the dragon sits still on the entrance to the gnome's 
                own Fortress Mechanus. Edril and his band of gnomes would be written 
                into gnomish lore forever as for the next weeks they rode tirelessly 
                through the lands of Akanon, fighting back fierce creatures and 
                charting the perfect hillside location for the first ever kingdom 
                of gnomes. Edril spent much more time in Akanon then originially 
                expected, personally overseeing the kingdom's construction. When 
                the first houses were made and the first gnomish settlers came 
                pouring in, Biddyn was selected as the first king of the gnomes 
                and he in turn erected a statue in honor of Edril. The statue 
                depicts Edril's battle with the great plague dragon, and gnomish 
                craftsmanship made it enormous and actually useful: it sits in 
                the heart of Akanon even today, acting as the central part to 
                Akanon's extensive irrigation system. When Edril returned home 
                to Felwithe he was greeted by hundreds of proud soldiers and again 
                proclaimed a hero.</p>

            <p> <i>The Battle of the Crushbone Orcs</i> 
            <blockquote> The first elf to take interest in Kelethin's request 
              to help overcome the Crushbone orcs under the leadership of Gharol 
              was a young soldier named Edril. Edril had lived his entire life 
              in Felwithe, schooled by the best teachers and raised in a wealthy 
              family. Around his 30th birthday, young by elven standards, he admitted 
              himself into the imperial school of soldiery where he impressed 
              his teachers with both his knowledge of military science and his 
              deadly accurate fighting skills. After graduating and performing 
              many deeds of merit in the imperial army of the elves, he was chosen 
              as a personal guard of the emperor at the unprecedented age of 50. 
              What brought him everlasting fame among the elves, however, was 
              not how he excelled in schooling but what he chose to do for Kelethin. 
              Going straight to the emperor himself, Edril asked that he be allowed 
              to lead the attack against the orcs. When the emperor granted his 
              wish, Edril hand picked 100 of the best elven warriors and the best 
              horses, and rode quickly to the woodland kingdom of Kelethin. 
              <p> He was met at Kelethin with a large reception, but decided to 
                ride through quickly. He was there for only one purpose: to make 
                a name for himself by destroying the orcs. Little more then two 
                days after arriving in the city, Edril and his men rode outside 
                the greater Faydark and headed directly for the first orcan encampment. 
                It was the middle of the night when Edril made his first strike, 
                and the orcs were completely caught off guard. Edril's men rode 
                straight over the orcs, slaughtering every clansmen they saw with 
                little casualties of their own. Edril is said to have fought like 
                a madman, tallying over 20 kills himself. Without even stopping 
                to catch their breath, Edril's soldiers rode for the next camp 
                so as to keep the element of surprise. 
              <p> One by one the camps of the crushbone orcs were destroyed quickly 
                and brutally. The orcs, still preparing for their second assault 
                on Kelethin, were always caught by surprise. Edril and his men 
                moved from one battle to the next so quickly, the elves called 
                them the legion of wind. The strategy worked perfectly: Gharol 
                was never able to get word of the new attackers in time to plan 
                a defense and so most of the orcs were slaughtered. The final 
                battle, lasting longer then the rest, was against Gharol's own 
                camp. Many of Edril's warriors were killed in this fight but all 
                of the orcs, including Gharol, were driven away to the deep growth 
                of the wild Greater Faydark. Here they have made their makeshift 
                kingdom. When Edril returned to his kingdom, he was proclaimed 
                high protector of Kelethin with over 150 kills to his name alone. 
                This would not be the last time Edril's name was written into 
                elven history, however. It is believed that only weeks later after 
                their retreat, Gharol was killed by his own followers.

            <i>Of Carandril's death and Edril's journey to Antonica:</i> 
            <blockquote> 
              <p> At the age of 450, Carandril became deathly ill. The emperor 
                fought death for more then a year before his passing into the

                in the surrounding imperial lands, a hero's send off, and a large 
                amount of gold coins for his retirement wealth. Nobody, however, 
                expected Edril ever to lay his sword to rest. &quot;He has the 
                blood of a hero,&quot; emperor Carandril used to say, &quot;try 
                as you might, you could never keep Edril from the adventure.&quot; 
                Thinking there was nothing left for him in the empire of the elves, 
                Edril gathered what wealth was given to him and set sail for the 
                far-off human lands of Antonica. </p>
              <p> Arriving in the city of Freeport, Edril was recognized as a 
                wealthy elf only. His name was unknown to these western lands, 
                but that quickly changed. Edril became almost instantly renowned 
                in the Freeport area for his fighting prowess, as he helped many 
                of the villages along Lake Neriuss against the raider Zellain 
                and his band of dark elves. His real fame, however, came as a 
                desert fighter. Edril held a chief role in defending an outpost 
                in the Kithicor woods against a large goblin attack, and it was 
                during this battle that Edril became infatuated by the deserts 
                of Antonica. Whether it was because they were so foreign to him 
                or whether he loved the danger, Edril spent most of his remaining 
                time on Antonica wandering it's deserts, from the eastern desert 
                of Ro all the way to the dead hills in the west and the plains 
                of Karana. His most noteworthy exploits in these areas included 
                capturing Ragoth the sand giant and his &quot;dust marauders&quot; 
                in the desert of Ro as well as flushing out an entire nest of 
                frogloks around lake Rathetear. He soon was recognized back in 
                Felwithe as a remarkable cataloguer of strange creatures, as he 
                would write notes about all his adversaries and send them to the 
                imperial library. As he made his way to Qeynos, he even fell in 
                love with an erudite female mage named Almaril and they were wed. 
              </p>
              <p><i>Of Almaril and Zisstrik the insane: </i><br>
                For a time in Qeynos Edril forgot about adventure or Carandril 
                or his home back with the elves. He loved Almaril deeply and she 
                took him back and forth from Erudin to Antonica, teaching him 
                everything he wished to know. He was as much interested in her 
                crude but powerful magic as she was his graceful fighting styles. 
                For the first time in a long time Edril was satisfied and happy, 
                and to the astonishment of all it seemed that the elven warrior 
                would actually settle down in Qeynos with his wife forever. But 
                fate moves unpredictably and Edril was called into service once 
                more. </p>
              <p> An old merchant noble from Freeport, a long time friend of Edril, 
                sent him a letter detailing the problems he was having with a 
                band of local trollish thieves. The thieves, however, were not 
                everyday thugs. Goods from merchant caravans had increasingly 
                been stolen to fund for a splinter trollish army somewhere in 
                the desert of Ro. The army, whom the kingdom of Grobb wanted destroyed 
                very much, was lead by an obnoxious would-be-preacher troll named 
                Zisstrik the insane, who lead his band of trolls on what he called 
                a &quot;religious crusade.&quot; Edril agreed to help with the 
                problem. The troll bandits were easily found and easily dispensed 
                with, but more important was what Edril learned during the hunt. 
                Zisstrik spoke at length, before he was killed, about the troll 
                dragon-god Trakanon and how the dragon told Zisstrik in his dreams 
                to steal and kill the local human merchants who &quot;pollute 
                the desert and the swamps with their presence.&quot; Edril dismissed 
                most of what the troll said as crazy dribble, but he became increasingly 
                interested in the tale of Trakanon. In return for the destruction 
                of the splinter army, Edril only wished in payment that he be 
                allowed to speak with the shamans of Grobb about the great dragon. 
                The trolls, however bitter and tentative, agreed. </p>

            <blockquote> 
              <blockquote> 
                <p> The elven warrior was immediately in love with the story of 
                  the troll heritage. He was fascinated by the idea of dozens 
                  of glorious armies dessimating eachother because of hunger and 
                  confusion, fascinated by the imagery of the far off and blasted 
                  land of Kunark, but even more fascinated by the character of 
                  Trakanon, a powerful being once a god to the trolls and only 
                  seen by a single chief. He immediately thought Trakanon was 
                  evil both for what he did to the trolls and because of what 
                  Edril knew about all dragons. The elf silently vowed to make 
                  the hunt for Trakanon his final and most glorious quest. Utilizing 
                  ancient trollish texts and learning what he could, Edril soon 
                  had plotted a course to and over Kunark. Almaril protested greatly 
                  and called Edril crazy for trying to carry out such a silly 
                  fantasy, but the elf couldn't resist the pull of perhaps the 
                  greatest adventure he would ever have. </p>
                <p> Leaving his wife sobbing behind him on the docksides of Freeport, 
                  Edril set sail for several weeks before arriving at what he 
                  hoped was the lost continent of Kunark. Frightened by the horrible 
                  site of the field of bone before them, the crew of Edril's ship 
                  told the warrior they would remain on the coastline until his 
                  safe return. Packing what he needed for a long and arduous journey, 
                  Edril made his way alone across the dead fields of the ancient 
                  trollish homeland until he arrived at the jagged cliffs of Trakanon's 
                  Teeth. What happened next no one knows for sure, as Edril was 
                  careful not even to divulge it to his wife before his death, 
                  but it is rumored Edril had to escape many clever traps and 
                  fight through several horrendous challenges before reaching 
                  the throne of the great beast. Even then, he did not kill Trakanon 
                  because what the dragon had to tell him was of far greater importance 
                  then any quest. Herein lies the complete text of Trakanon's 
                  prophecy, as Edril himself never forgot the words of the great 
                  beast and later told his wife in order that the whole of Norrath 
                  may read the message.</p>

            <i>Of Edril's last days: </i> 
            <blockquote> When he returned home he was changed forever. With his 
              greatest achievment completed, Edril the warrior, feared of the 
              orcan clans, slayer of the plague dragon of Akanon, first soldier 
              of the empire, and desert wanderer of Norrath, hung his sword to 
              rest forever. He lived many happy years in the arms of Almaril, 
              his wife, and they even gave birth to a son, something no one thought 
              possible between a erudite and elf. But whether it was fate's choice 
              to test Edril one last time or because erudites were enough &quot;non-human&quot; 
              so procreation was near impossible, Edril's son was taken by disease 
              at an early age. The event crushed the indomitable elf and at the 
              age of 405 the warrior passed away. &quot;No spear or sword or arrow, 
              fang, claw, or spell could ever hope of killing the elf known as 
              Edril,&quot; recounted Biddyn at the funeral of his friend, &quot;but 
              for a father, the death of an only child is the worst poison the 
              world can give.&quot; The lord of Qeynos thought it best to send 
              his body back to the elven empire and there gathered a very ecclectic 
              funeral procession: Merchant friends from Freeport and Qeynos, human 
              lords of Antonica, almost the entire gnomish population, and even 
              troll shamans from Grobb to bear witness to the last warrior to 
              ever lay eyes on Trakanon. Some said the dark elves were also present, 
              spying on the funeral from the shadows just to make sure Edril had 
              actually lost the battle with death. Dozens of elven trumpets sounded 
              his passing and his casket was floated over the top of the Elizerain 
              Lake to sink into it's depths forever, an honor normally reserved 
              only for the emperors. It is written that even now, at the bottom 
              of the lake in that same casket, the dragon pendant of Trakanon 
              waits, grasped tightly in Edril's cold, dead fingers. </blockquote>

              <p> <i>Of Caerthiel: </i><br>
                The Dragons had relinquished their hold over Norrath, and what 
                are now known as the elder races, the Elves and the Dwarves, stepped 
                out from under their gargantuan shadow. The Dwarves sprang forth 
                from the earth, to hold dominion over their mountainous kingdoms. 
                The elves took to the primeval forests of Norrath, creating a 
                vast empire that spanned several continents. Ruling from the city 
                of Caerthiel, the Elves lived in peace, under the guidance of 
                Innoruk, the elven god. </p>
              <p> <i>Of the rebellion and the outpost of Wielle: </i><br>
                As the corruption in the empire grew, so did the unrest in many 
                elves hearts. They wanted more and more power for themselves. 
                They grew suspicious of the strength of Innoruk, choosing to destroy 
                his works, and kill his servants. At first they were small in 
                size, and weak in power. But as the years went by the rebels grew 
                in leaps and bounds, using treacherous methods to slander the 
                leaders of the Elven Empire. The first sign of the growing rebellion 
                came at the Elven outpost of Wielle, located where the city of 
                Freeport is today. Wielle was loyal to the empire, and therefore, 
                enemies of the rebels. A rebel army under the captain Paetroen 
                savagely attacked it. The citizens of the outpost were killed. 
              <p> That action shattered centuries of relative peace. Suddenly 
                the Empire had to face a new enemy, a darkness in its mist. The 
                Emperor, Kel'anthinstion, called on all of the citizens of the 
                Empire to fight for the cause of Innoruk. He sent his most trusted 
                advisers, all disciples of Innoruk, to the far reaches of the 
                empire. They were to gather support to fight the rebels and support 
                the unity of the empire. The rebels had sent their own recruiters 
                using underhanded tactics to undermine the populace's faith in 
                their God. The war droned on for countless years. 
              <p> <i>Of the battle of Aerignon and the wild elves: </i><br>
                The war was a stalemate. That changed with the battle of Aerignon, 
                named after the province of the empire where it took place. The 
                loyal forces of the empire thought to catch Paetroen and his rebels 
                unprepared. They attacked him at his home base, just north of 
                Elizerain Lake. Forces were massed and placed under the direct 
                command of the Emperor himself. He was to lead the army of Innoruk 
                to destroy the rebels once and for all. As the army encircled 
                Peatroen's military headquarters, a victory for the blessed forces 
                of Innoruk seemed assured. Out maneuvered and outnumbered, the 
                Rebels could not get enough forces to turn back the impending 
                assault, and escape by any means, was impossible. 
              <p> But the imperial victory was denied that day, as a third player 
                in the war, the wild elves, tipped there hand. The wild elf was 
                a term used by citizens of the empire for the primitive elves 
                the lived beyond the borders of the empire. They had remained 
                neutral throughout the war, but had succumbed to the rebel's promises 
                of victory, and had joined the war on their side. What was supposed 
                to be a day of victory for the Empire turned into its greatest 
                defeat. The emperor himself was killed when an wild elf assassin 
                slipped into his tent and killed him from behind. On that day 
                the Empire was doomed. 
              <p> <i>Of the fall of the imperial city: </i><br>
                The war lasted for several years after the death of the emperor. 
                In desperation, the remaining loyalists sent messengers to the 
                Dwarven Kingdoms for aid against the rebels. They returned, saying 
                the Dwarves were fighting their own war, and would send no help. 
                With the help of new fiendish magic, the Rebels pushed the loyalists 
                back to their capital, Caerthiel, which was in what is now known 
                as the loping planes. Inside, the last of the loyalists huddled 
                in their homes, holding on to the last remnants of their shattered 
                empire. With out a leader to rally them, they were as good as 
                dead. 
              <p> Help came in the form of a priest of Innoruk, who rose up as 
                leader. His name changes with every telling, but the fact remains 
                that in the dark of the night, the day before the final assault 
                on Caerthiel, the priest led the last of the loyalists in to the 
                earth. Through a chasm that was opened and closed by Innoruk himself. 
                When the Rebel army assaulted the city the next day, they found 
                nothing but a ghost town, devoid of any life. 
              <p> <i>Of the elven schism (Dark Elves-High Elves-Forest Elves): 
                </i><br>
                As the loyalists took refuge underground, the rebels thought themselves 
                the winners of the War of the Broken crown. They took on the moniker 
                &quot;High Elves&quot;, while the wild elves became more commonly 
                known as wood elves. Without the loyalists to guide it, the Empire 
                fell apart. The elves that remained on the surface, the high elves, 
                could not stand the symbol of Caerthiel, and in a fit of rage 
                they destroyed it. They created their capital of Felwithe on the 
                very spot where the emperor was murdered, in the battle that destroyed 
                the empire. The loyalists fled east to the wild and uncharted 
                continent of Antonica. There they established the well guarded 
                and underground city of Neriak, where they stayed for many years 
                trying to rebuild their once great empire and all the while plotting 
                for revenge against the rebels who forced them from Faydwer. Having 
                been exposed to decades of low light in their underground kingdom 
                and to harsh conditions, the skin of those elves still loyal to 
                Innoruk has become darker and the elves themselves have been made 
                into warriors guided by the power of their god. They are feared 
                by the denizens of Antonica, who call the loyalists &quot;dark 
                elves.&quot; </p>

              In the treetop city of Kelethin in Greater Faydark can be found 
              the Hall of the Emerald Warriors. Under the direction of Warrior 
              Guildmaster Regren, these warriors support and defend the Kelethin 
              Merchants and the Merchants of Felwithe. They also oppose the Dark 
              Elf Warrior Guild in Neriak called the Indigo Brotherhood.</p>
            <p><b>Enchanter</b><br>
              The primary focus of the enchanter's art can be summed up by the 
              name of the arcane order to which he belongs: Enchanter. Their spells 
              are crafted to enchant people, places, and things. This art allows 
              them to charm beings and make them fight for their new masters, 
              or to magically enhance the capabilities of the enchanters' allies. 
              They also have some skill in offensive spells, but those skills 
              will never match those of a wizard. (The History of Norrath, Verant 
              International)</p>
            <p><b>Erud's Crossing</b><br>
              The name of the zone which the ferry from Qeynos to Erudin passes 
              through, and it marks the path that Erud himself travelled on his 
              way to the island of Odus centuries ago. Erud's Crossing's only 
              feature is an island that marks the halfway point of the trip. This 
              island is home to the cat people, the Kerrans, and other unique 
              island inhabitants. The ocean has its share of undead, killer sharks, 
              and snakes, as well as the odd fire elemental and lost soul abandoned 
              there. </p>
            <p><b>Erudin</b><br>
              The city of the Erudites, on the continent of Odus, founded by Erud. 
              A beautiful city, it houses a large library where much of the knowledge 
              of the world can be found. The Eruidin palace houses the bank and 
              the Magician, Wizard and Enchanter guilds in the city.</p>
            <p><b>Erudite</b><br>
              Being the exact opposite of the barbarian Northmen, the high man 
              prides himself on his intellectual abilities and social graces, 
              to the almost total exclusion of the physical disciplines. They 
              pride themselves on being superior to all other races. Any obstacle 
              can be overcome with intelligence and wisdom. Pick up a sword? Bah, 
              leave that to the lesser, unsophisticated beasts of the land. The 
              only exception is for Erudite paladins and shadowknights.</p>
            <p>Erudites have very few friends outside their own race. Others find 
              them very hard to associate with. Their snooty attitudes and overblown 
              egos can be said to be the main factors in this. But, only a party 
              of ignorant adventurers would turn an Erudite away from joining 
              them, for their high intelligence and facile use of magic come in 
              handy, especially when facing a powerful enemy. Clerics, enchanters, 
              necromancers, and wizards, Erudites excel when magic is needed.</p>
            <p>During the Lost Age, humanity was conquering the land of Norrath, 
              often in a violent and aggressive way. A few leaders spoke out against 
              the violence, urging the masses to remember why they had fled the 
              cold north. Others reminded them of their former glory and the might 
              of the Combine Empire. These leaders insisted that humanity adhere 
              once again to those principals to which all had agreed. Explorers 
              and adventurers returned from afar with tales of elves, dwarves, 
              and other strange creatures, as well as descriptions of ancient 
              abandoned cities. A few even came back with limited knowledge of 
              sorcery and the mystic arts. And when that discontent minority of 
              leaders heard all of this, they became both jealous and determined.</p>
            <p>A small, frail man of great intellect called Erud led this group, 
              and he formed them into a council. They quickly became irritated, 
              even disgusted, by their fellow man. Leaving a small network of 
              spies behind, the remainder of Erud's followers fled the city of 
              Qeynos and boarded a small fleet of ships. They sailed to the west 
              and landed upon the barren coast of the island of Odus. The land 
              was sparse and uninhabited and quite appealing to the council and 
              their people. They quickly built a city of their own, dissimilar 
              in almost every way to both Qeynos and Freeport, for it was almost 
              entirely a towering castle. Erudin it was called, and within it 
              the scribes and scholars, who called themselves High Men, gathered 
              and analyzed reports, captured books and scrolls, and other artifacts 
              brought to them by their spies. The first human mages since the 
              Combine Empire were born - wizards, sorcerers, and enchanters occupied 
              the great halls of Erudin and grew immensely in both power and knowledge. 
              They created schools of thought, categorizing magic into three groups 
              and assigning themselves to three classes: Wizards, Sorcerers, and 
              Enchanters. Thus began the Age of Enlightenment.</p>
            <p>It came to pass some years later that a small group of Erudites 
              discovered the lost art of Necromancy. They were branded heretics 
              and great conflict arose. For the first time in several hundred 
              years, the Erudites fought. They engaged in a civil war not entirely 
              dissimilar to that which they had loathed and fled from back on 
              the mainland. But there was one very significant difference - they 
              did not use swords and bows, but rather magic, and the result was 
              terrible. Lives by the hundreds were lost, great buildings and structures 
              destroyed, and eventually the heretics were forced to flee Erudin, 
              to hide and regroup in the southern regions of Odus. In one final 
              battle, great mystic energies were released and an immense hole 
              leading to unknown depths beneath the earth was created. Into the 
              sides of this chasm the heretics built their own city which they 
              called Paineel. And while both sides still seethed with anger and 
              hatred towards one another, their fear of what the last battle had 
              wrought has kept any further conflict at bay. Thus began the Age 
              of Turmoil. (The History of Norrath, Verant International)
            <p> <b>Estate of Unrest</b><br>
              The Estate of Unrest was once the home of a dwarven noble, in ages 
              past. Following the unholy destruction that created Dagnor's Cauldron 
              and the following takeover of that region by evil creatures, his 
              estate was overrun by the undead, and is now one of the great havens 
              of the unliving in all of Norrath.</p>
            <p><b>Everfrost</b><br>
              Everfrost is a permanently frozen area of frequent snowfalls and 
              constant snow cover. It is the northernmost land of Antonica, and 
              is adjacent to the home of the barbarians, Halas. It is also near 
              the gnoll home of Blackburrow, where all must pass if they want 
              to enter the lands surrounding Qeynos, and Permafrost. </p>
            <p>A frozen river divides this area into eastern and western halves, 
              and ruins of an ancient civilization are scattered throughout the 
              region. The traveler can find all kinds of snow creatures here, 
              including frost goblins, frost giants, bears, spiders, undead, mammoths, 
              wolves, orcs, and gnolls.</p>
            <p><b>Evocation</b><br>
              Another of the several skills related to the art of magic, evocation 
              deals with things that cast a force of energy onto a target.</p>
