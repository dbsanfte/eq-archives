            <p><strong><font size="+1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fan Faire Notes
		  by Kwill </font></strong> </p>
            <p>First of all, I want to thank everyone who was on my Live Quest
              Team for doing such a great job! Our team was Moongazer, Rokq,
              Jassal, Ommelf, Kwill, Schott, Sweet William, Pakse, Seka and Cenddar.
              I think we had a lot of fun!</p>
            <p><strong><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Art in EverQuest</font></strong></p>
            <p>I attended part of the art panel, which was very interesting,
              if a little technical! What you might not know about the art in
              EverQuest is that it is very much dependent on the game engine.
              The game engine is robust, but does have limitations so the artists
              have to be aware of that when they design environments and creatures
              for the game. The art in EQ must respect the engine's limitations
              so the game is still playable. The art and design teams take into
              account what it will be like to play in a zone filled with people,
              and design their creatures accordingly.</p>
            <p>EverQuest artists keep in mind that EQ is a role playing game,
              and not a first person shooter, and so their artwork reflects the
              mood and tone of the game. The process goes from the design document
              to the first sketches. The design document lays out what is important
              in an environment, and the way the characters should look and feel
              in a particular zone or area. Then the lead artist assigns work
              to the art team to make the idea of the zone, creature, or artifact
              come alive. For instance, Dulak was a sleazy pirate port, and the
              artist that drew the conception of what Dulak should look like
              took all those things into account when he first drew out the zone.
              He drew buildings made of driftwood, and floating barrels in the
              water, and even
              dead
              bodies laying around! He wanted to get the feel for what Dulak
              would look like. Once the concept was drawn, then the actual modeling
              could begin.</p>
            <p>There are two teams of artists: environment artists and character
              artists. They work on their own, but together with the art director
              to make a place come alive with a feeling of beauty, horror, or
              whatever the designers think the zone should be. The types of artwork
              needed to make a creature or environment come alive are modeling,
              texture, and animation. All of those jobs are done by different
              people in the art department, using software specifically designed
              to make pencil sketches come alive into a place where we can play.</p>
            <p>The ideas always being with pencil sketches, which are often more
              detailed than can be used with the game engine. Then the sketches
              are fleshed out with color, and the details are finalized after
              they are scanned into the computer. Once the details and colors
              are
              finished,
              then
              the model can be made three dimensional, using software that works
              with polygons to make movement as natural as possible. Again, the
              game engine puts limitations on the amount of detail on a model,
              and the type of movement a model can do. Next time you see an NPC
              in humanoid form, look at the shoulders and how they move. Shoulders,
              we were told, are one of the hardest things to model and make work
              correctly with the game dynamics the team has to work with. Seeing
              how complicated making a sketch into a monster, NPC or PC race
              is was very impressive! I came away with a new appreciation for
              all the work the art department has to put in to make the game
              so immersing and realistic.</p>
            <p><strong><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">EQ2</font></strong></p>
            <p>One of the most well attended panels was the EQ2 panel. Although
              the game is still under development, we were able to see some of
              the environment at the panel presentation, and the graphics are
              quite amazing. Some of the NPCs had been populated in the environment,
              but not all. The level of detail and realism with the new game
              engine for EQ2 makes it a true step above graphically from the
              original EQ.</p>
            <p>Some of the highlights of the discussion included:</p>
            <p>-System requirements will include a base requirement of DirectX
              9. There is an all new graphics engine. They are designing environments
              to get decent frame rates no matter how many people are in a zone.
              There is a dedicated pathing engineer working on pathing issues
              for the
              game.</p>            <p>- EQ2 is not meant to replace EverQuest. EverQuest will remain
              more guild oriented, and EQ2 will be geared more toward smaller
              groups and raids. The maximum raid at this time is 24 people in
              EQ2, with content for lower levels and groups of six. The idea
              is to have two games that are similar, but not to take players
              away from EverQuest to play EverQuest2.</p>
              <p>- There will be facial customization but no body customization.
                Racial archetypes will remain, and artisans can be both good
                and evil. Race will be a &quot;flavor&quot;; archetypes will be the most
                important attribute of a character. Religion will also be important,
                but in a different way than EQ. The religion will be more &quot;new
                agey&quot; -- most of the gods are not around and have been silent,
                according to the designers, so this will lend a different feel
                to religion in EQ2.</p>            
              <p>-EQ2 will support ways to find solo play as well as ways to
                find groups. There will be adventures from a starting city for
                even
              one or two people. </p>
              <p>-Quests will be meaningful and there will be in-game quests
                than can be completed in a short amount of time by groups.</p>            <p>-There will be no in-game maps at release. Exploration is a key
              element here, and player made maps will be encouraged.</p>            
            <p>-Instance play, which has been successfully integrated in Lost
              Dungeons of Norrath, will be a part of EQ2. Instances will be integrated
              into the game play. Ships on the oceans in EQ will not just be
              for transportation -- instant technology
              will be used and adventuring will be offered on sea-going voyages.</p>
            <p>-Weapon decay will be in the game, possibly as part of the death
              penalty. This was not clearly explained, and we will have to see
              how this feature ends up.</p>
            <p>-Trade skills will be an important part of the game. Trade skill
              items will include the ability to make artifacts for the player
              houses.</p>
            <p>-Loot distribution will be such that you can't monopolize
                the economy.</p>            <p>-Player housing will be customizable. Players can purchase floor
              plans, and customize floors, walls, trim, and more. There will
              be storage space and the ability to put player made artifacts
              into a player home.</p>
            <p>-There will be no centrally located bazaar. Any merchant can offer
              wares, sort of like &quot;catalogue shopping.&quot;</p>
            <p>- Teleport spires will be used to travel around the world. No
              mounts are planned for release.</p>
            <p><strong><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Lost Dungeons of Norrath Panel</font></strong></p>
            <p>The LDoN panel was a question and answer session. The LDoN team
              was open to listening to questions and concerns from the audience.
              They are working on the bugs that exist in the expansion, of which
              there are a few, but because the instance technology has worked
              so well, this kind of thing will be implemented in the future for
              EQ. Highlights included no change in the level range for players
              in adventures (too hard for the software to make an equitable adventure
              for a huge level gap in players); no change in the leaderboard
              lists (people complained it caused hurt
              feelings
              for
              people who
              could
              not get
              groups if
              they were not on it -- the team indicated that although it seemed
              elitist, in fact most people were getting groups as there were
               more than 100 people in adventures at any given time on a server);
              no solo adventures are forthcoming; and there will be no choices
              in adventures, you have to decline and re-request. Why does it
              take so long to get a new request? Because when you request an
              adventure, the server actually creates one for you on the spot.
              When you decline, it has to be destroyed and a new one created.
              So they
              put in a
              time gap so this system could work efficiently.</p>

            <p>Scott Hartsman, lead Technical Director, was so personable, open
              to listening to player concerns, and informed, that I was quite
              impressed. The game has gotten so big and so complicated that it
              is difficult for any one team member to know all the problems,
              and so they rely on player reporting of bugs to let them know when
              things aren't working (/bug). They are working on balancing the
              melee classes, and they feel this will take care of many individual
              problems in the game. Casters, you are done for the moment. They
              also know about pathing and graphics issues, and will be working
              on
              fixing
              some
              of the
              strange
              things
              that happen because of these (for instance, a shaman in bear form
              will show up with the hanging lip graphic if they are wearing anything
              but a leather hat). Now that LDoN has been released, they can concentrate
              on fixing many of the little things that people have been telling
              them about. And the funniest moment came when someone asked why
              helmets never show up. It's not a bug -- the hat designer doesn't
              like helmets! Scott and the team got a good laugh out of that,
              joking that it was an issue for a therapist!</p>
