              Sep 8 2002 1:24AM - Cursed Breaks Anavons First Kill Curse! Blackbadger 
              <br>
              We had to get payback for the 70%ofraidLDandstuckoutofserver3hoursTM 
              trick he pulled on us last time around, so we knocked down glyhp/exiled 
              and got ready for cursed. We lined up our assling MT and cursed 
              went down like a brick (a slow one though). 
            <p>well done Uros for not dying to cursed + the 5 people with crap 
              DR who got charmed every 2mins (you know who you are, although i 
              think some of you were clicking off resist buffs in an attempt to 
              kill our assling ;/ ) </p>
            <p>when we knelt down to check the corpse, we noticed something wrong... 
              we had killed a new mob and it hadn't dropped it's worst items for 
              us! Could the first kill curse be lifted? </p>

            <p>plus a couple of rings not worth posting. </p>
            <p>After that Deacis wanted tormax faction, so forced us to kill Dain 
              for him (silly shaman went from ally tormax to ally yelinak and 
              now wants to go back ;/) </p>
            <p>Also killed rage a couple of times in there somewhere today. </p>
            <p>Yesterday wasn't so eventful, although it was patch day, the &quot;random&quot;(read: 
              f euros) spawn timers blessed us with Tormax and Rhag1 as only spawns 
              yesterday after 8 hours of server being up, and even rhag spawn 
              was broke/bugged/changed, but guess today made up for it. <br>
              Sep 6 2002 1:28AM - Anavon and the First Kill Curse Regor <br>
              So, there we are in Ssra.. </p>
            <p>We've killed rhag 1, rhag 2. Had a go on Arch Lich, and didnt do 
              so well, 30% health or something before calling it. All buffed, 
              ready to go for a 2nd attempt, have tweaked strategy a bit, we have 
              1 less LD Cleric, when some little birdie tells us Statue has spawned... 
            </p>
            <p>Now, this means we up on rotation for Avatar </p>
            <p>Heartbreaking to leave Arch Lich there, all alone.. Not even a 
              ranger to beat on.. <br>
              But, thems the breaks.. we had a score to settle, and AoW was gonna 
              bear the brunt of one seriously kill hungry Anavon rabble. </p>
            <p>Not such a rabble though. <br>
              Vindi ... who ? grats Hador on BP <br>
              Statue and a couple of Armours to keep it fun.. grats Toraan on 
              BP, Shiftyeye on Cloak <br>
              Idol... hmm.. no one tell Blackbadger to turn off ICQ ? <br>
              Avatar of War vs 66 Anavon ? </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>only 4 deaths, 1 of them being our first MT <br>
              Grats Dirkin on Mask, Darkfan and Torut on Rings </p>
            <p>Tormax decided to show his head after that lot.. we promptly cut 
              it off for him, and gave it to Mezzior. </p>
            <p>Now, lets just talk about the drops. <br>
              First kills, Anavon, and Drops just dont go together <br>
              3 drops on first AoW kill ? wtf ? </p>
            <p>its the first kill Anavon curse I tell you... <br>

            <p>I don't usually get up on my Soapbox here at Cohort... but on the 
              rare occasions that I do, there's usually a reason behind it. In 
              this case, it seems that a cold front moved through hell... I figured 
              that it might be of interest to a broad range of people.</p>
            <p>This is not just some propeganda piece I'm throwing out... it's 
              straight from Microsoft.</p>
            <p>I'd like to point out some alternative OS's:</p>
            <p>Gentoo<br>
              Red Hat</p>
            <p>There are a number of others... and each one will give you far 
              more security and immunity to viruses than Windows will. Read the 
              short article. If you need outside verification that this is an 
              actual admission from Microsoft, I'm sure Google will have a plethroa 
              of additional information.</p>
            <p>Microsoft: &quot;Our products aren't engineered for security&quot;</p>
            <p>Friday 6 September 2002<br>
              Brian Valentine, senior vice-president in charge of Microsoft's 
              Windows development, has made a grim admission to the Microsoft 
              Windows Server .net developer conference in Seattle, USA.</p>
            <p>&quot;I'm not proud,&quot; he told delegates yesterday (5 September). 
              &quot;We really haven't done everything we could to protect our 
              customers. Our products just aren't engineered for security,&quot; 
              admitted Valentine, who since 1998 has headed Microsoft's Windows 
              division.</p>
            <p>In August the company put out eight security bulletins. This month 
              it has released two, so far, with the latest urging users to patch 
              a flaw in its digital certificate technology that could allow attackers 
              to steal a user's credit card details.</p>
            <p>Microsoft's regular stream of security bulletins has continued 
              despite Bill Gates company-wide Trustworthy Computing Initiative, 
              announced earlier this year.</p>
            <p>The Initiative was launched with a memo from Bill Gates, Microsoft's 
              chairman and chief software architect, and saw the company halt 
              production on new code in all of its products while employees scanned 
              every line of existing code in search of vulnerabilities.</p>
            <p>&quot;We realised that we couldn't continue with the way we were 
              building software and expect to deliver secure products,&quot; Valentine 
              said.</p>
            <p>But the company is dealing with a problem that is not easily resolved. 
              Valentine told developers at the conference that as the company 
              works to shore up its products the security dilemma will evolve 
              as hackers become more sophisticated.</p>
            <p>&quot;It's impossible to solve the problem completely,&quot; Valentine 
              said. &quot;As we solve these problems there are hackers who are 
              going to come up with new ones. There's no end to this.&quot;</p>
            <p>Microsoft has also been employing new tools developed by Microsoft 
              Research that are designed to detect errors in code during the development 
              process, Valentine said.</p>
            <p>According to Chandra Mugunda, a software consultant with Dell who 
              attended Valentine's presentation, buggy software is &quot;an industry-wide 
              problem, not just a Microsoft problem. But they're the leaders, 
              and they should take the lead to solve them,&quot; he said. <br>

            <p>Congrats to Raggnor on completing his epic shammy spear. It was 
              a total guild effort that was actually decided on the heals of a 
              ranger heheheh. Was not a text book take down but hey we took him 
              down none the less.</p>
            <p>Dropped Phinny late last week. Went there to snagged the corrupted 
              seahorse and he was up. YMM needed the wizard piece so we hooked 
              up to take him out. Overkill actually but still fun to slap around 
              a noted mob.</p>
            <p>Dropped Velkator this past week with the combination of YMM and 
              BDA peeps. Took a few tries but we got it together after a quick 
              huddle session and some adjustments. Xmortis is sporting a new bracer 
              now.</p>
            <p>Hats off to Sacrelig for completing the Helm of the Tracker quest.</p>
            <p>Zalidar and Somnus both finished off the Thurg gloves quest. Swadi 
              landed a pair of Thurg boots.</p>
            <p>Recent outtings have been down to the Chardok Royals area. City 
              of Mist, Cazic Thule, went dragon hunting in Western Waste, some 
              Effretti lord action and SSRA.</p>
            <p>Grats to Ouza on her new ring, Somnus on his new shield and Gebs,

            <p>Gone huntin' - Stormhaven (9/9/2002 9:57 AM) <br>
              <br>
              So what do you do to relax after you've killed the Emperor for the 
              first time? Well, I don't know about everyone else, but we go huntin'!</p>
            <p>Our friends at Verant were nice enough to reset Ssra again (and 
              again, and again) so when our trackers sniffed around they found 
              <br>
              evidence that the Cursed, High Priest, Arch Lich, and even that 
              pesky Creator were all stalking around the temple. It was a full 
              night and phat loots for all. Since I know how much you guys like 
              pictures, I made sure to take a couple.</p>
            <p>Enjoy!<p>
              Today we celebrate - Stormhaven (9/7/2002 8:57 AM) <br>
            </p>
            <p>The day started out as normal...</p>
            <p>But we knew we had some things to take care of tonight....</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Friday, September 6th, 2002 - Emperor Ssraeshza dies to the combined 
              forces of the Element of Darkness and Schism.</p>
            <p>The fight was not clean by any means, and there are definite areas 
              for improvement that we will be looking at for when we again face 
              the Emperor. However, that's a discussion for another day and another 
              time.</p>
            <p>Today the guild celebrates.</p>
            <p>Exactly two months from this day, our guild parted ways with our 
              former allies, The Relentless. There were many doubts placed upon 
              both guilds - expectations and dire predictions of which guild would 
              be the first to &quot;fall apart.&quot; When The Relentless struck 
              first by killing the Emperor with their new allies Anavon, many 
              thought that EoD would soon fall apart; our membership scattered 
              to the four winds.</p>
            <p>We did not.</p>
            <p>The road was a hard one and for most it felt like a step backwards. 
              <br>
              For all intents and purposes it was.</p>
            <p>Tonight however, all doubts were removed.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Two Guilds<br>
              One Tank<br>
              One Attempt<br>
              One 30+ minute fight<br>
              One dead snake<br>
              40 New keys to Vex Thal</p>
            <p>Determination Breeds Success<br>
              <br>
              ....huh? - Stormhaven (9/6/2002 6:23 AM) <br>
              <br>
              So I was all set to jump into another general chorus of &quot;Arky, 
              Arky&quot; since we killed the Arch Lich today. Unfortunately I'm 
              a big message board junky - I spend way too much of my day surfing, 
              trolling, and replying to these rather addictive forums. Needless 
              to say, the most recent set of patches has everyone either threatening 
              to cancel their EQ accounts, pissed off as hell, or just generally 
              confused overall.</p>
            <p>Well long story short, one particular item caught my attention 
              and pretty much ended my want to create a humorous news article 
              for the day. It was a cross-posted link to this message<br>
              **edit**<br>
              Notice how Rauk got rid of ugly url in Storms news post, pretty 
              much best HTML scriptor this guild has ever seen.</p>
            <p>*edit* <br>
              Well, it seems the masses crying out actually got a pretty good 
              response from VI. After reading the patch message for today (9/6) 
              it looks like they've put many of the old exp values back into place. 
              Now there's this phantom promise of &quot;We're confident that you're 
              going to find that the additional risk pays off *extremely* well.&quot; 
              I guess the next few days will see what this entails. </p>
            <p>Anyhow, we killed the Arch Lich and the High Priest tonight. The 
              late crew went over to Sleepers to pick up a piece of Primal as 
              well. Congrats to all that got loot.</p>

              -Hole, Venril Sathir, Hate- <br>
              Verant is out to get me! Okay, guess that needs a little backstory 
              first: Old roomate stole my 60 enchanter and sold it. I try to get 
              it back, they ban it for being sold. So after 6 months of emailing 
              Verant and getting no where, I file a complaint with Better Business 
              Bureau, and within like 4 days they give me the account back. But 
              now...they are seeking retribution, they will stop at nothing to 
              keep my ranger from getting his epic! </p>
            <p>So I run into Karnor's, and what do you know, Venril Sathir's remains 
              on track. Gather up the guild and we move in. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>So I'm standing there, firefly globe in my hand about to turn it 
              in so we can start the fight, and *poof*. VSR is gone. We're all 
              like WTF, and I was like yeah, and they were like WTF again, and 
              I said I dunno, and then they said WTF again, and I slapped them. 
              Check tracking, find this guy on track. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>While we had enough for the remains, we don't however have enough 
              for this guy at the time. So we try him a couple of times without 
              enough chain runes to go around and get smacked around a bit. No 
              biggie, we know we can beat him now though. But I had been screwed 
              out of my epic piece! I now have to summon another summonable firefly 
              globe! Can you believe that crap? I mean talk about ruining my epic! 
            </p>
            <p>After Venril Sathir, we decide to head to the Hole to go down and 
              beat up on poor old Jaeil the Insane. Path of Valor joins us, as 
              we're gonna get their Shaman his epic piece as well. We work our 
              way on down, everything going fine. Massive slaughter as we're clearing 
              it faster than I've ever seen it done. Just as we're getting close 
              to him, here comes 10 mobs charging into the camp. Now I was a bit 
              further back leading someone to catch up, so I watch them all charge 
              into camp. They don't agro on anyone in particular, just anyone 
              and everyone. So I know right then that the GM's are back for me! 
              And I shout to the zone &quot;You can't hold me down forever!&quot; 
              And no one responded cause well, ya know that would give away their 
              evil plan. Anyway, that little random agro from behind us, led to 
              this. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Couple of hours of gay Halfling corpse pulling is enough fun to 
              make the world go round. We got them all out rather quickly though, 
              thanks to me and Sithray for being super cool and doing that. They 
              went and made sweet sweet Halfling love after that, let me tell 
              you. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Hate time! We're not really knowing what to expect, since the GM's 
              were after me and I'm all paranoid. We weren't really after epic 
              pieces, just getting random loots so we can justify being loot whores. 
              A GM zoned in but we saw him before he could hide himself and ruined 
              his dastardly plan. We were the only people there, so really no 
              reason for him to be there except to try to screw me! I know the 
              plan! I will defeat them! Or I'll just never get my epic, whichever 
              is easier, I'm lazy like that. </p>
            <p>Hate went really well though, we cleared the majority of the first 
              floor in just a couple of hours with 8-10 people. MQ had the night 
              off, so Rot stepped up to take their place as the biggest loot whore. 
              Rot got 2 Iksar Warrior Breastplates, an Iksar shaman cloak, Cleric 
              boots, gaunts, and helm, Paladin legs, and a couple of other things. 
              Grats to Rot. Also Alefia got a Trueheart shield, Klopo got Indo 
              BP and Legs, Dorry got EM legs, Bururururururmen got magician legs, 
              Brigug got a shaman breastplate, I got a Silver Blade of Rot, even 
              though Rot was complaining about it. </p>
            <p>I completely lost track on the Death Fest, so I hope you guys weren't 
              hoping for a big huge payoff to it. But I have something even better! 
              Juggernauts coming out of the closet! </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Applaud these brave souls in facing their true identity with pride 
              and lots of rainbows. </p>

              Day 170 - My Ulcer just formed</p>
            <p>I won't bore you with the details .. suffice it to say, you couldn't 
              write drama that unfolded last night. Nothing like staring at the 
              ceiling of your apartment in deep thought for an hour. Anyway, the 
              future awaits, and I will continue to write funny stories and silly 
              images to the end of my days. (and yes I'm fully aware that its 
              been image light these past days, but I guess I'm in a bit of artists 
              block).</p>
            <p>Because its still relevant to last night, as I'm sure if I didn't 
              work today I'd have found a bottle somewhere :( .. Rum Rum Rum, 
              by Scrotcho.</p>

              <br>
              Day 168 and 169 - Sha-Zamm!</p>
            <p>First Up - Glyphed and Exiled (non euroized woot) then Cursed. 
              *shows off shiney new claw* Anyway, great and unbelievable fight 
              since a new Verant Interactive buff to the zone was the &quot;Lag 
              of Ssraeahza&quot; which caused a 2 to 3 second time lapse in everything 
              that was being done that day. Well, we pulled through and got the 
              win.</p>
            <p>Then it was on to the High Priest and the Creator, again with the 
              new &quot;Lag&quot; Buff to the zone these fights were different, 
              but we pulled through anyway. I played an enchanter for the HP fight 
              and I have a new found respect for them :) Though I just go back 
              to Ranger town and forget all about them! ke!</p>
            <p>Final fight of the night was the Arch Lich, a nice capper to the 
              evening and every snake but Rhag 1 and 2 and Blood and Emp (killed 
              earlier in the day) fall. Cheers to the loot takers and Boo urns 
              to the snakes.</p>
            <p>And because I'm so god dammed lazy today, I don't want to make 
              up a bunch of dead snake images, so I present to you, by our very 
              own Scrotcho the great gnome magician, the folowing : </p>

              <br>
              Day 167 - Timber</p>
            <p>I have no fancy images, no funny comments, basically due to me 
              being home and I'd have to turn on my laptop, fire up Photoshop, 
              then transfer all the files over here, blah blah blah and its a 
              weekend and work is the last thing on my mind. So I'll try to describe 
              the previous night in words. Then on Monday, I'll make up a picture 
              because no one can understand what I talk about anyway ;)</p>
            <p>166 Days ago, we formed the guild in the attempt to reach the end 
              game, and up to this point the end game was killing the Emperor 
              in Ssra and going to Vex Thal and clearing that out. Well, last 
              night we took the first leap after making lots of little steps towards 
              that goal. The Emperor is dead by the combined forces of Schism 
              and Element of Darkness.</p>
            <p>I thought the fight leading up and then the emp fight itself was 
              very exciting and everytime you step into that room, you think every 
              fight is going to be an epic one, as it is a very nicely designed 
              room, stylized for the final battle. Now we push on with VT Key 
              camp and also return to the big show a few more times to finish 
              out the rifts and of course all that yummy emperor loot ;)</p>
            <p>As for who got what, well on our end Privar the super wizard cleaned 
              up with the KEI robe and Garrisons so he's now forbidden from all 
              loot until the next blue moon ;) Rognar also picked up a Blood earring. 
              And myself and 9 others got a rift too. We'll be back for more and 
              a big Congrats go out to the 2nd alliance to kill the big man snake 
              on the server.<p>

              Day 166</p>
            <p>Killed the Arch Lich and High Priest in Ssra last night, I don't 
              have any fancy images yet because how many times can you show pictures 
              of the same dead snakes over and over again. Now hopefully tonight 
              I can write a late night update showing a relaly nice dead snake 
              but we'll see on that.</p>

            <p>Sunday, September 8th, 2002 - 2 Days, 2 Guilds, 2 Emporers, 1 Result 
              <br>
              Posted by: [Kyrthor] on September 8th, 2002 @ 06:53 PM<br>
              There he is, take a good look.</p>
            <p>That is the body of the 'non-gimped' emporer. VI pooched the patch 
              this week and made him way easier to kill than he should have been. 
              So, amid the screaming cries of all the guilds that had entered 
              Vex Thal across the game, they took the zone down last night and 
              fixed their mistake. Fixed it fairly well, too.</p>
            <p>Of course, that left pansy snake up for us this morning and we 
              just couldn't let that go by. So again, we got up earlier than human 
              beins should on a Sunday morning and went and paid a visit. Again 
              we had 70 folks, and again it was overkill, for which we feel a 
              bit guilty. But as I said before, how you gonna tell someone they 
              can't go? So we went and made a party of it.</p>
            <p>To correct for their previous errors, VI gave the emporer a nice 
              new flurry lag attack that chased others out of the zone, but we 
              weren't havin it. We took the emporer, continuous lag spikes and 
              all. Another proud moment, now on to some more....<br>
            </p>
            <p> Saturday, September 7th, 2002 - Ooga Chaka Ooga Ooga Ooga Chaka.... 
              <br>
              Posted by: [Kyrthor] on September 7th, 2002 @ 10:20 PM</p>
            <p>Told you, pansy snake. Said we were comin back for you and we did. 
              And OH, how we did.<br>
              We called the troops in for an early morning visit with our friend. 
              We stepped in with 70 folks. We felt guilty, because it was very 
              clear to us that 70 was overkill, but when someone gets up earlier 
              than any human should on a Saturday, who is gonna tell them they 
              can't go? So, guilt aside for now, we stepped in to have some fun.</p>
            <p>Blood tried to stop us, we punked him.</p>
            <p>Eight pansy snake fan-boys tried to stop us, we punked them.</p>
            <p>Emporer got tired and tried to do the job himself and we punked 
              him LARGE.<p>
              This was the moment that we all worked hard to get to. It was exciting 
              and exhausting and a complete joy to be part of. Not quite a flawless 
              kill, I think we lost 4 folks during the fight, but certainly a 
              performance to take pride in. I won't call it a 'crowning achievement', 
              cuz the crowning achievement for us will be when the test server 
              changes removing the 70% slow go in and we still punk him....but 
              damn, that was a blast. It was another day that made me happy as 
              hell to be with the best group of folks on the server.</p>
            <p>And for a little bit of news from yesterday (ok, not quite so little 
              for us), we put the beat on Shie.<p>
              With Shie and Emp down, that leaves us Seru and Vex Thal as the 
              only targets left to clear the expansion. Can't wait to get to work!<br>
