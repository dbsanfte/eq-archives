              Monday we started the killing off with Talendor. He started our 
              week off on a high note, dropping a Cloak of Flames. Grats Feller 
              on the CoF, Kiram on the passdown RBG.</p>
            <p>Later Zelthinak felt the sting of a BG rally as well. Grats Beaorn 
              on 15sta bracer and grats Heartilly on a nice neck piece, ancient 
              medalion of faith (10ac, 10wis, 3 other stats, 15hp, 30mana, 5 all 
              resists).<br>

              Hive mind &gt; Tunare <br>
              Posted by: Druss on Sunday, May 12th, 2002 <br>
            </p>
            <p>Killed Tunare again tonight. Pretty much our best fight against 
              her ever. <br>
              I&#146;ve got a special treat for all you &#147;True Believers&#148; 
              tonight, though. </p>
            <p>Rather than bore you with the same old pictures of the dead high 
              elf, and the victorious people all around her corpse, we&#146;ve 
              got something differentl. We have screenshots from the hive mind 
              itself, and what it saw during the fight. Check it out! </p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Tunare dropped two Golden Leaf earrings (congrats Serenity and 
              Abominis of CC), and a Essence of Nature and Petrified Heartwood 
              thorn (congrats Mildaan and Camel of Talons). </p>
            <p>After that, we paid a little visit to Yelinak in Skyshrine. Congrats 
              to Allar on Yelinaks head, Draggin on his Mask of the Dragon slayer, 
              Talons on their Sleepers Key, and Dragon&#146;s blood earring, and 
              special congratulations go out to the Gods of Rot, who received 
              2, yes, 2 outrider taming whips. Most valuable of all, was the knowledge 
              we gained from this fight &#150; we learned, that summoned arrows 
              are in fact &gt; Bioluminescent orbs. </p>
            <p>Following that, the Dain was up. Shortly thereafter, the Dain was 
              down. Congrats Kulraith of CC on the Frostreavers Embroidered cloak, 
              and a ring of the winter, and congrats to Talons on their Dain head, 
              and Crown.<p>
              Patches and Snakes... <br>
              <br>
              Posted by: Druss on Saturday, May 11th, 2002<br>
            </p>
            <p>So, because we all haven't seen enough of the zone lately, we decided 
              to kill something other than Commanders post patch. </p>
            <p>On Thursday - we killed the Glyphed, Exiled, and took a shot at 
              the Cursed. I think we might have actually moved his HP bar, but 
              hell, it was a learning exp. Killed Rhag 2, as well /yawn. </p>
            <p>So...with another patch on Friday, we returned to Ssra, and killed 
              the Glyphed and the Exiled (in what could quite possibly be the 
              sloppies kill I've ever seen on that mob...blah). Took another shot 
              at the cursed, refining our strategy somewhat, and got him down 
              to 45%. Next time, he dies. After wrapping up in the basement, we 
              moved up and smacked down the Creator. The increased spawn rate 
              of his guards make it a fun fight - the adds actually killed 3 of 
              us during that fight, but he's still pretty damned trivial now. 
            </p>
            <p>Loot? Well, CC broke a longstanding tradition and actually got 
              our Casters some loot. In fact, thats pretty much all the mobs dropped 
              the last two days. </p>
            <p>Kenji, our fearless GM, picked up a copy of Speed of the Brood, 
              and the newly upgraded Memory. Sehria picked up a copy of &quot;Mask 
              of the Hunter&quot; and a Geomantic Focus Crystal. Uzir picked up 
              the new shawl from the Glyphed. Brendayan picked up the newly revised 
              and Uber &quot;Willful dirk of domination&quot; (Thanks VI, for 
              actually fixing some of this loot). Murf received a &quot;Headband 
              of Many visions&quot;. Tikana got some shiny new Golem greaves. 
              Boanerges received a Hammer of the Sun (again, updated, and soon 
              to be re-updated). </p>
            <p>Our Allies in Talons picked up a pretty neat new bow from the Glyphed, 
              a Serpent tooth choker, a headband of many visions, a Hammer of 
              the Sun, a Geomantic Focus Crystal, a Rei's Battleworn Dirk, Gloves 
              of Control, a Jade Skull Ring, a Black talisman, and probably some 
              other things I'm forgetting. </p>
            <p>I'm crossing my fingers for more patches. The more VI patches, 
              the less time we spend farming keys. GO PATCHES GO!<br>
              <br>
              What do you know, that CH tip worked again! <br>

            <p>Patch day meant another break in the tedium of the ssra key camping...shhh, 
              don't tell Kenji we have another patch tomorrow! </p>
            <p>Our turn for AoW...missed the last one, made it to this one and 
              let me tell you, there's so much satisfaction in seeing: </p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Grats to Dinuvian on the War Bow of Rallos Zek, Parr on the Helmet 
              of Rallos Zek, Saze on the Flayed Barbarian Skin Leggings and Ulthumbra 
              on the Blade of Carnage. </p>
            <p>Cleared out the big 3 in Sleeper's too, got a Primal Claidmore, 
              Primal Hammer and Primal Warsword. </p>
            <p>IV died later on too, kinda anticlimatic after that whole AoW thing 
              though.<p>
              I can't believe its not butter..err...Ssra keys <br>

            <p>Yes, we've still been camping keys. Yes, it still sucks. Yes, the 
              slavedriver GM occasionally calls a recess from the Shissar Temple, 
              allowing us to wreak small bits of havoc on the mobs of Norrath.

            <p>The project this week? Tunare, who generously put out a Girdle 
              of Living Thorns and a Massive Heartworn Thorn, for our allies, 
              the Talons. Congratulations are in order for CC's Asstoy...err, 
              Allroy Bustardo, who received a Petrified Heartwood Flamberge and 
              Shaofung, on his new Fist of Nature. Also - both Brendayan and Saje 
              picked up Necro robes. Congrats, guys! </p>
            <p>There's another update in the pipeline, after today's patch. Stay 
              tuned!<p>

            <p>Dropped King T on the 4th. Congrats Flareon and Vanelar on their 
              rings of lightning, Talons on their head (Congrats on the Ever-so-L337 
              Clawed Griffon Sword, or whatever caster crap that might be made 
              into) Bracer of lightning, and Axe of the Kromzek Kings. </p>
            <p>Truth be told, its a pleasure when we get the chance to knock down 
              mobs like old king T. Not for the loot, though of course thats nice. 
              More because it gets the guild the hell out of SSRA and away from 
              the tedium known as &quot;Commander Camping&quot;. Pretty soon, 
              I'm gonna get a wild hair, and start doing daily news updates about 
              key camping. They'll all look pretty much like this: </p>
            <p>5/5 - Camped keys all day. 120 ppl in ssra. Fought with other guilds 
              over commander spawns. </p>
            <p>5/6 - Camped keys all day. 120 ppl in ssra. Fought with other guilds 
              over commander spawns. </p>
            <p>5/7 - Camped keys all day. 120 ppl in ssra. Fought with other guilds 
              over commander spawns. </p>
            <p>And so on... </p>
            <p>The real question here is...how many days could I do that before 
              Mirax and Flare had simultaneous conniption fits...Ah well, I'll 
              try and stick to things remotely interesting...like...other key 
              quests!!! </p>
            <p>What else gets us away from key camping? Why, a 4 AM trip to Acrylia 
              at 4AM in the morning to free the stupid cat from his Richard-Greico-look-alike 
              captors, the Grimlings. Honestly, the Acrylia key is probably the 
              most &quot;fun&quot; of the Luclin keys to do, as it actually has 
              a storyline to it, beyond VI's usually formula of &quot;Kill ubermob 
              on a 7 day spawn, and loot key&quot; (well, maybe not beyond that, 
              more like it has a story AND a 7 day bottleneck, so you have something 
              to think about while you wait for the mob to spawn). Its a shame 
              that with the emperor being the only Luclin key quest that leads 
              to Vex Thal, that more than likely noone is going to bother with 
              Acrylia until well after PoP.<br>

              Posted by Grasnalg On May 12 2002<br>
              We headed back into the Halls of Testing and spent a LOT of time 
              there tonight. Drops were about as rare as Rut's correctly spelled 
              words and Tog's good humor, but by the end of the night, we came 
              out with a short list of new SS quest armor pieces for some of our 
              lucky members. 
            <p> </p>
            <p> The items and their winners are:</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Madix - Warrior Greaves(Wow)<br>
              Meff - Cleric Vambraces(passed to him by Madix, nice move Mad)<br>
              Devraider - Druid boots, gloves and hat(try leaving some for the 
              rest of us next time, punk)<br>
              Grasnalg(Me!!) - Warrior gaunts(and most well deserved for his good 
              looks and awesome personality)<br>
              Grayfox - Rogue boots(only took us 29 minutes and 59 seconds to 
              convince him to loot them) <br>
              Draconal - Chanter sleeves, legs, and gloves(refer to Devraider 
              comment)<br>
              Barbed - Warrior greaves and boots(Did anyone save a pair for Bladestrike?)<br>
              Tarish - Rogue sleeves(transvestite style, but you're still hot)<br>
              Also came out of HoT with 3 new symbols for the guild bank:</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>White symbol</p>
            <p>Ruby symbol </p>
            <p>and </p>
            <p>Runed symbol</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Nice showing and very few deaths. Slow loot day, but loads of fun.

              Second day of Fear went great with a near perfect clearing and Grisnalg 
              finally getting an SK BP,(lol) Khaymus getting the Broken Golem 
              and finishing his wizard epic.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Afterward, Schism and Unseen Hand zoned in near the end and rather 
              than contesting the spawn, all 3 of us joined in and killed CAZIC 
              THULE himself, getting the big paladin himself, Mareck, the Fearsome 
              Pauldrons..(20ac and stats).. Grats to Aaneck on Shissar spawn. 
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A recap of last 2 days shows Sterling getting paladin BP, Grisnalg 
              getting Shadowknight BP, Ellesdil getting Druid BP, Draconal getting 
              Chanter robe, Khaymus getting wizard epic, Aaneck getting Chanter 
              epic piece, Mareck getting Phat CT shoulders. Grats to all on miscellaneous 
              stuff.<br>

              Raid on Grieg's End this evening. Fought our way in and managed 
              to obtain the key to rest of the zone. Very interesting zone with 
              mob traps and shifting appearances. Zone would get a lot more use 
              from players if it was itemized better. Still, it is a fun change 
              of pace.

              Killed spawned Trakanon for Devaberiel to finish his bard epic. 
              After clearing the lair, we spawned Trakanon and killed him within 
              20 seconds. Fight was over so fast one of our manaburn wizards didn't 
              even have time to get off her nuke. Grats to Dreamthief for rogue 
              BP. This will be quiet week as many of us are working on exp prior

              Well lotta server downs, if I wasn't sick as a mofaka right now 
              id remember what days we did stuff!</p>
            <p>One day we did one of the shittiest ToV North runs in recent history 
              I cried openly into the arms of another man, it was pitiful. Although 
              it was still ToV North and ph4t loot was shared and enjoyed by all, 
              huggles for everyone at the end of the night.</p>
            <p>Yesterday we had a nice run at creator, who dropped a Blade of 
              angels, good thing this is ranger useable now because I actually 
              had someone to give it to, grats Laan, also Grats Rufio on a shiney 
              trinket of speed. Later that night we went and took CT down with 
              the late night crew, drops were halo, two chokers, and a robe. Always 
              a fun fight with 36ish, huggles to the late night crew who made 
              this fun. And double thanks to ME cuz im so cool when I pull God's

            <p>Entered the zone and wiped to the first pull. Basically we werent 
              prepared at all for whats to come. Had no bards there, no shadowknights, 
              you who've been there knows what that means. What we did have thou, 
              was 18 people willing to do whatever it took to nail those pesky 
              dragons. So we did, pulled Silverwing, died like flies but learnt 
              how he worked. Set up camp in a diferent spot and tried again. This 
              time he went down badly. This have personally been the best trip 
              in eq ever. You all did your best, and we succeeded in killing 3 
              dragons there...Silverwing, Nexona and Xygoz. Druushk and Phara 
              Dar was too hard without a bard and only 1 manaburner. They will 
              have to die next time thou. We will return....... </p>

            <p>We wiped to Yelinak, so it was an even greater pleasure nailing 
              him 20 minutes later. Grats Naggar, Ruban and Samirah on stuff. 
              Liberated Icewell Keep soon after from the foul Dain. Getting better 
              at that shitty pull, so this time it was down to a 1 hour event. 
              Grats on stuff Gardaor, but dont let that added attack make you 
              melee even more. Shortly after Dain died he spawned again. Rofl, 
              for a few it seemed a good idea to farm Dains all night, but that 
              wouldnt have been appropiate. Had Talons not been in the zone, noone 
              would know about us dispatching Dain, and could rightfully go there 
              and kill the 2. spawned Dain, and so on for all the other guilds 
              on this server. Seems funny to me that VI even considers baning 
              people for killing a mob that RESPAWNS because of a bug. We didnt 
              kill that 2. Dain and still we get badmouth comments from staff 
              members /sigh VI. The night ended in Lake Rathe, where 2 people 
              got united in the beauty of nature. On behalf of two not mentioned 
              people, I thank you all for showing up and making this a moment 
              worth to remember.<br>
