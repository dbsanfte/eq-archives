              Posted by Loadan On Jun 17 2003 At 11:29:07 AM <br>
              It has been an eventful couple of days! 
            <p> </p>
            <p>Started by killing Rumblecrush in UP, following up with Itraer 
              Vius in AR soon after (man, I was proud of our rally time for IV, 
              it was awe inspiring, only 3 minutes from call up to formation of 
              raid groups...of course, we already had the raid going in Umbral, 
              so I guess it's not all that amazing hehe)</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Next day, server resets, so we take the opportunity to clear out 
              the first couple of bosses in Sleepers Tomb, good job getting out 
              there and taking care of business!!</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Nice work all, good job and lets keep up the good work!!<br>
              <br>
              Get some FT on that guy, PLEASE! <br>
              Posted by Loadan On Jun 12 2003 At 09:02:46 AM <br>
              We took out IV with our BG buds last night, and managed to finally 
              get some flowing thought on Thooven! He's been avoiding FT items 
              like the plague, but we finally managed to force him to take one! 
              heh</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Grats to Thoov on his insignia, and to Topsy for her mace of crunching 
              baddies!<br>

            <p>Yes I finally hit 60, its been a wonderful journey and Ive made 
              a ton of friends along the way. Id like to throw out a few words 
              of thanks to the peeps who played the toons who hung out with me 
              on my journey. Andorean and Katslayer, when they played we rocked. 
              Swadi,Raggnor,Eraserd,Trinady, &amp; Fulturn for chicken, frog, 
              fish and doggie killing. Arriak &amp; Sslanis hung tough on hamburger 
              hill in FV. Xmortis, Jonzer, Ligoris, Kithov &amp; Houfter for hanging 
              out in Sol B, KC, Velks, and all the places we hit today. Of course 
              I must include all the peeps in the guild today, without you guys 
              I would still be hanging out in Karnors for the most part, I could 
              list hundreds of names and forgive me If I havent picked ya out 
              of my faded memories.</p>
            <p>Speaking of thanks, we need to give a big DoKR shout out to TR 
              and most specifically the buds of Grintooth. Last weekend a group 
              of us teamed up with a group of TR peeps and beat up the dragons 
              outside ToV for many hours. Meimei,Kithov,Grin and a few others 
              all picked up some nice neck ware. Grats to them and again a huge 
              thanks to the TR peeps.</p>
            <p>Grats to Quechang for hitting 62, Zbar hit 63, Kalander on 61, 
              Aliciarose, Aubreyana, Lilcloe, and Xrizzt all put in some nice 
              leveling lately. Welcome to all the new peeps and hope you have 
              as much fun as I do.<br>
              <br>
              Submitted 6/7/03</p>
            <p>Congrats go out to our 2 newest Epic wielders. Meimei added a nifty 
              feather tipped spear to our ranks and Ligoris is the newest leaf 
              blower among us. Grats to both of them and to everyone who helped 
              to make it possible.</p>
            <p>The Fay take down is always a riot and this one proved to be just 
              as exciting. When we got done with Fay all that was left was a small 
              tail section.</p>
            <p><img src="faykill.jpg"></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>V the Shade has drawn our attention lately. We have taken him out 
              now 3 times in a row and each time is exciting and provides aton 
              of pleasure with some pain.</p>
            <p>So far those phatty shoulder pieces have eluded us but the loots 
              he has dropped have off set the extreme effort.</p>
            <p>Grats to Ridyen and Zbar on picking up some new slasher and Celtin 
              for the heart.</p>

              Short friday update. Killed a couple of HoH trial mobs and did Behemoth 
              once more this week. Went to Plane of Tactics for the first time 
              and got Tallon Zek pretty far down. Very good experience. Oh yeah, 
              and we killed Emperor and cleared Aten Ha Ra minis and blobs in 
              VT. Lots of loot and fun.<br>

              ... that as a guild we are making our final push towards the plane 
              of time. Over the past week or two we have tested, prodded, learned 
              and experimented. We believe we have our strategy down and are ready 
              to execute.</p>
            <p>One thing I can say, in the 4+ years I have been playing this game, 
              and through all the events and situations I have been affiliated 
              with, I have never been so proud of a group of people for their 
              guts, their commitment and their heart.</p>
            <p>So to my guild, my friends, I offer you these words to help inspire 
              and support us as we make our final push towards our long awaited 
              goal.</p>

            <p>So what does the SS/DA alliance do to blow off steam after being 
              repeatedly annoyed by the Plane of Everyfuckinthingisbroke? We go 
              on rampage across the Planes of Fire and Water and obliterate 1 
              God and 9 minis. Thats right newly added to the obituaries today 
              is Fennin Ro, Pyronis, Babnoxis, Magmaton, Blazzax, General Reparm, 
              Quavonis, Arch Mage Yozanni, Hydrotha and Krziik the Mighty. Grats 
              to everyone who got one of the 19 loots we collected today. I'll 
              leave you with a shot of one helluva a badass pull and let you think 
              about how far from home this lil birdy is. </p>

            <p> Wednesday, June 11th, 2003 - PoE - Plane of Everyfuckinthingisbroke 
              <br>
              Posted by: [Pirotess] on June 11th, 2003 @ 07:35 AM</p>
            <p>You know its been about 4 months since we first entered PoE and 
              for 4 months now I've somehow kept telling myself &quot;Sony's gunna 
              get this zone fixed soon, they know its broken and they have tried 
              to fix it a few times, they'll get it.&quot; I kept on thinking 
              I shouldnt rant and just have faith.</p>
            <p>HAHAHAHA!</p>
            <p>Im done kidding myself, and my faith in the Sony dev types is absolutely 
              gone. Would it be at all possible to pull a developer or 2 off one 
              of the new expansions for two weeks to fix this cesspool of a zone 
              so guilds can enjoy themselves in the current endgame? You know 
              this game is VERY much in its twilight years and making people hate 
              your product isnt building a good customer base for EQII. If you 
              have developers working on PoE then I suggest you fire them because 
              they are the most inept developers I have ever seen. </p>
            <p>Fix these things:</p>
            <p><br>
              Ring Bosses not respawning....ever - If you think its working Im 
              here to tell you its not. We've been getting placeholder bosses 
              for 2 weeks straight on CT and from what we hear from other servers 
              we're not the only ones. If you think its fun to spend an hour clearing 
              a ring only to get the lootless PH since you have no way of telling 
              if the ring was reset you really have a screw loose. These bosses 
              need to be up every 3 days just like the rest of the elemental zones.</p>
            <p><br>
              Dust ring trigger system - Is it really necessary to have it be 
              a trap so any exploring rogue can trigger it 6 times and blow the 
              ring? I dont think so. Its not scary, its not clever, its not cool. 
              None of the other rings have a trigger like that so why must dust? 
              If you insist on having a trigger put it in the center of the dust 
              ring as a static spawn and be done with it. If you refuse to move 
              it for some lazy reason make it despawn properly.</p>
            <p><br>
              Arbitor/planar projection timers - Is it really necessary to put 
              him that far back on a 45 min timer when hes real and 30 min timer 
              when hes PH? We typically just went through hell to get the buggy 
              rings down and during the week its usually around midnight when 
              we get him up. Do we really need to rush headlong to the back of 
              the zone to catch him before he despawns? You cant seem to figure 
              out how to make the dust ring and its triggers despawn properly 
              so lets at least try for some consistancy and just leave him up 
              indefinitely eh? Actually if w're shooting for consistancy you need 
              to spawn 4 of him so we can finish up our keys in one run and never 
              return to this will sapping zone. Its sad to say that too because 
              it has alot of potential.</p>
            <p><br>
              Orphaned Eyes and Horses - Cant tell you how many of these get scattered 
              all over the zone and end up aggroing spawns all over the place 
              in some demented way. You want to know how to reproduce it so you 
              can fix it? Take an Eye of Tallon up to the top of the granite ring 
              then click off the buff icon. Eye doesnt poof and clutters up the 
              place.</p>
            <p><br>
              Orphaned ring spawns - Veg ring is famous for this one. Kill the 
              end boss and the adds he spawns as he dies stay up after he dies 
              apparently indefinitely. So when he wigs out and spawns 8 at once 
              and you kill him but his adds wipe you they then camp your corpses 
              till you graveyard and later get trained all over the zone as xp 
              groups get wacked. Make em despawn when the boss dies.</p>
            <p>Anyone of you developers recall seeing these quotes somewhere?</p>
            <p>&quot;The simple answer is this: We are going to continue to support 
              EverQuest&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;We are also working hard on making EverQuest a better experience&quot;</p>
            <p>Thats right, thats your President lying through his teeth on your 
              official website to us. Your new features are all fine and dandy 
              but I dont think anyone would complain if you put things like group 
              xp changes and mispelled quest text on the back burner and fixed 
              the really serious bugs in the game. Things like PoE as a whole, 
              raid flags consistantly getting bugged so you cant invite any unflagged 
              people even if there are no other unflagged in raid. Or maybe things 
              like mezzing a charmed raid member screwing up their aggro. But 
              then who am I kidding it took 2 years to fix buffs dropping when 
              we zoned with low health.</p>
            <p>Personally I'd be embarassed to be providing a product this shoddy 
              to my customers. Not only that but the decline of any kind of useful 
              GM presence on the servers to fix these problems and you have to 
              wonder if people are really going to show up for round II. I know 
              Im starting to have second thoughts.</p>
            <p>That brings me to another point. You know PoE is buggy, if you 
              dont you arent reading those /feedbacks at all. So why then if you 
              know the zone is buggy beyond belief wont you allow your GM-admins 
              to repop the zone? Thats just the stupidest policy I have ever heard.</p>
            <p>Oh yah and while Im ranting, Charms are the biggest con you have 
              ever pulled off imo. Great you sold us an expansion on an extra 
              equipment slot and more bank space and then you make charms impossibly 
              rare. I've been camping the Scryer in Torigan Mines now for over 
              40 hours and gotten him to spawn 7 times. I now have 7 of his common 
              drops and the last time I saw him spawn was over 15 hours ago. Charms 
              are NOT worth that kind of effort.</p>
            <p>At best you get 30 mana/hp and some stats on charms. They arent 
              going to unbalance things if they come into the game even at 10 
              times the rate they do now. Hell you slammed caster focus effects 
              in as summonable items and they were MUCH more powerful than any 
              charm. Why dont you let mages summon a couple different types of 
              charms like the focus items? Why dont you put charm tags on some 
              VT and PoP gear? Why dont you make a charm that gets more powerful 
              as you get more PoP flags to reward people for getting flags they 
              really dont need anymore unless their guild is planning on going 
              to time sometime soon?</p>
            <p>Why dont you make PoP an exception to your typical crappy programming 
              and surprise us so we want to stay on as your customers instead 
              of just hanging around until the next best thing launches? That 
              would be good business. Think about it. <br>

              Hot Damn, hot damn, HOT DAMN! Was it a fun night or what?</p>
            <p>I remember a theory I heard about a long time ago that if you sat 
              a million monkeys in front of a million typewriters and made them 
              hit keys, eventually one would produce a Shakespeare play. Most 
              days I would bet money on where folks in the upper tier EQ guilds 
              would say those monkeys are currently employed. But ya know what? 
              Every so often they have to get it right.</p>
            <p>There she is, the crown jewel of the best encounter we've faced 
              in EQ so far, and today she went down to SS and DA. It's long and 
              involved and taxing and fun and (at least so far) not boring in 
              the least. Somebody find the guy that designed this fight and buy 
              him a pizza....wait, he lives in San Diego...no pizza there, better 
              make that a fish taco. Well...buy him SOMETHING...the boy deserves 
              a prize.</p>
            <p>We have been up to other stuff as well....</p>
            <p><img src="FroFS.jpg" width="520" height="200"></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>There's another fight I can't say enough good things about...well, 
              mostly good things. In fact, on the scale of total cool....Planes 
              of Power is rating an &quot;Arthur Fonzarelli&quot; currently. Luclin 
              is still locked in at &quot;Carrot Top&quot; for you folks following 
              along at home, and there is a big &quot;Rip Taylor&quot; rating 
              for the skypilots still floating around the developer ranks that 
              think a blowable boss spawn is a good idea.</p>
            <p>So, as always, we've been having fun. We hid a stack of peridots 
              in the Hedge maze and had Cleric races....we mixed beef byproducts 
              in to PoW for the enjoyment of our vegan swimmers...and yet again 
              we gathered up in the Plane of Lake Travis and attempted to pull 
              HP to the zone line for an entire weekend. I don't think we actually 
              got the HP to spawn, but I am sure we got a lot of good information 
              for someone looking to do a term paper on the topics of fishing, 
              sleep deprivation and alcohol subsistence. Failing that, I am sure 
              we learned a thing or two that can be phrased as generally cautionary 
              statements, if I could only remember what they were.</p>
            <p>Ah well...back to the grindstone. Two fights left to Time, can't 
              wait to see it.</p>

              To be a puller in Shadowed Soul requires many things, a good memory 
              to remember spawn set up, nerves of steel, quick reaction, good 
              FD skills and the ability to wipe a raid with a train that gathers 
              admiration from the Guild. When Shadowed Soul finds a monk with 
              these skills we have no choice but to make them a full member of 
              the Guild.</p>
