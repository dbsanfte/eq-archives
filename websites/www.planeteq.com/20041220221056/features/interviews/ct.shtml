            <p><b class="heading">Crimson Talon: &quot;The Strength of Our Guild 
              is Our People&quot;</b> 
            <p> <i>Crimson Talon is another &quot;old school&quot; guild on the 
              Cazic Thule server. CT demonstrates how a stable guild can bring 
              good experiences to its members without requiring huge amounts of 
              playing time. The guild has been steadily growing over the years, 
              with many of the original starting players still in the guild, and 
              with the same guild leader that originally founded Crimson Talon 
              over three years ago: Altus, a 61 monk. I interviewed him over e-mail 
              in late December 2002.</i><br>
            </p>
            <p><i>Kwill: When did Crimson Talon start?</i></p>
            <p>Altus: We started when a group of real life friends who had all 
              been roped into playing decided that we wanted to have a centralized 
              way to chat with one another. Unfortunately, there were not ten 
              of us at the time so we had to solicit help from others to even 
              get the guild formed. Fortunately, the people who we have recruited 
              and our friends who joined us along the way turned out to be very 
              welcome additions. We actually formed around this time of year in 
              1999. At one point I almost gave up on getting the tag because Valshire, 
              who was our server GM, kept telling me to meet him at various times 
              and places, and then for one reason or another he would not show 
              up. In retrospect it is kind of funny now but it was not then.<br>
              <br>
              <i>Kwill: How long have you been playing?</i></p>
            <p>Altus: I have been playing since July 1999. I had never heard of 
              EverQuest until I happened to chat with Sanglant, now a member of 
              Divine Alliance, at a friend's wedding. He spent a couple of hours 
              telling me how cool the game was. I picked up the game the next 
              day. As a result, I doubt that Sanglant will be on my wife's Christmas 
              card list anytime soon. </p>
            <p><i>Kwill: How is the guild organized?</i></p>
            <p>Altus: Once we started growing as a guild and formalizing some 
              goals, we established a fairly simple philosophy. The purpose of 
              our guild was to increase the opportunities for our members to do 
              things that they otherwise would not be able to do without a disproportionate 
              increase in frustrating BS. Therefore, our organization is a bit 
              on the minimalist side.</p>
            <p>In addition to myself, we currently have five active officers: 
              Khallin, Tomwin, Groovit, Brewall and Greymask. Each of us has certain 
              strengths and weaknesses and areas of guild management we tend to 
              gravitate to, but we do not have any specific job titles. Our officers 
              get no special perks in regards to loot priority or any other tangible 
              benefit to compensate them for the administrative functions that 
              they must perform. </p>
            <p>The fact is that our guild structure is set up to encourage each 
              person to be a leader, within reason. Any member of our guild can 
              call a raid. Any of our seventy five or so members might be called 
              upon to mediate a dispute between members or to help with the administration 
              of the guild. Our officers define our guild goals and policy very 
              broadly and it is the duty of each member to do what they can to 
              help us meet those goals.<br>
              <br>
              <br>
              <i>Kwill: What do you think the strengths of CT are?</i></p>
            <p>Altus: It is certainly a clich&eacute;, but the strength of our 
              guild is our people. In terms of guild census, we have grown pretty 
              slowly. The reason we have grown slowly is because we have not been 
              willing to mortgage our group identity for the possibility of achieving 
              things a little bit faster. Our people are by and large builders 
              more than they are consumers. Almost every one of our members has 
              received an invitation or multiple invitations to other guilds that 
              are higher on the EQ food chain. We are people who enjoy the journey 
              as much as the destination. We enjoy experiencing new things together 
              for the first time. We share our successes and our failures, and 
              have enough of a shared history to get some enjoyment from what 
              we have built cooperatively. </p>
            <p>More importantly, we try to accomplish as much as we can without 
              adversely affecting our real life obligations. By and large, we 
              are made up of people who have somewhat limited playtime. We are 
              adults who have jobs and families and other important obligations. 
              This helps keep this game a game to us.</p>
            <p>Our biggest in game strength is probably planning and execution. 
              Proper planning and execution has allowed us to conquer some challenges 
              that others told us we had no chance to conquer.</p>
            <p><i>Kwill: What has the guild done that you are most proud of?</i></p>
            <p>Altus: One thing that I am pretty proud of but which is pretty 
              dated by today's standards of success is the amount of epic quests 
              we have completed. Even the epics that have meant very little to 
              the guild in terms of helping us increase our abilities mean a lot 
              for the people who want them. When epics first came within our reach 
              I promised that we would complete the epic of any person who would 
              put in the work for their epic and who would help others meet their 
              goals. Over 80% of us now have our epics, and the vast majority 
              of people who do not are newer members or people who have taken 
              long breaks from playing. In a personal sense, it makes me very 
              proud that I could keep my word.</p>
            <p>Our greatest accomplishments as a guild are united by one common 
              theme, constant advancement. We continue to move forward and face 
              new and greater challenges.</p>
            <p><i>Kwill: What is your take on guild politics on the Cazic Thule 
              server?</i></p>
            <p>Altus: Politics are inevitable when you have groups of people competing 
              for limited resources. Trying to manage a political agenda for my 
              guild is not something that I enjoy, so our policies are a little 
              isolationistic. We try very hard not to be involved in server politics. 
              Frankly, it is pretty easy for us to do because we are not one of 
              the guilds competing for the very bleeding edge of content. Most 
              of the guilds who hunt the same spawns that we hunt are reasonably 
              easy to get along with. The powers that be have made things quite 
              a bit smoother by increasing the amount of available content, thus 
              decreasing the amount of desperate competition that occurs. I may 
              be naive, but things seem to be a lot less rancorous than they used 
              to be. </p>
            <p>I do want to stress that we respect the other guilds on the server, 
              and admire their accomplishments.</p>
            <p><i>Kwill: What are your goals for the guild?</i></p>
            <p>Altus: I want to play together with our members as long as we can. 
              I want to have as much fun as we possibly can. I want to defeat 
              every challenge that we have the will and perseverance to defeat.</p>
            <p><i>Kwill: What are your recruitment policies?</i></p>
            <p>Altus: Currently, we have a &quot;needs&quot; recruitment list 
              as well as an open recruitment policy for any class. People can 
              become probationary members of our guild by meeting certain class 
              and level requirements, attending a certain number of raids with 
              us, and securing an appropriate number of sponsors from the ranks 
              of our current members. Probation lasts about thirty days. At the 
              end of thirty days, probation can be extended, or the person can 
              be granted or denied full membership. During the term of probation, 
              a person's sponsors are directly responsible for the conduct of 
              that person. Our level minimums are level 55 on our needed class 
              list and 57 otherwise. I expect both of these numbers to be raised 
              in the near future because our average level is above 60 and I do 
              not believe in recruiting people who are not at least nominally 
              ready to participate in the activities of the guild.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><i>Kwill: How do you distribute loot?</i></p>
            <p>Altus: Someone once derogatorily accused us of taking our loot 
              system from a low level role-playing guild. There is some truth 
              to the statement because we have had our system when we were a low 
              level guild. Since the time that I formalized the loot system, I 
              have fallen out of love with it and subsequently learned to love 
              it again. It is simple and objective in its administration, although 
              likely not fair in every instance.</p>
            <p>For most loot, we use a need before greed system. People who could 
              and would use an item on a full time basis get first crack at the 
              item. People who would use it situationally but not all the time 
              get the second shot. After that, the item is fair game for anyone. 
              If there is more than one person who qualifies for the item, they 
              roll for the item. Any droppable item that they replace with the 
              new item is then distributed in the same manner. That way there 
              is a trickle down effect from a single drop. Items won in open rolls 
              may be sold, traded used to twink etc. Some items of particular 
              value may be reserved and distributed by the guild in the same manner 
              at a later time, or sold by the guild for cash.</p>
            <p>Quest items are distributed to the person who is closest to completing 
              a quest.</p>
            <p>Of course, the dice have no memory, so in theory some people could 
              win everything and some people could never win, even if they were 
              present for every item that dropped. In reality, that does not seem 
              to happen. Over time, everyone seems to get what they need. From 
              the standpoint of maximizing our guild's capability, it would be 
              nice to have one main tank with every good item that we have every 
              gotten that he or she could use. If the person cast in that role 
              ever leaves the game or the guild, that advantage turns immediately 
              into a disadvantage. I guess you could say that our loot system 
              tends to create a bunch of adequately well equipped to modestly 
              well equipped people which works well with our guild.<br>
            </p>
            <p><i>Kwill: Why do you think guilds break up?</i></p>
            <p>Altus: I think guilds break up for the same reasons that voluntary 
              relationships break up in real life. Sometimes, they blow up spectacularly 
              because of perceived lies, greed or any of a million other slights 
              that one person thinks someone else has done to them. I imagine 
              these problems start small and fester for a while, with nobody being 
              overly concerned about them. Then, some event lights the fuse to 
              the powder keg and all hell breaks loose.</p>
            <p>The other main reason is apathy and a lack of a coherent group 
              identity. If people do not all care about their guild, and share 
              the same general vision and values in regards to what they expect 
              from the guild experience and what they are willing to contribute, then at some point being in the guild 
              becomes more of a burden than a blessing. People perceive the guild 
              as moreeffort than it is worth and they leave or it withers on the 
              vine.</p>
            <p><i>Kwill: What is the hardest thing about being a guild leader?</i></p>
            <p>Altus: I am not sure that it is the most difficult thing, but the 
              most frustrating thing is when I have to deal with someone who is 
              unhappy about something that I have done or failed to do and who 
              has not told me about the issue until they are really angry about 
              it. I sometimes feel like I am expected to read minds. That is a 
              talent that, sadly, I lack. Most problems presented to me in this 
              way could be easily solved if people would just talk about them 
              when they were small problems as opposed to waiting until they become 
              big problems. I think we are all guilty of unconsciously assuming 
              that the people we associate with know the things that we know and 
              feel the same way about things that we do while we know rationally 
              this is not true. I wish I could get everyone to communicate with 
              one another more effectively.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><i>Kwill: Where do you think Crimson Talon fits as a guild on the 
              Cazic Thule server?</i></p>
            <p>Altus: In terms or what content we have completed, we have not 
              accomplished the things that the &quot;first tier&quot; guilds on 
              our server have. Some of the things, due to time constraints, we 
              never will accomplish. I sometimes joke that we are about an expansion 
              and a half behind. We are just now settling in to what was end game 
              content before Luclin. I do not know whether that makes us second 
              tier or third tier or 45th tier, and frankly I do not really care. 
              I think we have some very exceptional players, planners and leaders 
              in our guild. We continually meet and overcome new challenges. We 
              raid often, and can usually field a reasonably complete raid force. 
              I have a lot of respect for those people who have done the things 
              we are now doing before us, but I do not feel like our accomplishments 
              are cheapened by the fact that someone did them first.</p>
            <p>I imagine some people on our server like us, some people dislike 
              us, and the majority of people are pretty apathetic about us. I 
              do want to say that I appreciated Thornsong's comment in the last 
              one of these interviews that you did when he said that he had respect 
              for our guild. It is gratifying when someone outside of your guild 
              recognizes what you are trying to accomplish. Respect, in some sense, 
              transcends like or dislike.</p>
            <p><i>Kwill: What about EQ addiction? Do you think that's an issue? 
              Do you have any players that you would consider addicted?</i></p>
            <p>Altus: I think that some people do become dependent on EQ. In my 
              mind, some hallmarks of dependence might be consistently playing 
              more than you intend to; spending all your time immersed in an EQ 
              culture, or planning what you are going to do next when you get 
              online; giving up or reducing important occupational, social and 
              other recreational activities; and finally continuing playing the 
              game even when it is not fun anymore. These are similar to some 
              of the clinical diagnostic criteria for substance abuse disorders. 
              When I hear tales of people losing their jobs or having their<br>
              spouses leave them over a game then I have to conclude that those 
              people have a problem that goes beyond a mere lack of responsibility 
              or setting priorities. When I hear people bitch, piss and moan about 
              how much they hate the game but I see them online when I log on 
              and they are still online when I log off then they, too, would seem 
              to have a problem to me.</p>
            <p>Games like EQ are somewhat insidious because they are like a playground 
              or a nightclub that never closes, where you are likely to see friends 
              at anytime day or night and where no preparation is necessary to 
              attend. You do not have to get dressed up to play. Hell, you can 
              skip brushing your teeth and no one knows unless you tell them. 
              It is really not surprising to me that people prefer that over the 
              rigors and frustrations of real life.</p>
            <p>From time to time I have had to talk to people in my guild about 
              taking the game too seriously. That is as close to directly confronting 
              the addiction issue as I have ever come. </p>
            <p></p>
           
            <p><i>Kwill: How would you describe your leadership style, and how 
              do you keep your guild together?</i></p>
            <p>Altus: The guild stays together because we constantly try to talk 
              to one another and make certain that everyone participates in the 
              business of the guild. We have an active and lively message board, 
              and our members are mature enough to realize they will not get their 
              way every time on every issue and not take it as some personal attack.</p>
            <p>I try to use whatever techniques I can to get us from where we 
              are now to where we need to go efficiently and intact. I try to 
              explain the reasons for doing what I do so people do not have to 
              guess at those reasons. Sometimes reasoned discourse and praise 
              work the best. Other times, I have to scold or chastise people. 
              I am very direct in my leadership style. Some people have accused 
              me of being a bit of a control freak, and I probably have been from 
              time to time. I try to remember, however, that this is all a game 
              and do not take anything too seriously.<br>
            </p>
