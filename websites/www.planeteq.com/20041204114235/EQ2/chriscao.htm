            EverQuest II</font></p>
            <p>At the Fan Faire in Las Vegas, 2004, I had a chance to sit down
              with Chris Cao, one of the two lead developers of EverQuestII,
              and talk
              to
              him
              a little
              bit about gaming design and philosophy. This was long before EQII
              was in beta, let alone released, so no one knew much about it.
              We were at a Star Trek themed restaurant, and if there is anything
              that
              is
              yet
              an &#8220;undiscovered
              frontier&#8221; it&#8217;s the universes that game developers are
              creating for all of us to play in. EverQuest is five years old
              now, and the field of massively multiplayer online games is just
              beginning to blossom. The EverQuestII team is working to be again
              on the cutting edge of this genre, just as EverQuest was. Chris
              and I talked about what kind of theories and ideas game developers
              have to consider to create an engaging and sustainable game world
              that&#8217;s fun to play in, ideas that turned out to be more complex
              than you might at first imagine them to be.</p>
            <p>Chris worked on the live team for EQ before moving to the EQII
              team as lead developer. He came to gaming after being a science
              teacher in the public schools, finding that his physics background
              lent itself naturally to scripting of game code, and his life experience
              lent itself to designing fun, challenging games that have the complexity
              to sustain themselves over time. He has thought a great deal about
              complex issues that impact a game of the scope of EverQuest and
              EverQuest II, including building community, the economy, playability,
              and how to make it so people want to log in and keep coming back
              over time. Right now, his job consists mostly of making lists,
              he told me, keeping the project on track and making sure that everything
              gets done the way it should be. But his first love is game design
              and the details that go into creating a world that people want
              to adventure in.</p>
            <p>My first impression of Chris was how thoughtful he was about game
              design, and the importance he stressed of balancing the game between
              fun and sustainability. Game designers have to make decisions about
              how they are going to treat the players as the game progresses.
              The tone that the developers take makes a huge difference on how
              the game ends up being played. Will the developers, and later the
              live team, take a very strict authoritarian role, forcing players
              to play the game as they envision it, squelching any deviation
              from the assumed gameplay with nerfs and changes? Or will they
              be permissive, and change things as the players ask for them, realizing
              that some of the changes may ruin overall gameplay in the long
              term? Where do they go when suddenly a new play style in the game
              shows up that completely differs from the original design idea
              and changes all the encounters? Chris was very earnest in explaining
              that many times developers and designers seem to be making changes
              that at the outset seem unfair, but in fact are making sure that
              the game remains playable and enjoyable over time. If the game
              can be &#8220;won&#8221; in a short period of time, players will
              leave and find other games to play. Live team changes are a result
              of many discussions about what will keep the game fun and hard
              enough to be satisfying to the players over time, without making
              it too difficult or frustrating. A tough challenge! We both agreed
              that even the most brilliant group of programmers and game designers
              can never outguess 450,000 players, using all their skills and
              imagination to make the game into their own personal playground.
              It&#8217;s not possible for the developers to guess every trick
              and technique good players come up with to conquer a difficult
              encounter, as they found as EverQuest progressed. Every time the
              players come up with something new, the developers like Chris have
              to decide how that is going to impact the game now, and in the
              future. What changes, if any, should be made to make sure the game
              stays fun?</p>
            <p>Chris is also very interested in fostering a sense of community
              and friendships among players, working to put elements into EQII
              that will encourage interactions between individuals. Players of
              MMOs place value on their player avatars: they have individual
              personalities that may or may not reflect the personality of the
              person at the keyboard, and exist strongly as individuals in the
              game world. Interaction between players is what builds community
              within the MMO. One important part of EQII that Chris feels will
              draw on this concept is the player housing feature. In some MMOs,
              the player housing can be described as a &#8220;trophy case&#8221;,
              something a player constructs to show off his or her accomplishments.
              In EQII, the housing is very personal, in the sense that players
              can design the layout, the placement of the windows, and the design
              of the interior, but more importantly are also made for sharing.
              The house is an expression of the avatar&#8217;s personality. A
              key element is that friends can come into the house to enjoy it,
              move objects around, and even contribute to the design. The house
              is interactive, not static. EQ has not survived and prospered over
              five years just because of the monster encounters; it is because
              of the relationships player characters have formed in the world
              of Norrath. Chris hopes to encourage friendships and altruism in
              the game by incorporating more elements to make cooperating with
              others rewarding personally. I can&#8217;t wait to see what he
              comes up with in this regard. </p>
            <p>Because of the emphasis on friendships and camaraderie, groups
              and raids are going to be designed to work on smaller scale. There
              is a theory behind these decisions, as well. Chris feels that large
              raids end up marginalizing some players. Most people don&#8217;t
              feel very important in a group of 50 to 100 players zerging the
              mob. In EQII, the emphasis is on smaller raids, up to 4 groups
              of 6, and many of the encounters can be easily done with just a
              small group of 6 people. So in changing the game design, he has
              changed the focus from huge raids to more personal adventures with
              groups of comrades.</p>
            <p>We also discussed the economy of an MMO. The economy in a game
              becomes very important in the success of gameplay, as a player&#8217;s
              in-game money and gear needs to have value. Chris has looked into
              economic theory, which helped him to decide which elements can
              make the economy stronger, thus making the game more playable because
              buying and selling items actually works.</p>
            <p>People&#8217;s play styles also come under scrutiny. Chris thinks
              often about what kind of playing experience disparate people want
              to have. Some just want the hack and slash of a good fighting encounter.
              Some want the challenge of quests and puzzles. Others want a different
              type of game, where player characters work at trades or skills
              within the game world. Chris, as a former schoolteacher, uses his
              knowledge of different learning styles and diversity to incorporate
              some of these ideas into his game design, with the goal of making
              the game interesting and fun for many kinds of people. </p>
            <p>Fan Faire is important to him, as it is to all the designers and
              programmers, because they really get to see what the game fans
              are like, up close and personal. It&#8217;s not just the 18 &#8211; 25
              year olds playing: it&#8217;s the over 50 crowd, professionals,
              women, men, children, whole families. Designing a game that&#8217;s
              fun and a rewarding use of leisure time for all those types of
              people is not easy, to say the least. For EQII, Chris has tried
              to put in a more open ended game, with less linearity than the
              traditional RPG, to appeal to a wider audience. Tradeskilling,
              player housing, and other elements are in place to offer alternative
              playing experiences. He also took into account the casual gamer,
              who does not want to raid for 5 hours each night. Chris has considered
              gender roles and the ways men and women might play differently,
              and incorporated those ideas into his design elements, with the
              goal of making a game that can be fun in different ways and blend
              differing player personalities into a complex MMO that is really
              enjoyable to spend time in, day after day.</p>
            <p>We briefly touched on the issue of player-versus-player. Chris
              personally feels that although PvP can be fun, it also can foster
              a gang mentality amongst certain players. He hopes to develop an
              alternative system of PVP that incorporates the excitement and
              skill of challenging and defeating a real person, but does not
              end up with a bullying group of players ruining the experience
              for everyone else. </p>
            <p>The bottom line for any game designer is how to keep people coming
              back who feel that the monthly subscription fee gives them entertainment
              value. To keep customer loyalty, the design and development teams
              have to be responsive to customer concerns and yet have a strong
              sense of where the game is going and how the game universe, in
              this case the land of Norrath, should function. The game has to
              be fun, for a lot of people. It has to foster community and a sense
              of belonging. It has to give you a sense of accomplishment and
              personal satisfaction. There has to be a desire to log in today,
              and the day after. To that end, the designers play themselves,
              and read message boards and fan sites. How does their theory of
              game design really play out in the real world? The grass roots
              commentary and complaining is not ignored; the developers really
              do want to know what the players care about. If players are complaining
              and asking for changes, that means they care passionately about
              the game. And there is nothing more rewarding for a designer to
              log in as just a regular character (which they do!), join a group,
              fight, enjoy a challenging encounter, and watch their group members
              have a great time too. Yes, Chris admitted, he cringes when he
              hears his group members complaining about something he designed,
              but he doesn&#8217;t say anything. He just waits for the next moment
              when people are having fun again.<br>
