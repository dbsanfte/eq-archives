            Late night SSra fun!  <br>
            Posted by Loadan On Mar 16 2004 At 08:52:09 AM <br>
We went to SSra temple last night, with 3 groups or so, and stayed up late!!
We took down Rhag 2 (grats to banogari on new legs and a nice new pigsticker!),
then we moved up to take on the Arch Lich. We learned a couple of things, that
will come in handy next time we tackle him, but we didn't manage to take him
down ;/                        <p>Good night, nonetheless, and it was good fun. I'm payin for it
              this morning, as I'm sure a lot of other folks are, but I'll cya'll
              tonite for more fun!<br>

                Posted by Loadan On Mar 03 2004 At 07:59:36 AM <br>
  Good job on a quick clearing of Sleeper's Tomb, we started with MOTG, move
  to Progenitor, then made our way down to clear the Final Arbiter and the 4
  ancients (lol, can't remember all their names!).</p>
            <p>Grats to our big winner of the night, Topsy for her new robe (it
              must be uber if Eng is still wearing it!) and necklace!! <br>

                Fun in Ferubi <br>
                Posted by Loadan On Feb 24 2004 At 09:07:56 AM <br>
  CoG went roaming through Ferubi, and found a couple of named that needed killing.</p>
            <p>We took out the *hack*cough* Armsmaster twice, got a NIFTY augment
              x2, then went down a bit farther and took out *hack*cough*splat
              (yeah, thats his name, sorry) and he dropped a nice cloak for a
              crappy shaman (yep, I won it, imagine that).</p>
            <p>Good night in Ferubi, lets get back there and do it again!!!</p>

              An event that has now become standard, we killed the giants and
              yawned. We killed the spearmen and yawned. Is this the best that

              <br>
              The raid started with less than 50 people and ended with 52.
                Several (including me) were skeptical of the odds, especially
                when we were
                seemingly short on time a few times. With Altus cracking the
                whip though, we pulled it together and all of us hung in there
                to bring
                down the Lord of Disease for the 2nd time. CT - 2, Bert - 1!
                We're knocking on the Sol Ro Tower door very soon. The Crimson
                Talon
                cometh! Grats to Fluteria on Radiant Mask of the Disease Lord
                a sweet mask for any class. Also congrats to Windarii on Decayed
              Shoes of the Plaguebringer.</p>            <p>Bing! Pop! Whiiirrrrlllll! <br>

  Continuing on our flagging madness, we ventured into the Plane of Innovation
  to render the Manaetic Behemoth into tinkering scrap. Numerous members got
  flagged from the event, and we moved on with a smaller crew to kill Xanamech
  Nezmirthafen for loots and factory flags in the event of latecomers on a future
  raid. </p>
            <p>Another CT First! Rydda`Dar Bows Before Us! <br>
              Posted by: Thespis on Friday, March 12, 2004<br>
              <br>
              They say 3rd time is the charm. Well CT usually does it the 2nd
              time, but RD proved more of a challenge. 1st attempt, we had him
              close to 25%. 2nd attempt was somewhere around 20%. Tonight and
              the 3rd try ever, we slew the beast and proved ourselves worthy
              to face the Lord of Light, Mithaniel Marr. Congratulations to all
              who got this checklist check. Congrats to Tigermane on Ivory Etched
              Aegis and Elven Bow of Mysticism dropped also, but nobody was interested
              in it really.</p>
            <p>We also again made Vallon Zek, the minion of Rallos, bow before
              our might, and it went even more smoothly than yesterday. Congrats
              to Gish on Furious Hammer of Zek and grats to Tico on Resplendent
              War Maul. It was a fantastic night of raiding. Not one, but two
              big targets were destroyed by the Crimson Talon.<br>
              <br>
              Vallon Zek, Minion

              <br>
  The Crimson Talon seems to thrive on raid challenges that require intelligent
  strategy. Our first attempt on VZ was hampered by some outside involvement.
  This second attempt was free from interference and went very smoothly. With
  our normally intelligent leadership and attention to detail, VZ and all his
  illusions were destroyed one by one. The whole fight went fairly quickly, and
  in the end we were victorious. A lot of flagging fun was had by all. Congratulations
  to Dreamthief on Obsidian Scimitar of War and grats to Teifa on Furious Hammer
  of Zek. </p>

              <br>
              Bertoxxulous, the Plaguebringer and master of the Crypt of Decay
                has been battered, bruised, and beaten at the hands of the Crimson
                Talon. On our first Bert attempt ever, we took him down to 47%
                with only 45 people and only 3 clerics. Two of those clerics
                are considered alts. The next night we went back with 56 people
                total,
                6-7 of which were clerics. The fight got a little chaotic, but
                people stepped up when needed and in the end the evil lord of
                disease was lying at our feet. Congratulations to Fenik on Decayed
                Shoes
              of the Plaguebringer and grats to Klaminar on The Rotting Fist.</p>            <p>Terris Thule Terrified <br>
              Posted by: brewall on Tuesday, March 09, 2004</p>
              <p><img src="file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/m-miron/My%20Documents/My%20Pictures/guildnews/ct3.jpg" width="450" height="338"><br>
                <br>
                Terris Thule was resting this evening in her lair, when some
                  intruders appeared. She casually looked over and determined
                  they were not
                a threat - not enough people, not enough gear, and not enough
                  healing. She closed her eyes for a moment, but then caught
                  a mace to her
                midsection - and the fight was on! In typical Crimson Talon fashion,
                we slayed her yet again, this time with too little of everything,
                except for deaths, which under the circumstances, was amazing.
              Excellent tactics and execution by everyone</p>

              <p>Well another fine few weeks in between postings. We have been
                busy for sure and wanted to take this chance to welcome aboard
                all the newest additions. Carpy, Katina,Scyll,Cypher, and Im
                sure ive missed a couple. </p>
              <p>DoKR has been hard at work farming Bot for some much needed
                gear and spells. Grats to Shimmor on all his new spells, along
                with Quiinn and Kalander, Andorean, Houfter, and Ziam. Ghob scored
                some leather pants, Katslayer is sporting a new BP, Helm and
                Gloves so grats to him. A number of chain pieces have dropped
                and have been passed around to those that can use em. </p>

    What have we been doing ya ask?? (submitted by Larlador at 02:08am GMT)</p>
            <p>Basicly we killed SolRo mini's, mini's and more mini's till we
              were sick of it and still yet we need to kill many more.....</p>
            <p>However we did manage to get enough people flagged over time to
              get a raid in to SolRo his chamber himself, and with a near flawless
              kill we managed to get a truckload of people flagged for Plane
              of Fire.....</p>
            <p>During all these killings we did manage to sneak in a RL guildmeeting
              in Leeds (England) next one will possibly be in either the US or
              somewhere in Scandinavia. And we did manage to sneak in a few other
            kills like Berty and Vallon in there.</p>

            You know the drill by now. Fates takes out a dragon.</p>
            <p>Last night it was Lady Vox again, since she didn't spawn the other
              night when we planned on taking her out. This time we had 19 people
              total, 13 of the proper level for old dragons. One of those 13
              was the nearly-naked Marcom. Generally, it's bad to hear &quot;I
              don't have a BP.&quot; when you're all buffed up and ready to move
              in...</p>
            <p>This is a diagram showing what a dragongeezer killing force looks
              like.</p>
            <p><img src="file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/m-miron/My%20Documents/My%20Pictures/guildnews/fd11.jpg" width="400" height="300"></p>            <p>I'm not sure how it happened, but Vox was invisible to me. I used
              my Dionne Warwick Psychic Beads (requires lots of APs, DKPs, and
              PPs!), and maybe the others' positions, to try to stay on her back
              for maximizing my rogueliness. Picture a big blue dragon in the
              middle of all those swords, just like the older pics.</p>

            <p>We're not sure exactly how it happened, but we ended up with a
              lot of adds. So we killed that stuff too. Ice Witch? More like
              Iced Witch... </p>

            <p>Kittiana got a Runed Bolster Belt and passed her Runebranded Girdle
              down to Warmarch. War also got a McVaxius` Horn of War. Our newest
              initiate Draigh got Kavruul`s Mystic Pouch. Daedilus got White
              Dragon Scales for his epic, and we got another one for the bank
              too. The guild bank and/or some future twink also got a Crystalline
              Spear. As usual, we did great and got some nice loot.</p>
            <p>After clearing up the pest problem in Permafrost, a few of us
              helped McCorpse out with a kill for his epic. Here you can see
            the very dead Ixiblat Fer.</p>

              Fates gets the other one!</p>
            <p>Last night we took down Lord Nagafen. We had planned to get Vox
              again as soon as she respawned, but she took too long so we went
              after the secondary target. We mowed through SolB pretty quickly.
              It was tricky getting the last of the giants out of Naggy's lair
              (especially when some inferior tracking told us there was one still
              in there, when he turned out to be behind us). Marcom, Raglaoki,
              and Norleef got them all out, but Marcom got summoned by Big Red
              on the last pull. He feigned death, but was stuck rubbing Naggy's
              tummy while everyone else got buffed up for the battle.</p>
            <p>You will not evade us, Lord Nagafen!</p>
            <p><img src="file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/m-miron/My%20Documents/My%20Pictures/guildnews/fd5.jpg" width="400" height="300"></p>            <p>Another one bites the dust!</p>
            <p>This time we had 21 people present, including Draigh and Bolgor.
              15 of those were able to directly engage the dragon, and averaged
              just under level 51. Iriniam got a Rokyls Channeling Crystal that
              dropped while clearing, I won Gauntlets of Fiery Might, Ashetaka
              got a Treasure Hunter's Satchel, and Triste finally got an epic
              piece: Torn, burnt book. The guild bank also got Red Dragon Scales
              to sell. Again, a good haul and great work by our Dragon Destruction
              Divison.<br>

              <br>
            Fates does it again!</p>
            <p>After quite an ordeal just making it happen, the Fates Twink Brigade
              took down Lady Vox again with minimal effort. Originally the raid
              had been planned for Sunday. It was moved to Saturday to accomodate
              more players. Sony's patch antics led to postponing the event until
              Monday night. We meandered over to Permafrost and saw that Vox
              was up, then ran to SolB to see if Naggy was too. While we were
              there, another group moved into Permafrost to kill Vox. Their large
              force had some... issues... and Vox proceeded with craziness most
              of us had never seen. My rogue died when her AE popped Hide. At
              the small gate. While she was on her way back. Yes, Vox was nearly
              at zone-in. Like I said, issues... (You can find a collage of this
              great event in the Members section of the board.)</p>
            <p>While the other group stalled, screwed up, and tried to blame
              us for things, we came to the conclusion that we were going to
              make this work. We would take the dragon the next day, before they
              could gather their forces.</p>
            <p>We started gathering our forces at the prep spot and doing some
              clearing. &quot;Clearing&quot; in this case means &quot;gobbie
              genocide&quot;.</p>
            <p><img src="file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/m-miron/My%20Documents/My%20Pictures/guildnews/fd6.jpg" width="400" height="300"></p>
            <p>We then moved up to the ramps, where we went over the tactics
              with the new members and did our buffing. Here's a shot of our
              raid force.</p>
            <p><img src="file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/m-miron/My%20Documents/My%20Pictures/guildnews/fd8.jpg" width="400" height="300"></p>
            <p>Then we did the important part: killing the dragon.</p>
            <p><img src="file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/m-miron/My%20Documents/My%20Pictures/guildnews/fd9.jpg" width="400" height="300"></p>
            <p>One dragon on ice, coming up!</p>
            <p>We took down Lady Vox without anyone dying. We had a total raid
              force of 16 including high level buffers, and 11 people in the
              Twink Brigade actually engaging her. Surefind, an initiate on his
              first dragon raid, said afterward that it was &quot;almost anti-climactic&quot;.
              That's a good sign that we had the preparation and skill to pull
              this off so smoothly. As most of us saw the night before, even
              a much larger raid force doesn't guarantee anything - skill and
              teamwork do still count for something in this game. Soeur and Maarcus
              each got Kavruul`s Mystic Pouch, Skulker got a Runed Bolster Belt,
              and the Guild Bank got two Dragon Bone Bracelets and a Warhammer
              of Divine Grace.</p>
            <p>Since the dragon went so well, the mains then ventured down to
              the pit to exact some revenge on The Chilling Terror for killing
              Liath and Witney earlier. Hits hard, flurries, AEs, stuns, summons...
              Yeah, he's mean.</p>
            <p><img src="file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/m-miron/My%20Documents/My%20Pictures/guildnews/fd10.jpg" width="400" height="300"></p>
            <p>Gorewyn died this time, but we still showed him who's in charge.
              Gore also got a Jagged Permafrost Shard to help with his epic.
              *snicker*</p>
            <p>All in all, a great night for Fates.<br>

                Fates is recruiting again! We've had a few new people join FD
                lately, and things seem to be going pretty well. Here is a thread
                on our message board describing what we're looking for. If you
                have any questions, feel free to post on the board, send an officer
                a PM, or get in touch with one of us in-game. We play lots of
                alts, so if you don't see the person you're looking for, just
                do a &quot;/who all Fates&quot; and ask if they're around. If
            they're not, you'll generally find someone else willing to help.</p>
            <p>We look forward to hearing from you!<br>

            <br>
Well, another productive week for IoA . Monday proved to be a few firsts for
us, as we dropped the new and improved RZtW. I am proud to sport my new BoW and
Melk his new mask. Then it was off to PoA to say allo to our leetle friend The
Avatar of Wind who provided Jaguarx his new Bracer and Helious on his new cloak
. During our stay we provided a few members with some nice items. Grats to all
who won!<br>
<br>
              Tuesday proved to be a learning experiance, as we dipped our
                  feet into the waters of PoE. With most everything already down,
                  we
                  started the Dust Ring, but then realised as we spawned the
                  Warder that alcohol and raiding dont mix. Qelyn , put down
                  the bottle,
                  our raid leader shouldnt be drunk ! (Happy belated birthday)
                  Ok, maybe he wasnt drunk, but he sure pulled like he was. Soooo
                  ..we went to PoA! Grats Xaldarenn on the shinny new staff ,
                  and you know what , i cant even remember what else. Enjoy the
                  spotlight
            Xald .</p>
            <p>Wednesay meant a full pop all over the server, early, which was
              quickly taken advantage of by our European friends , and left us
              once again , in PoA. With a full raid force we made quick work
              of the Avatar of Smoke. Grats Sveva on the new belt (you are now
              our buff whore) and Xamren on your new gloves.</p>
            <p>Then on to Avatar #2 The Avatar of Wind , grats Anna and Fandiil
              on a pair of sparkly orbs! . While there we killed the Queen and
              provided Mandarken with a new mask . We were really hoping for
              her OTHER drop this time =/ With a few other minis up, we made
              short work of them , grats kolrath on the ring . Grats jaskur on
              the new cloak and Kazm on our 2nd staff this week<br>
              <br>
              Thank you to everyone who joined us this week, and welcome to our
            newest IoA applicant and member to ourfamily.<br>
            P.S. thank you hideto for fixing all my broken links!<br>

  On Monday night, we finally mustered up enough to attempt sol ro. Our first
  attempt was a little sloppy, and we learned a lot. We quickly res'd up and
  proceed to kill him Flawlessly. Finally IoA is full elemental flagged</p>

              ro dead or the target...or the loot, sorry I was too busy trying
              to get res'd! <br>

            <p>After that disaster...err learning experience, we headED to PoAir

              Mold, Aabil the heavy bludgeoner by default, Xamren for the FT5
              feather, and Cat got 2 loots: the Belt from Calegoboth and some
              resplendent shoulders. It was a nice little farm to end up the
              night. </p>

  Farming and backflaging... | <br>
  Posted by: Hideto on Monday, March 01, 2004 - 08:59 AM <br>
  <br>
  Well its been a while. These last few weeks have been very fruitfull. Last
  week we did A LOT of blackflaing and got many new peopel elemental flaged!
  Grats. We also got a lot of new applicants and members up to speed. We managed
  to off AD, TT, Hedge, HoH, Kos, Sayrn, Carpin, Bert, Behemoth, Agnarr 2.0 (we
  beat the broken version, was fun fight!), TZ, and VZ all in about 1.5 weeks.
  Great job. </p>
            <p>Not only did we do all those backflags but we managed to farm
              3 Avatars in PoAir. We got our first Plate ele drops and few more
              chain pieces. Now that we got more flaged, looked for more ele's
              to come! </p>
            <p>On sunday we caught Aten and some of the better VT mobs up. We
              headed over and before anyone knew it we were knee deep in a 45
              mob 1.5 hour all-out battle including 1 named. With only 1 monk
              and 2 chanters and a crazy ranger pulling, things got messy fast
              but someonehow we fought our way out of it. It was one fun fight.
              Just a few hours form the start, we got aten and got some good
              loot. Grats to Tannus on your Mail of Judgement, Dakonn on Crimson
              runed mask, Lortan on the Tailsman and Annattek my &lt;3 on the
              caster mask.</p>

            <p>We have also been checking out GoD here and there. Tongiht we
              explored Ferubi and got 2 nice rings (grats Psy and Calhin) and
              a hand full of aug (15 ac, +25hp/mana). Look for more GoD loot
              to come! Darnir also got some nice Shoulders.</p>

            <p>News: The last month <br>
  posted on 03-11-2004 04:41 PM by Thornsong </p>
            <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
              Well, a lot has happened in the last month. We have been busy working
                our way through the new expansion. In fact, we have one peregrine
                kill and that is it in Planes of Power (minus Time of course)
            since the expansion came out.<br>
            <br>
            GoD is a challenge and we are making
                headway. We are through the Ikkinz trials and having fun playing
                with the raids, where we are
              pulling out insane loots which is always good. Our necros are loving
            the 70 hp augments.</p>
            <p>This expansion is not for the feint of heart, but it does need
              some mad adjusting as several classes are feeling left out by it.
              I hope SOE realizes this and makes adjustments.</p>
            <p>As far as recruiting, we are considering adding a couple of classes,
              posts will be made in the next couple of days of what classes will
            be open. Cleric always is as usual.</p>
