              Tonight we joind DW for a seb key raid. I am not sure of the exact
              number but we had a good turn out. DW had several toons and COI
              contributed 5 toons I think. Doyen, Malvron, Merrylyn, myself(Lios)
              and I think one other though I cant remember who sorry. Any way
              with Mal and I tracking for the raid we were able to get about
              8 or 9 toons their keys in about three hours so it was a great
              effort by all. Thanks to DW for inviting us to join them and I
              am looking forward to many more combined raids.<br>
              May the Circle be unbroken. What

            <p>Tonight
              was fifth Thursday and was scheduled as a fun night with no xp
              however those of us who showed decided to go to Griegs End
                and get xp any way since we were all in that level range. As
              we were on the way there we discovered that DW was holding a raid
                in GE so we joined them to take out Grieg himself. After about
                one hour as we were light in the healer department the raid fell
                apart and most of the people there left. Doyen, Eihdger, Malvron
                and myself decided to stay and fight for awhile. We worked our
                way in past the courtyard and did quite well. There were a few
                other groups in the zone so there were no large groups of mobs
              to deal with.</p>
            <p>At 8:30 or so we started to work our way back out.
                We did well until we got to the second to last room before the
                ZI when we
                  ran into a group of 5 mobs. E mezzed one but the second one
              he mezzed
                  resisted and he and a friend, both Red to me, came after us.
                  We fought hard but were unsuccessful in killing them before
              Mal, E and I all died. Doyen survived only because just before
              I died
                  we recieved help from one of DW members who was still in the
                  Zone and happened to come by and see the plight we were in.
              He is a
                  62 bard and he and Doyen managed to kill the last one. After
                  that they drug our corpses to the zone line where fortunately
                  there
                  was a cleric with a clicky stick who consented to rez our corpses
                  and we were then free to return to POK and log out. All in
              all a profitable and fun night of EQ.</p>
            <p>Attendance has been way down
                lately for the scheduled events. We need to get that taken care
                of. There is a Seb key raid with
                DW tonight and ofcourse next Thursday is 50's xp night for COI.
              Come join us for the fun. May the Circle be unbroken<br>

                Hail Circle<br>
                This week we did 50s Ldon in Ever Frost.<br>
                What and Doyan were in the camp waiting for the rest to fill
                the group. Daemion and Glorvindale had signed up as well. Dae
                arrived at about six o'clock and Wuddor also came along. We started
                to ooc at about this time when Glorv made his appearance. We
                still needed one more and we had no healer so Doyan swithched
                to Nianque. We picked up Unclefairy a level 53 wizzy from DrangonWrath
                and now we were ready to go. We got our quest, a collect, and
                ran to the entrance. What pulled with Glorv also tanking. Nian
                slowed and healed and Daemion took
                care of any adds of which I would like to say there were not
                nearly as many as usual when What is puller. With Wuddor and
                Uncle adding DPS we had little trouble. The only time any one
                came close to dieing was when Nian had cannied himself down fairly
                low then drew agro and got Nuked to less than 15%. Just goes
                to show that you can't be too carefull when you canni. As you
              have probably deduced by now the crawl was an easy success. </p>
            <p>What
                  had to leave at that time while the others went to North Ro
              for a second crawl. I have not heard from Nian so don't know
                  the outcome. However given the makeup of the group I am sure
                  it was a success as well. Next week we go again. Also Friday
              is Kael and Saturday at 1:00pm Central time is a raid on the Hole.
              Check the calandar and see where you can have some fun and help
              out the Guild.</p>

              Hail all<br>
              We had a good night of xp grinding tonight as we went to Griegs
              End. There were six of us tonight, Myself as Lios, Malvron, Canor,
              Mezzerina, Doomes and Ssaurus. To start I ported us all to DSP
              and we had a short run to a Griegs from there. Mal did the pulling
              and we had good tankage with him
              as well as the two BL. Mezzerina did a good job of crowd controll
              and Canor kept us all alive. That is untill we got a lot of adds
              that one jumped on C and he died before I could heal him as I was
              about to evac Mezz said she
              had all mezzed so I canceled the evac. That turned out to be a
              mistake. Two mobs broke mezz at the same time one took out Mezz
              the other beat on me so I was unable to port us. We all died except
              Mal. We got rezzes and regrouped but it was time for Mezz to leave
              and Doomes need to leave as well. SO Mal, Can and I decided to
              go at it again. After a while we picked up a Warrior and did well.
              However Mall pulled a mob and a Big
              named mob decided to join the fun. I was the only surviver this
              time. Well now it is nine o'clock so after once again getting rezes
              we called it a night. Although we all died at least once we still
              ended with a good bit more mana than when we started plus there
              were two armor drops
              that allowed Doomes and Mal to improve there armor class. Thanks
              to all who came. Next week we do it again I think it is 50s Ldon
              and there is the Kael raid on Sunday.<br>

            <p>CT's First Avatar Kill <br>
              Posted by: Thespis on Tuesday, September 28, 2004<br>
              <br>
              The anticipation of raiding in the elemental planes has been building
              for a while now. CT has patiently endured the flagging and backflagging
              process and has finally reached a point where elemental raids are
              realistic. We still have some flag work to do, but we're well on
              our way to leaving our mark in Air, Earth, Water, and Fire. We
              recently made a foray into the Plane of Air and came out with our
              first Avatar kill. The Avatar of Wind came at us fast and furious
              but soon realized it was no match for the strength of our gathered
              force. Including some mini-nameds, 5 loot upgrades were obtained,
              a good night's &quot;work&quot;. Congrats to...
            <p>Leawen - Sparkling Shortsword</p>
            <p>Khallin - Scintillating Feather Mask</p>

              Our excited forces gathered into Sol Ro for our first major force
              attempt on Solusek Ro himself. We quickly dispatched his minions
              and soon found ourselves standing inside his chamber. There he
              stood in his regal attire, mocking us. Likewise, we began jeering
              back at him. No sooner than we did, we understood his immense powerful
              stroke from his weapon was no laughing matter. After re-grouping
              and examining him from a distance, Altus and CTs fellow officers
              devised an engagement plan that would lead us to victory. In we
              swept, casting our spells and arching our bows mightily into his
              back. Our strategy worked, for soon he fell to our feet and presented
              us with a Gold Ruined Mithril Knife and Gauntlets of the Burning
              Prince. We all rejoiced, examining his serene visage before hailing
              the Planar Projection and diving into Doomfire, the burning lands.
              Congratulations to Varilux and Yakkai for your hard earned treasures.
              Welcome the Crimson Talons to Doomfire! We stand united, staring
            down the road at the steps of Time.</p>

  Tired of sitting in boring XP groups every night when you could be raiding
  with a guild that appreciates RL over game life? Tired of being forced to be
  at almost every raid or suffer the consequences? I have good news for you!
  I just saved a ton by switching to Crimson Talon! That's right, you too can
  enjoy the benefits and be a member of Crimson Talon. The application process
  is reopened on a limited basis. I highly reccomend you check us out. </p>

  Due to the summer time busy RL schedules that many have, things have been quieter
  the past few months than they were late winter and early spring. CT has been
  steadily working on Sol Ro mini flaggings to get enough flagged for Sol Ro's
  room so that we can continue our progression and achieve access to the Plane
  of Fire. As has been the story of CT's existence, there are spurts of growth
  and periods of quieter activity, but we continue our steady push onward and
  upward. CT continues to balance EQ against RL and maintain its philosophy while
  remaining an effective higher content raiding guild.</p>

              <br>
              Brewall has completed his complete world map of EverQuest! This
              map has been a work-in-progress for many months and should show
              virtually every zone and zone connection in the game. As a guild,
              we have not explored much of GoD, so there may be some minor inaccuracies
              in those connections. Overall, the rest of the world should be
              extremely close, and is arguably the most complete map of EverQuest
            currently available. From Brewall, enjoy!</p>

  Brewall has updated his map of the Plane of Tranquility. When the map was originally
  done, it was prior to Crimson Talon having access to virtually any of the zones,
  and many of the stones were labeled based on word-of-mouth. Now that Crimson
  Talon has access to the elemental planes, Brewall has corrected all of the
  inaccuracies. In addition, the labels/color were redone for easier printing.</p>

So its been 2 months since the last update, school is back, the kids are off
the server mostly and the football is back on TV. We have been very busy of late,
raiding at pretty good pace and our guild is growing every day it seems. First
order of business is to welcome all the new people to our family. Too many for
me to remember at this point so please excuse me if I forget a name or 3. Kortad

Well, what has IoA been up to since our glorious TRC killing? More of the same
actually! Last night, in a true Illusion of Apathy showing, we managed to kill
not one, but TWO Elemental Gods in one night! Corinav was up, and was the last
piece for alot of PoTime flags, so we went in and he went down faster than [insert
random &quot;Make fun of Sveva&quot; ending here].</p>
                    <p>Grats to Sveva and Nelanbend on: Earring of Embedded Coral<br>
                      Grats to Manadar on: Maelin's Leggings of Lore</p>
                    <p>Then we were off to PoFire to see our good buddy Fennin
                      Ro. Now, normally this guy is just on farm status. However,
                      we actually had people that needed this flag, and for some
                      reason, a couple people needed only this for PoTime keys!
                      Weird! I thought they gave you this flag when you hit 65.
                      Well, they should at least. We zoned in, buffed, and an
                      hour later, we had a dead flamer on our hands, and no it
                      wasn't Gwendle!</p>
                    <p>Grats to Bloodveign on: Ifir, Dagger of Fire<br>
                      Grats to Xamren on: Earring of Eternal Flame<br>
                      ..!.. Sony on rolling back Xamren, Ianin, and Darnir, making
                      them lose their items, including Xamren's new earring,
                      and Ianin's new BP. Whatever. We'll get them back for them.
                      But the love for this game when it wasn't buggy, full of
                      problems, and when it actually HAD GM's, well, Sony, that
                      is lost forever my friends.</p>
                    <p>Next update should include Plane of Time screenshots,
                      as well as more slams on Sveva! Stay Tuned!<br>

  <br>
  First off, as I start this news post, I'd like to give a big huge FUCK YOU
  SONY!!! for many problems that we encountered last night. First off, had a
  few random people hav levels just... DISAPPEAR! Like &quot;OMG where did my
  levels go?&quot; kinda disappear. Then of course, there is the hours of trash
  clearing to get to the event that is the subject of today's update. THEN there
  is the actual event itself! But, no matter. In true IoA style, we dealt with
  it, and moved on. </p>
                    <p>Monday, September 27th, 2004, we all zoned into PoEarthB
                      while one goal on our minds: Plane of Time. Sure, we had
                      alot of obsticiles in our way. We had an encounter that
                      needed 6 enchanters at the very least. We had 6. We needed
                      all the healers we could muster. We didn't have enough.
                      We needed bards to help out with mezzing. We had 1. We
                      needed all our chanters the same level so they wouldn't
                      overwrite their own mezzes. Not bloodly likely. Do we see
                      a pattern here? So many things stood in our way of winning,
                      and those were the least worrysome. What WAS you ask? This: </p>
                    <p><img src="ioa103a.jpg" width="512" height="384"> </p>
                    <p>However, we would NOT be denied. One by one, the councilmen
                      came. One by one they were knocked down. One by one, they
                      were mezzed and off tanked. And one by one, they fell to
                      the power of IoA. For those of you that don't know this
                      event, there are 12 Councilmen. You have to kill all 12
                      of them in 7 minutes in order to get Avatar of Earth to
                      spawn, in order to win this event. How long did it take
                      us to kill all 12? Six mins? No. Five mins?? No. FOUR MINS???
                      Why yes! We breezed through them, and they went down faster
                      than I thought possible. The Avatar of Earth spawned, we
                      killed it, and there was joy among IoA. The end results?

                    <p> </p>
                    <p>And with that, came the loot. Grats to Chrono and Lortan
                      on: Ring of Flowing Stones</p>
                    <p><img src="ioa103c.jpg" width="600" height="423">Grats to Lewsh on: Rosrak's Greaves of the Primal</p>
                    <p>And congratulations to many Illusion of Apathy members
                      on: Quintessence of Elements</p>
                    <p>4 attempts was all it took for the members of Illusion
                      of Apathy to overcome this god aweful event. Sony, if any
                      of you read this, if there is EVER an event like this in
                      OoW, I swear to god.... But hey, at least I'm not bitter!!!</p>
                    <p>Now, normaly I would have some nifty quotes of some of
                      the funny/humorous/retarded shit people say in this guild
                      I call home, but I haven't complied them all yet. So, here
                      are some real quotes to fill the time until I can get some
                      better ones up:</p>
                    <p>Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence.
                      Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful
                      men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is
                      almost a proverb. Education will not the world is full
                      of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone
                      are omnipotent. The slogan, 'Press on,' has solved and
                      always will solve the problems of the human race <br>
                      --Calvin Coolidge </p>
                    <p>Great works are performed, not by strength, but by perseverance.<br>
                      --Samuel Johnson </p>
                    <p>Having once decided to achieve a certain task, achieve
                      it at all costs of tedium and distaste. The gain in self-confidence
                      of having accomplished a tiresome labor is immense.<br>
                      --Thomas A. Bennett</p>
                    <p>I FUCKING HATE DRUIDS!<br>
                      --Annattek</p>
                    <p>Congratulations to all the members of Illusion of Apathy,
            and I'll see you all in the Plane of Time!</p>

                      If that looks like fun, consider joining Mortal Omen! We

                        but if you do your chances at fun are 100% and your chance
                        at loot increases every time. We need level 62+ as we
                        push our way into planar progression. When we do raid,
                        and that is several time per week, the raids start at
                        8:30PM ET and usually end by midnight. If you are interested

                      Hello loyal fans. I has been a while since our last update.
                        Some of us have been too busy avoiding having to bank
                        AA's with the upcoming expansion to post.</p>
                    <p>Currently, we are trying to gulp down the new expansion
                      but haven't quite finished chewing the last one. We have
                      added a few good new members so we have someone to give
                      all that Qvic armor to. I would give them some respect
                      by listing their names here, but I am too busy trying to
                      avoid grinding to level 70 to post more.</p>
                    <p>In other news.. The 1st Epic 1.5 on Cazic Thule was won
                      this week. The lucky cheater worked his way through the
                      usual buggy-as-hell SoE quality checked quest. It was a
                      monk, who would have guessed. I guess now the floodgates
                      are open. Time to look out for #1. G'luck on the epic hunts,
                      only 126.5 more to go! Anyway send your love (and maybe
                      a shirt) to this guy:</p>
