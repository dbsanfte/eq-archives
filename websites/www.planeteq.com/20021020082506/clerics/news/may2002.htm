                           We're sorry to have to patch again so soon, but there are some issues that we felt should be taken care of right away.
<p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Fixed NPC's multi spawning in Grimling Forest
<li>Fixed a spawning issue related to the Coldain 10th Ring War
<li>Fixed assorted issues with several other zones
<li>Fixed a bug that made archery work like Innoruuk's own machine gun
<li>Fixed the Petrifier Cockatrice name truncation in Dreadlands
<li>Fixed Innoruuk's Chosen name truncation in the Plane of Hate
<li>Fixed a memory leak in the animation player
<li>Tavee's shoulders effect has been changed to specifically exclude affecting the duration of the Donal's Chestplate timer effect
<li>Naki's rings now report the altered casting time properly
<li>Most NPCs in the world will now return items that they don't care about.  Summoned pets can still be handed anything you like
<li>Fixed a bug that was causing GMs to be incomprehensible to players if they did not share a common language on Firiona Vie
<li>Fixed a bug that was preventing players from being able to turn off /roleplay on Firiona Vie
<li>Fixed a bug that was causing bard song modifiers (such as Instrument/Singing Mastery and Puretone) to break if the combined bonuses went too high
<li>Fixed a bug that was causing some quests to think they required a higher faction than they actually did
<li>A quest for a new high level Druid spell is now live (requires Luclin)
<li>Addressed a balance issue with high end Magician and Necromancer pets by improving them.  (Half of this change went live lastnight but was missed in the previous patch message.)
<li>Improved many rewards in an overall rebalancing effort of many Luclin encounters. (This went live lastnight but was missed in the previous patch message.)
<li>Made stacking changes to allow more spells to stack with Dance of the Blades.

<b>News arrives from Freeport</b>
<p>
The streets of Freeport have been overtaken by greed and turmoil. The conflict between the Dismal Rage and the law-abiding citizens of Freeport has reached a boiling point. New heroes have been called on to aid both sides in the constant power struggle of this city.  Numerous guildmasters have advanced the training that is given to all those brave enough to rise from Freeport, either for good or for evil. The Commonlands have also started to see strange new individuals and even stranger creatures.  There is also word that the Deathfist Orcs have begun to stockpile supplies for an unknown reason.  Citizens knowing the nature of the Deathfist Orcs are preparing themselves for anything.

<b>Late arriving news from Ak'Anon</b>
<p>
It has not been long since two wayward gnomes returned to their home city of Ak'Anon, one empowered with gifts of a Paladin of Brell and the other wielding the dark knowledge of a Shadowknight of Bertoxxulous. Already pupils have flocked to the chapel of the Deep Muses and the mines of the Dark Reflection to learn the secrets and skills these opposing masters possess. Led by their new champions of Brell, the Deep Muses, Gem Cutters, and Eldritch Collective have begun a campaign to exterminate the Dark Reflection from the mines of Ak'Anon and their cherished homeland, the Steamfont Mountains.

</uL>
<b>Spell Stacking</b>
<p>
General stacking changes: Some buffs were not being allowed to stack which now will stack, and other buffs were being allowed to stack which should not have. <p>
For example, many stacking problems with spells that have a See Invisible or Levitate component are now gone (e.g. Dead Man Floating), while a number of stacking exploits that granted too much regeneration, too much offense (ATK), too large of a damage shield, or too many hit points have been fixed.

<li> Casting deftness was changed to reflect the increases presented by the in-game help (5, 15 and 25%)

</ul>

<ul type="disc">
<li> A character may now have a horse, a pet and an Eye of Zomm at the same time

</ul>
<b>Sullon Zek Rules Change</b>
<p>
We have increased the number of character that can be created on an account to three. These characters, however, must be on the same team
<p>
<b>Firiona Vie Rules Changes</b>
<p>
Since the launch of Firiona Vie we have had tremendous support for this special server from players who want a very roleplaying immersive environment. Players have made numerous suggestions to tweak the ruleset a little more. We have taken many of those suggestions and made changes accordingly.
<p>
We will be keeping the following rules intact:
<ul type="disc">
<li> /ooc will remain unavailable to remind people that acting in character is strongly recommended.
<li> The Common language will remain out, to help maintain the feeling of race-based community and to allow people to continue to roleplay someone with a native tongue.
<li> The Trivial Loot Code and all of the special rules for no-drop items will remain. This has worked out nicely for the sense of community on the server.
</ul>
The one character per account restriction will remain.
<p>
However, we will be removing the following restrictions:
<ul type="disc">
<li> Anonymous/roleplay flags will no longer be required. They will remain available, but forcing anonymity on characters was causing undue problems finding groups and other such things that are essential to enjoyable gameplay.
<li> The language learning limit/speed restrictions will be removed. While the idea of limited languages seemed like a good idea, this is another item that was just making it too hard to actually play the game. Roleplayers that don't want their characters to be overly literate always have the option to play their characters that way.
<li> /shout and /auction have returned to unrestricted use to allow easier grouping and selling. People are welcome to filter those channels if they prefer not to see them, but the benefits of having them availabe is just too great. /ooc will remain disabled on this server. Obviously, acting in character on any channel is strongly recommended.
<li> Alignment restrictions has been removed. Forced restrictions for grouping make playing the game too much of a chore. Characters, however, may always decide who they wish to group with based on any factors the character perceives. If your Dark Elf won't group with a paladin, he doesn't have to (and shouldn't). If your cleric of Quellious wants to heal a necromancer because healing people is the right thing to do for him, then you should be able to do so. But not allowing these things is a restriction on your ability to play that character 'in-character', and a real hindrance to general gameplay.
</ul>
Again, it's important to understand that this is still a roleplaying preferred server. The rules that we are changing were often as much of a restriction to one's ability to roleplay as they were a help. And the artificial barriers to grouping, especially the trouble created in just finding a group, needed to be removed to allow people to actually play the game.
