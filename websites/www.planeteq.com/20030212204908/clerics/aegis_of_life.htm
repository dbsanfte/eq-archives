Camlend Serbold regards you as an ally -- what would you like your tombstone to say?<p>
You say, 'Hail, Camlend Serbold'<p>
Camlend Serbold says 'I say, good to meet you, Yumanea!  I am Camlend Serbold.  Some call me Serbold the Great.  I am the leader of the righteous order of paladins which serves the Temple of Life.  Together with the clerics of this temple, we defend the will of the great [Rodcet Nife] and smite all who dare to oppose us. '<p>
You say, 'what about Rodcet Nife?'<p>
Camlend Serbold says 'Do you feel your heart beating within your chest!!?  It is Rodcet Nife, the Prime Healer, whose breath keeps it in perfect rhythm.  If you do not pray to His glory then I assure you, someday when your heart begins to slow, you shall be crying out loud to Rodcet Nife. '<p>
You say, 'i have come to defend life'<p>
You say, 'i came here to defend life'<p>
Camlend Serbold says 'Then go to the Plains of Karana.  Somewhere there, Lord Grimrot is hatching his little plan for the Bloodsabers.  Bring me his evil scythe and his heart.  It is said that upon his death, his soul will be absorbed into this weapon of darkness.  Do this and be rewarded. '<p>
Camlend Serbold says 'We must have both Lord Grimrot's scythe, Pestilence,and his misshapen heart. '<p>
Camlend Serbold says 'We thank you for your service.  With Lord Grimrot's evil soul trapped in this scythe, all but the truly evil shadowknights would be able to wield it.  I would like to present you with this as a token of our appreciation.  Your devotion to life is supreme.  Go now, and serve life. '<p>
Your faction standing with Priests of Life got better.<br>
Your faction standing with Knights of Thunder got better.<br>
Your faction standing with Guards of Qeynos could not possibly get any better.<br>
Your faction standing with Bloodsabers could not possibly get any worse.<br>
Your faction standing with Antonius Bayle got better.<br>
You gain experience!!<br>
You receive 8 platinum from Camlend Serbold.<br>
<p>
Lord Grimrot spawns in South Karana, at the ruins just off the South/North Karana bridge (loc +14000, +1120). he has two forms, a live version (level 40 Shadow Knight) who drops the Pestilence Scythe, and a dead version (level 30 Shadow Knight) who drops the Decaying Heart. Both spawn in the same place under the tower that does not have a hat on it (you will see what i mean when you get there) the place holder is a Putrid Skeleton who remains standing.
<p>
Undead Grimrot is an easy kill. He harm touches for 301 and has a pet (if you let him summon one). Just root the pet, use your highest undead nuke on Grimrot then either nuke or atone the pet. Live Grimrot is tougher, he harm touches for 401 and has very high magic resist. You may want a melee friend on call for this one.
<p>
Both are a rare spawn on a 3 hour 17 min timer (+/- 10 mins). There are many theories about killing the place holder at certain times to ensure the spawning of the live or the undead version. I completed this quest not long ago and honestly couldn't tell you if these theories work or not.
<p>
You do need at least high warmly to complete the quest, but you do not need maxed faction. Killing Undead Grimrot took me from warmly to ally but did not max my faction, I was able to complete the quest no problems.
<p>
NOTE: This quest WILL make you Kill on Sight to the Corrupt Qeynos Guards.
