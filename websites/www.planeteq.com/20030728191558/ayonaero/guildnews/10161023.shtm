                This afternoon we saw the AL trigger mobs up so CB went for it. 
                Everything went very smoothly for each kill. The AL takedown was 
                our best yet. Great job all!!</p>
              <p>Later this evening we finally got in a second practice attempt 
                at the blood and took him down with no trouble at all with numbers 
                in the low 30's. Everyone listened well and pulled the plan off 
                without a hitch.</p>

                Today saw a nice quick and easy score of a CT kill for some nice 
                100HP items.</p>
              <p>Afterwards we headed to Ssra for our second attempt ever to kill 
                the High Priest. The life-span is so often about an hour after 
                prime time for so many mobs we considered ourselves fortunate 
                to see him the day after patch. At any rate we set up our crowd 
                control plan and strategy, practiced it for a bit then took on 
                the HP himself. With little difficulty the HP went down with a 
                THUD. Great job everyone and congrats on some nice new toys!!<br>

                Two patches in a row saw plenty of action. First patch we started 
                the Cursed cycle in ssra, but during the Exiled kill VI announced 
                &quot;No Cursed for J00! Come back one year!&quot;. Next we headed 
                to Akheva ruins for a quick run to Shei but found him already 
                occupado so we took out IV instead. Finally we headed to Ssra 
                again and took out Rhags 1 and 2 and got set up for the Arch Lich. 
                Unfortunately the zone crashed while we were attacking and of 
                course &quot;No Arch Lich for you!&quot;.</p>
              <p>Todays patch saw us hit Rhag 1, Xerkish the Creator then the 
                Arch Lich and finally the Burrower Parasite. Great job everyone 
                on a some awesome kills and teriffic drops. </p>

              <p>Planes Of Power is simply amazing. Nothing really more can be 
                said. By far the best expansion rollout. Everything looks polished. 
              </p>
              <p>Let's talk about server firsts. A brave group of EW soldiers 
                decided to try our hands at a Trial infront of the tribunal. Fun 
                for all, and a nice server first. If this is what we have to look 
                forward too, POP is going to be fun and new for months to come. 
                Defeating the trial, resulted in access to the Plane of Storms.

                It's to be expected. Kudos to the developers of PoP, very nice.

              <p>Luclin was a disgrace .. at least most of it. With VI compressing 
                such sparce content together with such huge character upgrades, 
                its just not fun since you have to do boring timesinks to make 
                up for the lack of content as you achieve more power. For PoP, 
                I hope they took notes from Velious and put in time sinks in the 
                form of ST zones etc... not literally of course but just the ideology 
                Velious had: Gaining power through actual content not green camps. 
                Where the banes to make you more powerful against your foe's(primals) 
                dropped off high end raid content not suicide inducing boring 
                mines and secluded areas... </p>
              <p>Anyway enough rambling... Wrapping up on Emporer's feels good 
                as we can finally let go of him and VT and move on to PoP. </p>

                Ayonae Ro server. Everything we do in VT would make for lots of 
                updates but VT has too many items dropping to stay sane and post

                No guildfirst for over 2 weeks! That simply couldn't be, and so 
                we decided to get our lazy asses up and finally (d)own Vyzh'dra 
                the Cursed. He had been a worse enemy for us in the past than 
                Arch Lich (and who knows us, knows what that means) - yes, we 
                did have a few shots at him but always fuckups and errors occured 
                and our best try left him standing over our dead bodies at 80% 
                i think. This time it was completely different and in the end 
                WE were standing over his dead body (killshot from Aragor above)! 
              </p>
              <p>But i'm too fast, let's start at the beginning. After our recent 
                kills of Shei Vinitras and the Burrower combined with our new 
                raidforce we were highly motivated to see lots of stuff dead, 
                and so ... 2 x Arch Lich Rhag'Zadune, 2 x King Tormax, 2 x Derakor 
                the Vindicator, 2 x The Statue of Rallos Zek, 2 x The Avatar of 
                War, The Itraer Vius and our old friend Rumblecrush all died horrible, 
                painful deaths. And after weeks...or even months, at least a long 
                time after we killed him for the first time, the High Priest of 
                Ssraeshza finally became a regular target for Landslide. Tactic 
                pinned down, execution smooth and Wiggo tanking - every of the 
                3 kills in the last 2 weeks was pretty good and a nice success. 
                3 dead High Priests and the funny thing is that the loot was nearly 
                identical every time so that some of us now have horrible visions 
                of being stuck on that loot combination forever :p. Blackouts 
                to Ginlaas and Aule, Ivory Crystal Greaves to Nasivin and Zxinn, 
                Supple Onyx Chains to Negil, Slivermind and Remete and our local 
                dr00ds scored a Sporecaller (Welas) and a Pearlescent Armlet (Minolena). 
                Grats everyone on the phat lewts and the kills. </p>
              <p>Some guilds have a mascot....some have a random guildmember that 
                brings them luck, but i think our current lucky charm are Emperor 
                Ssraeshza attempts, because so far after every try on him we were 
                able to kill Vyzh'dra the Cursed. Yes, we went for the Blood of 
                Ssraeshza and then Emperor Ssraeshza for the first two times with 
                the intention of bringing Mr. Emperor down, however especially 
                after the Mod Rod Nerf there is still some work to do before i 
                can post pictures of his corpse ( - sorry Majja). Never give up, 
                never surrender ... we're coming for you, ugly boss snake of Ssra! 
              </p>
              <p>Apart from more experience with the encounter we also got 2 Maces 
                of Confusion for Slivermind and Minolena, a Ssraeshzaen Blood 
                Cord for Samanusuke (check out the quotes...) and a Blood Veil 
                of the Shissar for Ysael. Grats all winners. </p>
              <p>Our latest (2nd) Vyzh'dra the Cursed kill took place last Thursday, 
                but the actual guildfirst happened on the Sunday before. After 
                our Emp attempt we moved down to the basement ... about 45 people 
                and 5 clerics were left. We were not sure if that would be enough, 
                but we needed more experience with the handling of this encounter 
                anyway and so we went ahead and triggered the cycle at 11pm. A 
                Glyphed Covered Serpent and Vyzh'dra the Exiled were quite frankly 
                a pushover and shortly after midnight we then engaged Vyzh'dra 
                the Cursed. As mentioned before, we were ~ 45 people, and 5 clerics. 
                Yes, a whole damn 5 clerics! It might be that people have done 
                this fight with less, but for us it was pushing the limits very 
                hard. Wiggo survived the first minutes and after the first reslows 
                this feeling settled in...the feeling that we could wipe any minute, 
                but also the will to keep things going, to keep the fight running 
                and running ... and then he was on 80%..60%..50%.. .<br>
                Every single person there did his best to keep the fight going 
                - nothing went wrong, the clerics proceeded to keep wiggo alive, 
                the shamans kept on keeping Cursed slowed and the wizards continued 
                to nuke the shit out of him. After what had been an eternity (fight 
                lasted ~ 45 minutes all in all) he enraged and then died with 
                ~ 45 cheering Landsliders beside him. Even Wiggo said something 
                positive - must have been the second time this year or so ;). 
              </p>
              <p>It was a great feeling...not only a guildfirst, but a very good 
                fight as well, so smooth and clean in the end that i am extremely 
                proud to have been a part of this raid as well as to be a part 
                of this guild. Sure we had a few deaths, but they were minimal 
                as the cleric number allowed no real battle rezzing anyway. Wiggo 
                tanked from the start to the end i might add, and he and Ghazghull 
                positioned cursed perfectly this time (as well as on our second 
                kill). </p>
              <p><br>
              </p>
              <p>(Please note Bobbib's excellent timing for throwing in a discipline! 
                *grin*) </p>
              <p>Not many of us, if at all, were even thinking of winning this 
                battle when we engaged, which makes the victory even sweeter and 
                more rewarding because it was one of those fights where all things 
                just come together and nothing goes horribly wrong, and then you 
                *actually* kill the mob too! Ownage raid everyone and excellent 
                teamwork, staying up late without bitching (1am when he died) 
                and then kicking his ass that hard couldn't have happened with 
                any better people participating. </p>
              <p>Oh oh, i sense that half of you didn't even really read up to 
                this point, but there is still more come, sorry :/. So Thursday 
                after another patch and Emperor attempt, we went to the Ssra basement 
                again and our worst fears became not true - even with the Mod 
                Rod Nerf we were able to kill Vyzh'dra the Cursed and it was no 
                less of a smooth kill than before. Our clerics were probably the 
                only ones sweating at one point or another ... /rude VI. Now that 
                we have killed him pre-rod patch and post patch i'm sure with 
                the right crew he's going to become our bitch. Oh yes, the loot! 
                Congrats to Amokh for the Opaline Charm and Kinian for the Vengeful 
                Mail of the Void and Vyzh'dra's Render of Souls off our first 
                kill, Wiggo for the Bloodfrenzy and Ghazghull / Aranyhaj for the 
                Cloaks of Dark Shadows off our second kill. </p>
              <p>Other loot worth mentioning: Elkahier got a Light Woodsman's 
                Blade - the first and only one out of all our Itraer Vius kills 
                so far, congrats. And off our recent High Priest kills grats Tharos 
                and me for the spell Marzin's Mark as well as Folhoffer for another 
                Elnerick's Rending. </p>
              <p>Whoops, i also just noticed that we fought a Coldain Ringwar 
                lately after making sure that Myrianor is nowhere near (we had 
                a painful experience with his hatred for d0rfs once ... ) . Congrats 
                Aranyhaj on her 10th Coldain Ring aka Ring of Dain Frostreaver 
                the IV or however the fuck it's spelled. </p>
              <p>Stuff worth mentioning but less funny is the ninjalooting of 
                our second last King Tormax. You might say now, well your fault 
                if you get ninjalooted ... that's even half true, but still doesn't 
                justify this greedy act. As well as the guilds that were there 
                in Kael and kept memory bluring him should be ASHAMED of how low 
                they sank that day. If they were the one that ninjalooted the 
                head, ST Key and the Axe we do not know, but GM's are involved 
                and we will either have an answer soon ... or never. Still at 
                this spot a big FUCK YOU to all those that think that just because 
                you fail at killing a mob you have the right to constantly memory 
                blur it after another guild pulled. And even THEN you failed to 
                take him off us because we still got the experience and were able 
                to loot everything not no drop - before said moron ninja'ed the 
                no drop items. We will not forget what you have done and we know 
                who was in Kael that day. Our dear public relations managing mastermind 
                Bobbib already has the revenge plan ready ... . </p>
              <p>What else is there to say. The last weeks meant some changes 
                for Landslide but we had a good time, even when we will have to 
                deal with the Mod Rod Nerf and the upcoming Planes of Power expansion 
                soon (that European players will probably get weeks after US players). 
                See you in the Planes of Powers (hopefully this year still :p)!

                We decided to practice training ourselves all to hell so that 
                we're ready next time we get FLAWLESSLY&#153; trained, with GM's 
                watching and ignoring everything that's going on... <br>
                Later, we realized it was just that Sangan forgot who's team he 
                was on. <br>

              <p> Guild first! Lady Mirenilla. About time we found this stupid 
                thing alive for long enough to make it not alive. We were so excited 
                about killing her, we just decided to give all the loot to Derryk 
                for umm.. I dunno. Why DID we do that?</p>

              <p> The bigger they are, the harder they fall. That looks like it 
                HAS to hurt. Props to Boneskin for the excellent wildlife photography.</p>
              <p>And yet again, monk pants go to a gimpy chain class. Injustice! 
                Nerf our AC and then have rangers and rogues steal our @#$% pants. 
                But, you don't see them pulling for us do you?!?<br>

              <p>So, after the monk nerf, he died about as quick and easy as Malcor

              <p>Lots of other stuff died. Who knows what all and what all they 
                dropped though. I just wanted to finish up some kind of news update 
                to get the death threats to stop. THAT MEANS YOU CAN STOP NOW! 
              </p>
              <p>In the next update, I will show you pictures of something so 
                rare that I'm not sure if it has ever been seen on our server 
                before or not. Stay tuned!<br>

              <p>PoP out today and some other stuff. Posted Monday, October 21, 
                2002 by Silvermaine<br>
                Hello Readers,</p>
              <p>Today the Planes of Power is now in stores and is live on the 
                servers. So, I'm sure there will be many rushing out to get a 
                copy or four and the advance on the Planes will be hugh. Pallys, 
                you've got a change to Slay Undead. Seems that the damage you 
                do won't be affected, but the way you take damage when you activate 
                it will. A 15% increase or up to that will you now take when you 
                have activated your skill of slaying undead. They have also changed 
                how AA points are refunded. If you have over 30 you can use them 
                (redistribute) them just after you log in but before you Zone. 
                If you Zone before you've redistributed them, they are lost to 
                you.</p>
              <p>Well, be looking for some stories about the Planes as I find 
                some folks to interview.</p>
