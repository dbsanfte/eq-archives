                Early this evening CB set up for a really great takedown of the 
                AoW. Only one transition the whole fight. Next we headed to SSRA 
                to take down Xerkish the Creator and had zero deaths during that 
                encounter. Dare I say.... FLAWLESS... Finally we hit the High 
                Priest once again. All in all an awesome night and a really great 
                score on some awesome drops.</p>

                Last week we had a failed first attempt and while on a second 
                attempt that was going smoothly the zone crashed. Last night we 
                took another crack at this cycle. After an overzealous nuker got 
                in one to many shots the cursed poofed out of position we had 
                to reset and try again. Our next try got hosed up on the engagement 
                but fortunately very few were lost and the reset was very quick. 
                Finally, our last attempt last night the agro management 401 courses 
                paid off and the cursed went down. Now if we can just get used 
                to the quirks of the raid channel feature!<br>

              <p>The Army of Eternal Wrath showed up in full force yesterday to 
                slay Aerin'Dar. After the quick dance with Aerin'Dar, we took 
                a run through the Halls of Honor. Expecting the Wrath of MARR 
                to slay us, it came as great shock to be greeted by kitty cats

              <p>A cold wind swept the frigid wasteland known as the Great Divide. 
                Warlords pulled their cloaks tight about their battle-scarred 
                plate. 1 by 1 the allies came, gathering to assist the dwarves 
                in their plight against.. blah, blah, blah, bullshit, yatta, yatta 
                this ain't no fucking fantasy book! We did 10th ring war and beat 
                dat ass! About 50 XA total showed up, with the help of 10-20 random 
                passerby's and others who came to pitch in. All went well, and 
                the evil Narandi spawned. I think Zistrix tried to solo him, 'cause 
                he died pretty quick. Evil Narandi dropped in about 75 seconds, 
                and we got some phat loots.</p>
              <p>I'd just like to say a thanks to all XA for the good showing 
                and help to complete this quest. Also, thanks to all those non-XA 
                who showed up and pitched in. And the special raid award to - 
                Punchen, who showed up and royally annoyed a lot of XA -- great 
                job, I wish I had more of that capacity!</p>

                After this alot headed out, and I'm off to bed. However, a good 
                lot of XA went to the Plane of Innovation to do a quest/raid. 
                Good luck to them, and I'll try to post the results manana.</p>

              <p>We were going to do the 10th ring war today, but the trigger 
                mob, Sentry Badain, conveniently forgot to show up for duty. Drunken 
                dorf! I sent out spoys to find and murder him, then realized that 
                would only hinder our efforts more! Hopefully tomorrow..</p>
              <p>Instead, we went to NToV again.. Boring! Well, not really! Started 
                off by clearing some flurries drakes, and some flurry drakes decided 
                to clear us once as well! They succeeded one time, but only once. 
                After that we moved up to Koi`Doken.. ah the memories. We have 
                NEVER killed this fucktart w/o a wipeout preceeding it. Its like 
                a curse or something similarly lame. Well, we got his pet dead 
                on first pull, then let him kill us and started again. Second 
                go 'round, Fishface didn't do so hot.</p>
              <p>Next, we paddled across Koi`s lake and laid a XA-style bitch 
                slap on Lady Mirinella. Think Aranoth went LD for the 29th time 
                this raid and died, but other than that no deaths. So we started 
                clearing to triplets to see what we could do. Setup, then pulled 
                ole Zlexak.. all was well till he got pulled a bit to far and 
                AE smacked the casters a couple times. We got him back to position, 
                and then he started bending over each and every melee for some 
                ass-lubbin. Needless to say, the red wurm that repopped and wandered 
                in from the north exit area didn't help things. He started giving 
                the casters some ass-lubbin. Only good thing about this was that 
                everyone got some lubbin, and a mass wipeout afterwards. We learned 
                a few things, and next time we go for this jackass of a dragon 
                hes gonna die.</p>

              <p>Some scheduled North raiding today, how fun! We got things rolling 
                a bit late, but better late than never. Laid the smackage down 
                on a good portion of the lower half of NToV.. Aaryonar dead, Ikatiar 
                the Venom dead, Eashen of the Sky dead, Dagarn the Destroyer dead(guild 
                first!), Lord Feshlak dead, Buncha named flurries/guards, dead. 
                Basically a 5 hour stint in NToV providing some good loots:</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Alwind - Reapers Ring(guild first!)</p>

                Well shit, I forgot screenshots, and Dagarn being a guildfirst 
                I would have liked to post one, but he died so far inside the 
                wall we couldn't get him out with dynamite, so /rude Dagarn. No 
                screenshots 1 year!<br>
                In other breaking news, some long-term, old school XA have moved 
                on from our guild, and I'd just like to take a moment to recognize 
                their time and efforts put into the guild: </p>
              <p>Rocax(used to masturbate during HoT farming so much I thought 
                his pecker would drop off)</p>
              <p>Terhas(told me that Heeman's RL GF was fat, and do this day I 
                taunt Heeman about it!)</p>
              <p>Elemak(didn't know him from old days, but he gives me a run for 
                my money on being a class act jackass at times!)</p>
              <p>Aalamar(We always agreed on one thing: to always disagree! However, 
                Aalamar is a good guy and hopefully he will do a road show in 
                my area one day.) <br>
                Zodiak(Good luck whatever guild you join up with, but none will 
                ever compare to XA..)</p>

                was right, IO is the best in game, the best on server and all

                got their stones. Congrats! <br>
                Finished off the night with an epic fight. Thank to the guildies

                1. &quot;Words cannont describe how I felt last night when I completed 
                my epic. I never thought when I started it that I would ever see 
                it. And especially to see it last night. Talk about unprepared. 
                I had to run to the bank and everything to get the stuff. I never 
                thought when I logged in last night I was going to end the night 
                with my completed epic. Talk about falling out of ones chair. 
                <br>
                I just want to thank you all for your support in me obtaining 
                my epic. Some were around for me in supportive words. Some were 
                around for the epic fights and died more than once. Some were 
                around for just turns ins which resulted in more deaths than the 
                epic fights. Especially in the difficult and trying turn in at 
                Sol B. Many deaths down there from those Fire giants. Some, even 
                after dying from going down there once for me, went down for a 
                second time to that hell zone for me. Some were around to guide 
                me thru the biggest quest I have ever completed. In all that, 
                they had to drop what they were doing to come help me. IO is truly 
                a wonderful and FUN guild. Thank you so much!!<br>

              <p></p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Grats Antonin on his White Dragon Scale<br>
                Grats Ezekkiel on his Runed Bolster Belt<br>
                Grats Jaana on her Word of Redemption.<br>
                Grats Saraza on his Pox of Bertoxullous.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>One night before this, we killed Master Yael and The Va'Dyn.</p>
              <p>Grats Anterak on his Strength of the Elements Quest that he finished 
                now<br>
                Grats Arnie on his Gold Inlaid Ulak<br>
                Grats Brutimus on his Shaderock Girdle</p>
              <p><br>
                And here are some other Events we had the last couple of weeks. 
                Due to the lack of updates, I felt like adding some screenshots 
                so you're up to date again.</p>
              <p>A few days ago, we have slained Klandicar. Took us two tries, 
                but I guess thats pretty acceptable.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Grats Everblade on his Heavy Dragonspine Vambs<br>
                Grats Vyxnn on her Matchless Dragonhorn Boots<br>
                Grats Taino on his Klandicar's Talisman, the first Sleepers Tomb 
                key of the Legend!<br>
                And grats Claies on a couple of Chanter Spells.</p>
              <p><br>
                Somewhen around that time, we went off to Chardok since we are 
                still in need of some Epic goodies from the Royals.<br>
                There's not much to tell about it. Same business as usual...</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Grats Zarta, Csirke, Anterak, Ulvrim, Jaana, Jobboom to their 
                Epic pieces.<br>
                Grats Daeceleb, Sofaris, Kalyxx, Jobboom on other random stuff. 
                <br>
                And a day afterwards, grats Jobbooom to his EPIC!</p>
              <p><br>
                Some 2 weeks ago (or so), we went off to Plane of Air. Thanks 
                to a very generous bugged Sirran The Lunatic (Thanks Verant!), 
                we were not able to reach our last Goal, the 8th Isle and the 
                Eye of Veeshan went unharmed. Anyways, we reached Isle 7 and got 
                our main goal, 2 Crowns of Elemental Mastery for Nikademuss and 
                Suntong. </p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Besides this, we had a big contest on Deathtouchs. Everyone wanted 
                to die the most, the best, the sexiest...<br>
                Rumors say we had around 40+ people die on Deathtouchs. The record 
                on DT's eaten by one person was told to be at around 12 deaths.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Grats Nikademuss and Suntong on their EPICS!</p>
              <p>Somewhen in between all this, we also killed the General in Kithicor 
                for Vyxnns Epic.</p>
              <p>Vyxnn, this is that girl here, that is too nosey to even fall 
                on the floor when she dies...</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Grats Vyxnn on herEPIC!</p>
              <p>So...<br>
                Lets count this all together (and I am sure I forgot several things...):</p>
              <p>7 Epics gotten for Gaediianiel, Kalyxx, Shamax, Suntong, Nikademuss 
                and Vyxnn <br>
                Killed like 10 rar enameds including: Telkorenar, Gozzrem, Lendiniara 
                the Keeper, Klandicar, Woushi, Gorenaire twice, The Va'Dyn, Trakanon, 
                Master Yael... <br>
                Gotten our asses handed to us way less then we used to ;)</p>
              <p>Conclusion is basically brought down to one sentence, a good 
                friend of ours stated very clearly:</p>
              <p>To come to an end with this big News update, I'll let you enjoy 
                some random shots taken over the past 3 weeks...</p>
              <p></p>
              <p></p>
              <p></p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Yes this is a bug, but it scared the shit outta me (can't say 
                it different)...</p>
              <p>Today, we're off to NToV, so maybe I'll just update these news 
                right away tomorrow. <br>
                Stay tuned for more news from the evil grounds of Ayonae Ro, the 
                Legend of the Jokers!</p>

                Plane of Nightmaire .... </p>
              <p>Tbh .. it wasn't all that scary and the mobs in there have excellent 
                graphics ... We ran into some ravens (blue cons to 60) some TreeAnts 
                (also blue cons), some Guardians (Red to 60/61) and Glooming (Yellow 
                to 60/61).</p>
              <p>All in all the plane showed a lot of room to exp at, the guardians 
                did best at 1% per kill for a lvl 60 (90% exp 10% aa).</p>
              <p> Very nice zone to run through, very doable with 1 group (1 War, 
                1 Necro, 1 Shaman, 1 Enc and 1Wiz is what we had).&quot; <br>

                Ok.. so were having a guild meeting last night, chattering away, 
                when I get this tell from Lbpuppy who sais &quot;my trigger mob 
                is up&quot;. So meeting gets cut short and Phoenix heads off to 
                the vast watery wasteland of TD. 30 min, a couple of lost rangers 
                (go figure), and on odd looking dragon later, Lbpuppy has his 
                last peice to finish his epic. Was a flawless fight with zero 
                deaths, damn fish wouldnt even eat the bard!!! </p>
              <p> And a couple of our proud new druid with his leaf blower! </p>

                WoW, what a fun day. Posted Tuesday, October 29, 2002 by Silvermaine</b><br>
                Well, their I was just grinding away when the call went out to 
                gather the forces and raid the day away.</p>
              <p>Our first stop was the Plane of Fear, there to kill the Broken 
                Golem for our Guildie Fuloo. Well, the BG went down and we find 
                the Wraith of Shissar up, next you know she is down and Jess gets 
                the head. With mop up done, we port off to Western Wastes to Slay 
                Klandicar for that key he holds. So, Klandi drops to our might 
                and then its off to Kael because the Vindicator was talking trash 
                about us and we just had to set him straight. So, Our mighty force 
                moves on into Kael and we slap him around really good for that 
                trash talk and put him out of his misery. </p>
              <p>Ok, now you'd think we're done for the day.. nope.. we're off 
                to Velks to slay the Sorcerer who was making fun of Fuloo and 
                his new epic. On the way to the Sorcerers room we find Beldrek 
                up and wandering around and we just slapped him around till he 
                gave up his loot. Then we move to Velketor's front door and take 
                out his guards, then proceed to take over his throne room and 
                slap that silly sorcerer around. Well, now that we'd taken care 
                of him, the remainder of our forces decided to head on down to 
                the basement and check on Lord &quot;theguywiththereallylongunpronaunceablename&quot;, 
                aka BOB, (Lord Doljonijiarnimorinar) and slap him around. Well, 
                seems our reputation preceeded us and he high tailed it for the 
                hills like the yellow cur he is. (translation, he wasn't up).</p>
              <p>So, all in all a very productive day. Grats To Fuloo on his brand 
                new Epic. Grats to all others who got some really nice loot.</p>
