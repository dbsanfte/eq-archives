              Jun 25 2002 12:58AM - Gimme the money ! Regor <br>
              Not much to say other than ... <br>
              Jorleag &amp; Lady Nev dead in record time, some nice work figuring 
              out how to pull the triplets without using pets, then the evening 
              finished with a money shot 
            <p></p>
            <p>Grats to those that got loot.. Lots of happy monks, shadow knights, 
              and bards <p>
              Jun 22 2002 3:14AM - Some NToV action... Deacis <br>
              So...Here we are again, on our merry way to NToV to gank some wicked 
              dragons, hopefully winning, getting some fairly decent loot... </p>
            <p>Should be fun, and enjoyable, laughs and kicks for all...But... 
            </p>
            <p>Some people just have problems with their long term memory, I know 
              there is a month between each of our slots in rotation but...That 
              isnt a reason to go blank each and every time we go there... </p>
            <p>Things went well for starters...Eashen went down without any trouble, 
              except for perhaps the worst positioning I have ever seen, despite 
              a heapload of guiding from the raidcoordinators...Died though, so 
              not the biggest fudge up...Grats Sicon and Leafric on their new 
              bracelets, and a monk from PE, whose name escapes me atm on a pair 
              of nice claws. </p>
            <p>Ikitiar hadnt spawned yet, so we decided to give Roy a go...Shouldnt 
              have done that...Got his guards though, but was amazing...Took about 
              2 minutes of shouting in caps before guard was disposed of in the 
              appropriate manner, which then again left us with an angry unslowed 
              Roy and some oom clerics...But we've been in worse...So we fought 
              on...then our AE of the hatchlings came back at us, landing 9 hatchlings 
              on us...Oh well... </p>
            <p>Regrouped, and decided to gank the newly spawned Ikitiar, to at 
              least accomplish something on what was a very long friday...So that 
              we did...Wasnt the prettiest fight, again positioning was way off, 
              just one death though, so wasnt total loss, just seen better before 
              :p Was the big monk day, and Grats Evade on his new tunic and boots, 
              and Scoff on a new pair of leggings from PE... </p>
            <p>So people started logging, but so what? Somehow people pulled themselves 
              up from the big puddle of mud we were crawling in, and executed 
              a perfect kill on Roy...And at the second he fell dead, at the rigth 
              spot, our 9 friends from before came back...:p So welcome CR, courtesy 
              of 9 very angry hatchlings...Actually worse CR on these than any 
              of our previous flurry wipes...Was actually so bad, that we had 
              to end the night after a good load of summons, and some good effort 
              done by a solid group of people. Infestalia got a new amulet, and 
              Hermi got a new mask, Meldinor from PE got an amulet as well. </p>
            <p>So wasnt a total loss...Just not very pretty... ;) </p>
            <p>Would like to thank the peeps on this picture for staying up, helping 
              people getting their corpses, and in general showing excellent support. 
              :) <br>

              Two more Epic Warriors<br>
              Posted by: Kylearan on Tuesday, June 25, 2002 - 06:16 PM CST <br>
              Grats to Aeria and Remusnoc on completing their Warrior Epic Quests! 
              That makes 5 warrior epics this month! </p>
            <p>
              Dirty Deads Done to Dragons<br>
              Posted by: Kylearan on Wednesday, June 19, 2002 - 04:48 PM CST <br>
              <br>
              Last night we made a quick trip out to Cobalt Scar to save the otters 
              from the ferocious Kelorek'Dar. Grats to Kiram on a Cloak of Crystaline 
              Waters and Thomdar on a hand down Rune Branded Girdle. </p>
            <p>Then this afternoon, everyone's favorite sexy dead chick, Sardilaav 
              spotted Severilous in EJ and the call to rally went out. A short 
              time later he was dispatched dropping a GDS for Aeria, a Treasure 
              Hunter's Satchel for Sardilaav, and the spell Avatar for Shamy. 
            </p>
            <p>To top it all off, right before we hit ToV tonight, we stopped 
              by WL and gave Wuoshi &quot;what for&quot;. Dropper her like a sack 
              of potatoes, then opened the sack to find two Emerald Dragon scales, 
              a Tanglewood Shield (Grats Heartilly), and a Scimitar of the Emerald 
              Dawn. </p>
            <p>That's 3 dragons in under 24 hours. Not too shabby :) <p>
              Warrior Epics come in threes!<br>

              BG completed it's 3rd Warrior Epic in 2 days on Saturday. Thanks 
              to the hard work of BG over the past few weeks in PoA and Chardok 
              plus a few assorted Sev slayings, congradulations goes out to Skirge, 
              Kiram, and Craszs! </p>
            <p>Also on Sunday BloodGuard teamed up with Illusion of Apathy to 
              take down Vindi. Tannus (IoA) and Heartilly (BG) were the big winners, 
              getting Vindi's BP and Head respectively. <br>

            <p>Thanks to Mirax, Kenji, and Whopper for the updates while I was 
              away. I'm still a little wiped from my trip, which I'm using for 
              the half-assed psuedo-update you're getting tonight. . Yep...this 
              ain't a real update. A real update, would have humour, pictures 
              and other crap. The real update, would have been up tonight, except 
              for the fact that Tormax spawned late night (2 am EST) and he needed 
              killing. A tormax death isn't really news, though...</p>
            <p>...But the first killing of the High Priest of Ssra is. This was 
              only the 2nd time we actually fought him, and he dropped like a 
              rock. Deaths were surprisingly minimal for the fight...I think we 
              were all a little shocked. Drops were an earring of Dissention and 
              a Wrath's Edge for Talons, and an Earring of Dissention for Cohort 
              (grats Me).</p>
            <p>Anyway...sleep calls.<br>
              <br>

            <p>Well, its been a while so I thought I'd go ahead and do the newspage 
              again, kinda missed it a little.</p>
            <p>I took some time off from those blasted steins and idols and went 
              with the alliance to hit the creator. Took a while, but 35 minutes 
              and hundreds of mod rods later, the big snakey hit the dirt. Grats 
              Ariyka and Hamilia on their leafy earrings to go with at least Hami's 
              cabbage one!<br>

            <p>Druss is in Hawaii. Mirax is firing idols for Cabbage Quest Earrings 
              so here's a little update on what we've been doing this last week.</p>
            <p>Somehow we lucked out and actually caught Tormax and Yelinak up. 
              Same for Zlandicar. </p>
            <p>We went down into The Deep with Talons and killed the Burrower 
              Parasite. Great work and patience helped us get it done our first 
              time through. Afterwards, we went and killed the Thought Horror 
              Overfiend.</p>
            <p>Spent some time in Ssra with Talons on Saturday. Killing the Creator, 
              Rhag 1, Rhag 2, the Glyphed and the Exiled. We also picked up various 
              Shissar Ring quest pieces. </p>
            <p>Sunday we killed Dain. </p>
            <p>Just to show that we can give praise as well as criti ... er point 
              out &quot;situations&quot;, thanks to GM Brioma for assisting Furran 
              with his petition regarding the 8th Shawl. Furran's a good guy, 
              it's nice to see him get a break.</p>

              Well, our juggs campers noticed Trakanon had dared to show his face 
              once again in Old Sebilis, so the call went out far and wide, and 
              The Council of Grey came to Old Sebilis to lay waste to the poison 
              dragon yet again. After a couple of mishaps with early aggression 
              from the hapless dragon, we settled in, and did it right. The Council 
              rushed Trakanon, and withstood his first attempt to lay us low with 
              his poisonous breath. Then our group unleashed the full fury of 
              CoG on the poor beast, and his first breath turned out to be also 
              his last. Not one cog death. Flawless Victory. Great work all! Congratulations 
              go out to Mancinia for her new Cloak of Piety, and to Katalia for 
              her new Tolan's Breastplate. The four teeth were awarded to some 
              other CoGs, and many spells were looted during the outing. Nice 
              work CoG!<p>
              City of Grey Mist <br>
              Posted by Naezariit On Jun 18 2002 At 09:49:20 AM <br>
              Well, a hearty band of CoGs moved into the City of Mist last night 
              with hopes of encountering the fabled black reavers. This was our 
              second trip into this city in as many nights. When we got there, 
              encountered two different groups of ppl, one being led by Saoshen, 
              guild indeterminate, and other being led by Sceaze of Expatriate 
              Loreweavers. Careful coordination with these groups ensured minimal 
              stepping on each others toes. One of our maneuvers resulted in death 
              for Sceaze and crew, so we rendered assistance and rezzed them. 
              We were able to net a second Torch of the Elements in as many days, 
              gratz Jan. The black reavers were more stingy however, and we came 
              away with no jade reavers. Katalia did pick up a green jade broadsword, 
              gratz Katalia. I believe a good time was had by all, and we even 
              were blessed with the presence of a mad monk!<br>

              Quick trip into Fear this evening to get the Wraith of Shissar that 
              Chantress has been camping for weeks now. Grats to Chantress for 
              getting our second enchanter epic in just days! While we were there, 
              Yain showed up and needed the broken golem. Since we were there, 
              we killed broken golem for him.

              Finished Kestel's enchanter epic this evening with a quick trip 
              to kill the Tangrin and final turn-in's. Grats to Kestel for getting 
              his epic!</p>
            <p>JUN 18, 2002<br>
              We needed a few epic items from Hate and decided to raid it this 
              evening. On the first floor, we managed to get Kestel's vampire 
              essence, 2 Eyes of Innoruuk [Imotep &amp; Kenatal] and Alone's Ranger 
              stone. After laying waste to the first floor, we decided that we 
              wanted our first Inny kill. We ventured out to the second floor 
              and cleared the way to the god of hate. One excellently executed 
              fight later, Inny lay dead at our feet. Grats to Immolar for the 
              Pauldron's of Power!<br>

              Sup n stuff - Merauk (6/27/2002 10:52 AM) <br>
              <br>
              Rauk been working hardest ever on his NWN module. After 6hrs of 
              work made best module ever that Angrie and Xate destroyed in about 
              3 minutes. Working with scripts that have no documentation is fun. 
              Especially when the closest thing to C program you have done is 
              Pascal and that was 16yrs ago.</p>
            <p>Today represents sort of what we consider our anniversary. The 
              original formation date is lost in the sands of time, but it is 
              within a day or two of this date. Hard to believe two years has 
              gone by already. I believe the only original founders still left 
              are Shadestorm, Eastwood (Zorek), and Tyrani everyone else we killed 
              and buried a long time ago. While a lot of the new members are cool 
              they will never be as cool as us, cause well we are the coolest 
              and they aren&#146;t. </p>
            <p>Getting back on Emperor track this weekend so not doing much of 
              anything past couple of days. Five days solid of attempts all of 
              which worked well just got tiring after awhile. Hopefully the planets 
              align this weekend and we slay him only.</p>
            <p>Peace out T9000<br>

              Server fixed again, fucking Gaef breaking it all the time meanest 
              ever.</p>
            <p>Have continued our relentless ass pounding of the Emperor. One 
              of those fights where if you make it to 90% you are going to get 
              to at least 20%, then either finish the last 20% or explode. Not 
              overly difficult but certainly complicated enough where if one thing 
              goes wrong you get to coffin out.</p>
            <p>Either way he is going to die or we will, hope to post the fat 
              kill shot soon.<br>

              Did someone say something about epics?</p>
            <p>Well, Phisto finally got his robe for the monk epic, so late Tuesday 
              night a quick trip to Air ended with Gwan dead, then Wednesday we 
              smacked Trunt so hard he cried like a schoolgirl with a skinned 
              knee. After that, it was a quick trip to LoIO gathering far more 
              force than needed where we proceeded to kill Vorash and Deep, and 
              spawned Xenovorash who we summarily kicked in the junk and took 
              his lunch money.</p>
            <p>Was a good time, especially with the little level 20 twink someone 
              had out there talking about how we had too many people for the fight. 
              No kidding we do, but we're having fun beating up silly mobs, unlike 
              the silly sod who sits around watching other people do stuff.</p>

              we even ended up turning people away because we didn't want to wait

              News: For three nights this past week, the House has battled valiantly 
              and with near perfection in fJune 24, 2002</p>
            <p>News:</p>
            <p>The House fought in the Halls of Testing within the Temple of Veeshan 
              on Tuesday of this past week and Tayzia was able to unearth the 
              rare silk robe along with other drops for the House. On Friday and 
              Saturday night, we stomped around in the Akheva Ruins searching 
              out spell drops and the like.</p>
            <p>This coming week will take us back to the Halls of Testing on Tuesday 
              night. On Friday night, we&#146;ll be invading Chardok to seek out 
              their Queen for Faerus. That kicks off at 9pm EST. On Saturday, 
              wizards willing, we will be heading to Veeshan&#146;s playground, 
              the Plane of Air in search of a Spiroc Wing Blade. Portal time is 
              8pm EST from the Western Commonlands.</p>
            <p>This past week, Rivka&#146;s wife gave birth to a baby roguette 
              named Hilary. Congrats to the happy family on their addition. </p>
            <p>Epics:</p>
            <p>The quest to defeat the rogue Celestial Fists continues for Lonandar. 
              With the assistance of his mentor, Morts, Lonandar has determined 
              that the next Celestial Fist he needs to face and overcome is Gwan. 
              Gwan awaits the challenger in the Plane of Air and will hopefully 
              meet his doom on Saturday night.</p>
            <p>Hopefully all will go as planned this coming Friday and Saturday 
              night in Chardok and Sky and we&#146;ll have Faerus that much closer 
              to our first Warrior epic.</p>

              night 10th Coldain ring wars. With minimal people this encounter 
              still rocks imo. Grats Fane and Korkrest on your sick new rings.</p>
            <p>Got Dain? We did...Twice. Took out King Dain a couple times for 
              old times sake. Loots were decent, people were happy, and we all 
              cried irl reminiscing of old times. </p>
            <p>Waxed CT, because we could.</p>
            <p>Took a late night trip to VP and got waxed...Who's bright idea 
              was it to go back to that dump anyway! </p>
            <p>Still, the brunt of our time was spent busting our asses in the 
              gayest expansion ever known to man. Took the crew up to the Emperor's 
              room a couple of times and inched our way closer to our goal. I 
              doubt we'll be doing much else besides this encounter from now on, 
              until the day he dies. I can smell VT already.<br>

              But going LD seconds before you kill the target is even gayer. So, 
              sorry all, no juicy pic of the Creator lying dead on the ground, 
              but you catch the drift of what happened...Shiney trinkets of speed 
              for all! Grats Xatryil and grats Enferno on your mage dagger.</p>

            <p>Yesterday we got to do a Shawl War for our fearless midget leader, 
              Thornsong. It was a first for many of us and a fun event. Here's 
              some script from the end of the quest:</p>

            <p></p>
            <p>Thanks to Farea for the pics and grats Thornsong on your shawl!!!</p>

              Goodnight Now Ladies And Gentlemen, Goodnight Now Ladies And Gents....<p>
              Do you wanna kill the AoW? How about North TOV dragons, Cazic-Thule, 
              Tunare, Tormax, Yelinak, Arch Lich, High Priest, Burrower Beast 
              and Fippy Darkpaw?</p>
            <p>Then do we have a bargain for you. Shadowed Soul and The Divine 
              Alliance have had enough. We are tired and scared and ready to move 
              on. This means that the entire alliance is FOR SALE and can be yours....lock, 
              stock, and primal.</p>
            <p>You get:</p>
            <p>- Over 10,000 levels of characters<br>
              - Fully decked out Main Tanks and Clerics with mana pools to kill 
              for<br>
              - Keys to Veeshan's Peak, Sleeper's Tomb and Emporer Ssraezewhinybitch<br>
              - Items that no longer drop in game, such as Clawed Guardian Bracers 
              and Gnome Illusion Masks<br>
              - AA skills out the wazoo<br>
              - The chance to de-level whichever of us has pissed you off</p>
            <p>What we want:</p>
            <p>- Lots of cash. We had so much fun at the Austin gathering last 
              weekend that we're shooting to buy us a couple of these or for enough 
              to send all alliance members and their families to Hawaii for a 
              couple weeks.<brp>
              Sure, we don't have any damage output and we are all hybrids, but 
              if we can kill stuff, you can kill stuff. It shouldn't be hard or 
              take skill...we are just a bunch of whiney kids who wanna cash out 
              our toys and go home.</p>
            <p>So, if you wanna step up in the world, contact an alliance officer 
              SOON with an offer.</p>
            <p>Remember, this is a package deal, you are bidding on ALL of it. 
              There will be no partial sales allowed, you gotta buy the whole 
              thing....primaries, alts, applicants, the works. <br>
              <br>

              87 - HISSSSSSSS!<br>
              <br>
              Thursday I forget .. </p>
            <p>Friday to Sunday : </p>
            <p>Spent all weekend farming and combineing and farming and combineing 
              and foraging and combineing and foraging and farming and farming 
              and foraging and paying for and searching, etc. etc. etc. for things 
              and people to do the Earring of the Solstice Quest. The guild is 
              looking to bang out 35 either tonight or Tuesday, should be a good 
              day </p>
            <p>other news, went back to goblin killing, still KoS after 1600 faction 
              hits </p>
            <p>The big news of the weekend was Nariel, Chantress of the night, 
              finally finished her Shissar Stick of Hastiness and there was much 
              rejoicing. Then she baked and baked all weekend as well as the quest 
              for Level 60 so she can give out C3 like Solias does .. maybe she'll 
              VoG me! </p>
            <p>Umm, other then that .. it was a nice (to me anyway, some of our 
              more diehard fools think otherwise) change of pace of dragon killing 
              1 day, giant killing the next (or same) and then every 2nd day in 
              sleepers ... 3 constant months of that is getting a bit tireing 
              and this weekends flurry of tradeskills was great. Oh, and farming 
              faction in Droga at Chief netted me 2 Idols .. boom!</p>
