You say, 'Hail, Perrir Zexus'
<p>
Perrir Zexus says 'Salutations, Yumanea! Your devotion to our Lord Innoruuk is evident in your actions and on your soul. As a member of the Spires of Innoruuk, you are required to obtain and wear the symbol of your station among the clergy. I can award you the [hematite symbol of Innoruuk] worn by the initiates of the Spires. '
<p>
High Priest Perrir Zexus wants you to prove your worthiness. He wants you to collect 4 Halfling woven grass amulets to prove your worthiness. These can be found on Halflings in Nektulos Forest.

<p>
Hail Ithvol K'Jasn and tell him 'I am an initiate'. He will tell you to go and slay Master Whoopal in Nektulos and take his head to Draxiz in the The Tower of the Spurned. (Master Whopal spawns at a Totem Pole just west of the bridge near the shore. His placeholder if Questor Dunden.) Slay him and you will get a Halfling Head.
<p>
Return to Neriak Commons and give the head to Draxiz. He will give you a mask, which looks like a head, that will give you 1 guise of halfling.
<p>
Now head down to West Commons and look for an npc halfling called Wallin Slyfoot. He wanders a bit, but usually ends up on the path near Kitchor. When you find him active the illusion spell and tell him that you will assist him and he will give you a letter for Master Whopal (Hehe..he's dead)
<p>
Now return to Neriak Commons and give Draxiz this note. This will cause the Leatherfoot spies to spawn. They spawn in a small room behind the waterfall near the PoD. Kill them (there may be two) and one of them will drop another Halfling Head.
<p>
Return to Neriak 3rd Gate and take this head and your Initiate Symbol to Ithvol. He will reward you with your Disciple Symbol
<p>
Note: Dealing with Draxis will lower your Dead Faction. It is a small hit but if you are Dub, then think twice before doing this part.

This is given after you complete the disciple quest.
<p>
Hail Ithvol K'Jasn and tell him 'I will deliver the provisons.' He will tell you to go the Neriak Foreign Quarter and tell Dran Slug Rembor that 'Ithvol sent me'
<p>
Travel to West Foreign Quarter and tell Dran ‘slug’ Rembor, 'Ithvol sent me' Dran will ask you for 2 steel bonings. These can be made with the blacksmithing skill. After you give the bonings, he will hand you a crate and says 'Heres the crate of provisions. Take this to Dragoon Szorn in the Lesser Faydark immediately!
<p>
Travel to Lesser Faydark to the camp at (loc -900, 1155) and give the crate to Dragoon Szorn. He will hand you a receipt and ask you to find the [missing shipment]. If you ask about it he will tell you to 'Seek out Ennixy and tell her [hate be my guide]. She typically works from her homeland in the steamfont mountains.'
<p>
Travel to Steamfont and talk to Ennixy Frennor (a gnome at 1350, -850). You say, 'Hate be my guide' Ennixy will ask you to slay a paladin named Crusader Swiftmoon. He will spawn right near her. After you slay him he will drop the missing crate and his head.
<p>
Travel back to Lesser Fay and take the crate back to Dragoon Szorn and he will give you a Voucher of Services Rendered.
<p>
Travel back to Neriak 3rd Gate and give to Ithvol the Voucher, the head of Crusader Swiftmoon, the receipt for the provisions, and your Disciple Symbol of Innoruuk. Ithvol will then give you your Regent Symbol of Innoruuk.
