              May 20 2002 1:05AM - A wee bit of NToV Deacis <br>
              Finally our turn again ;) And what ho! 
            <p>Iki, Eashen and Roy were up, so our turn started, and of course, 
              eager as always we ran our coconuts to ToV for some dragon slaying 
              action. First up was this little bugger: </p>
            <p>(insert annoying picture of a wyvern you have all seen before, 
              dead, half stuck in a wall) </p>
            <p>Someone got some loot, but not in Anavon ;) </p>
            <p>Then we killed Eashen, always nice ;) </p>
            <p>(insert yet another picture of a wyvern stuck in wall, looking 
              rather dead) </p>
            <p>Grats Talryn on his new gloves ;) </p>
            <p>Then the lord almighty, ruler of all he beholds, slayer of many 
              o'ranger, Roy... <br>
              Pull 1...Seen better attempts, but one guard down before getting 
              asslinged... <br>
              Pull 2...Thanks Andreas for pulling a Flurry ;) <br>
              Pull 3...Grats Baldrith on his new mask, and rest of alliance on 
              a flawless kill ;) Devor, Hador and Bioengine need some new schooling 
              with Uros I think though...and his whip. ;) </p>
            <p>(Insert picture of very dead Roy, actually not stuck in wall) </p>
            <p>See you all tomorrow ;)<br>
              <br>
              May 16 2002 9:32PM - Something for all the sentimal and old people 
              out there... Deacis <br>
              Today a miracle struck the Cazic thule server, and for the first 
              time in a very very long time, this wondrous being decided to pay 
              us a visit: Yiau.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><br>
              For those of you, who have been on the CT server for more than two 
              years, you should be able to remember this wonderful enchanter, 
              I do anyway ;) She hijacked her brothers comp to pay us a visit, 
              and I must say it made my day at least ;) </p>
            <p>Hope the people who miss her, were able to talk to her a bit, and 
              remember old times of joy and fun ;) And if you didnt, then I hope 
              she will be back in again, before 2 more years pass ;) </p>
            <p>/hug Yiau :) <br>
              <br>
              May 15 2002 12:13AM - We loved the snake temple.... Deacis <br>
              Oh yes we do.... </p>
            <p>In fact so much that we arent doing anything else... </p>
            <p>Getting exp though, so what the hey :p </p>

              I'm sure ya don't want to hear about. </p>

              Fungus Grove Rumble <br>
              Posted by Agilent On May 17 2002 At 10:59:41 AM <br>
              Last night we decided to get some exp so a few groups headed to 
              do the Caller spawns in Fungus Grove. At first the spawns were too 
              slow so we decided to trigger the biggest wave. The highlight of 
              the event was when after 40 min or so the spawn timer went crazy. 
              We had 10 or so mobs up and two named up at the same time. Needless 
              to say we dispatched them. Grats to Allegory on a rogue cloak and 
              everyone else that got loot.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>After FG I mentioned going to the Deep to try to get some levitation 
              spells. It was pretty late but managed to get a group of a 60 enc, 
              52 bard, 2 warriors (50, 60), 56 shaman and a 58 Mage. The fight 
              in was rather tedious but we eventually reached our goal. After 
              30 min of hunting at camp the named mob spawned and dropped levitation. 
              Grats to me, ilent, on finally getting the componentless levitate. 
              After a few spawn cycles a few of us were tired and it was late 
              so we had to start fighting out as we had no porter and Verant managed 
              to nerf CoH in the zone. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>We were almost half way to the exit when I got the strange gut 
              feeling. I told Aaneck one of our enchanters to check the Verina 
              Tomb spawn for the enchanter epic because my feeling was that one 
              fo the mobs was up. He checked and she wasn't, but then I said well 
              then it's Cazel (Aaneck needed this piece). Moments later we see 
              a guildie in Oasis saying &quot;Cazel is up&quot;. After our late 
              night Deep crew zoned to saftey we headed to Oasis for some Cazel 
              smack down. Our main tank was Cabrine (bard), with 2 mage pets and 
              a chanter pet to help tank. Toasted the menace in under 2 min. The 
              newbies in Oasis were rejoicing. Congratulations to Aaneck on another 
              epic piece. Only four to go and he has all the hard ones out of 
              the way. Not much longer now till we have another snake stick. Was 
              a very fun and rewarding night all around...<br>

              Working on a a few monk and rogue epics this evening. Actually starting 
              to run low on epics to complete.
            <p>MAY 17, 2002<br>
              Another large raid on Cazic-Thule. Penetrated deep within the zone 
              and managed to come away with a couple interesting items. Everyone 
              is enjoying playing in a new place.</p>
            <p>MAY 15, 2002<br>
              Large scale raid on Cazic-Thule this evening. Laid waste to the 
              zone.</p>
            <p>MAY 14, 2002<br>
              Raid in Iceclad to finish Greymask's eigth shawl. With 30+ players 
              there showing support (and not wanting anyone to lose the seventh 
              shawl), the wandering dwarf was scarcely touched. Other loots dropped 
              as well from the attacking mobs, including a helmet and a caster 
              primary hand item.</p>
            <p>MAY 12, 2002<br>
              Crimson Talon returned to Grieg's and slayed Praetorian Myral. Nothing 
              like killing a 300k HP mob that wields a weapon that procs divine 
              aura. A very long fight to kill him, but he went down neverless. 
              Dropped a very nice 1hs weapon.<br>

              Wanted to say Thank you to Drizo, Andorean, and Xmortis for helping 
              Fairsong complete a quest for some really nice gloves. It took 2 
              days of hunting and a couple of deaths by Katslayer but I finally 
              got all the giant heads I needed to complete the quest. Thanks for 
              helping.<br>
              <br>
              Did a seb key night to help those who didnt have em yet complete 
              this quest. Grats to Badexposure,<br>
              Amadicia, and Xxeeme for getting their keys. Grats to Amadicia for 
              snagging a little wizzy stick and<br>
              Badexposure a hangmans noose.<br>
              <br>
              Had another successful run with LoN in both Kael and decided to 
              hit Umbral Plains instead of doing Kael. A good time, decent loots, 
              and good exp was had by many.<br>
              <br>
              Saturday a bunch of us went gem hunting in sirens grotto and picked 
              up some much needed gems. Grats to Kalander for taking home a netted

              <br>
              We finally got a chance to fight with the cursed and were doing 
              well. We are happy to say they did fix the encounter if another 
              guild tries to do curse and fails. But all is not happy seeing that 
              if any guild is attempting any mob where a trap can be set off while 
              they are pulling to the area, everybody below them gets nailed as 
              well on the trap's effects. So we had every cleric, every caster 
              nailed with the manadrain so because of this, we had to camp and 
              let it despawn. So please fix the z axis in ssra.<br>

              Lord, I am *SO* Tired, How Long Can This Go On?<br>
              Cuz we've been workin in a coal mine, goin downtown...</p>
            <p>Erp, wait, that wasn't it, but it's been close.</p>
            <p>This past week, SS &amp; DA have been busy as hell running about 
              killing stuff. I would recount it all, but honestly, with the sleep 
              I am losin trying to keep up with all these hoops VI wants me to 
              hop through, I can't remember what I did last night. The only thing 
              I am sure of is that it wasn't sleep. If anyone reading this saw 
              me this week, please email me and let me know what I was doin, so 
              I can write something snazy about it for our next update.</p>
            <p>On a related note, I think I will share my own silly views on Luclin. 
              The new VI high end model does one thing amazingly well....it insures 
              that only the truly insane will be there. If you are only mildly 
              crazy, or a low volume player, in the back of your mind you could 
              always think that under the right circumstances, when the planets 
              are lined up in just the proper order and you have sacrificed the 
              required 3 Chickens and drank the rum....you might get in on the 
              slaying of some Uber Mob. Nagafen, Trakanon, Cazic-Thule...somebody. 
              If you just play your cards right, someday you can get there.</p>
            <p>Welp, no longer. There is now a pretty firm ceiling on where you 
              can go and what you can do in Luclin if you don't want to prove 
              you are nuts. It's nasty and long, and HARD to get to some of this 
              stuff, and frankly, it is starting to bother me less. As time goes 
              on, the competition for any mob gets tougher, but unless VI changes 
              the design of the expansion, I can't see that really happening in 
              Luclin, or at least not as bad as it has gotten in every previous 
              expansion.</p>
            <p>So, is this a good or a bad thing? Well, in the end it is just 
              a thing, but like I said, it is starting to bother me a lot less.
