<b class="heading">Analeia, Part III</b><br>
<i>by</i> Penya Dreamlight

<br><br>
Worlik looked out into the desert edge, past the small hut inns and into the grassy commons. In the distance he could see the lighted tops of the druids circle, its polished gray stone in stark contrast with the wilderness around it. Sighing in frustration, he turned back to the sight of the stone tunnel that had been carved into the desert wall. Looking at the rag-tag bunch who had hesitated there, he said irritably, “I can’t believe I am going in there, especially with <i>you</i>.” He scowled at the dark elf who was standing a little too close to Loralie for the dwarf’s comfort.
<br><br>
“Well, if you think I want to spend any more time with you than I have to….”Anarchy began in iratation.
<br><br>
“Now, children,” Analiea cut in, “Let’s play nicely.” The comment earned her a glare from both men as she turned to peer into the passage. “I want to get this over with.” 
<br><br>
Anarchy grimaced at the paladin’s back, doubting the sanity of coming to this place with these people because he thought he may have seen his face on piece of silk. Beside him, Loralie frowned peering into the darkness, “Do we <i>have</i> to do this?”
<br><br>
Analiea shrugged, “The city symbol of Befallen is on the medallion.  Rumors have been circulating for months that this place has become occupied again.  It’s close to Freeport. It seems like a good place to start.”
<br><br>
“I just want to know what we expect to find,” Loralie commented.
<br><br>
“I don’t know what we will find,” Analiea replied, “I don’t even know what to look for. All we know is that there are some very strange things going on and we are trying to find out about them.”
<br><br>
Worlik snorted, “Great, I’m going to likely die with a damned inkie just because you are fishing for information.” Anarchy stiffened but made no retort.
<br><br>
Analiea looked at her friend and said wryly, “Yesterday you thought it was a great idea.”
<br><br>
“I wasn’t here yesterday,” the dwarf replied, squinting into the darkness, “I don’t like the feel of this place.”
<br><br>
“None of us do,” Analiea agreed, “but it’s time to go in.” Without another word, Analiea walked into the passage.  Worlik grumbled something about impulsive elves and followed. Anarchy moved to go next, but was stopped when Loralie laid a gentle hand on his arm.
<br><br>
“Don’t mind him too much,” the magician whispered, “He doesn’t hate you, just testing your patience.”
<br><br>
Anarchy raised one eyebrow, “How do you know?”
<br><br>
Loralie smiled and said, “He hasn’t tried to get you to fight him. Come on, let’s catch up.” She proceeded into the hallway and Anarchy followed, allowing himself to enjoy the sight of her delicate frame.
<br><br>
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://ads.gamespyid.com/ad.aspx?S=planeteverquest&A1=NONE&G1=RPG&T=3&P2=0&A2=0&A3=300x250?unique"></script>
 
The entrance emptied into a raised area with a wide staircase that led to a large chamber.  Across from the entrance was another darkened hallway with what looked to be a collasped ceiling partially blocking the path. A large rock formation stood in the center of the chamber, which was lit by odd glowing green rocks imbedded in the wall.  There were four doors in the chamber, two on each wall. Standing as sentinals around the rock pillar were four skeletons. Curious, Analiea approached them and frowned when she realized they were animated but made no move to attack her.
<br><br>
“They are here to frighten away the curious,” a voice said from the darkness. The party looked around the rock formation to see two men. The first was halfling who was kneeling at the far door on the left wall trying to pick the lock. The second was a human wearing banded armor with the holy symbol of Errolise Marr hanging proudly from his neck. The man had been sitting against the wall quietly, but smiled and stood when he saw the others.  “Are you here to rid the world of a few undead or just curious?”
<br><br>
Analiea bowed formally, “We are not really sure why we are here, brother.”
<br><br>
“I recognize you from the temple, sister, but I don’t believe we have been introduced.” the man stated, “My name is Brother Lourious, humble cleric to Errolisi Marr, and this …err…gentleman… is named Redo Ransack. We have been exploring this place.”
<br><br>
Analiea introduced herself and the rest of her companions. Brother Lourious stared hard at the dark elf, but made no comment. Redo turned his attention back to the locked door patiently trying to unlock it. “What have you found so far, Brother?”
<br><br>
“Nothing deserving the reputation of this place,” Brother Lourious replied laughing, “There was one nasty large skeleton in that hallway over there, but I expected more with the stories I was hearing.”
<br><br>
“I was hoping for more,” Redo added as the door finally opened, “A man has to make a living somehow.” The halfling stood and said, “Well, I’m ready, what about you, Lou?”
<br><br>
Brother Lourious nodded then regarded the companions. “We were going to explore some. Would you like to join us?” Redo frowned, but said nothing.
<br><br>
After a moment of indecision, Anarchy stepped forward and said, “I don’t know about them, but I would.” The others followed Anarchy and the group proceeded into the hall beyond the door. The hall was much like the architecture in the rest of the building. They turned a corner to see that it opened up to an area with two doorways and what appeared to be an overlook into a lower section of the complex. The group moved into the room where the door had been knocked down. More of the animated skeletons stood there, but they, like the others if the Foyer, made no move to attack the party. The wall of this room was knocked down. Analiea crept over to the wall to look into the space it revealed. There was a rough stone path which weaved itself down to the next level. On the path stood a petite gnome woman. Her black and silver hair was pulled into a neat bun and she wore simple cloth clothing. Analiea frowned at the sight of her standing there so placidly, until the woman started waving her hands to weave some sort of magic. When a skeleton appeared next to the gnome, Analiea suddenly understood that she was a necromancer. “Heads up,” the paladin whispered to her companions as she drew her bow. Stepping into the opening she let an arrow fly that found its mark in the woman’s shoulder. For a second the gnome and half-elf stared at each other across the room, the hatred for what the other stood for shining in both of their eyes. Abruptly the gnome ordered her skeleton pet to attack Analiea as she began to cast another spell. Analiea felt the heat of a poisonous touch as she backed away from the opening to allow the pet to come in, and force the necromancer to come up into the room.
<br><br>
“What did you do?” Worlik growled as he pulled out his weapon. Loralie backed away from her sister and prepared to cast. Anarchy moved to join her, standing slightly in front of the other caster in a protective posture. The skeletal pet charge through the broken wall, only to be greeted by a damaging spell cast by Brother Lourious. The gnome stepped through the opening to find herself facing not one, but six people. As she began casting a different spell, Worlik, Analiea and Redo began attacked, trying to disrupt her. Brother Lourious began to work on the pet. Loralie started casting but stopped when Anarchy laid a hand on her arm and said, “Save your strength, this will be quick.” He was right, the necromancer was soon dead and the pet quickly followed.
<br><br>
Loralie turned to the dark elf and asked, “How did you know?”
<br><br>
Anarchy shrugged, “You forget, their kind is plentiful in Neriak. I recognized her pet as a result of one of the more simple spells. She also is not wearing any robes, or carrying any greatly magical items. But in the future, Analiea, you may want to let me look before you attack.”
<br><br>
Analiea grimaced taking the rebuke in good grace, “You are right, I’m sorry. I cannot stand necromancers, they are an affront to all I hold dear.”
<br><br>
Redo frowned in puzzlement, “Yet you travel with a dark elf?”
<br><br>
Worlik grumbled, “He travels with us uninvited.”
<br><br>
Loralie rolled her eyes, while Analiea smiled wryly. “Anarchy did not chose to be a dark elf. This woman chose to be a follower of Innoruuk. Every person has the right to prove themselves by their deeds.”
<br><br>
Worlik crossed to Anarchy and said lowly, “And you have not proved yourself yet.”
<br><br>
“Leave him alone, Worlik,” Loralie said softly, “We did not come here to fight each other.” 
<br><br>
Analiea started to go through the hole in the wall with the others following her. Redo stopped long enough to loot the corpse of the necromancer and was disappointed to only find a couple of silver pieces.  The path twisted around to another open chamber which had another hall stretching into the darkness. The party headed towards the path when they heard a breathy war cry. Loralie spun to face the sudden attack of a mummy. She could smell the sharp odor of its moldy as she felt herself being slammed by a solid hit to chest. Analiea and Worlik pushed past Redo and Brother Lourious and swung at the foul creature. Anarchy began to cast a spell that surrounded the creature in blue light, causing the undead eyes to look around nervously. Worlik taunted the creature to dive after him, deftly side-stepping the creatures blows. In the next instant, the creature was knocked back by the simulataneous affect of the spells that Loralie and Brother Lourious cast.  Soon the creature was dead, but not before it landed several solid blows to Worlik and Penya.
<br><br>
After the fight was completed, Brother Lourious approached the injured parties and examined their wounds. Petitioning to Errollisi Marr, he healed the wounds and treated the disease he knew the mummy carried. “This place is getting more interesting all of the time,” he commented, “I have heard of mummies, but have never seen one before.”
<br><br>
“Then you haven’t spent much time in the desert,” Worlik commented. Let’s go.”
<br><br>
The party continued to explore the hallway which wrapped around to several doors. Cautiously the group continued, but found their progress slowed by several large skeletons that were killed with a quiet efficiency. After the third or fourth fight, the party seemed to fall into a rhythm which allowed them to work well together. Conversation was limited as they continued on, the air of the place becoming more ominous as they travelled deeper into the halls. 
<br><br>
Just about the time that Analiea decided that this little excursion was a waste of time, she opened a door and found herself face to face with a human female in armor. The two stared at each other in shock for a moment, then the woman barked a sharp command and Analiea found herself under attack by another skeletal pet. Worlik growled and lept forward to confront the shadowknight. Worlik found himself the target of a poison spell and was pounded hard. Brother Lourious hung back from the fight and began to heal the warrior, as the other two spellcasters began to cast at the knight. Redo waited until the knight had been drawn into the hall then snuck past her so that he could backstab her. Needless to say, this drew the woman’s attention, and she immediately turned to swing on Redo who jumped back deftly to avoid the blow. As this was going on, a mummy that had appeared from behind them joined in the fray and began to attack Brother Lourious.
<br><br>
The battle ended with the shadow knight, mummy and the pet dying, but every member of the party had been hurt. Looking to find refuge, they entered the room where they had found the shadow knight. Brother Lourious and Analiea began to heal the party as they rested.
<br><br>
“This is getting us nowhere,” Anarchy stated, “I have seen no distinctive markings on the wall, nothing to connect it to that tapestry. Why are we still here?”
<br><br>
“We have not seen the whole complex,” Redo commented, “I heard stories that there was a third level.”
<br><br>
“And that will be a waste of time too,” Worlik grumbled.  “I am ready to leave.”
<br><br>
Analiea shook her head, “I think we should proceed.”
<br><br>
“Well, if we do continue, we should be smarter about it,” Brother Lourious declared. He began casting a spell on each member of the party and said, “This will make it so the undead can’t see us.  It won’t help against the necros and shadowknights.”
<br><br>
“We’ll just have to be careful,” Worlik muttered, and continued about how they should have thought of the spells before. He turned to the door to leave when suddenly his feet hit loose ground and he felt himself falling through a hole to a room below. Analiea who had seen it happen raced over to see her dwarven friend cursing profusely at the hole now in the ceiling that he had fallen through. “Are you ok, Worlik?”
<br><br>
“I’m just great,” the dwarf snapped, “I don’t suppose you have any rope.” 
<br><br>
Analiea looked hopefully at her other companions, all of whom shook their heads. Worlik could tell from the look on her face what the answer was. “Now what?” he asked. Worlik looked around and found himself in a small room with a tall ceiling.  The room showed the same decay as the rest of the complex, and a pile of rubble was under the hole. Worlik began to climb the pile, but the loose dirt and rock shifted under his fully armored weight.
<br><br>
Anarchy looked down at the hole and said, “It doesn’t seem like that long of a drop. We could join you down there.” Worlik opened his mouth to protest but Anarchy interupted saying, “We are pretty much invisible to everything, it should be safe enough. We know there was no path downstairs the way we came, but there was a crossroad at the entrance to this level, remember? We’ll just head in that direction and hope for the best.”
<br><br>
“We were going to investigate there anyway,” Analiea agreed, “Hold on, I’m coming down.” Analiea jumped through the hole. Brother Lourious and Redo quickly followed. When it was Loralie’s turn to go down, Anarchy took her hands and lowered her down, allowing Brother Lourious to catch her and lower her the rest of the way. “No one offered to do that for me.” Analiea whispered to Worlik.
<br><br>
“That’s because you can beat them up,” Worlik pointed out as Anarchy jumped down. Once everyone had safely landed, the group proceeded as quietly as they could through the door. 
<br><br>
The hallway that they entered was even more forboding than the one they had been in before. Here the halls were not as brightly illuminated and the air seemed more dusty from lack of use.  The hall contained only one door to the right, and the group moved towards it, half of them hugging each wall as they approached it. As Redo moved to the door to see where it went to, Loralie, who was against the opposite wall, found herself stumbling backward, seemingly through the wall. To her amazement she could see the hall clearly and no wall in that section.  The magician turned to see a roughly cut chamber that had none of the fine stonework that marked the rest of the complex. The chamber she was in was fairly dark, but she could see the flickering illumination of torchlight. She went towards it thoughtlessly, forgetting momentarily the others in the hallway.
<br><br>
In the meantime, Redo had opened the door and found another hallway with an expanse of doors. Worlik and Analiea moved down the hall they were in and found a circular room with a door on the other side. Moving carefully, Worlik crossed to the other door and carefully turned the knob only to find it locked. Analiea gestured back to the others and Worlik nodded. They needed Redo.
<br><br>
Loralie hesitated just outside the hidden chamber the torchlight revealed. Standing in the room was the massive form of an armored Troll clutching at a sword. He was speaking in broken common to a Euridite spellcaster, whose very manner declared his distaste at dealing with the troll. “Peoples up top,” the troll stated. At the sight of the living creatures, she shrank back into the shadows.
<br><br>
The Euridite shrugged.  “Our helpers will take care of it. Why are YOU here? You have spoken to the dark-elves then?” the spellcaster asked.
<br><br>
“Me talked to ‘em” the troll confirmed, “Dey makin’ friends all over. Gonna fight Freeport.”
<br><br>
The Euridite shook his head, “They can’t yet, they don’t even have enough support within Neriak for that. The Dark One made too many enemies in his day.”
<br><br>
The troll grunted, “Me friends say they fight. Dark One gots many friends all over.”
<br><br>
“Maybe,” the Euridite conceeded, “But he does not have the Undead Sword yet, and until he does he will be vunerable.”
<br><br>
“We lookin’ fer it,” the troll declared, “We find it.”
<br><br>
“Find the Dreamlights and you will find the sword,” the Euridite stated.
<br><br>
“We know where dey is but no sword.”
<br><br>
“They may not have it now, but the dark one seems to think they know how to find it.” 
<br><br>
That was enough for Loralie. Quietly she stepped back and headed back for the hall. In the meantime, Redo had quickly checked the side passage to discover one too many doors to his liking, and too many of the animated skeletons stood guard. These undead servants seemed more powerful than their kin upstairs, some even wearing leather armor. If Redo’s sense of direction was serving him properly, halls were leading in the wrong direction. The group met outside the door and became aware that Loralie was missing. Just then she reappeared, gesturing urgently to the ceiling. As she did so, a skeleton walked from the hallway that Redo had exited and headed towards the secret area. As it crossed the passage, it suddenly turned and faced Brother Lourious. 
<br><br>
“I think it can see you,” Anarchy whispered.<br><br>
<br>
      “Run,” Analiea commanded. With that everything erupted into movement. Worlik grabbed Redo’s arm and practically dragged him to the locked door that they had found. The rest of the party followed quickly as the skeleton began cackling, calling the other skeletons. They all went to the circular room and stood ready while Redo fumbled with his picks and began to work on the door. “I hope this is the right door,” Analiea commented as she readied her sword. Loralie began casting as the first skeleton came through the entrance way to be neatly chopped down by Analiea and Worlik. A fiery pet appeared next to Loralie, which she commanded to attack the next skeleton that came through the entrance.
<br><br>
 As the party heard shouting and footsteps coming down the hall and the prepared for a fight, Redo unlocked the door and yelled, “Go!” Loralie was the first to obey, calling off her pet as Worlik finished the work. Anarchy was not far behind. From down the hall the dwarf could see a troll looking into the passage and several more skeletons charged at the group. With a muttered curse he turned and followed Analiea and Brother Lourious through the door. Redo was last and began to close the door behind him, but was forced back by the impact of the skeletonal hands trying to stop him. Both Analiea and Worlik turned and rushed the door, their momentum causing the door to shut with a slam. They could see the doorknob turning but it had locked automatically. As they turned they heard a voice from the other side of the wall say, “Me gots key.”
<br><br>
The group was relieved to see that the room had stairs, which they quickly scrambled up. They were equally relieved to find that the next door they hit was not locked. By this time, the door below them had opened letting the flood of skeletons follow them. Analiea glanced over her shoulder and was horrified to see that they had been joined by a ghoul and Troll shadowknight.  The group ran down the corridor the door revealed and immediately recognized the hallway that they had come in. One skeleton that was faster than the others took a swing at Worlik but missed. The group ran up the rough path to the next level. Once in the room with the broken wall the spellcasters let Redo lead, since he would have to unlock the door. They stumbled into the following passageway and once again took a defensive stance at the door while Redo unlocked it. Worlik and Analiea began fighting the dark boned and slim eleven skeletons, trying to block the passageway. Brother Lourious hung back and healed the fighters. Loralie sent her pet after the ghoul as both she and Anarchy flung spells at the Troll. When they heard the door unlatch, they group retreated to the opening and began to run to the entrance of the complex. The undead minions swung at Worlik and Analiea as they retreated, but could not land any solid blows. 
<br><br>
The party made it to the outside desert, temporarily blinded by the bright sunlight. Brother Lourious turned to look behind them to see that the undead were no longer there. “Stop,” he commanded, “Everything is gone.”
<br><br>
Everyone turned to look at the empty tunnel. “The magic that animated them must bind them in there,” Anarchy speculated.  <br><br>
“But what about the Troll and Spellcaster?” Loralie asked in amazement.
<br><br>
“I don’t know, but let’s not hang around here and find out,” Worlik grumbled. “They may just be getting energy to continue the fight. With that observation, they all began a quick retreat to Freeport.  
<br><br>
Inside Befallen, the Troll was holding back the Euridite who was fuming that his complex had been invaded. “Will you let me go?” the dark skinned human demanded.
<br><br>
“No, dey need to run.”
<br><br>
“What are you talking about?”
<br><br>
“Didn’t youse see ‘em. Da girls was Dreamlights. We don’t kill da Dreamilights, the Dark One said so. He need ‘em.”
