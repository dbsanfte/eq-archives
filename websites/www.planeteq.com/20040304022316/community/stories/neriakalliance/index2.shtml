            <i>by</i> Jack Holt <br>
            <br>
            </p>
            <span class="headline">Chapter 2 - The Mithril Ring</span> 
            <br><br>Kelethin destroyed!" 
              Dvinn thought to himself. "And I will be one who does it." A brief 
              smile crossed his face. "But Orcs," he sighed visibly and rolled 
              his eyes. "They are not troops, they are chaotic mobs. Will there 
              be Neriak troops as I've been promised? How many will there be?" 
              He looked down at the Ambassador's robe and sash that had been given 
              him. "Political allies... But I don't like being coerced and manipulated." 
              And so his thoughts came in disjointed, rapid succession for several 
              minutes.
            <br><br>They were interrupted 
              by a knock at the door. He rose and opened it. A guard greeted him 
              and instructed him to follow him. Another one fell in behind them. 
              They led him to a large courtyard of stone where he was given a 
              sealed scroll by a robed figure whose face was hid. "King Crush 
              cannot read. Give this to the Orc Oracle, or the King's Emissary. 
              One of them will read it to the king."
            <br><br>Dvinn took the scroll 
              and bowed.
            <br><br>"Now, Ambassador, 
              I'm going to blindfold you. Under no circumstances are you to remove 
              it. Understood?"
            <br><br>"I understand," Dvinn 
              said.
            <br><br>It was not a blindfold. 
              It was a deep, black cloth bag. Dvinn listened carefully for a clue 
              of what was going on around him. Several persons came into the courtyard. 
              At least one was in chains. Two people came close to him. He heard 
              the sound of cloth moving on either side of him, and sensed something 
              large and round go over his head. Then he heard someone fall. The 
              sound of chains told him it was the prisoner.
            <br><br>Dvinn was a soldier. 
              He knew the smell of blood and the sound of death. He started to 
              reach for the hood, but the voice that had spoken to him earlier 
              reassured him. "You are in no danger Ambassador as long as you do 
              not remove the blindfold."
            <br><br>Then the two near 
              him began to chant. A spell, but what spell? Several long seconds 
              ticked by, and then Dvinn's attention was drawn to a humming sound 
              around his waist. The temperature dropped suddenly, and he could 
              hear the sounds of a forest. Hands were on his shoulders, and a 
              new voice reminded him not to remove the hood. They guided him on 
              a short journey, and then finally allowed him to see his surroundings.
            <br><br>It was indeed a forest--a 
              very dark one. It was also a military camp. On either side of him 
              were several rows of uniformed Teir'Dal--Neriak Regulars. A Dragoon 
              bowed before him. "Sir, I have an escort prepared to take you to 
              Crushbone."
            <br><br>"Where am I?" Dvinn 
              inquired.
            <br><br>"You are in Lesser 
              Faydark, and these are the troops which will destroy the Elves of 
              Faydark."
            <br><br>Dvinn surveyed what 
              appeared to be two companies of Regulars. This just might not be 
              an impossible mission after all.
            <hr>
            <br><br>Within minutes of 
              entering Lesser Faydark Niffun had made contact with the enemy. 
              He spent the first day dodging Orcs as he drove deeper into the 
              forest. On the second day he saw his first Teir'Dal. Then he spent 
              six days scouting instead of the three he had predicted during his 
              conversation with Maesyn Trueshot.
            <br><br>The Dark Elves in 
              Lesser Faydark were not bandits as Trueshot had predicted. The Empire 
              had a small army in Faydark. The majority of them were Neriak Regulars. 
              The rest were elite members of the Empire's darkest kind--Dragoons, 
              Necromancers, Shadow Warriors, and Wizards. And a single addition 
              was made to the force every four hours.
            <br><br>For a full day Niffun 
              studied the ritual by which this was accomplished. It always began 
              with the execution of a prisoner. After the execution, two Neriak 
              Wizards would emerge from a tent in the middle of a small clearing 
              with one on each side of a ring of mithril that was about five feet 
              in diameter. Of course it was not ordinary mithril. It was some 
              kind of magical teleportation device. After the wizards stood still 
              and chanted for a few seconds the ring would hum and grow bright, 
              and then someone would appear in the middle of the ring.
            <br><br>Niffun had also seen 
              it work in reverse, presumably sending a messenger to Neriak. Where 
              else could it be linked?
            
            
            <br><br><script type="text/javascript" src="http://ads.gamespyid.com/ad.aspx?S=PE&A1=NONE&G1=RPG&T=3&P2=0&A2=0&A3=IAB_MEDIUM_RECTANGLE?unique"></script>
 
			As interested in the 
              device as he was, Niffun had another problem that was more pressing 
              at the moment. It had to do with the prisoners that were there for 
              use in the teleportation ritual. The Teir'Dal had several of them 
              tied to trees at one end of the clearing. Most of them were Elves, 
              but there were a couple of Gnomes, an Orc and a Dwarf as well.
            <br><br>At the moment, the 
              Dwarf was tied up to Niffun! The Druid, who was in tree form, had 
              moved behind the prisoners and shape changed with the intention 
              of saving as many as he could once the opportunity presented itself. 
              Before he could do so two Dark Elves appeared and bound the Dwarf 
              to him.
            <br><br>Neither the Dwarf 
              nor the Neriaks had any idea he was there, but that would have to 
              change soon. Niffun had to get that ring, teleport out with as many 
              prisoners as he could, and get back to Kelethin to warn the city 
              of the danger.
            <br><br>Releasing the prisoners 
              would be easy enough. A pair of guards appeared every fifteen minutes 
              to check their bindings, and then continued to patrol the area. 
              The interval provided just the window of opportunity he needed. 
              However, once he changed shapes the prisoners would be able to see 
              him. How could he keep them, especially the Orc, hidden and quiet? 
              And just how would he retrieve the ring? Normally he could depend 
              upon his natural Halfling abilities to sneak and hide, and his Druid 
              camouflage spell. These worked well against Teir'Dal Regulars, but 
              he didn't expect for the Wizards in the tent with the teleportation 
              ring to be that easy.
            <br><br>&nbsp;"Ouch! Don't 
              kick me."
            <br><br>It's hard to say who 
              was most astonished. The Dwarf was trying to get his feet free and 
              in the effort had kicked backwards with his heels. The Druid had 
              been deep in thought and had responded without thinking. A Dark 
              Elf Regular had been walking nearby carrying firewood.
            <br><br>All three recovered 
              from the surprise at the same time. Niffun released the shape spell 
              in his mind, but the transformation back to his normal form would 
              take a few seconds. Until that was completed the Dwarf was still 
              tied up, so the Dark Elf had the edge.
            <br><br>He dropped his firewood, 
              reached for his weapon, and sounded the alarm. "Treant! Treant!"
            <br><br>Apparently he had 
              heard of the creatures, but never seen one or he would not have 
              made the mistake. He swung at the "Treant," but it shrunk under 
              his swing and the Dwarf took the blow. Now the "Treant" was a Halfling 
              and the Teir'Dal was surprised again.
            <br><br>The Dwarf had been 
              injured, but not critically so. He grabbed the soldier's weapon 
              and butted him with his shoulder. The gawking Dark Elf was knocked 
              backwards and his weapon came free in the Dwarf's hand. Niffun was 
              himself again, and silenced the downed soldier by crushing his skull. 
              He turned to face the Dwarf. He could hear the sound of running 
              feet, but they were a few seconds away. The Dwarf embraced him, 
              but Niffun pushed him away. "There is no time for that! Stand close 
              to me!"
            <br><br>The prisoner's cried 
              out as one for help, but there was not enough time to help them. 
              Niffun closed his eyes and selected the proper rune in his mind--the 
              Circle Teleport Spell for Butcherblok. The spell required certain 
              words and hand movements, so he began them.
            <br><br>From the center of 
              the clearing he heard two chants begin. The wizards were preparing 
              to cast spells! He had a head start, but he was casting a long spell.
