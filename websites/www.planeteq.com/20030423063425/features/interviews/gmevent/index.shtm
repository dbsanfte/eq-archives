              <br></b>by <a href="mailto:stryker@planeteq.com">Stryker</a>
            <p> Hail, all! I've just finished my interview with 2 GM's on the 
              Rodcet Nife server, Helenithea and Kriggan. (If you're on Rodcet, 
              say Stryker said hi!) We started the day in the Plane of Sky, with 
              my pre-made level 55 Iksar Necromancer. I was all decked out with 
              all the best stuff for a necro, and some of the best spells. Then 
              they gave me a bridle for a horse, and of course I was thrilled 
              at this, because on my server I am not rich enough to afford one. 
              During my interview, I danced with Helen (Helenithea) quite a bit, 
              and was bonked many times. </p>
            <table border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="3" align="center">
              <tr> 
                <td><a href="/features/interviews/gmevent/GM5.jpg"><img src="/features/interviews/gmevent/GM5s.jpg" width="200" height="150" alt="" border="0"></a></td>

              </tr>
            </table>
           
            <p>I made a comment that it was amazing to have all this great stuff 
              on me, and to be hanging out with GM's. Helen quickly responded, 
              &quot;It's not much different than the real thing, you're just slightly 
              uber. Ok, a whole lot uber.&quot; Kriggan and I both cracked up. 
              As I was memming my spells, Kriggan gave me a quick rundown of the 
              spells he gave me (since it was my first high level necromancer). 
              While he was doing this, Helen (a cleric I believe, I never found 
              out) was casting Feign Death on herself for fun, and joked, &quot;Silly 
              Lizzy! Feign death is for necros/monks/shadowknights only. I'm just 
              cheating 'cause I can!&quot; </p>
            <p>I asked the GMs, &quot;How long have you been playing EQ?&quot; 
              Helen responded, &quot;Since right after the release of Kunark. 
              1.5 years for me.&quot; Krigg said, &quot;I started playing in May 
              of 1999.&quot; I then asked, &quot;How many characters do you have, 
              since you can't have any on this server?&quot; Kriggan told me, 
              &quot;Well, I've got characters scattered across the realms. Ranging 
              from level 1 to level 60.&quot; Helen said, &quot;2 main characters 
              and a bunch of twinks/low levels, same as the average player. I 
              played less and less after becoming a GM, since it's hard to want 
              to sit down and grind for 8+ hrs after seeing it all day. But I 
              still do play =).&quot;</p>
            <p>What made them decide to be GMs? Kriggan answered, &quot;The love 
              of the game for me. I've been in customer service for the last 15 
              years. I ran a MUD for someone for 4 years and when I saw the chance 
              to get a job as a GM, I jumped on it. Was the best thing that has 
              ever happened to me, really. It's a dream job.&quot; We laughed 
              and joked about for a while, and then we went to go fighting.</p>
            <p>Helen summoned me to the Lake of Ill Omen, while Kriggan went off 
              to Luclin to find something he wanted to show me. We rode around 
              LOIO on our horses impressing people, while I kept shouting about 
              www.planeteverquest.com to advertise us. Lots of fun was had there. 
              Someone started one of the famous LOIO conversations of insults 
              and fighting. After a while, Kriggan told me he was summoning me 
              to the moon, to show me something.</p>
            <p>When I arrived on the moon, I was in the Ssraeshza Temple zone. 
              In case you don't know, that's the home of the Shissar. I admired 
              them and took some screenshots. Then for fun I attacked one of them, 
              and was dead in less than a second. But of course I was ressurected 
              by Kriggan and we continued on.</p>
            <table border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="3" align="center">

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>I asked, &quot;Since I was denied access to Customer Service Home, 
              can you describe it for me?&quot; Helen said, &quot;It's like a 
              mini-Mt. Olympus. It's very small, green stuff, a little Greek looking 
              structure, an Olympic size pool, two small pools with pillars around 
              them...there's currently 3 NPCs there who are named after and represent 
              Guides who died in real life. Some GMs just sit in the pool while 
              answering petitions.&quot;</p>
            <p>Afterwards, they summoned me to Western Wastes. There, we fought 
              Pantrilla and had great fun. We then continued to go around killing 
              everything we saw. </p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>After Western Wastes, I asked to go to an out-of-the-way zone so 
              we could discuss the event we were going to do. We spent about an 
              hour there, discussing my role in the event. We then proceeded to 
              Misty Thicket, where I was turned into Fluffy the Bear, Helen was 
              Maati Ursi, a ranger who had lost Fluffy, and Kriggan as a Goblin 
              Poacher, who was there to hinder my return to Maati. All in all 
              it was much fun, thanks to Haba for leading me home. =)</p>
            <p>Then we logged back on our characters, and I was taken to the East 
              Commons tunnel. There, Helen spawned close to 300 bixies and almost 
              that amount of skeletons and zombies. Much fun was had as all the 
              high levels rushed to kill them. During this time, the sky was turned 
              red, to show the event was going on. It is quite funny to see people 
              running from a single file line of pursuing bixies!</p>
            <p>We then went to Castle Mistmoore where we hung out with some people 
              from Rodcet who were there. We talked for a while and Helen danced 
              with most of us...again. I had some questions about the job of a 
              GM: &quot;What's the most common question you get in a day?&quot; 
              I asked. Krigg replied, &quot;For me, the questions vary from 'Can 
              you please suspend this person?' to 'What can I do to help this 
              person out?'&quot; Helen said, &quot;For me, it's 'How soon till 
              you get to my petition?' In second place, it's 'Bring be beerz! 
              NOW!'&quot; </p>
            <p>My next question was, &quot;What is the most funny petition you 
              have ever gotten?&quot; Krigg answered, &quot;I had someone petition 
              wanting another player punished because they logged before twinking 
              him after the guy promised to twink him. I've also received petitions 
              that said things like: 'I like cheese.'&quot; Helen searched through 
              old screenshots to find text of her funniest: &quot;User Text: 'um 
              there waz a spec atr dock and it waz talking just 1 and then there 
              were like 5 then they started 2 kill and the spec said im sexy yes? 
              and i like pancakes.' Turns out, it was a necro using voice graft 
              =)!&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;What is your pet peeve as a GM?&quot; I wondered. Krigg said, 
              &quot;Playerx tells you, 'Help me help me! I've lost all of these 
              items and you've got to help me NOW NOW NOW! I don't care 50 other 
              people were waiting in front of me! NOW!&quot; Helen had a different 
              comment: &quot;Guilds fighting over zones. There are SO many zones 
              and raid targets in EQ now that there is NO excuse whatsoever, none, 
              to fight over the same NPC, other than as an act of pride and to 
              snub others. It's stupid. I hate it.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;What is the most rewarding thing you do as a GM?&quot; I 
              asked. &quot;Seeing that 'virtual smile' on the player that I was 
              just able to help by answering a simple question, answered Krigg. 
              &quot;Getting thanked, getting random tells sending *hugs*, random 
              hellos asking how I'm doing, anything where players treat me like 
              a person. That's always nice, &quot; commented Helen.</p>
            <p>My next question was &quot;What was the most fun you had as a GM?&quot; 
              Krigg said, &quot;I'd have to say when I'm working at the Fan Faires 
              and seeing all the people having a great time meeting each other 
              and the GMs that are there.&quot; Helen agreed, &quot;Going to Fan 
              Faires. I live for those things. Not just because my players buy 
              me drinks either. =) &#133; But because it's really weird in a warm 
              and fuzzy kind of way to have people randomly come up to you and 
              say thank you, like in Dallas, Wulfgahr came up and thanked me.&quot;</p>
            <p>Finally, I was summoned to the Plane of Growth, and to see the 
              GIANT Ancient Totem that was there. I asked them about their personal 
              race and class favorites: Krigg responded, &quot;I don't really 
              have a &quot;favorite&quot; class, but I play my ranger, necro, 
              rogue, wizard and beastlord the most.&quot; Helen said, &quot;Fave 
              Class would have to be druid. First character I ever had, and still 
              my preference, only because I never put in enough time to quest 
              terribly. So I like being good at everything, even if it's at the 
              cost of being master at nothing.&quot; </p>

            </table>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&quot;What race is your favorite?&quot; I asked. Helen responded, 
              &quot;Fave Race? Um... I'd have to say Vah Shir right now, just 
              for looks... the new textures for their armor is awesome and I'd 
              like to play my kitty more to see what each piece looks like on 
              them, since it's totally unique from other races.&quot;</p>
            <p>Much fun was had by all. I would like to thank Helenithea, Kriggan, 
              Tamara Sanderson, Kwill, and all others who helped me pull this 
              together.</p>
