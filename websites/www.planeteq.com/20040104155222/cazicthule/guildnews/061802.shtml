              Jun 16 2002 10:58PM - Some more snakes...some giants...and some 
              wolves??? Deacis <br>
              Still wreaking havoc in ssra...But took slight break to help Elcannon 
              get a new pair of shoulders ;) 
            <p>5 waves of annoying giants and wolves, and roughly 60 minutes of 
              trying to get memblur on aggro general left and right, Elcaboom 
              got the Coldain Shawl 8 ;) So was good day ;) <br>
              Jun 15 2002 3:35PM - Snakes... Deacis <br>
              And snakes... </p>
            <p>And Good luck England in the quarter final ;) Once again proving 
              why Denmark cant conquer Britain...Defense... :p <br>
              Jun 13 2002 1:11AM - Snakes with attitude Regor <br>
              The Anavon/PE alliance tried out some of the other big snakes in 
              Ssra for the first time.. <br>
              Glyphed spawned, glyphed died.. hmm. one of those that you wonder 
              why we didnt do before.. heh </p>
            <p>Exiled, we had no idea what to expect.. but we had a good go and 
              got him down to 15% <br>
              Next time we will be prepared, and he will die.. horribly <br>
              Creater owned us, but we learnt alot.. next time different story 
              <br>
              Its kinda fun doing mobs you know very little about </p>
            <p>We got our revenge by offing King Tormax before getting embroiled 
              in some intrigue between Durn StoneCrash and one of Rallos Zek's 
              Oracles. it ended badly for the Oracle, and also I suspect a certain

            <p>Sadly, I am not the cunning linguist that Druss is, so I have no 
              witty lines for this particular bit of ... news? <br>
              I hate cabbage <br>
              <br>
              Posted by: Druss on Friday, June 14th, 2002 @ 1:23 AM<br>
            </p>
            <p>So...the week in review. </p>
            <p>First, and most importantly, we've changed the name of the guild. 
              Our logo has changed accordingly. I'm sure Flare will be updating 
              all titles on our site very soon. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>In addition, our new Guild Heraldry: [picture of a cabbage!]</p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>So, whats the deal? Well, the past week, we've pretty much done 
              two things: Jack, and cabbage quest earrings. And Jack left town, 
              he's allergic to cabbage. </p>
            <p>Yes, cabbage earrings have pretty much taken the guild by storm...to 
              the exclusion of nearly all else. Our guild is full of tradeskill 
              geeks, what can I say... </p>
            <p>The strain of endless foraging took its toll on our druids and 
              rangers. Hours of pushing buttons, hoping for that one special drop 
              to appear on their cursor, caused many to teeter on the brink of 
              madness. Take Dinuvian for instance: </p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>You see? Irrefutable evidence that Dinuvian has completely lost 
              his proverbial marbles. </p>
            <p>A few rare times, we managed to pull our cabbage crazy members 
              off to kill a mob or two: Zlandicar died twice, Vindi once, Dain 
              once, Itraer Vius once, and Tunare, in what was the fastest zone 
              clearing and smoothest Nature Ho smackdown (4 minute fight, on the 
              nose) ever. </p>
            <p>We also managed a shot at the High Priest in Ssra. We went, knowing 
              absolutely nothing about him, going into the fight. No, we didn't 
              kill him, but we pieced together the strategy needed to take him 
              down, and we'll get him the next time we go after him. </p>
            <p>Oh, in the not-so-Ubah portion of the update, we managed to blow 
              the AoW spawn this past week. I must say, the barrage of errors 
              we had were truly spectacular. We screwed up multiple times, and 
              still got him to 20%, which was about 80% better than we deserved. 
              In retrospect, we really didn't prepare for the raid correctly - 
              everyone had stocked up on fish rolls, and not Iron Rations... </p>
            <p>Thats all for this week. It will be a while until my next update 
              - Yours Truly is on vacation till the end of the month, and I'll 
              be far, far away from a computer. Maybe the guild will have worked 
              through its cabbage fetish by then. </p>
            <p>Aloha!<br>

              Two small raids last night, but both flawlessly handled by CoG. 
              Big NIFTY's go out to Ztalten on finishing CoG's first of many 8th 
              Shawls. Congrats to Mythika on the Leafblower, but please try not 
              to make a mess with it in the guild hall. <br>

              Grats to Kilwean for obtaining the bard epic singing short sword!</p>
            <p>We also decided to try the Grimling High Priest in Acrylia. We 
              brought two groups (spoiler sites suggested three), and we were 
              complete overkill. Mobs barely lasted 5 seconds as we killed the 
              would-be repelers. After over an hour of killing them, watching 
              the blood dry, and playing gems, the Grimling High Priest finally 
              took matters into his own hands. Only problem was that once we had 
              him down to 10 percent, he poofed. Not gated. Poofed. At least we 
              got a few bone chips. Still, Brewall is making a few adjustments 
              to his map from the explorations.<br>

              Is it just me or did they make this guy an absolute pussy? He was 
              hard... when we did him in February, now hes hard like Merauks flacid 
              pecker. Guess VI decided this was too hard, and now put it on par 
              with say Creator (Staying awake for 30 minutes).<br>

              the bloody point?), and seeing neither were on yesterday.....we 
              dropped bb and did a little ntov. </p>
            <p>As i was quite bored with yesterday, decided to make an NWN channel 
              for all the old nwners . I know damn well CT has the most nwners(across 
              all servers), so if ya want to deal with old times, talk about new 
              ones or even hell this doesnt happen much....roleplay the old characters 
              go for it in channel nwn inside. <br>

              Spent the weekend in Hate for epic drops and armor. </p>
            <p>Ended up getting some dust for Shazzum, a Pally epic thing for 
              Varukaa, and a ton of armor for people. Pretty good weekend, though 
              Magi P'Tasa whimped out on us and didn't spawn. Forced us to have 
              to kill the Maestro and let his two bard weapons rot.</p>
            <p>Grats to everyone!</p>
            <p>Also, I was hoping to post a picture, but no one sent me one showing 
              Filicity with her new Celestial Fists. Congrats Filicity!</p>
            <p>Finally, big grats to Minena for completing Swiftwind. She is now 
              40% more lethal! Check out pictures in our public forum. <br>

              Tonight was our first time to take a stab (no pun intended) at the 
              High Priest since late January, early February-ish. From what I 
              had remembered, we were going to be in for quite a ride. This guy 
              was no joke, and the encounter was a serious one when we killed 
              him way back then...That was then, this is now.</p>
            <p>We went in, weapons blazing, and absolutely PUNKED this mob on 
              the first attempt. Complete control, flawless execution, and an 
              overall badass job done by all. Special thanks to the BFA pull crew, 
              GG you guys.</p>

            <p>Had a LONG night last night, or so I hear. Before my DSL ultimately 
              crapped out, we hit the THO and Burrower Beast in the Deep. Grats 
              Baraccus on your wizzy staff of free n00kage, and Summine on your 
              sleek n sexah new tunic. <br>
              After our rampage in The Deep was complete, we headed out to Velious 
              for our turn in the NTOV rotation. We got off to a late start, and 
              that's about all I can say since my DSL went down for good at that 
              point. H8 only for Broadband Now. <br>

              Thursday I forget .. </p>
            <p>Friday to Sunday : </p>
            <p>Spent all weekend farming and combineing and farming and combineing 
              and foraging and combineing and foraging and farming and farming 
              and foraging and paying for and searching, etc. etc. etc. for things 
              and people to do the Earring of the Solstice Quest. The guild is 
              looking to bang out 35 either tonight or Tuesday, should be a good 
              day </p>
            <p>other news, went back to goblin killing, still KoS after 1600 faction 
              hits </p>
            <p>The big news of the weekend was Nariel, Chantress of the night, 
              finally finished her Shissar Stick of Hastiness and there was much 
              rejoicing. Then she baked and baked all weekend as well as the quest 
              for Level 60 so she can give out C3 like Solias does .. maybe she'll 
              VoG me! </p>
            <p>Umm, other then that .. it was a nice (to me anyway, some of our 
              more diehard fools think otherwise) change of pace of dragon killing 
              1 day, giant killing the next (or same) and then every 2nd day in 
              sleepers ... 3 constant months of that is getting a bit tireing 
              and this weekends flurry of tradeskills was great. Oh, and farming 
              faction in Droga at Chief netted me 2 Idols .. boom!</p>
