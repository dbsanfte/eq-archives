                  <p><strong>A Helping Hand </strong>by Kwill</p>
                  <p>There are so many acts of random
                    kindness in EverQuest between players that occur every day
                    in the
                    game, and I hope that you personally have
                      been either a recipient or a giver of assistance at least
                      once in your playing career. Each server really is a small
                      community. Last night, I was playing an alternate character
                      to recover my level 12 corpse which had gotten into a little
                      trouble with the dinosaur things deep in Paludal Caverns
                      -- he shouldn't have been in there in the first place,
                    and they see through sneak! My plan was to log in my 58 paladin,
                      go find my little beastlord's corpse, and drag him to safety.
                      Nothing went as planned, and I managed to fall off the
                    bridge
                      to the Paludal Caverns and get stuck underneath it. I could
                      find no way to crawl out, and was stuck. I gave a tell
                    to a random level 65 magician one zone away, hoping I might
                      get a call of the hero (I wasn't feeling too heroic at
                    the
                      moment under the bridge, mind you). He not only responded
                      to my tell, but came over and got me out. He didn't want
                      a donation for his time -- he was just helping another
                    player out that he didn't know out of the kindness of his
            heart.</p>
                  <p>It turned out this magician was tagged in one of the
                    power guilds on my server, whose leader I met at the guild
                    summit.
    I gave a tell to his guild leader, telling him how kind his guild member
                    had been to me. It turns out that my magician rescuer was
                    an
                      applicant to the guild (which is very hard to get into)
                    and by helping me, he made a very good impression on the
                    guild
                      leader and, I assume, the membership. You never know who
                      you may be helping when you get that random tell. That
                    little alternate character may belong to someone who can
                    help you
                      out sometime, or perhaps that person's main ends up being
                      a desirable group member. At the very least, you have made
                      another friend in the game. Of course I didn't have to
                    give a tell to his guild leader, but that was something I
                    could
                      do to help him and thank him -- and because he was an applicant,
                      my gesture made a much bigger difference in his playing
            experience than it ordinarily might have.</p>
                  <p>But my evening didn't
                    end there. I couldn't find my corpse. Another random player
                    in the zone, a level 20 necromancer, enlisted her
                    friend
                      and not only found the corpse, but purchased a coffin for
                      me and got my corpse back to the zone line. Another friendly
                      gesture that made my game play last night a fun time, and
                      not a frustrating experience. No, I couldn't do anything
                      for the necro or her friend like I did for the magician,
                      but that didn't make their experience helping me any less
                      satisfying for them, I don't think. They seemed to be very
                      happy to take some time to connect with another player
                    and have the satisfaction of helping someone in trouble resolve
                      a problem. Last evening, they made a difference in someone
            else's playing experience.</p>
                  <p>The design team talked at the
                      guild summit about making a difference in the storyline
                    of
                      the game world -- and by helping a someone out, you just
                      have, because the players make up the game world just as
                      much as the NPCs and the storyline.
  For my magician friend, helping me out had a personal benefit he didn't expect.
                      But that's not the only reason to do something nice for
                    a stranger. Corpse recoveries, helping a lost character,
                    buffing
                      for no charge, or porting someone make the server community
                      a nice place to be. Every player can probably help out
                    someone else, some time. By helping one another out, everyone
                    has
                      a good time. Because isn't EQ really about the people we
                      play with? It's not just guild mates or group members or
                      people on your friends list. It's the people you run by
                    in the zone or you hear shouting for help that also make
                    up
                      our communities.
  And one other thing: when you are on the receiving end of a helping hand, be
                      sure to thank your good Samaritan -- it feels good to be
                      appreciated when you make an extra effort. This is my public
                      thank you to those characters on Cazic Thule last night
                    who helped out the little beastlord and the paladin. I appreciate
                      it!
