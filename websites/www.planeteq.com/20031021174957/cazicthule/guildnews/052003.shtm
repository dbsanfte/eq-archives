              Had an eventful evening. </p>
            <p>Took out the Evolved Burrower in Acryllia Caverns. This mob replaced 
              the Restless Burrower. Same attack, but now it is shiknar shaped 
              instead of wurm shaped. Dropped some nice loots. Congrats to all, 
              and check out the Loots thread to see what dropped.</p>
            <p>We then headed over to Dreadlands and picked on Gorenaire. She 
              dropped fairly quickly and dropped some nice loots, also available 
              on the Loots thread.</p>
            <p>Then to crown the evening, Celgorn was invited into the family. 
            </p>
            <p>Welcome to the family Cel! <br>

            <p>We never really considered doing Seru before last night so armed 
              with only 3 bane weapons went for a peek. The result was some decent 
              loot and a very dead Lord Seru.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>This finally brought Shadows of Luclin to a close, why we waited

              Family day in fear!! <br>
              Posted by Loadan On May 13 2003 At 09:25:01 AM <br>
              What started as a simple rescue in Fear turned ugly when some folks 
              that were sitting at the zone in to fear decided to come in and 
              help us, and ended up wiping the rescue party.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Sooo, after getting some more guild support, we successfully completed 
              our rescue mission (whew for Tellin, eh), and then we noticed some 
              epic mobs up. BIG thanks to Frelkin, Eng, &amp; Dal for dragging 
              our sorry corpses around, and I'm sure PoV (the other guild there) 
              muchly appreciates your efforts too!!</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>After the rescue was complete (for both guilds hehe) we went our 
              seperate ways, and CoG had tons of success and got 4 folks closer 
              to their epic completion!</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Grats to Maxximos (on childs tear), Grisnalg (on a evil sk sword 
              from Fright - thanks for eating the DT Dal), Mayu (on some kinda 
              oil from broken golem heh), and to Tellin (on another evil sk sword 
              from Terror - thanks to Mayu for eating HIS DT) Grats to Ayanar 
              for his shiny new box from that last golem, and grats to the CoG 
              family for coming together to help a friend in need (and then thanks 
              for the rest of the family to come help the first helpers hehe)</p>

              We've recently been in Ssra alot and hope that continues. Took down 
              Rhag one and two but mostly we've been working on shards and key 
              parts and flaggings.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Welcome to Darkice and welcome back to Sirturo.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Something on a more serious note. Our family lost a good friend 
              Monday to a terminal illness. Though this is just a game, the people 
              in it are very real and our grief and our rememberance of him is 
              very real. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Balbore/Falcoun was a special person in action and in spirit. He 
              didn't let on to alot of people that he was sick...which to me testified 
              to what a strong person he was. He never seemed down to us...he 
              never let it ruin his enjoyment of being with us. He just was a 
              quietly awesome person. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>I for one am very pleased to have in a small way perhaps made his 
              enjoyment the moreso as I'm sure many in the CoG family are pleased 
              to have done the same. Balbore represented everything good that 
              is Council of Grey and I don't think he'd want us to be sad for 
              him. So, I won't be...I'm listening to U2 sing about what a beautiful 
              day it is...and I agree. It's a very beautiful day. We love and 
              miss you Balbore.<p>
              Just sit and watch the fireworks. <br>

              Mostly we've been boring....getting alot of folks flagged for Plane 
              of Tactics, Crypt of Decay, and Bastion of Thunder. Grats to those

            <p>We killed the Ancients in Sleepers recently. Did a pretty fast 
              and smooth job of it. Good job folks and grats to those that got

              Time for CT to kill Aaryonar solo. This is a momentus occasion that 
              has been a long time in coming for our guild. If there is anything 
              this guild does it is execute well-thought-out tactics with precision 
              on mobs, and this fight was no exception. We took Aaryonar down 
              without a single - zero - deaths. Tactics and execution was absolutely 
              flawless. Our NToV rotation spot is now secure. Drops for the night

              Our rotation of NToV begins tomorrow, so this evening we went to 
              Western Wastes to kill Sontlatak. We managed to take him down and 
              received a talisman [Altus] and a large number of spells. We then 
              went over to DN to do Sleeper Tomb key turn-ins.</p>
            <p>Loots for NToV will be done April Fool style. Highest roller on 
              an item that they can and will use, gets to decide who to award

              of Kerra Ridge</b></a></p>
            <p>A chill wind howled across the portal entrance as the numbers of 
              The Coven quickly grew in Ice Clad. Numbering near 2 score, they 
              moved in silence and with a deadly purpose that was reflected in 
              the naked steal blades. Ligoris had called for The Coven to help 
              in the duty of escorting a certain dwarven General across the frozen 
              waste. With a quick nod, the General was off on his errand. Januse, 
              Jonzer, and Katslayer provided the needed melee skills. Xmortis, 
              Kithov and Bonefork picked up the decaying remnants of those who 
              opposed us and gleefully pitted them against our next adversaries. 
              Wave after wave fell to the violent onslaught. Mortalist, Marvapur, 
              Amadicia, Andorean, and Ziam, charged the air with magical particles 
              as they unleashed all manner of spells. In the end Ligoris received 
              his 8th shawl as his reward for dedicating a lot of time and effort 
              into the trade skills. This event went so smoothly the Coven gathered 
              again a few days later and repeated the same hell spawned fury in 
              Ice Clad, thus securing Mortalist his 8th shawl. Congrats !! </p>
            <p>Ripped up Phinny while in Kedge to help Ligoris with a piece of 
              his epic. 6 of us dropped Phinny with relative ease. Grats to Kalander 
              on his new clicky. The corrupted was rolled after a short break 
              and Ligoris looted his epic piece.</p>
            <p>Bastile called forth the Defenders to take down Radir. We quickly 
              gathered up 2 groups which was more than needed and moved to Radir's 
              cave. Moving forward, we quickly mauled any mobs that opposed us. 
              Grats to Shindar and Bellatoris on their new weapons.</p>
            <p>A joint group of Blood Gaurds and DoKR peeps took down that wussy 
              dragon in Cobalt Scar. This fight wasnt even close. Grats to Norwreck 
              on his spell and Katslayer on his new 2 hander.</p>
            <p>Beat down Lodi a few times, as well as Gantru Dralkenr many times 
              the past 2 weeks. Grats to Aliciarose on her Lodi Shield &amp; Celtin 
              on his bracer. </p>
            <p>A group of us took on the major burden of dropping Zelnithak. Emerald 
              Protectorate had pulled him to zone while asking for assistance. 
              We gladly took up the offer of pounding on that over grown horse. 
              After a long battle he finally fell, dropping 2 no drop pieces that 
              went to EP. Ridyen was awarded the bracer so grats to him.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>The Coven gathered in the icy hallway and prepared for its first 
              joint take down. Legion of Nox, Children of Tunare, Loyal Defenders, 
              and Kerra Ridge had sent forth many a mighty ambassador to accomplish 
              this task. Vindicator merely chuckled at the news of this upstart 
              force lurking at his front door.</p>
            <p>The Coven advanced at a lighting pace blowing through any giant 
              or foe that opposed them and quickly had cleared the area that would 
              become Vindi's last stand. New to this type of battle many of the 
              Coven members fretted nervously as they checked blades, mumbled 
              incantations and readied prayers and spell books. 2 times the Coven 
              faultered but still they persisted finally, Natazuul lured the lumbering 
              giant to his final resting place perfectly as Sarine, his fellow 
              monk looked on in admiration. Waiting in the shadows, Shirmar grinned 
              evily and began his onslaught, shouting out Vah Shir battle cries 
              that drew the remainder of our forces into the fray. With such mighty 
              blows from the arms of Shaylah, Drizo, Zbar, and many others, Vindi 
              began to wither.</p>
            <p>The first cleric to drop was Andorean, exhausted from the constant 
              healing, she collapsed into a meditative state. Darwinn and Ziam 
              were quickly succombing to the constant drain as well. This gave 
              Vindi renewed strength and he punished Shirmar brutally. Under this 
              enraged attack Shirmar finally collapsed. Januse quickly took his 
              place and fended off Vindicators wraith until he too was beaten 
              unconsious. Vindicator shouted wildly as the Coven called forth 
              all of its combined might. The air crackled and exploded as fire, 
              ice, and lighting filled the small area surrounding Vindi. As soon 
              as the knee of Januse bent, Katslayler jumped in calling forth the 
              power of Rallos Zek to protect him. He held the vengeful fury of 
              Vindi for as long as he could then he too stumbled and fell.</p>
            <p>But just as Vindicator thought he had achieved victory, the full 
              fury of the wizard Mortalist, the mage Ithaka, the druid powers 
              of Kaldek and Fairsong, and the combined host struck witih a mighty 
              thunderous boom. Vindicator teetered for a second reeling from this 
              blow as Celois's pet gave him one final shove to topple this mighty 
              Giant Chieftan.</p>
            <p>Shirmar claimed the fallen giants breast plate as Kaldek cleaved 
              the head of this beast as a trophy. Sporting the rewards of their 
              spoils the Coven then left the city of giants to pursue more loots 
              and trophies in Fear but that is another tale to be told. </p>
            <p>Recent Epic accomplishments of note, Kithov is now the proud owner 
              of the necro epic. Natazuul recently achieved epic status. Yaldain 
              has also finished up her cleric epic.</p>
            <p>Congrats to Jonzer,Swadi, Andorean, Kalander, Xmortis, and Drizo 
              on finishing up their Lodizial Shell quests after stalking this 
              turtle down on a number of occasions.</p>

            <p>Shawl Completed<br>
              Added by Mortalist Nox on 5/9/2003 2:31:00 PM<br>
              --------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
              Mortalist stood in a small bowl of melted snow. Others around him 
              were pacing through knee-deep drifts; he remained in a small divot 
              he created for this camp. </p>
            <p>All around him, dark, menacing shapes moved in the last light of 
              day. Stalking back and forth in restless anticipation of the conflict 
              soon to come. The terror that plagued Ice Clad was the Legion of 
              Nox.</p>
            <p>Watching the Legion of Nox was a social experiment. The dark and 
              twisted armor shapes walked and slithered next to the natural inhabitants 
              of Norrath. Most of the Legion appeared as if they had crawled from 
              the nightmares of children. Then there was Shaylah Nox and her cohorts. 
            </p>
            <p>She stood on the dense ice of the permanent frosted ground and 
              glistened. Her silver armor and white trappings blended into the 
              surrounding so naturally it would appear as if she was chiseled 
              from the ice itself. She gave the &#147;Hero&#146;s of Norrath&#148; 
              a champion. She appeared clean and pure, as the wind that blew off 
              the ocean. </p>
            <p>It was only after closer examination that you could smell the corruption 
              of her soul. The elven woman had been to long on the battlefield. 
              Her hatred off all things living was apparent in her harsh commands 
              to her soldiers. In the eyes of Tunare, she was Death. In the Legion 
              of Nox, when dark knights and Teir&#146;dal casters surrounded her, 
              she was the abomination. </p>
            <p>There were many others here. Averys Nox and Leyl stood to the side 
              of the throng arguing over the tenets of pain. Januse and Katina 
              laughing with a wicked sense of justice. A laugh brought on by the 
              madness of the Indigo Brotherhood. Then there were Delwren and Katina, 
              teasing the young Necromancer Marlichy. The women were making suggestions 
              that the young man believed to be invitations. And Arkinon, who 
              stood away from the crowd, feeling alone but a member.</p>
            <p>Then there were those loyal to the Legion but not loyal to the 
              dark. Marvpur the witchdoctor, who fled Halos seeking Revenge. And 
              Mistofelees the gnome spy, waited near the assembly, hoping this 
              would end in victory. </p>
            <p>Then there were the Legion&#146;s allies. The Defenders of Kerra 
              Ridge. They were an odd compliment to the Legions own resources. 
              The Defenders were hero&#146;s cut from the fabric of Norrath. They 
              were the golden light of dawn that pushed out the night. They were 
              here to help.</p>
            <p>Fairsong, the light-footed wood elf stood with his high elven wife 
              in the deep white snow. In the shadow of Fairsong stood their body 
              servant and assassin, Katslayer. Fairsong&#146;s token Teir&#146;dal. 
              It was said that Fairsong trusted the Dark Elf like a son. Maybe 
              Fairsong was not all good. Off to the side of these three were the 
              loyalist to Fairsong. Those, which called themselves the elite. 
              Ligoris the healer and his servant Belastral. Jonzer the Tracker, 
              the crudest example of the ferocity of the Feir&#146;dal.</p>
            <p>They watched with the Legion, looking for the danger in the distance. 
              But they also careful observed the Legion, as though it would turn 
              on them. </p>
            <p>In the distance a small dorf approached the camp. Wearing nothing 
              but the clothes of a miner. Mortalist went to meet him, and they 
              talked. </p>
            <p>Soon the dorf donned armor given to him by Mortalist. The armor 
              reflected the lights from the ice and snow, Velluim Armor. Mortalist 
              returned to the camp.</p>
            <p>Mortalist addressed the camp.</p>
            <p>&#147;The General was not surprised to hear our information regarding 
              the ambush set for him on his trip to delegate with the Pirates. 
              He will continue with his journey. Under our alliance with the dorfs 
              of Thurgadan we must protect him from these Kael Assassins. This 
              means if the general dies before his conference, then those that 
              let him die will feel more pain and torment then each of us can 
              imagine. Our duty is clear. We will not fail.&#148; Mortalist turned 
              and followed the Dorf General across the ice plains. The Legion 
              of Nox and Allies followed after him.</p>
            <p>*the night wore on*</p>
            <p>Sitting around the cracking fire of the comfortable pirate village, 
              laughter could be heard as the Legion&#146;s party raged on. The 
              cleric Ziam and the witch Razria sat and talked through the night.</p>
            <p>&#147;It is finished, the dorfs of this land seemed to have struck 
              some deal with the gnome pirates. The lands of ice will change dramatically 
              in the ensuing years.&#148; the wood elf noted. Her voice was soft 
              like the spiders. Her tone relaxing.</p>
            <p>&#147;Change is never pleasant, there will be much war before these 
              dorf&#146;s feel free. I know the Legion will be here, to so the 
              seeds of Hate into the hearts of dorf and giant.&#148; Ziam stares 
              into the fire. His eyes revealed that his mind was racing to cipher 
              the consequences.</p>
            <p>&#147;Why did you let Mortalist deal with that Avatar of Brellis? 
              Our reward for the General was given by the dorf&#146;s why deal 
              with their god as well? It is a god of &#133; a lesser race.&#148; 
              The witches spite was evident in hear speech.</p>
            <p>&#147;Mortalist knows what he is doing, remember the rewards from 
              the gods are unique. The rewards from dorf are plentiful. Also, 
              do you remember that Brellis shares a history with Innoruuk? If 
              you would have grown old in the underworld then you might see the 
              significance of the respect he showed the Avatar.&#148; Ziam concluded, 
              the sound in his voice gave away the Pride he felt for the Legion 
              to have completed the Finally Shawl for the Thurgadan.</p>

              Mortalist walks through the silent halls. His companion follows 
              close beside him.</p>
            <p>&#147;I think we did amazingly well, last night. Even though the 
              Plane of Hate, and then later the Plane of Fear had to be called 
              off due to the weather. Once we arrived in the Umbral Planes we 
              succeeded. &#147; Mortalist continues to speak to his companion.</p>
            <p>&#147;We were able to loot several nice items as well as completed 
              a time sensitive trigger. We need have some issues in the beginning 
              of the night, but those cleared up quickly. Our relationship with 
              Defenders of Kerra Ridge grows stronger on every event.&#148; Mortalist 
              continues&#133;</p>
            <p>&#147;I do hope that the Demented Ones become as valuable to use 
              over the next year. It would be amazing to see what we could accomplish 
              with two powerful allies. All in All last Evening in Umbral Planes 
              was very enjoyable&#148; </p>

              Monday is not that bad a day if you are a nomad! We started out 
              by killing status and AoW in Kael. Gratz to Pindan with BP of Eradication 
              and to Colaking and Zanlea with their new leggings from AoW. After 
              that we went to The Deep and killed the big ugle worm Burrower Beast. 
              Gratz to Pindan with Ancient Burrower Spine and to Silverskin with

              Congratulations to all of NoN. We have reached another goal and 
              hunted for the first time in VT together with VA - a collaboration 
              that is working real good. We are now in the most uber place pre-PoP 
              and have picked up the pace to catch up with the high end game in 
              a short time. It has been hard at times, but now we are reaping 
              our rewards and enjoying the results of all the work. Our first 
              raid went flawless thanks to all the knowledge that VA has in these 
              things and the good raid discipline that NoN. VA are good teachers 
              and help us perform well. Before we went to VT we popped by Kael 
              to off Vindicator and the Statue with few people. The effects of 
              our improvements in gear are showing.</p>

              of people is just about ready to go raiding in Vex Thal. We found 
              time to do a few PoP bosses too, namely Grummus and Saryrn. Nice

              In the spirit of freedom and liberty we, The Relentless, have set 
              forth our solem goal to end any tyrany or oppression that may come 
              to exist within the world of Norrath. </p>
            <p>Our information sources have gathered that there was a dictator 
              of the most vile and revolting kind located somewhere within the 
              plane of water. We have vowed that this oppression will come to 
              a swift and permanent end.</p>
            <p>Upon reaching the Reef we received conformation of our reports.</p>
            <p><img src="redlob.jpg" width="432" height="146"></p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Although many of the locals wanted our help and cheered us on as 
              we rallied through the Plane, it was apparent that some were still 
              loyal to the old regime.</p>

            <p>With the enemy on the ropes his personal public relations agent 
              began to give forth claims that confused the public and attempted 
              to trap them in his delusions.</p>

              Well it's been a while since we have had the chance to explore someplace 
              new. Having received keys to PoEb which have been dormant for the 
              past few weeks due to various bugs and script errors, we found quite 
              a few new uses for them. Of course there was the traditional paper 
              weight, Zippe found they make nice bottle openers, and Ghoat...well...heh.</p>
            <p>Tonight for the first time we were able to use them for the intended 
              purpose and zoned into PoEb. So this was the zone that stood between 
              everyone and the Plane of Time. We started off in usual form, bringing 
              out various server firsts. Here we have a picture of our first tree 
              in PoEb, notice the second one in the background.</p>
            <p><img src="earthtree.jpg" width="444" height="326"></p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>We cleared out some more mobs, sadly they all remained on the ground. 
              Then it was time for the good stuff, bring on the mini's. After 
              a few impressive rounds, including the ever so elusive silk gloves, 
              we finally found a mob who was ready to give us a challenge. </p>
            <p>Regretablly I missed the opportunity for a pre fight pic, but as 
              you can see he didn't amount to much anyways, flopping dead on the 
              first try.</p>

              and beat this encounter. Tonight my fellow guildmates proved once 
              again that Relentless isn't just a guild tag, but a way life.</p>
            <p>We are now half way to the Plane of Time, and Coirnav hasn't got 
              much longer before he sinks to the bottom of his dark pool in defeat. 
              We are greatly awaiting the challenges that await us in PoEb, and 
              we will rush to meet them head on as soon as our keys start functioning. 
              It is truly our time to shine and enjoy the fruits of our labor.</p>

              More Mayhem in Sraa</p>
            <p><br>
              The Creator fell to SA again, just one night after our 1st, due 
              to a patch. The 1st fight taught us a lot, because this one dropped 
              in about half the time. Kudos to Opossum for working out a great 
              strategy. Kudos to everyone for taking care of the adds, as required, 
              and doing a great job of controlling aggro. And of course we can't 
              forget the healers and debuffers, they did a marvelous job. Here 
              is a list of the items that were dropped by both Creators:</p>
            <p>Grey Dusted Wraps - Zodo<br>
              Grey Dusted Wraps - Sanaelar<br>

            <p><br>
              An exciting fight developed in the Temple of Sraa last night. We 
              worked our way up to the 3rd floor and had the opportunity to fight 
              a mob we had always wanted to but were never able to because it 
              was almost never up. The fight was one of the longest I can remeber 
              being involved in which primarily just dealt with one mob. To hear 
              your MA able to yell out DEFENSIVE!! 3 or more times, is just plain 
              weird Anyway, we took down the Creator, it was an enjoyable fight 
              and I am very proud of everyone that was there for this impromtu 
              raid. Congratulations to Sanaelar, Sargeone, and Dynter, on their 
              great new items.<br>

              Thule. Friends from Knight's of Loyalty, Order of the Golden Staff, 
              and Legacy or Darkness, were there to help and revel in the hard-fought

              What a pansy. Or, as Bugs would have it, what an ultra-maroon. Either 
              way Mr. Omnifiend there takes the omninap. Basically every other 
              fire mini (between yesterday and today) went as well. I think our 
              hit count in fire yesterday was 7, which is pretty sweet since it 
              included both big red there and the arch mage. Or, maybe it isn't 
              sweet...who knows. Perhaps the reason that AM and Blazzax sat up 
              since the &quot;new and improved fire&quot; patch was because they 
              were just too easy....I dunno. I just point my bow at stuf...ya 
              dig? Anyway, like you can see, for the first time since the patch, 
              he drops. On our first attempt as well. Guess we were a little too 
              taciturn about taking him on...gave him a bit more credit than he 
              was due.</p>
            <p>So that brings us to our world today, good ol' Bubba.</p>

            <p></p>
            <p>After the clean sweep of fire, we moved back and took on Bubba, 
              racing through the event in near record fashion for us. In related 
              news, Khayne won the betting pool on how many chanters we could 
              kill in RZ's room with his bet on &quot;all of them&quot;, however 
              insider betting is suspected. Anyway, while the parimutuel issues 
              were being resolved we popped RZ down to the arena (oh how delicious 
              that will be after the floodgates open in tactics), popped down 
              there and wasted him directly. Our fastest kill yet. With how fast 
              we can roll through this event at this point, I figure we'll see 
              ol' Bubba on full farm status shortly....it's just too fun to kill 
              the god of war.</p>
            <p>Anyway, back to it, AACH day approacheth and I smell gristle for 
              the rant mill.</p>

              Been fun the last few weeks introducing our newest member to the 
              all the PoP encounters. No matter what we asked her to do she managed 
              to keep up with the other clerics. We even found out she can count 
              all the way up to ten, which is a good thing for heal rotations.</p>
            <p><br>
              Please welcome the newest Full Member of Shadowed Soul, Ceeni.<br>

            <p> Thursday, May 8, 2003 - Some Say A Comet Will Fall From The Sky 
              <br>
              Posted by: [Kyrthor] on May 9th, 2003 @ 10:24 AM</p>
            <p>Someone order meteor showers and tidal waves? All we can say is 
              &quot;bring it&quot;.</p>
            <p>Been fun but busy the last couple weeks. The big news of note was 
              SOE deciding that the planes of Fire and Water were a joke (which 
              they were) and kicking several encounters in each up enough notches 
              that Emril himself backed up and said &quot;Damn!&quot;.</p>
            <p>What do we say?</p>
            <p>About *@#$(&amp;ing time. That's what we say. How about some more!</p>
            <p><img src="Fire19fs_1.jpg" width="520" height="296"></p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>The new encounters are fun, tough, and finally no longer complete 
              jokes. We haven't toppled all of the changed encounters yet, but 
              that will come in due course...</p>
            <p><img src="Fire21fs_1.jpg" width="520" height="390"></p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Noteworthy is the fellow we dropped this evening.....the Arch Mage 
              in fire. We took a peek at him a few days ago, revised our plan 
              and paid him a visit again tonight, which inevitably led to this:</p>
            <p><img src="Fire27fs.jpg" width="520" height="320"></p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>In addition to all that, we have snuck in a nearly complete round 
              of backflagging to hook up some of our newer alliance members...so, 
              all in all....lots got done, some still to do, weather is here, 
              wish you were beautiful. Hell, we even manage to throw in finding 
              encounters never before seen in Everquest. So as you would expect, 
              life is pretty exciting.</p>
            <p>Here's to the new, tougher world....hoping it gets moreso...and 
              like the man said, learn to swim!</p>
