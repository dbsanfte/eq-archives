                leader, Uber Avatars will be available for Corpse Retrievals if 
                neccessary. Fear Raid in 3 weeks, keep leveling. Guild Meeting 
                also coming up soon. Also if you need anything for certain quests, 
                don't hesitate to ask, Mistmoore can be done easily for those 
                that need items for quest armor or just items. We've done many

                Congrats to Ayne, Anlashok on both parts of the ranger epic (and

                gnome ended up offering the hungry ogre a nearby halfling while 
                quickly getting a port out for himself. The moral of the story

              <a href="http://members.tripod.com/crimsontalon/"><b>Crimson Talon</b></a> 
              <blockquote>Brewall led the Crimson Talon, allies, and other adventurers 
                in a fourth raid against Vox, and won yet again (now 4-0). Her 
                loot was liberated yet again, and for the fourth time in a row, 
                no paladin books. Loot was: WDS [Brewall], WDS [Cris], Runed Bolster 
                Belt [Tico], Staff of Forbidden Rites [Lazuli], Staff of Forbidden 
                Rites [Scoff], and Ice Comet [Aridican]. Loot rules were changed 
                to reflect status change of WDS (all four bards from original 
                raid have won), bards will have higher odds, but casters are now 
                in on roll. High level bards may offer a cloak for trade if caster 
                wins and if same or better than a WDSC, I will enforce the trade. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Grr. Emergency patch on Thursday. Should have scheduled Vox raid 
                4 on Wed and then hoped for another patch, three kills in three 
                days would have been really nice (although 2 in 4 isn't bad either). 
                Will try to plan more around this in future. <br>
                <br>
                Raid on Kedge last night, but Phin had been killed earlier in 
                the day. Tomwin managed to get a piece for epic off the Corrupted 
                Seahorses. Get ready for some upcoming raids on CoM and to get 
                more Seblis keys. <br>
                <br>
                Vox is killed yet again on Tuesday night. Amazed that the word 
                has gotten out, and I was shocked at how many people showed up. 
                Once again, pick-up groups of random people can prevail against 
                the beast if they are well organized. Were it not for the pit 
                mobs, the fight would have been much easier (why people don't 
                listen to instructions is beyond me-stay there and die!). This 
                would have been certain failure for a smaller raiding party, but 
                neverless, we prevailed. Brewall raids are now 3-0 against the 
                beast, and although no paladin books have dropped (0 on 3 kills), 
                three bards have a WDS necessary for epic quest. See links above 
                for full write-up and raid points. <br>
                <br>
                Decided to take on the Kael Drakkal arena tonight, and killed 
                many guards, spectators, and a number of named mobs. Drops were 
                fairly sparce, but very nice: Gladiator's Chain Leggings (lore 
                no-drop ac17 str2 cha4 wis6 hp20 mr10 0.0wt war/clr/pal/rng/shd/dru/brd/rog/shm

                in this spot.</blockquote>

                spells, and a head. What a waste of time. Went to sleepers last 
                night and killed something. Got ph4t l00ts. <br>
                <br>
                Dain and Yelinak dead.<br>
                <br>
                Started day off by whacking CT. BTW you can't slow him anymore, 
                sort of threw us out of whack and we lost on first attempt. Round 
                two went to EOD/TR. Grats Merauk on his Robe of Inspiration and 
                Angrie on his Pauldrons of Ferocity.<br>
                <br>
                Moved onto Yelinak. His AOF is no longer canceled by C2, again 
                a bit of a suprise. We beat him to zero visible health and lost. 
                Readjusted strategy totally owned his ass round two. Congrats 
                Zagmog on his Gauntlets of Dragon Slaying and Cybsled on his Earring.<br>
                <br>
                Finished the night with Dain. Some jokers who apparently thought 
                they were being funny gave him a velium axe. Too bad they were 
                too cheap to stick a real weapon on him. Next time guys if you 
                want to imitate FOH try to spend a little cash on a real weapon. 
                425 Dain with his gay proccing axe owned on round one. <br>
                <br>
                Killed Klandicar, Zlandicar, and Myga today. Made a piss poor 
                attempt at The Vindicator, won't even go into details.<br>
                <br>
                Casually waltzed in and killed The Dain yet again. Congrats to 
                Gaef on his belt of dwarf slaying.<br>
                <br>
                Moved to TOV and fought Aaryonar who is a real mofacka. </blockquote>

                Castle Mistmoore last weekend, and thanks to all our friends who 
                aided us (such as Nandarr and Jhereg) and to Galadriad, just for 
                being a cleric with Rez! <br>
                <br>
                Special Kudos out to Uadan who completed the more difficult portions 
                of the Raincaller, WurmSlayer, and Electrum Bladed Wakizashi quests, 
                all in the same night!!!<br>
                <br>
                We're growing rapidly under the new leadership of Aeryl & Lorudcee. 
                I've relinquished leadership, in an effort to once again just 
                enjoy the game, and not have to deal with the politics of leading. 
                Our ranks are starting to include several in the mid to high 40s, 
                and a few of us have gone planar.<br>
                <br>
                Our website has had a major facelift, including the addition of 
                a new Guild Inventory system I wrote, which will soon be followed 
                by a research items inventory.<br>
                <br>
                And just a bit of history... we're just a bunch of players, tired 
                of the bickering and moaning about phat lewt. We formed this guild 
                to enjoy each others' company, to have good times with good friends. 
                And, so far, it's been a resounding success! If anyone is interested 
                in just having fun, then I recommend they give us a tell!</blockquote>

                It was a long weekend, and that means a long weekend of killing 
                for us. Now normally, BFA weekends suck. We putz around a bit, 
                maybe kill Vindicator or Trakanon or something equally useless, 
                but generally everyone logs in at different times and leaves at 
                different times and we never get anything useful done.<br>
                <br>
                This weekend we made an exception. It was memorial day weekend 
                and we wanted to make it a weekend worth remembering.<br>
                <br>
                First we had to warm up. We headed over to Skyfire Mountains and 
                took a shot at Talendor. As usual, he dropped fast, and dropped 
                nothing of value. I no longer consider Talendor a dragon. From 
                now on, we will refer to him as the skyfire lizard boss.<br>
                <br>
                Then we zoned into VP. A slow start as always, but luckily the 
                wurm spawn for us was set up pretty much perfectly, and so Silverwing 
                died real quick. Again, he dropped nothing of value. I would remove 
                Silverwing from the "dragon list" and consider him nothing more 
                than an annoyance, except that occassionally after you kill Silverwing, 
                some fool ends up standing too far out and training Hoshkar, making 
                the battle cost a lot more deaths. As usual, this happened, and 
                we had to CR, but we weren't beaten yet.<br>
                <br>
                Next up was Hoshkar, and we ended up screwing him up too, I forget 
                how we did, but we all died. Then whie CRing, Omalley trained 
                the camp again (DIE OMALLEY!) and caused us another fun CR. We 
                got lazy and bored, so we just pulled Hoshkar instead of fighting 
                him in his lair, and worked him real quick. Once again, drops 
                were crap. Notice a pattern here?<br>
                <br>
                We moved deeper in for Phara Dar, and ended up killing her with 
                8 people left in the zone. Now, by now we should be experts on 
                killing dragons, but no, we ended up almost losing again. This 
                scared most of us, so we all decided to shape up. Phara had one 
                good drop, the Shroud of Veeshan, but otherwise, a useless loot 
                haul.<br>
                <br>
                Then we hit the three crappy dragons. Druushk, Nexona, and Xygoz 
                all died without dropping anything of much interest. The only 
                good thing was that we got two more necro DMF robes. Yay.<br>
                <br>
                Well, our warm up session was done and we all headed out to sleep. 
                Tomorrow we had big plans scheduled.<br>
                <br>
                Of course, those plans fell through, and instead of doing them, 
                we hit the Dain instead. Probably our worst Dain fight in history. 
                Sadly enough, we got worked by the 350 Dain and came close to 
                losing. You'd think after 25 dain kills we'd be pretty good, but 
                no. We were getting complacent. It was time to shape up and try 
                something new to test our skills. In revenge for all the deaths 
                that the Dorfs caused us, we took it upon ourselves to get Crover, 
                Malstrome, and Leody killed a few times. It worked.<br>
                <br>
                We would have gone for Klandicar at this point, but Western Wastes 
                crashed. So instead we header to ToV. I know, you're thinking, 
                "More armor farming? How boring!" But no, we were headed to ToV 
                North to start our expedition into the Shrine of Veeshan. This 
                was to be no joke - no non-kos characters to do easy CR, no known 
                safe spots, no knowledge of the zone whatsoever. That combined 
                with the fact that the BFA has no knowledge of tactics and no 
                ability to form our own ideas (we are bottomfeeders after all) 
                was promising to make for a coffin-filled adventure!<br>
                <br>
                First we made our way to Eashan of the Sky to practice our ToV 
                North tactics. Mobs in ToV North hit REALLY hard, have nasty AEs, 
                and tons of hitpoints. Eashan is a great mob to practice on. We 
                ended up killing him and getting Onyx Chain Sleeves. The best 
                part about killing Eashan is that after you kill him, you get 
                to kill all his little kids hundreds of times over. Killing hatchlings 
                is fun, almost as much fun as clubbing baby seals!<br>
                <br>
                Then we prepared for the Main Event. Aaryonar was the badass Sontalak-looking 
                guardian of the ToV shrine. He's got a horrible AE, quads for 
                850, and has a ton of hitpoints. Killing him is far from trivial, 
                but the force that succeeds in doing this has free reign to try 
                out all the other bosses in ToV north. The first attempt we made 
                weeks ago we only got him to 80% health. The second attempt we 
                got him to 75%. But now we had a strategy. Third attempt we got 
                him to 8%, fourth attempt we got him to 1%, but he warped home. 
                By now it was close to 3am EST, and people were tired. But no 
                one wanted to leave Aary up for another night. He had to die. 
                Our final attept we ended up killing the beast. Cheers echoed 
                throughout the halls. Aaryonar was dead, and even better, Clug 
                was dead! Everyone loves seeing a dead dragon, but seeing a dead 
                ogre is even better. Aaryonar dropped Ring of the Reaper and a 
                Whitestone Shield.<br>
                <br>
                It was late, so we moved into ToV north and camped there for the 
                night. Sunday was promsing to be a big day. If everyone could 
                wake up in time. Which they couldn't. Scheduled for 4pm, we didn't 
                start till 6pm. Our dragon killing abilities were starting to 
                come under doubt.<br>
                <br>
                First dragon of the day on Sunday was Lord Feshlak. Now Xate came 
                up with a method of solo pulling ToV dragons that I found to be 
                extraordinarily fun. Because it involves killing off lots of warriors. 
                Seeing dead barbarian warriors always brings a smile to my face. 
                However, the method hasn't been perfected yet, and the first dragon 
                pull ended up pulling Feshlak and one of his guards. People were 
                all preparing to camp, but then we realized, hey, we're dragonslayers, 
                we can kill him! And we did. Feshlak went down pretty easy, even 
                with the extra adds. He dropped some stuff that I can't remember. 
                I believe Lovern got some sleeves of some sort, and someone else 
                got something else. And I think there was a third drop too. And 
                we got some dragon meat. Fortunately I don't pay much attention 
                to anything.<br>
                <br>
                We then went for Dagarn the Destroyer. Being part of the pulling 
                team, I was psyched to pull a nasty quad 850 rampaging dragon 
                that runs faster than sow. Unfortunately, after yelling out the 
                warning "Don't Fall Off!" at least 10 times that night, I fell 
                victim to my own curse, and fell off the ledge into the lava below. 
                I had to sit out the entire fight while they fought Dagarn the 
                Destroyer. Unfortunately for them, without me there is no victory, 
                and Dagarn beat us. Not ones to give up easily, we tried a second 
                time, but this time I got CoH'd back up, and Dagarn fell to our 
                might in good time. Trystar recieved Shiny Metallic Leggings. 
                So if you see a newbie high elf naked wizard walking around with 
                the Relentless tag around him, that's Trystar.<br>
                <br>
                Moving farther in we ended up with a nice Xatetrain. Xate was 
                challenged to pull Vulak'Aerr (the boss of ToV north) solo. So 
                he tried one of the pulling tricks, and managed to pull Vulak 
                to camp. Now unfortunately for us, Vulak likes to summon all his 
                dragon friends to him when he attacks us. Vulak + Kreizemm + Nevederia 
                + Jorelagg + who knows what else, and a bunch of drakes all charged 
                camp. Needless to say, we all died once again. That's what's great 
                about a new zone - you always end up dying a LOT. I always escape 
                cause I know where to feign, plus I always make sure the groups 
                are stacked so I get xp, so I ended up getting +xp for the whole 
                trip. Sucks to be everyone else!<br>
                <br>
                Then Xate made a booboo and zoned into Plane of Mischief. Now 
                any smart person, before zoning in, would have left a corpse at 
                camp before zoning in. Not Xate. He's an ogre. He zoned in and 
                realized he couldn't zone back out. So while grumpyleaf went to 
                rescue him, the rest of us proceeded. Of course, at this point, 
                everyone was screaming "Let's go to PoM!". Screw that! We were 
                here to kill dragons, not puppets and mushrooms and shit. So I 
                told everyone "later" and we kept going.<br>
                <br>
                Next up was Lady Mirellena. Now the other dragons were easy, but 
                Mirellena was super difficult. She had a nasty AE and we didn't 
                think we could beat her. Oh wait. No, I'm thinking of Aaryonar. 
                Mirellena was a chump and went down like one. She had some crappy 
                drops, including 2 Mithril Boots. But the Orb of the Crimson Bull 
                that she dropped was pretty good. I wonder if it's a coincidence 
                that Crimson Bull sounds like Red Bull, and has the Effect:Invigor 
                on it.<br>
                <br>
                Next up was the lord of the fish, Lord Koi'Doken. Now normally 
                I'm scared of fish dragons: I mean look at them, there is Faydedar, 
                Kelorek'Dar... er, wait, fish dragons are all weak. And so Koi'Doken 
                proved. We killed him on the first attempt with a flawless victory. 
                Owned! He dropped a broken Trident, a decent Helm of the Deep 
                Sea, and a Net of the Deep Sea, which isn't actually a net, it's 
                a shield, but go figure, right?<br>
                <br>
                After that we all took a little trip to the Plane of Mischief 
                for fun and frolick. Was nice to actually get to the zone without 
                exploiting. We accomplished nothing however.<br>
                <br>
                Monday we were all tired, but managed to kill two more dragons, 
                Jorleag and Lady Nevederia. Lady N gave us some trouble but we 
                downed her eventually. Loot of Jorelag was really bad, Lady N 
                had two SK belts.<br>
                <br>
                Other misc drops of the weekend included Barriers of Sound, Shield 
                of Thorns, Rings of Superiority, Cleric and SK shields, Rogue 
                and Bard necks, Ranger Bow, and some other nifty stuff. Overall 
                a great weekend. 14 Dragons in 4 days is always impressive, especially 
                7 new ones. Only the 3 dragons and 3 bosses of ToV North left.

                as far as the level 61+ wurms), and managed to clear various wings 
                in Howling Stones making for a busy week for Shahmat. All in all, 
                a highly productive week for Shahmat too. In terms of loot our 
                guild bank has a safe financial cushion, and is able to begin 
                equipping our members with items like Celestial Healing, our raids 
                have rewarded us with some excellent equipment upgrades for our 
                members and we are well on our way to more Vellious quest armour.<br>
                <br>
                Recently, we have begun hunting in the Kael arena. Over the next 
                week our focus will be to equip our members with Vellious quest 
                armor, explore deeper in Skyshrine and Dragon Necropolis and add 
                a few new members.<br>
                <br>
                We are looking for a couple excellent players. We have a lot of 
                fun, we have successful raids, and we have room for a couple more 
                people. If you are interested in learning more about us, please 
                see Pakse, Paynes, Sneeky, Aphasia or Nandaar online or visit

                raid - get your request in now. We will do our best to fit everyone 
                we can into our raids.<br>

                We were happy to be able to assist in killing Brother Zyphel in 
                the Frontier Mountains, and we run exp groups everywhere from 
                Sebilis to Chardok and back. So if you are tired of the same old 
                pickup groups - give us a tell, we may have a better idea for 
                you.</blockquote>

              <blockquote>Eejag, The "Fist of Fire" fell to the forces gathered 
                in Lavastorm Saturday afternoon. Kinjate was able to loot the 
                charred scale needed for his Monk Epic. After that fight, everyone 
                moved over to Nektulos and took down Kirak Vil for Kanine. He 
                was able to loot the tainted shield for his Paladin Epic. Grats 
                you two! <br>

                This update of the Thursday night event in Trak's Teeth comes 
                from Darias and Greyy. The event went well. Even with the relatively 
                late start time, we had about two full groups when we formed at 
                the EJ zone. We decided to hunt the Forager cycle and moved ourselves 
                into position.<br>
                <br>
                With Falconian and Derreck as our trackers / pullers we were able 
                to pick up some nice things. Aneega won the Ceremonial Iksar Chestplate 
                and Bolgor walked away with the Meditative Blanket. A Korzanz 
                Kit'ioukl helm rotted since no SK's were on when it dropped. <br>
                <br>
                Bolgor, Iamfree, and Orvious were the only ones in attendance 
                that needed their Sebilis keys. All three of them received the 
                two required medallions to make the key. Congratulations all! 
                <br>
                <br>
                Please welcome Johnanne, 28 ranger, and Greyy, 53 rogue, on the 
                start of their probation with the guild. <br>
                <br>
                This update comes from Kinjate: Well, an extremely successful 
                night in Chardok tonight! It took us a little while to get prepared 
                and ready to zone in, but once we did, we moved quickly into the 
                tunnel where the iksar betrayer spawns and set up camp. Not even 
                an hour into the camp we Hear a message from Kevo who was pulling 
                while I grabbed Malakie, Kevo shouts, "Iksar Betrayer Incoming!"<br>
                <br>
                So the pipe was taken care of!! Now it was time to get in there 
                and have us some fun!!! Unfortunately I was so excited to get 
                back to the group from getting Malakie that Ii forgot to grab 
                a screenshot! Doh!<br>
                <br>
                Well, I died a few times, but loot was kind, even though we weren't 
                able to get organized enough to try Korocust again. One Auspice 
                was kind enough to donate a Sarnak Battle Shield to our camp, 
                and another sarnak, (not sure what I was dead at the time) was 
                kind enough to donate a Sarnak Battlehammer. I had invited The 
                Templars along, as some had showed up last week and helped out 
                quite a bit. Lvsun, one of their members was the lucky winner 
                of the shield, and Gizak was the gracious winner of the Warhammer! 
                Congratz to you both! And i guess to myself for my Pipe!<br>
                <br>
                Well, on about 1am we decided to call it a night and head out. 
                Me, Jimatra, Aegien, and my friend Serinde got Translocates to 
                Dreadlands(Thanks again Lum!) And we ran to to Old Wizard city 
                to find Brother Balatim. He wasn't up right away, so we killed 
                his PH and sure enough, 6 minutes later popped one Brother Balatin! 
                <br>
                <br>
                Jimatra charmed it, I hailed him, and told him that I WAS ready 
                for the True Drape. I handed in the Two Pipes and my Robe of the 
                Lost Circle, and received my Robe of the Whistling Fists! W00t!
