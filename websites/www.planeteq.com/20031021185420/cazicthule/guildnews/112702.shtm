              Ok, we had an inkling of what to expect.. Terris-Thule is renowned 
              for every first attempt to have some surprises. She delivered. But 
              we thrive on recovering from bad situations, and in true Anavon 
              style, we managed to bring it back from the brink of failure.. </p>

              Glyphed, Exiled, Cursed, HP, XTC. It was fun, and I get to post

            <p>Yeah, we won the ring. No, it wasn't pretty. Crypt of Decay is 
              gonna be a huge pain in the ass.</p>
            <p>In other news - Killed Grummy Grums twice, which gave us the chance 
              to experience things like that picture, above. Killed Aerin Dar 
              once, giving us access to Halls of Honor (despite the god-damned 
              non-random spawn timer) Finally did the gnome walk without him bugging 
              out and poofing on us, though we haven't really spent much time 
              in the factory.</p>
            <p>We also killed the usual assortment of Luclin stuff. So exciting!</p>
            <p>Short on time this week, so no photoshopped art till next week.

              The dentist's of Crimson Talon paid a visit to Seblis for a tooth 
              extraction this evening. Trakanon was complaining about a tooth 
              ache and our perscription was death and subsequent removal of his 
              teeth. Virtually everyone in the guild has completed their VP key 
              now and the few remaining people are in the final steps.
            <p>After Seblis, we made our way to Chardok to pay the royals a visit. 
              We hastily made our way through the dungeon and slayed the prince, 
              king, and queen in short order. Excellent job by everyone on the 
              fighting! A few turn-ins later, Hattrick finished his enchanter 
              epic! Ciene is also now just a few shards away from a cleric epic 
              as well.</p>
            <p>NOV 19, 2002<br>
              Killed Gozzrem in West ToV again this evening and then moved on 
              to the Halls of Testing for a little bit.</p>
            <p>NOV 18, 2002<br>
              Another foray into Veeshan's Peak. Stayed near the entrance with 
              minimal number of people for chances at some rare spells. Once more 
              have keys, we will be attempting penetrations much deeper into this 
              dungeon.</p>

            <p>Dropped the prince of Chardok and helped Celois take a good step 
              in his epic hunt. Rylog picked up a nice upgrade from that encounter.</p>
            <p>Lots of upgrades lately from Tov and Thurg Armor. Stomping Dragons 
              and Giants seems to be the norm lately. Umbral has been kind to

            <p> </p>
            <p>After we dealt with the train (which proved to be the most difficult 
              part of the night), we promptly stepped up to kicking the HP's ass. 
              The fight didn't last long; it's amazing how fast a mob dies and 
              how happy everyone is after a ranger sacrifice or two.</p>

            <p>News: Terris Thule/Aerinn'dar = toast <br>
              posted on 11-18-2002 08:52 AM by Magnuss Surestab </p>
            <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
              We started off Saturday around noon pst in PoV, with Aerin'Dar in 
              our target. The event went without any hitches, and he was destroyed 
              on our first attempt.</p>
            <p>You have received a character flag!</p>
            <p>Afterwards, we went straight to PoNB to take on Terris-Thule himself. 
              The first attempt was absolutely insane - we had no idea what we 
              were in for. After getting him to about 40% and promptly getting 
              slaughtered by all of the chaos that ensued, we took a quick 15 
              minute breather to review what had happened and to fight back in. 
              The second attempt was total control, and Terris' head was on our 
              plates.</p>
            <p>You have received a character flag!</p>
            <p>Terris was a very interesting fight, and in my opinion, a taste 
              of the encounters to come in PoP. In a lot of sense the development 
              team did what they were supposed to with the encounter; Use their 
              creative juices, and come up with something totally diferent then 
              what we have been molded to do in fighting mobs from previous expansions. 
              It was an intense encounter, and we all had a blast. I'm really 
              looking forward to doing this one again.</p>
            <p>Moving forward!</p>
            <p>We poked our heads into Halls of Honor and Plane of Torment for 
              the rest of the weekend, and generally checked out the new zones. 
              I see new targets in our near future... <br>

              Have you ever had one of those uninvited guests? The kind that would 
              Never leave? Vallon Zek is JUST LIKE that, only right when you think 
              he will finally go away a bunch more of him show up. Then when you 
              think THOSE are gonna go away then they tell two friends, and so 
              on and so on and so on...</p>
            <p>I swear, I thought I was drunk. No wait, I was drunk.</p>
            <p>What was I talking about? Oh yeah, killing Vallon Zek.</p>
            <p>So there we were, surrounded by an angry god. When all of a sudden 
              ...<p>
              How it worked I'll never know, but it did.</p>
            <p>The end result?<br>
              <br>
              And there was much rejoicing. Three nights in a row, three Server 
              firsts in a row. Life is Beautiful.</p>
            <p>Until Next time remember folks... Smile. You don't have to be happy. 
              Think of it as showing your fangs.</p>

              Man, how time flies!</p>
            <p>It seems like only yesterday that we entered the Plane of Tactics, 
              and now the Zeks are starting to die!<p>
              There it is, you see it here first on CT. Tallon Zek tried his best, 
              but he failed. We stepped up to him and dropped him first try. It 
              was intensely cool to come up against a boss that actually uses 
              archery against us. Next we need to run up against a boss that will 
              quad kite us.</p>
            <p>Time to run, gotta catch a nap to be ready for tomorrow. We whacked 
              Cletus Zek...time to line up on Bubba Bo Bob Zek, and then maybe 
              after take a run at big, bad Cooter Zek. </p>
            <p>And yes, I fully expect to find the General Lee parked somehwhere 
              in this zone.</p>

            <p></p>
            <p>What day is it?<br>
              That's right...I've trained ya all, I can hear ya sayin it.... it's 
              Almost Anything Can Happen day. What's the first rule of AACH day? 
              We do NOT TALK about AACH day....so let's move on.</p>
            <p>Let me 'splain what we been up to....no, there's too much. Let 
              me sum up...We have been killin stuff. Quite a bit of stuff. And 
              today we added nicely to our list of conquests.</p>
            <p>We lined up the Manaetic Behemoth in PoI. We went into the factory, 
              did the &quot;Spawn Dance&quot;, waded in and bashed heads with 
              him. As we had a full assling turnout, the fellow never stood a 
              chance. When the smoke and lag cleared, the Behemoth was tits up 
              and we were movin on to the Plane of Tactics for the first time 
              on Cazic-Thule.</p>
            <p>These new, faster fights that Vi has been working on are (so far) 
              a blast. You line it up and if you know your shit, you move on. 
              The only downside so far are the spawns that are triggered and despawn 
              on failure. I guess all the design folks that dealt with the greifing 
              on the Avatar of War must be gone...otherwise they would have understood 
              that letting the triggering of a mob like that be materially easier 
              than killing the mob itself is simply setting yourself up for grief.</p>
            <p>Ah well. The Plane of Tactics now becons....something new to play 
              with. Back with more updates later...time to log back in and continue 
              talking with the gnome in PoT.</p>
            <p>Later, campers....</p>
