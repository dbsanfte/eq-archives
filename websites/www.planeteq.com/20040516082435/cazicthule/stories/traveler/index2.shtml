(Part 2 of The Traveler)<br>
<i>by</i> Penya Dreamlight

<br><br>
It was night again in the East Commons. The Traveler always felt more secure here. The grounds were more familiar, and the dangers here less, although the griffins still had to be watched carefully. Simply put, he was exhausted. He had spent some time in Befallen, happily seeking revenge against the undead for their very existence. All he wanted now was to make it back to Freeport and rest a little, secure in the knowledge that he had done his part to exterminate a little evil. He would not sleep much for even in sleep he waged a war against his enemies.
<br><br>
As he walked, he saw movement in the trees. Squinting he saw the shadowy form of an orc. Silently, the Traveler moved closer to the creature. Seeing the dull reflection of metal bracers on his arms, and better armor than what was typical on the creatures here, this identified him as a Legionnaire. The traveler frowned, he had never seen one away from the camp before, but when three centurions joined the creature, he suddenly understood. They must have been hunting someone who had tried to raid the camp. One of the centurions happily held up small bronze armor, proclaiming joy at his prize, confirming the Traveler’s theory.
<br><br>
Curiosity drove the Traveler to ignore his exhaustion and follow the hateful beasts as they went back towards the camp. The adventurer had to be very careful. Although he could take any one of the Orcs individually, he could not take them as group. As expected, they began to pass the fallen bodies of some well-meaning warriors on the path back, as well as some of the orcs they had fought. The Traveler allowed his heart to feel the burning hatred for the creatures as he passed their corpse. They did not even have the decency to attend their dead properly. The Traveler noted where the fallen warriors were. They would have to be attended to later.
<br><br>
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://ads.gamespyid.com/ad.aspx?S=planeteverquest&A1=NONE&G1=RPG&T=3&P2=0&A2=0&A3=300x250?unique"></script>
 
Finally the dull fire in the camp could be seen. The Traveler continued to follow the creatures, but veered to the side of the camp to set up a vigil in the trees where he could see the comings and goings of the camp. He identified five more of the horrid creatures milling around. Unaware of his presence they went about their daily tasks of preparing food and preparing for their foraging expeditions. The oracle cast buffing spells on the warriors who would then head out into the commons hoping to catch some poor soul to raid them for their loot. The Traveler decided to watch this ritual, wait for the Centurion to leave the camp. He would then follow and kill them. His only regret was that he could not kill them all. He saw the remains of two other humans, one garbed in white robes, reminiscent of the woman he had seen a couple of days before. The wearer of these robes, however, appeared to be worn by a human male. It must have quite a battle to watch.
<br><br>
In the back of the Traveler’s mind he wished he had help. This was a new thought for him - he normally preferred to work alone. Absentmindedly he twisted at the Fire Emerald ring that the woman had given him. He certainly could use her at his side, although he was unsure if he wanted her there for the great power she wielded or her peaceful demeanor. It had been so long since he had been in the presence of simple goodness that he had forgotten how inspiring it could be. 
<br><br>
The Traveler pushed his idle contemplations aside abruptly when he saw a new orc enter the camp, accompanied by two Legionaries. The armor that the creature wore identified him as a more powerful creature than the normal occupants of the encampment. Silently the Traveler descended from his perch and carefully crept closer to try to hear what was being said. He had taken great care to learn orcish so that he could communicate with the warriors. He enjoyed taunting them in their native tongue during battle, particularly when he was trying to pull their attention from some other adventurer. The new orc approached the Captain of the camp and gestured towards one of the tents. The Traveler moved silently towards the tent to see if he could hear what was being said.
<br><br>
Inside the tent, Lord Shin Rhee said to the Captain abruptly, “Be prepared, things are going to start happening.”
<br><br>
The captain asked, “Prepared for what?”
<br><br>
“There may be a series of humans asking for asylum. You are to hold them here until I can arrange transportation for them.” 
<br><br>
“Why should a filthy human need asylum from us. They can go to the Militia in Freeport. Their type is welcome there.”
<br><br>
Lord Shin shook his massive head saying, “We have informants there who have infiltrated the temple. We have discovered the identity of a number of allies of the paladins.” Lord Shin smiled with satisfaction, “ It is the wrong time to move against the knights, but we can strike against their friends. However, the humans that perform this task will not be safe any place in Freeport. We have promised them money and a place to live.”
<br><br>
The captain snorted, “Why don’t we move against them ourselves?”
<br><br>
Lord Shin looked wryly at the captain and asked, “Two of our enemies are the magician and the enchanter. Are you in such a hurry to face them again? What about the smith?”
<br><br>
The captain’s eyes widened, “They are back? They left Freeport some time ago.” The captain shuddered, “They have not visited this camp. The last time they did I lost many good fighters. The elves seem to take pleasure in killing us. Especially the Jeweler woman.” 
<br><br>
“It is their turn to die.” Lord Shin Rhee said positively. “And it will be a great day for us.”
<br><br>
The Traveler pulled away from the side of the tent and quickly tried to retreat back into the darkness. He had only been able to interpret half of what he had heard, but it was enough to chill him to the bones.
<br><br>
An elf jeweler female who had recently returned to the area? How many of those could there be? The Traveler had to warn her. 
<br><br>
There was only two, slight problems. The first was that the Traveler did not know where the woman was. Freeport was a large town. It was difficult finding people, particularly if they did not want to be found. The second problem was even greater.
<br><br>
The Traveler did not know the woman’s name.
