<p>
This is the quest for the Shining Star of Light, a 1HB cleric/paladin weapon. The quest starts with Astaed Wemore, the same cleric in the Temple of Life who gives the blessed oil quest. Apparantly Lempic Hargrin is sick and needs a special cure. He will tell you to go to Rivervale and find Kizzie Mintopp, and tell her that "I am from temple of life". She will then tell you to find some guy called Honeybugger outside in Misty Thicket and find out how to get honeycombs, because she needs them to make Honey Jum. Bring her the honeycombs and she makes the Honey Jum for you. You then need to give it back to Astaed and he will make the Jum into a potion for Lempeck Hargrim of West Karana. Take the Potion to Lempeck, and receive a rusty scyth (Lore item version). Sometimes he goes crazy and attacks you at this point. I've seen various theories on why he attacks. The most likely one is that you have the wrong potion. If you identify the potion before giving it to him, and it identified as a Potion of Disease Warding, you should be OK. If it identifies as an Orange potion of something, you are probably going to get attacked. Your best bet is to keep givingAstead honey jum until you get the right potion. Take the scyth back to the Aeston Wemore, and you get the shining star.
<p>
Quickest method to complete the quest without all the talking:
<ol type="1">
<li> Give Kizzie Mintopp 3 honeycombs and 30 gp for the Honey Jum.

<li> Take Honey Jum to Cleric in temple of life (the one who gives the quest) and get Potion in return.

<li> Take Potion to Lempeck Hargrim of West Karana and get LORE ITEM RUSTY SCYTH - NO DROP in return. His house is near the river bank, between the fields.

<li> Take Rusty Scyth back to cleric in temple of life for the shining star of light. You also receive the following faction changes: Priests of Life, Knights of Thunder, Guards of Qeynos and Antonius Bayle get better, Blood Sabres gets worse.
</ol>
<p>
<b>You have to be high Amiably with Priests of Life to do this quest</b>
Faction Problem. If you are a dwarf cleric you will have to do some factioning. You should be apprehensive at first.<br>
This is most likely also a problem for other races.
<p>
Easy ways to raise faction:<br>
Turned in well over 200 bone chips to Lashun Novashine (I dont suggest this) <br>
Turned in 15 bandit sashes. (Seems like the best effort/low cost way to up the faction)<br>
Turned in about 6pp in Gold to Lashun Novashine
