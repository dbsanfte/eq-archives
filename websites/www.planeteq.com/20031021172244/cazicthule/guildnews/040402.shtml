              Tormax, Yeli, and CC's First Ring War <br>
              <br>
              Posted by: Mirax on Wednesday, April 3rd, 2002<br>
            </p>
            <p>Monday was a busy day for us. First, Tormax respawned and he had 
              to die. Then, our good friend Yelinak spawned and we wasted him 
              too. Grats Abominis on her ST key, Avar on the head for his new 
              gloves and Nurilbus and Grakus on their pretty new robes. </p>
            <p>Then CC went on to do our first ring war, with the help of some 
              Talons. First, Druss met his new best friend: </p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>The dorfies all formed up, ready to defend Thurgadin against the 
              giants: </p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>The battle raged on, but finally, the giants were dead, Thurgadin 
              was secure, and Druss had a brand new ring!<br>

            <p>CC and Talons went to Icewell and took care of that nasty little 
              Dorf again. Grats Makvelis on the Dain Head, Taraddar and Tylerx 
              on the Rings of Winter, and Whitenite on the Aegis of Ice. </p>
            <p>Akheva was next. Va'Dyn died quickly, grats Parr on the Skybreaker 
              and Talons on the Shaderock Crown. </p>

            </p>

              Posted by Ztalten On Apr 01 2002<br>
              Spent most of the evening in Kael mainly for faction and ended up 
              with a bunch of loot... Grats to blasko on chain helm, gisele on 
              plate BP (!!!), nikolette on leather legs, allegory on chain legs, 
              thomm on plate boots, mayu on silk bracer and silk gloves, marek

            <p>Also managed to kill Lodizal once again... grats to naezariit on 
              the shield and grats to project eon on the map piece - thanks for 
              helping us. We also got arch lich, death peace, and ice spear of 
              the soloist for the spell bank, as well as lodizal boots (14ac 7str 
              20hp effect: turtle skin) and club of the ice ocean (14/27 3str 
              10hp effect: frost strike 149dd) for the bank.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A few quest mobs were also killed... another scout for tazmun's

              Posted by Ztalten On Mar 31 2002<br>
              CoG went to Howling Stones / Charsis because about 99% of the guild 
              had never been there and most had always wanted to go... Raid was 
              mainly to encourage people to get their keys, explore the place, 
              and get to know it so that exp groups will go there more often - 
              and well, it was a success. Drussel unfortunately wasn't up so we 
              didn't really have a big mob (I hear she's not all that bad anyway) 
              to kill, so loot wasn't plentiful... but grats to Varner on enshrouded 
              veil (7ac 2wis 2int 10fr 30hp 30mana) and Devraider on elder spirits 
              boots (8ac effect: levitate)</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>I'm also told that Liinc got the corrupted brownie in LFay (putting 
              him very close to finishing this now!!) and killed the Kromzek Captain 
              in WW for Sereta to get the talisman from the scout. Big grats to 
              the both of you =)<br>

              Hate the Turtle <br>
              Posted by Ztalten On Mar 30 2002 <br>
              We started off the afternoon sitting in iceclad from about noon 
              till 3 or 4 cst waiting for that big turtle to spawn so we could 
              get his uber loots... and well he never did show.=( So we took a 
              group of folks down to The Feerrot and killed a GIANT spider to 
              do part of Tazmun's Beastlord epic(mob cast an AE poison / snare) 
              and then headed to Nek Forest to get ready for Hate.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Sent the first group up at about 5:30cst and after a short (typical 
              for planes) break in CR we started mass slaughter of the first floor. 
              Grats to (long list):</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Arkyian (applicant) on cleric shield, Hildar on warrior arm, Grusnalg 
              on shaman boots and bracer, Gisele on cleric bracer, Samn on an 
              SK sword, Raagweed (his first trip to a plane woot!) on rogue bracer 
              and legs, Mayu on chryosilk pants, Licifed on chryosilk pants and 
              his Insidious robe(AC11, STA 8, CHA 3, INT 13, MANA 35), Leonin 
              on Greaves of the Untamed(22AC, 5 STR, 5 DEX, 5 WIS, 5 AGI, 30 HP, 
              30 MANA, +2 sv vs. fire, disease, cold and magic and +1 save vs. 
              poison)from second floor and Varner on his new pally shield Life's 
              Guard(30AC, 10 STR, 100 HP). We also dropped Hand of Maestro twice 
              somehow and got Hildar and Evthorrn their epic pieces. Also gratz 
              to Licifed on getting Essense of Vampire which takes him one step 
              closer to his very own epic. AWESOME hate raid guys, I think everyone 
              had a lot of fun and we also picked up a good 8k+ for the bank after 
              stone/peridot costs.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>As we're all recovering from a long night in Hate, Maulder notices 
              that Lodizal has finally spawned in IC!! (big grats to malfader 
              on finishing Eyepatch of Plunder too... more patience on a spawn 
              than most of us have I'm sure) After a whole lot of chaos that normally 
              involves that turtle spawn (esp having spawned uncamped) we finally 
              dropped it with a little help from TR. Big grats to Sterling on 
              club of the ice ocean (14/27 3str 10hp: frost strike) and on the 
              shield quest piece as well. We also got two spells for the guild 
              bank: Arch lich (nec) and Spiritual Purity (Bst)</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>All in all a great day for CoG =)<br>

              Lodizal Dead again <br>
              Posted by Grasnalg On Mar 27 2002 <br>
              Lodizal stuck his head out of his shell yet again and was spotted 
              by Malfader. After a couple quick port trips(thanks Manolas!! =) 
              ), we ran over to the half dead(from the first CoG group)turtle 
              and finished him off. After some strange person locked up the corpse, 
              we finally got down to get the loot and divy it out. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Gratz to the big winner Raflen on the Lodizal shield(or the quest 
              piece at least), Malfader on the eyepatch of plunder quest piece, 
              Grusnalg walked away with a nice new 1H blunt with a decent proc 
              and Ssinjinx got some new booties. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Not a bad night though, considering we weren't really planning 
              on doing anything but having a good time. Gratz again to all the 
              big winners and turtle soup for everyone, my place, Ruts bringing 
              the beer!<br>

              APR 02, 2002<br>
              This was our last night of ToV for a few weeks. Planning on some 
              other activities and trying to finish up some epic quests. Drops 
              were very kind tonight: Plate BP [Maxist], 2 Plate Gauntlets [Khandrahcir, 
              Ceeni], 2 Plate Helms [Valstorm, Brewall], Leather Cap [Tomwin], 
              Leather Boots [Tomwin], and a Black Symbol [Altus].
            <p>APR 01, 2002<br>
              Returned to ToV. Drops were a bit light tonight: Plate legs [Sylvanna], 
              Chain Legs, Plate Boots [Aorthin], and a Ruby Symbol [Skylynn].</p>
            <p>MAR 31, 2002<br>
              Instead of ToV this evening, we went to Dragon Necropolis and decided 
              to do a crawl of the zone. About midway through the raid, we realized 
              that Zlandicar was up and sent a tell to Unseen Hand if they would 
              be interested in teaming up to take him down. Everyone moved into 
              position and we took down Zlandicar with only a few deaths from 
              the DoT. Drops were: Cowl of Mortality [Valstorm], 2 Talisman of 
              Zlandicar [Unseen Hand], Heart of Zlandicar [Mmatil], and 4 spells 
              (2 Focus, Protection of the Glade, Call of the Preditor). Valstorm 
              passed down his RBG [Maxist], and Maxist's FBSS went into the guild 
              bank.</p>
            <p>MAR 29, 2002<br>
              Lot of people were out and about tonight. Switched night from raid 
              to just open experience and faction.</p>
            <p>MAR 28, 2002<br>
              Definitely getting better at ToV. Cleared the halls of testing repeatedly 
              and came away with more items than last two nights combined. Drops 
              were: Plate BP [Kilwean], Plate Helm [Aorthin], Chain Boots [Alone], 
              Plate Legs [Hawkien], Chain Sleeves [Dodja], Silk Robe [Kestel], 
              Silk Pants [Xamren], Chain Tunic [Denor], 2 Silk Bracer [Silvercaster, 
              Fenik], 2 Plate Gauntlets [Skylynn, Sylvanna], and Plate Arms [Xamia]. 
              Made our way to exit and zoned back out. Grats to all the winners!</p>
            <p>MAR 27, 2002<br>
              Another night in ToV's Hall of Testing. Many dragons fell this evening 
              and we were amply rewarded with loots: Plate Boots [Maxist, Lisner], 
              Plate Bracer [Sylvanna], Chain Helm [Khallin], Plate Breastplate 
              [Awll], Silk Sleeves [Silvercaster], and Silk Boots [Kestel]. At 
              the end, we medded up and then began walk towards zone exit, only 
              to have 4 mobs appear on us at once (nothing like bad agros through 
              walls and bad pathing...). We had planned well though, and nearly 
              all the groups were able to evac, a few corpses had to be summoned, 
              but overall, great preparedness. </p>
            <p>MAR 26, 2002<br>
              Came back to ToV with a vengance. This time, we cleared large portions 
              of the East Hall. Lots of loots this evening! Plate Boots [Valstorm, 
              Kilwean], Plate Helm [Lisner], Leather Boots [Chiun], Plate Gloves 
              [Nato], Glowing Drake Orb [Shcammer], and a few other drops. Made 
              our way to the exit and zoned back to the start.</p>
            <p>MAR 25, 2002<br>
              Crimson Talon's first raid on ToV! We did portions of the East Hall. 
              Still getting our feet wet, but still managed to get a chain arms 
              and plate boots.</p>
            <p>MAR 23, 2002<br>
              Raid on Dragon Necropolis. Camped near entrance and managed to get 
              some minor loot.<br>
            </p>
            MAR 22, 2002<br>
            Raid on Siren's Grotto. Went to bottom of the well and came away with 
            numerous velious breastplate quest gems.
            <p>MAR 21, 2002<br>
              Severilous was up again tonight, and Lumper was waiting for him. 
              He quickly put out the word in guildchat and we came scrambling 
              from Siren's Grotto to help our warrior out. We quickly dispatched 
              Severilous for the second time this week. Drops were: Green Dragon 
              Scale [Lumper], Selos Drums of the March [Devaberiel], Rune Bolster 
              Belt [Machedor], Dragon Bone Bracer [Dreamthief], and 4 nice spells. 
              Machedor passed down his sash of the dragonborn, and a fbss was 
              passed down after that. Grats to everyone and thanks to the guests 
              that tagged along with us.</p>
            <p>MAR 18-20, 2002<br>
              Coming off a few days in Kael Drakkal to work on faction. Camped 
              different area of the zone each night and came away with some nice 
              armour drops. Lots of plate drops last night and had enough items 
              go get something to almost every plate user and some extras.</p>

              Disir and Drizo who both whacked out a chunks of<br>
              their epics in The Overthere the past week. Grats to Kelti, Houfter,

            <p>
              Tore through the plane of Fear the other night. After a false start 
              we broke in with help from An Rach and<br>
              their allies and owned the zone for over 5 hours. Lots of nice loots

            <p>Would like to welcome back a friend to DoKR who had taken a break 
              from EQ, but has returned as a friendly bard, Amadaus. We also added 
              a cool Rogue to the mix, Calashar and a shadown night named Disir. 
              Disir also took a major step in his epic with the help of Andorean, 
              Kumos and Drizo. Congrats.<br>

              Prowled around Kael a few times this week and helped Houfter snatch 
              up some nice boots from the giants. We also spilled a little lizard 
              blood in Cazic Thule, the new cazic thule with the same old trains 
              except they can wipe out level 60s hehehehe. Camped the giant forts 
              both in dread lands and burning woods, with modest success, thanks 
              a bunch to all those that helped out.<br>
              <br>
              Some of us did some major improvements in the gear department as 
              the guild footed the bill for a few items that should go along way 
              toward helping peeps out. Somnus, Kelti, Uladrian, Houfter, Swadi, 
              and Aliciarose all added some new armorment. Good job guys.<br>

            <p>We had a nearly flawless victory against this particular AOW last 
              week. Our first shot was a little rocky, but our second attempt 
              we only lost like 6 people. Against this guy, I'm gonna say that's 
              pretty damned good. I'd say something regarding our l33t skillz 
              or something, but I'll just let the picture speak for itself. Grats 
              to Isifhan and Shadowrose on your new rings and Sanuvin on your

              Holy shit what a night of crap - Merauk (4/4/2002) <br>
              <br>
              Rooted Tunare has to be one of the easiest mobs in the game currently. 
              I think we have lost one time to her since the first upgraded killing 
              and every other kill has been flawless.</p>
            <p>Tonight, I want to say we lost like 12 times (at least) I shit 
              you not. It pretty much goes down on the books as one of my worst 
              EQ nights since the 14hr POF CR way back when. </p>
            <p>This means one of two things will happen. For the next week every 
              mob bigger then a moss snake will totally own us or we will go own 
              everything that moves with perfect execution. Lets hope for the 
              latter of the two ;&gt;<br>

              Went down to The Deep and laid some serious smack onto the Burrower 
              Beast. Probably our best go yet at him, nice to see coming of a 
              little rest our execution is still perfect.</p>
            <p>To ponder a little for a moment let us reflect upon hate and love 
              for others. </p>
            <p>Always give your best, never get discouraged, never be petty; always 
              remember other may hate you, but those who hate you don't win unless 
              you hate them, and then you destroy yourself.</p>

              will get better useable loot taking X people and killing some old 
              school dragon in Kunark. <br>
              Thank you for your time!</p>

              Killed Thought Horror Overfiend last night (or so I read). Other 
              then that been a week of experience and just general goofing off. 
            </p>
            <p>Happy Easter to everyone (except Canadians).<br>

              I hate POG - Merauk (3/25/2002 ) <br>
              <br>
              Cleared POG again. Managed to lose to Tunare first go around thanks 
              to fat druid spells. Flawless second shot. Fat l00ts fell from the 
              sky and everyone was happy.<br>

              Server resets again! Mass ph4t l00t is farmed! - Zippo (3/25/2002) 
              <br>
              <br>
              Welp due to some freak server crash last night we got to work our 
              ballz off again today, Tormax spawned moments after server up, took 
              a small force to Kael at 3 AM to take him out.</p>
            <p>Later in the day Burrower Beast spawned, so we felt obligated not 
              to pass on a chance at the ph4test l00t ever so we took this guy 
              out. Grats Merauk on robe, Cilorian on Ring.</p>
            <p>After that we dropped AOW, ph4t l00t was enjoyed by all, Grats 
              Phantaziaa on Helm and Deedit on your War bow.</p>
            <p>Next stop Tunare this sloot (Sorry Mhyrrin) had to go down again! 
              Grats Grumpyleaf on Earing, Teufle on Piercer, Nalenn and Korkrest 
              on belts!<br>

              Snoozer day - Merauk (3/23/2002) <br>
              <br>
              Went and beat up The Creator. Dropped some sword and monk headband, 
              none of which an enchanter can use so totally a waste of time. Moved 
              on to try our hand at CT Ring of Fire thing (anyone else feel this 
              type of encounter is so over used now it sucks?).</p>
            <p>Learned some interesting things, some of the recent patch changes 
              made this a bit more doable. Would expect to see this ring defeated 
              somewhere in EQ land fairly soon. Spawned the first Avatar but pretty 
              much got owned, which is typical for a first attempt on an encounter 
              as complex as this. Got some good info though. </p>
            <p>Edit: Also did the Arch lich, but then again hes been downgraded 
              so much its getting way way too simple.</p>

              Another day of ownage... - Zippo (3/22/2002) <br>
              <br>
              Started out the day by knocking out Tunare, fat slut died pretty 
              fast, wasn't our normal flawless victory, but hey sometimes a few 
              people gotta go off and die and ruin it for everyone =(. Tunare 
              put out an earing, 2 bard raipers, and a 2h sword for a twink!</p>
            <p>After that we headed to the deep, dropped the Turd Beast with little 
              trouble. After which we headed to Akheva and killed Itraer and Shei 
              Vinitras. Itraer dropped ranger sword and cleric hammer, Shei dropped 
              Piercer and some priest range item.</p>
            <p>Later in the night late night crew decided to drop some chick in 
              katta, and finally for a last finale decided to drop Though Horror 
              Overfiend at 3AM. THO dropped SK weapon/helm (SUPRISE).</p>

              <br>
              Took a trip into the Halls of Testing and had mixed results. We 
              had a good crew there, but kept having a problem with the MoBs outside 
              the door deciding to come play inside. Ended up eating a couple 
              wipeouts. Got some kills in though. Grats to Gorewyn (plate helm), 
              Trinady (chain bracer), and Dankee (chain legs). Hopefully, we can 
              return next time and have a less CR-licious time. <br>

              Back in Hate again today. Spent some time just killing wanderers 
              because zone hadn't respawned from server crash the night before. 
              But, we killed and killed and killed as they spawned, and cleared 
              the first floor and part of 2nd. No moni-bosses or Maestro spawned, 
              unfortunatly. But, we did get some drops. Rogue stuff for Sadall 
              and Thornwolf (including books for epic), cleric breastplate for 
              Infexious (finally), and some other stuff including part of SK epic 
              that's quite rare. All in all, a great day up there. No wipeouts, 
              very few deaths at all. <br>
              <br>

              <br>
              Saturday March 23rd we broke into Hate. Break in was no problem, 
              but trying to move to the cleric house from zone in, rather than 
              from safespot, proved to be a tricky proposition. Made for a day 
              with more CR time than killing time. But we still got some drops 
              so grats to all who got something. <br>
              <br>
              Website is back up and domain name is working (thanks SV). Friday, 
              March 22 we took 3 groups into Chardok in search of the enchanter 
              epic piece, which happens to drop from the Prince. We torched the 
              place and really had no difficulty getting into the Prince's lair. 
              Only thing that slowed us down were some linkdeaths and such. Once 
              there, we thought it would be fun to pull the Prince and all of 
              his protectors! Well, wipeout ensued, but only after the Prince 
              was down and his head looted (grats Shazzum). The kill was saved 
              by the nuke group who vaporized the Prince after the melee were 
              down. <br>

              Today we decided to try IV and Grieg again and they died with relative 
              ease.
            <p>IV dropped a pair of Vex Xi Vius for us. Grats to Aniela and Regor. 
              Everyone loves a good blind!</p>
            <p>Grieg dropped Geomantic Fingers of Focus for Lilcure and a Belt

              Doomshade <br>
              Had to try him, many people been talking but noone acting. So Blas 
              set up a trip to UP to trigger the Doomshade. Pulled a few nameds 
              first and then finally the shade. He put up a good fight but died. 
              Dropped all crap but a good bow. Grats Melk on the coolest looking 
              Bow ever seen. Sweet graphics. <br>

              Yelinak the Virgin <br>
              The feared Yelinak ( SS dragon ) finally had to feel our wrath. 
              Today i dont know why we waited this long on killing him, what a 
              wuss. 50 people and about 4 died only. Brilliant tactics and awesome 
              teamwork made Yelinak look like a cripple. Who will be next ? Grats 
              to Radiation on Gaunts, Mizt on Sages ring and Anavons on some new 
              weaponry. After celebrating the death of Yelinak, we set sail for 
              Dragon Necropolis to kill Zlandicar, took us 30 minutes from zone 
              till he died. New strategy used, lets call it 'Planned Zerg', one 
              person died, shame on you Pally !! Grats to Brithorn on your ST 
              key and Hazh on Cowl.......Heed these words, for a Gnome will enter 
              Sleepers soon. <br>

              Mass slayin' <br>
              A rexaling saturday resulted in hugner and lust to raid sunday, 
              which we did. Many mobs did fell, blood scattered the ground as 
              they fell, one by one. Started off killing the stone giant ( mentioned 
              in earlier post ), then Vindicator and Statue died to allmost flawless 
              victories. Still had time to do more mobs, so headed to Sleepers 
              to aquire some primals, Grip 'Slayer of stuff' Taoistic will be 
              even better at slayin with his new 15 / 20 fistwraps yay. While 
              forces were clearing ST, others were sent to Fear to clear up for 
              CT fight, but unfortunately fear didnt get populated so that was 
              cancelled. Scouts were sent to Ssra to check on Zhezum. He was confirmed 
              up so we quickly moved there. Set speed record, from zone to dead 
              Zhezum took 40 minutes !! woot. Grats to our new BattleCleric Gwyn 
              on hammer. <br>

              Rumblecrush <br>
              Well, rumors lured us all to Umbral Plains to have a look at that 
              Stone Guardian called RumbleCrush... He was a feared mob, and known 
              to wipe quite a few guilds.....so we prepared Troops for the worst 
              possible encounter. Fast debuffs made him piece of cake and he died 
              misserably 1 minute after the pull. Sad to see a mob like this drop 
              better stuff then Lendi, but oh well, guess its time to farm. <br>

            <p>Wow it's been a huge week for The Relentless and Element of Darkness. 
              24 Boss mobs dead... 3 x PoG clearings and Tunare, 3 x Burrower 
              Beast, couple of Tormax's with an Avatar of War thrown in for good 
              measure among the most noted.<br>

            <p> Fun when server crashes.. <br>
              Posted By: Zith on 25 March 2002</p>
            <p>Server crashed late Saturday night.. so we decided at 4am to go 
              kill Tormax. Was a pretty flawless kill considering what time it 
              was. Grats to Rabrak on your boots and Stilt on your belt.<br>
              After getting some sleep we hit the Deep for the Burrower Parasite. 
              Turning into one of our favorite encounters, and seemingly easier 
              every time.. he coughed up a tunic for Thrynne, and a dagger for 
              Magnuss.</p>
            <p>After that we headed to Kael to face our arch nemisis.. the Avatar 
              of War. Seems we have this fight down now, as we killed him the 
              first attempt pretty easily. Drops were two helms and a bow. Grats 
              to Crestfallen on your helm!</p>
            <p>All in all, a good weekend..<br>

            <p>Well, was a big day of killing big mobs and surprisingly little 
              dying.<br>
              We managed to take down Rhag 1 and 2, Arch Priest and Creator...all 
              went down without a hitch... Grats EoD on a ton of weapons, and 
              grats us on about 38210482083 copies of Moonfire... WTF? Oh, and 
              grats Choter on Funeral Pyre... </p>
            <p>Then we decided to go to Cazic Thule and show the &quot;Ring of 
              FEAR(TM)&quot; what we were made of! Well, unfortunately, we had 
              too many members staring at the cleric chick's boobs (the cleric 
              that talks to you through the whole fight...) and we got thoroughly 
              slaughtered about 30 minutes in... Granted, we DID have about 25 
              mobs of all shapes and colors and taunt wasn't working..but that's 
              entirely beside the point...</p>
            <p>After coffining out, we sent a crew to go take on HoT dragons... 
              Congrats more peeps on getting parts of uber loot! As for me, I 
              went to Sebilis and passed myself off as a paladin... &quot;What 
              cleric would have a primal brawlstick?!&quot; I say and laugh wickedly...

            <p>The last 2 days seemed to flow into one another as we embarked 
              on another BFA killing spree,this time, all in the name of Emergency 
              Patch Day!!!<br>
              The early birds (&lt;3 you people, was a LONG day for some of you) 
              started clearing PoG in preparation for Tunare, who fell to the 
              combined might of the BFA in her typical fashion... like a chump. 
              Grats Summine on your phat earring of FTness and Twink_01 on your 
              bard rapier! So sad, 50% of Tunare loot seems now to be going to 
              twinks </p>
            <p>Then we raced on over to The Deep to reward the early birds with 
              a worm of magnificent proportions. Grats Soiel on our first Ancient 
              Burrower Hide Tunic and YOUR phat FTness, and grats Thorem on your 
              Ring of the Depths.</p>
            <p>Stuff was still alive so we headed to Akheva where GETTING to Itraer 
              Vius continues to be a problem for us. &#147;Don&#146;t let these 
              GATE!!&#148; *cough*&#133; so, ANYWAY&#133; IV died in much the 
              same fashion as Tunare when we finally got there Gratz Zith on Lightwoodsmans 
              Blade for your bank!</p>
            <p>From Itraer to Shei where everything went perfectly, Gratz guys 
              on a great fight AND gratz Hierl on your phat Sphere of Stacking 
              Issues.</p>
            <p>At this point most people decided enough was enough and went to 
              bed like all good people do. The totally insane decided that ANOTHER 
              trip over the invisible bridge in The Deep was in order. *I* was 
              smart and waited until everyone was across before logging back in 
              for Coffin of the Hero to the Thought Horror Overfiend. THO and 
              his 65 BILLION HPs died shortly thereafter and dropped&#133; SK/PAL 
              LOOT! Gratz Malheur on your Ancient Gladius. </p>

              Did you feel the rush of Power last night? Do you feel that void 
              inside you is a little less empty today? It is because our Power 
              Relic had been returned last night!! NOT only did we return our 
              Power Relic, we also captured Midgard's Power Relic! Congrats to 
              all who fought the battle!! Enjoy the victory and celebrate! We 
              had won a battle, but the war is not over. Some day, we WILL see 
              our Strength Relic back and safe in our Relic Keep.</p>
