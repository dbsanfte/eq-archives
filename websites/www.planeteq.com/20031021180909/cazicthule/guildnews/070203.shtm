            Torn burnt book ripped from Sev's dead body <br>
            Posted by: Ikana on Sunday, June 29, 2003<br>
            <br>
            Vintersorg noticed Severilious up. The bad news for Sev was that
            we quickly arrived in force, bringing whole exp groups in some cases
            and took him down. Waited with bated breath and YES he had the book
            Elca needed as his last item for epic.
            <p>Grats also to Saxonlight on Mask of the Hunter.</p>
            <p>Other drops from memory (open rolled) Pouch, GDS, Selos Drums
            of the March, Spirit of Oak, Talisman of Raptor.</p>

            <p>A second night in
                  the North Temple of Veeshan for non-stop dragon killing. With
                  a virtual full house, we had a lot of work to do:</p>            <p>Maiz: Barrier of Sound [Missycat]<br>
              Lord Koi: Ancient Pirate Eyepatch [Aorthin], Greaves of the Deep
                Sea [Kagarok], Net of the Deep Sea [Sabretta]<br>
              Lady Mir: Mithril Gauntlets [Maemura], Frost Wrath [Elcabongue]<br>
              Sevalak: Shield of Midnight [Romell]<br>
              Cekenak: Blackstar [Dezziy], Meljeldin [Kagarok]<br>
              Zlexak: Baton of Flame [Ignatious], Dragonspine Rapier [Yakkai]<br>
              Jorellag: Crown of Resiliance, Sprinkler of the Spirits [Barelil],
              Facesmasher [Khandrahcir]<br>
              Nev: Cloak of Thorns [Machedor], Girdle of Dark Power [Brewall],
            Nev Right Eye</p>
                  <p>Tomorrow night, we will get the two remaining dragons
                that weren't up the first day that we didn't want to double-back
              to.</p>            <p><img src="ToVLordKoiDoken.jpg"></p>

              Posted by: brewall on Wednesday, June 25, 2003<br>
              <br>
              Time for North Temple of Veeshan once again per the Cazic-Thule
              rotation agreement. Due to the patch, we decided to move our optional
              start date up from Friday to Tuesday to maximize everyone's time.
              Dispatched Aaryonar without any difficulty and killed a few other
              dragons as well.<br>
              Aaryonar: Circlet of Summer [Bearrun], Hand of the Master [Keyra],
              Reaper's Ring [Tico]<br>
              Flurry Drakes: 2 Ring of Superiority [Naydell, Imotep]<br>
              Lord Feshlak: Amulet of the Storm, Boots of the Dead Dream [Greymask]<br>
              Dagarn: Wurm Pauldrons [Udian], Bow of the Destroyer [Lisner],
            Belt of the Destroyer [Valstorm]</p>
              <p><img src="ToVAaryonar.jpg"></p>            <p>More Slayings <br>
              Posted by: ctadmin on Tuesday, June 24, 200<br>
              Additional slayings throughout the lands over the last several
                days. Itraer Vius met an untimely demise (twice), Grieg who was
                kind enough to provide us
    with a Spire Attuned Shard [Aorthin], and Klandicar (twice), and Zlandicar.

            <p>Foray into Sleeper's
                Tomb <br>
              <br>
              With the few keys that we have to Sleeper's Tomb, we made our
                first foray into the zone to learn a bit more about it. We successfully
                cleared much of the zone and will obtain more keys in the coming
              weeks.</p>            <p><a href="http://defenderskerraridge.tripod.com/dokr/index.html"><b>Defenders

              <p>Welcome back to Eeden and Lidayne. Both had taken some extended
                breaks and are now back full swing.</p>
              <p>Natazuul prompted a few of us to beam over to Toxx to kill some
                overgrown skelly. While we were there we decided to farm him
                a bit and dropped him for everyone there that needed his heart.

                Fairsong. Speaking of yours truely, Id like to challenge Quon

              <p>I inducted myself as a full blown member of the purple club.

              <p>The past week we Rumbled in Umbral a few times and cut down
                a few giants in Kael. Grats to all the new gear and items peeps
                have picked up. Beni made out like a phat kat and picked up some
                plate arms and boots in kael. Great job on the leveling guys
                and gals. The increased levels has allowed us to tackle some
            nice camps in house with fewer numbers.</p>

              News: Two is better than one ? <br>
posted on 06-30-2003 10:34 AM by Larry<br>
              Well in most cases two is better than one. I mean why have only
            one $100 dollar bill, when you can have 2?</p>
            <p>And I mean whats better after a hard day of raiding the planes
              than knocking back a couple of cold ones.</p>
            <p>And almost everyone of you have fantasized about dating twins,
              as opposed to a single person.</p>
            <p>Well, I can tell you one thing that isnt better twice over, and
              that is that stupid &quot;I would rather have 2 root canals&quot; encounter
              called the Rathe. You see we worked very hard to kill the Rathe
              Council to get time flagged, and for one reason or another we had
              a few of our very active players not able to get the flag. So what
              are you gonna do?</p>
            <p>For those not familiar with Relentless values, we most definately
              have family values inside the guild. We all decided that there
              was no way we were going to go start exploring in the Plane of
              Time without those people who failed to get flagged at the first
              Rathe kill because of poor coding or bad timing. So we made a pact!
              We decided our guild would not raid Time until the Rathe council
              felt our sting a second time!</p>
            <p>Well Doing Rathe twice is not the same as drinking 2 beers, receiving
              $200 dollars or dating twins. In fact doing Rathe twice is enough
              to push a guild to the limits of sanity. However in the end Rathe
              dies again, those people who weren't able to get flags during the
              first kill got taken care of, and heck even the value of my twink
              went up a couple hundred dollars.</p>
            <p>Time for Time!</p>

              I am so proud to be a part of this guild and I just want to thank
                everyone for being there today <br>
              playing your hearts out. This awful encounter designed by sadists
              at Verant almost seemed<br>
              easy tonight. Everyone played their part extremely well and went
              the extra mile when minor<br>
            problems arose. Well done Relentless! </p>
            <p>I was a bit preoccupied to take pictures while at the Rathe encounter
            so I took a few snapshots around Time. </p>

            <p><br>
              The Creator fell to SA again, just one night after our 1st, due
                  to a patch. The 1st fight taught us a lot, because this one
                  dropped in about half the time. Kudos to Opossum for working
                  out a great
                  strategy. Kudos to everyone for taking care of the adds, as
                  required, and doing a great job of controlling aggro. And of
                  course we
                  can't forget the healers and debuffers, they did a marvelous
              job. Here is a list of the items that were dropped by both Creators:</p>            <p>Grey Dusted Wraps - Zodo<br>
              Grey Dusted Wraps - Sanaelar<br>

            <p>Nothing like starting out a new month with new members... and
              a cleric and warrior are always a nice combination to add at the
              same time to any roster. Now if we can just keep the barbarian
              from tripping over the human healer we'll have it made...but maybe
              that's hoping for to much....</p>

            <p> Wednesday, June 25, 2003 - Ratskeller <br>
              Posted by: [Pirotess] on June 25th, 2003 @ 11:16 PM</p>
            <p>Its no secret SS and TR are not on good terms with each other.
              Competing for over 3 years on a limited supply of mobs to kill
              does just that. I will however have to say that I feel for them
              on the major rear ramming Ratskeller orchestrated this week but
              maybe thats Karma, I dunno. Over the 4 year history of SS, we've
              had members leave for several different reasons. Some have sold
              and some even padded their accounts with items well after they
              knew they were leaving us. However never did any of them do it
              with items so hard to come by as a Time key.</p>
            <p>While I wont go into details since you can read about those here,
              I will say this to you Ratskeller so you understand why Im posting
              this. Dragging my guild into your concocted story solely for the
              purpose of pressuring your guildmates to pay an outrageous sum
              of money for your account is sub worm level. I havent seen accounts
              go for $2600 since the Kunark days and those were decked out. While
              my members money is naturally theirs to do with as they see fit,
              I'll be happy to go on record here as saying they wouldnt be a
              member if I caught them with the Ratskeller account. That is unless
              it was purchased to delete you or leave you logged in 24x7 in Tranquility
              for abuse. Seeing an account break even 1k in these twilight days
              of EQ is so rare you've got to be on crack if you think we'd believe
              there was:</p>
            <p><br>
              A) someone in SS who truly considered you a friend</p>
            <p>and</p>
            <p><br>
              B) had $2600 dollars to blow on a weak account like yours.</p>
            <p>However, just in case we've recently conducted a poll to test
              just those things. I'll be moving it to the front page shortly
              for you all to participate in as well. Until then here are a few
              of the better Haiku's our members came up with to describe our
              feelings of you.</p>
            <p>---------------------</p>
            <p>My New Main just cost<br>
              More than many people's rent.<br>
              and it's Ratskeller</p>
            <p>---------------------</p>
            <p>What are you smoking?<br>
              Playing your guild off of ours?<br>
              Please say it is crack.</p>
            <p>---------------------</p>
            <p>Took the flags you did.<br>
              Show the remorse, you did not.<br>
              Kick your ass they will.</p>
            <p>---------------------</p>
            <p>And heres a few other things to make you smile as we remember
              Ratskeller in all his glory.</p>
            <p>100k plat - $350<br>
              Ratskeller - $2600<br>
              Publically acknowledging you sold guild earned stuff and are stupid
              - Priceless</p>
            <p>There are some things in EQ you can't buy, for everything else
              there's PlayerAuctions.</p>
            <p>---------------------</p>
            <p>Why did I answer &quot;Yes&quot; you might ask?<br>
              I'm sorry, I was drinking all day from my flask.<br>
              Was I upset when he sold his time key?<br>
              Of course I..hang on, I gotta pee.<br>
              But not on poor Ratskeller body aflame,<br>
              Personally I think his small penis was to blame.<br>
              So why would SS spend all that dough?<br>
            A small price to pay to be rid of that ho.<br>

            <p>One day this cute little ball of fur was discovered on our doorstep... &quot;Aaaaah,

              by....&quot;Pirotess, can we keep it...pleeeeaaaaseee.&quot; So
              after some discussion, and actually discovering she has a few useful
