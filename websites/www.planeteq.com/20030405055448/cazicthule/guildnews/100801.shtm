<i>Note: unless news is emailed to me, I check all guild websites on cazicthule.com for news, and post recent news I find there (this site feature has not been updated for a while, so I am starting again with the most recent news.  Guild news must be from mid-September to the present to show up here).  If your guild has a website and doesn't have news here, it's because I could not find any to report, or it was more than one month old.<P>If you would like to have news of what your guild is doing around Norrath posted here, please email kwill@planeteq.com.  And, if for some bizarre reason you would <b>not</b> like your guild featured in this report, let me know that too!

<p><b>News from Guilds Around Cazic Thule:</b><p>

<b><a href="http://www.gamersed.com/%7Eaod/" target="_top">Alliance of Druids</a></b><br>The website has gone through a major overhaul and will continue to be updated.<p>

<b><a href="http://meow.dyndns.org/News.asp" target="_top">Amichi</a></b><br>The Amichi database has undergone a small facelift.  When a search is done on items be it vendor sales or just raw item list, it now provides more links to information about the item, if there is some in the database.<p>

<b><a href="http://members.home.net/blindfaithdivision/home.htm" target="_top">Blind Faith Division</a></b><br>Hate sucked...we bust into a almost cleared first level which is exactly what we wanted...The other guild raiding it pulls on top of me and somehow I wind back up in camp with ***loads...It's been a while since I had a wipeout in Hate/ /sigh.  We got back up and running fairly quick and are off to second floor.  We cleared half of the second floor only to have a ranger helm drop...no blue diamonds, 3 regular diamonds, very few trinkets, was a worthless two days....<p>

<b><a href="http://www.theblacktalons.net/" target="_top">Black Talons</a></b><br>Talk about a fun night!  First we took down Telkomor, and then we decided that we were up to the challenge of trying Gorzem.  We stayed Gorz on the first attempt and he went down easily to the hand of the Talons, making this another CT server first.  Congratulations to everyone who received loot from the dragons!<p>

We have charted our course and will stick to it.<br><br>Please go to eq.guildmagic.com and register.  The roster is going to be done from there.  This will allow us to plan raids more effectively.  On Sunday, October 7, CH will be making a raid at Crystal Caverns.  Also involved in the raid will be our allies Nightbladers.  Possibly some members of Heralds of the Gods will be joining us.<P>

Welcome back Fleshcarver Shadowblade.<p>


<b><a href="http://ctu.gnomish.net/" target="_top">Clockwork Tinker's Union</a></b><br>Please join me for a tour of the palatial dwelling known as the Estate of Unrest on Thursday, October 4 at 9:00 p.m. (eastern). Be warned, the grounds are a bit shaggy and the current tenants would like to chew your face off. However, we frown on this type of hospitality so shall show them the business end of sword and spell. <p>We will gather together to craft gnomish tinkered items and enjoy the magnificence of the windmills.  This is a recurring event held the second Monday of each Month.<p>

<b><a href="http://cohort.cc/" target="_top">Cohort Chalybeius</a></b><br>Kelorek Dar died to CC today, drops were two Cloak of Crystalline Waters and a Typhoon. 

CC spent the weekend killing all sorts of fun dragons in Western Wastes. Grats to everyone on their new mini-NoS and dragon armor drops. Lots of spells too!<br><br>So we were on our way to Sebilis to spawn the Trakanon clone for the Bard Epic, and someone forget to tell Wuoshi that she wasn't due up yet. After she made a tasty meal out of a few of us, we had to get revenge! Drops were 3 Emerald Dragon Scales, 2 skydarkeners (grats Banandar!) and a Scimitar of the Emerald Dawn.<br><br>

Then we got back to Sebilis and took down the Trakanon clone. Grats to Spiritsong on his new Singing Steel Sword!<p>

<b><a href="http://www.crimsontalon.com" target="_top">Crimson Talon</a></b><br>Dodja finishes quest for ranger epic Swiftwind!

SEP 25, 2001
Raid on the Hole with KoT. Crawled down the dungeon getting some needed epic pieces. Made it all the way to the bottom and decided to take on Nortlav the Scalekeeper for the first time.  Grats to Valstorm on the red dragon scale and to Bar for the spaulders. An excellent raid overall and we learned a lot.  Definitely the way the game was meant to be played with a crawl and killing a tough mob at the end.

SEP 24, 2001
Raid on Dragon Necropolis. Second raid in this zone was rewarded with a few items. Definitely need a few levels or a bigger group to deal with ratmen.<p>

<b><a href="http://www.neoweb.net/brad/da/" target="_top">Divine Alliance</a></b><br>Sontalak was killed followed by a Dozekar who bears a striking resemblance to Sontalak (well, Dozekar moos, but that's the only difference).  It's been a week, and you all know I'm lucky if I remember the loot 20 minutes after the fight.  People got stuff.  We rejoiced.<p>

On Sunday, we did another awesome ring war, so grats to Sasaris on his 10th ring :).  We kept all our dorfs alive, we got some loot from them, and once again, we rejoiced.<p>

On Tuesday, we made a trip to Airplane to do some epic stuff, but the lil monk dude wasn't up.  So we messed around and keeled things.  They dropped a TON of stuff.<p>

Wednesday, we hit Sleepers, killed some warders, etc.  And once again, we rejoiced, since we didn't get a bunch of stuff that Mort needed.  I took pictures, but you know what the warders look like.  Oh, and thank you to all there for hooking me up with that primal spear.  I still suck, but I suck less now!  Thanks :D<p>

And to round out this update, we keeled Lendiniara last night.  I think Chadd got the key...who may or may not remember, depending on how much beer was consumed last night.<p>

<b><a href="http://www.viper.tierranet.com/Drunkards/" target="_top">Drunkards of Norrath</a></b><br>Point: I, Twyl/Srukin/L, am resigning as the leader of the Drunkards as well as leaving the game of Everquest.<p>

Drunkards have been around since nearly the beginning of EQ and that's more than most guilds can say. I never wanted to be part of a guild that was uber, loot oriented, or raid oriented- and you guys (god bless you all) let the Drunkards be just that. I have a lot of pride in this guild and still do, I think it's great that we accomplished whatever it is we accomplished - cause it's rare to see a guild do what we do (namely: nothing) and actually survive the test of time. Some members have come and gone (though some we were glad to get rid of) but in the end about 90% of our members, current or old ones, have left some sort of positive mark on the guild- or at least on me.<p>

Vdien will be taking my position as the leader of the Drunkards...<p>

<b><a href="http://www.elementofdarkness.com/" target="_top">Element of Darkness</a></b><br>Mainly because it seems they added one side of the equation and not the other ;> That being its easier to kill certain mobs, without much of the buffing the mobs part. I say this because yes, mobs have more hps, but other than that, didnt really notice anything to make it a zero sum encounter ;> Anyways dropped Tormax and the three warders. Hey snowspinner, ask Nalenn for a primal 2nder seeing we gave him 4 primals in one trip.<p>
   
Apparently we have friends everywhere these days. EOD and TR took another stab at the fourth warder our first attempt since BOTS killed him first (we actually tried the same day they did and were of course bummed out they beat us to it :p).<p>

Sad to report we didn't get the job done but learned some new interesting things. Probably make some more stabs at it in the future. Bottom line is we crave new things to kill and all we have left is Tunare and Ventani. Loving High Elfs like we do Tunare is OFF LIMITS!<p><b>Enconium Cadre</b><br>Encomium Cadre is no more.... 
Most all the council including myself are retiring from game. It was fun while it lasted and I wish everyone the best of luck in the future.<br>

			  Friday and Saturday night we raided with Defenders 
              of Kerra Ridge in City of Mist and Chardok. We left Chardok last 
              night with Machedor as the proud owner of a new Sarnak Skullsplitter. 
              Thanks to all who attended either or both raids. I look forward 
              to seeing more of you in the future.
            <p>

I would like to thank you all for a wonderful turn out last night in Kedge. Khandrahcir was able to get the bone he needs for his spell quest and we were able to meet some friends and allies. Great work everyone and thanks for your patience during the hard times.<p>

Greetings!!! Just a quick reminder for everyone to visit everquestraids.com for current raids that we'll be sponsoring or attending. Happy Hunting!<p>

<b><a href="http://eqtwilight.homestead.com/index.html" target="_top">Knights of Twilight</a></b><br>So whats new in KOT aside from the boards?  Well, a new look, a new attitude.  We have lost a few people recently, gained some more, and had a couple week break period in which to reflect.  Its time though to get back to work.  We are looking at Hate on the weekend of the 20th, and also another co-op raid with Crimson Talon to Kael.  The date has yet to be released.<p>

<b><a href="http://legacyofdarkness.no-ip.com/" target="_top">Legacy of Darkness</a><br></b>We went to Air, for the first time this Thursday, Friday, Saturday. Bregan D'Aerth came along to join the madness. We had a rough start the first two days, but finally got ourselves into gear on Saturday and cruised to the 5th Isle with relative ease. We succeeded in accomplishing what we set out to do, which was getting Pikaroofy her monk EPIC piece and our 5 Rangers thier EPIC pieces. Congrats to Leneril, Gallerien, Ghelandar, Kaluvdar, and Biel. Along the way we picked up several haste belts and was able to complete the Cloak/Cape quest for Lysantt's Necro Epic and got two more pieces for Carmina's Necro EPIC. Talamyr(Me) got the Blade of Abrogation for his EPIC. Gallerien completed some Ranger Cloak quest and Oogg completed some Shaman Necklace quest from there as well. Grats to them!<p>

Congratulations to Khrystania on our first Enchanter EPIC.<p> 

Congratulations to Salerien on our first Druid EPIC.<p>

Recruitment:
Our recruitment has been frozen for the most part, except for special exceptions. However we are now currently looking for specific classes.

              Welcome aboard Taistick and Cajunelf, the latest additions to Ordained. 
              Woot!<br>
            </p>
            <p><b><a href="http://www.orderofoblivion.com" target="_top">Order of Oblivion</a><br></b>Congrats to all those who have recently completed their epics, we are over 1/2 was done with getting one of each class, 8 out of 14 with 6 more to go.<p>

Also congrats to all on the drops from ToV, the zone has been a challenge at times, and a breeze at others. Hopefully with our increased assets, we will be tackling bigger and better mobs.<p>

We are currently in the recruiting process, you can vist our site at: www.orderofoblivion.com for our homepage and policies.
            <p> If your looking for a end game guild that is just breaking into 
              the high end game, drop us a line. We don't know how to do everything, 
              we haven't done everything, but we have a hell of a lot of fun learning 
              on our own how to do them. So if your interested in doing things 
              for the first time, with others who are doing it for the first time, 
              check us out. Most of the upper end game is still new to us, and 
              it's exciting. Were not killing these mobs for the 50th time where 
              it's routine and boring.
            <p>

<a href="http://www.geocities.com/cazicriders/" target="_top"><b>Pale Riders</b></a><br>PR and CoG finished up our PoA raid a couple days ago and ended up with a bunch of Spiroc Blades, 5 Mage crowns, a ton of Ranger Balls... err.. globes, and an assload of other stuff.<p>

<b><a href="http://www.project-eon.com" target="_top">Project EON</a></b><br>Once again E O N was the fastest guild and took down Lodizal for the 3rd time in just 3 days. Drops were boots, shell, ring and map piece that went to Azazu. Good work everyone and gratz to Azazu!<p>

Thanks to all who joined us in a raid against Permafrost on 10-06-01.<p><b><a href="http://65.101.119.209/guild/main.shtml" target="_top">The Relentless</a></b><br>Last night we cleared all the dragons that respawned in ToV North. Then we headed to Fear and took down CT.<p>Trakanon, the dragon who's name invokes fear into the hearts of Uber guilds ... not!<p>
Well obviously someone must of told him we were coming for the Donal's BP he was holding because he was obviously scared to death of us when we charged the lair.<p>

The call went out for 12 people to go kill trakanon, by the time we broke down, we had 26 so we knew this was gonna be a walk in the park ... (foreshadowing music please).<p>

You see, we should have figured something was up when Trak came to say hi as we were at the locked door before the Jugg and Reet area, but then again he was probably just wanting to inspect us to see our l337 g34r.<p>

After Trak went home ...(please note the following is spoiler information, if you wish to kill trak on your own, do not read further). ... we set up in the cubby.<p>

Killing a few jugs, a protector and a 12" cold cut combo from Subway we prepared to charge the lair. The countdown from 30 seconds happened in about 10 seconds in true Xate form, and we charged.<p>

The forces of Relentless charged into the Lair at the same time Trak saw us and ran to the bridge, so we ran to the bridge and beat on him. Of course, then, Trak gated back to the Lair after shrooming a few people. We charged the Lair just in time to see Trak run back to the bridge. We charged the bridge and I decided it was time to mem Mana Sieve. As trak once again gated back to the Lair about 1/3 of the force was shroomed, 1/3 dead and 1/3 running back to the lair again. Well you guessed it, we got to the Lair only to have Trak runback to the bridge. Well I sieved whatever mana he had left and the 8 or so of us left beat him down the rest of the way.<p>

This was truely one of the most hilarious Trak runs I have been on in the last Year or so ... GG on Donal's and Rogue BP. Special Thanks to Veschar for coming down to DMF us at the last minute, enjoy your Tooth!<p>




 

<b><a href="http://www.shadowedsoul.com/" target="_top">Shadowed Soul</a></b><br>Well, yesterday we once again entered Sleepers Tomb and fun was had by all until officer Obie found an envelope under a pile of garbage with our name on it......but that's another story. We ripped through the zone and had a blast, other than needing to sit on our duffs to wait on spawns for 2 warders. It gave us lots of time to use in gentle reflection. Titanax held a deeply spiritual prayer meeting...it was very moving. Now, about this bridge I am selling....<p><a href="http://www.shagya.com" target="_top"><b>Shahmat</b></a><br>After way too much time in Hate and Fear we've finally got most folks epics drops, finished up 4 epics this week including Wharfrat's and Kitska's.  In between epic fights, we dropped Trakanon with Cohort Chalybeius<p>After
we finish up epics - it's back to the Temple of Veeshan for us.  Recruitment?  Sure - we're always happy to talk with excellent players who want to be the best.  <A HREF="http://www.shagya.com">http://www.shagya.com</A><p><b>

City of Mist: Thanks to Vg, Tds, and Kol who worked very well together.<p>
Happy to see Bamce get his missing scrolls. exp. the "rare drop" off the 2 hour spawn Spec courior. Also happy to see Tds member Twiz get his piece from the human Skelly for his Brain Bite quest. Knights of Loyalty were also a nice addition to our raid as their 58 level rogue picked locks for reavers and then spawned Lord Goiusk for shammy epic. I Was pleased to have Kol shammy loot the books off of Lord Goisk.<p>

Bad me... forgot to get Tazmania's ring in the bank for Neh ' Ashiir. But there is hope yet as "Kol" has incouraged me to get ahold of their high level Gm "mage" for assistance for the next raid. Future does look promising.<p>

Special thanks to Aineril for pulling, Resistance, and Duffil for their selfless acts on rezzing, and Shonsu and Symetry on CR.<p>

GREAT JOB ALL. Maybe 2 weeks on another schedule, and possibly our most successful CoM raid yet. You all are great. 
Thanks again.<p>
