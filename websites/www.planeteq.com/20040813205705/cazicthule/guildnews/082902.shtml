              </b>8/26/02 Trak's Teeth <br>
              I received a slightly biased report from Drephic on the Trak's Teeth 
              Hunt yesterday: </p>
            <p>Ok after the Forager hunt , the people who were left went and hunted 
              the hunters on other side of zone.. Two groups of 4 each went after 
              the dreaded hunters , but to no avail they were in hiding. But lurking 
              in the deep woods was a skeleton named DOOM, in a scouting venture 
              the MIGHTY warrior Drephic followed a druid to hunt this menace 
              down.. If a breif but ugly battle Drephic was slain. By the mighty 
              powers of the gods he was restored to life with the newfound wisdom 
              of never follow a damn druid into the woods alone. After the Doom 
              was slain the froglok hunters came out of hiding and was soon set 
              upon tby the mighty minions of Absque Veritas. Before the minions 
              of Absque Veritas retired for the evening, six kept a medallion 
              each from the poor frogloks.<br>
              Manelanua the Shadowknight, Zoorac the bard, Phlite the Druid, Ganthir 
              the Cleric, Bukka the LOST Druid, and Kasmira the Shaman of great 
              Beauty each added a new trinket to there collection. <br>

            <p>And also another emperor today, who decided we needed more weapons 
              and dropped two Acrylia Handled Broadswords and the first Caen's

            <p>Random drop tables are part of the excitement of EQ. Sure, sometimes, 
              its a real raid-downer when after you've been fighting Ubermob_02 
              for 20 minutes, he drops 3 BST weapons. But every once in a while, 
              the drop table comes out...pretty nice.</p>
            <p>Case in point: On passing through Kael Drakken, we dropped a coin 
              in this fella and look what happened.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Yeah, no joke, 4 blades of carnage. For CC, Congrats are in order 
              to Rulak and Warlor on their new suicide sticks...err, weapons, 
              yeah, thats what I meant.</p>
            <p>So...what else have we killed this week?</p>
            <p>Well, along with the good old AoW, we got Vindi and the Statue 
              of Rallos Zek. Prior to that, we did the Rhag &quot;hat trick&quot; 
              in Ssra (Rhag 1, Rhag 2, and Arch Lich). Killed the High Priest, 
              Velketor (yeah yeah, go retro crap. Anything to get Angturil his 
              &quot;pretty-in-pink&quot; robe, I guess...), Rhag1 &amp; 2 again, 
              Blood, and had a pretty decent Emperor attempt as well. Busy busy 
              busy busy.</p>
            <p>Finally, I leave you with some words o' Wisdom from Dinuvian:</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Words all of us can look at, meditate upon, and say &quot;Din...WTF?!?!&quot;<br>

              Took this guy out with minimal loss. 
            <p> </p>
            <p>He kinda took us by surprise and started attacking before MT was 
              ready, but we called the attack to kill anyway and he dropped like 
              a drunk dwarf in an all-you-can-drink night saloon. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Gratz to bregga on the talisman. We also got some spells off him 
              that we split with BG. Check spell bank for updates soon! </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Gratz guys on an excellent kill. </p>

              Just wanted to say thank you to everyone who came out to the Arena 
              this evening. I think the new apps who came were quite impressed 
              with our way of getting to know each another...with a boot to the 
              skull. I hope everyone had a great time and that everyone got to 
              know the new apps a little bit =) Once again, a great time had by 
              all (save a few of us loosing exp due to bleeding to death heh) 
              Thanks again =)<br>

              AUG 23, 2002<br>
              Trakanon's lease on Seblis expired and we went into his lair to 
              evict him. Instead of throwing him out, we decided just to slay 
              the foul beast. Drops were: Donal's BP [Bormer], Cloak [Kilwean], 
              and 4 Teeth [Physst, Silvercaster, Proetus, and Ceeni].
            <p>AUG 21, 2002<br>
              This night's raid was Hate in order to get a ranger stone. We quickly 
              cleared our way through the first level and proceeded to work on 
              the second. Drops on the second floor were very light (as always 
              - that zone really needs a better drop rate). After dozens and dozens 
              of kills, we managed to get a Darkmetal Falchion. Innoruuk seemed 
              to be aware of our presence and just before we pulled him, he ran 
              out of the building to another spot! We rescouted and then fought 
              an epic battle with the god. Overall great fight and only one death. 
              Drops were: Eye [holding], Icebelt [Denor], Pauldrons [Karrzem-guest], 
              Triumphant Mask [Machedor], Ring of Pure Blood [Awll], and a Shattered 
              Emerald [Gilthanus].</p>
            <p>AUG 20, 2002<br>
              Started the night in ToV, but another guild was already present. 
              We did the right hallway for a bit, until we decided to try Vindicator. 
              We ported other quickly and barely paused from our sprint to the 
              arena to kill the giants in our way. Then, a flawless pull and a 
              well executed fight later, we divided up Vindi's loot: Living Thunder 
              Earring [Signarius] and Head [Dunskye].</p>
            <p>Our posse then moved on to Fear to kill all the minis in the hope 
              of getting a SK epic piece. The mobs seemed to drop everything else 
              except what we were looking for including: Shield, Claws, Puppet 
              Strings, and a Trunk.<br>

              -Kael, Maiden- <br>
              Sunday night we took one group to Maiden's Eye to get some experience 
              and some loots. Not much dropped though, couple of people got some 
              upgrades, but nothing major. The pullers dropped a couple of times 
              each though. But overall wasn't too bad. </p>
            <p>Monday Night: Kael: Mission: Kill Stuff: Mission Accomplished. 
              We grouped up with LoD to take out the Tormax area in Kael. I must 
              say they were excited. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Hawk and Animal were bodyslamming and piledriving their way through 
              the giants left and right. Wait...what? Not Legion of Doom? Oh, 
              the guild Legacy of Darkness. Forget all that I just said then. 
              So anyway, we went to Tormax area with Legacy of Darkness and cleaned 
              the joint out. The couple of times we probably should have wiped 
              out we didn't just from sheer talent(luck). We spent a good portion 
              of the night there, and for the first time we were stuck waiting 
              on respawn for giants :(. Lots of drops: Grats Bworld on Plate Arms, 
              Alefia on Barbed Pauldrons, Brigug on Orb of the Infinite Void, 
              me on Chain Legs. Legacy of Darkness got the following: Plate Bracer, 
              Plate Gaunts, Coldain Gloves, Mask of War, Plate Arms, and Silk 
              Boots. Grats to all who came away with something. And to the others 
              you need to start cybering us officers better if you want some loot. 
              Nobody gets something for nothing! Anyway, here's the happy party. 
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>The OFFICIAL Juggernauts Melee Death Fest Contest continues! Updated 
              standings as of Maiden's Eye(Sunday) and Kael(Monday). </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>As of 8/27/02[Kael]: <br>
              Nikalos(Monk) - 4 Deaths <br>
              Ouden(Ranger) - 4 Deaths <br>
              Sithray(Warrior) - 3 Deaths <br>
              Klopo(Warrior) - 3 Deaths <br>
              Alefia(Paladin) - 2 Deaths <br>
              Dannie(Monk) - 1 Death </p>
            <p>Fri-08.23.02-Ouden- <br>
              -Kael Wackiness- </p>
            <p>So we didn't really have anything planned for last night, cause 
              Sithray had to go give oral, or have oral surgery or something like 
              that. But low and behold we find out that we have enough people 
              on and the Kael arena is open on a Friday night, wacky! So we head 
              in, some of us slower than others(you know who you are!). We set 
              up, and the giants just start slinging loot at us! Plate Arms x 
              2, Plate Gaunts, Plate Bracer, Chain Bracer, Silk Bracer, Silk Boots...and... 
              ::drumroll:: A Plate Breastplate and a Chain Breastplate, one right 
              after the other. Grats to lots of people, but mostly me on Chain 
              Breastplate cause I'm a big lootwhore and a glory hog too it appears. 
            </p>
            <p>It all seemed just too good to be true. Couple of people left, 
              and we kept on chugging cause the amount of drops had turned us 
              all into 12 year old kewl d00ds out for phat lewtz. Cleric low on 
              mana, fighting a mob, main tank low on life as complete heal is 
              casting, respawn right on top of us. Main tank down! Paladin down! 
              Uber Halfling Ranger roots and saves the day! But everyone isn't 
              as cool as said Halfling Ranger and dies anyway. So here we go coming 
              back for corpse recovery. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Yes, that is summoned magician armor and swords. So we try all 
              sorts of training wackiness to get the bodies out, and eventually 
              after 2 hours we get them out. And sadly enough we couldn't have 
              done it without Bururmen's summoned armor. Well we could have but 
              I'm trying to make him feel better. Thanks to the help of all the 
              other people that helped out at times. And thanks for Alefia the 
              uber training, corpse pulling, DA using Paladin. And don't forget 
              Nikalos the cussing, FD'ing, getting anally probed by giants Monk. 
            </p>
            <p>Thanks to tonight, I have declared the beginning of the OFFICIAL 
              Juggernauts Melee Death Fest Contest. It'll probably run until I 
              forget to keep track or get tired of it. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Was under 5 stupid seconds! </p>
            <p>Anyway, the standings: </p>
            <p>As of 8/23/02[Kael]: <br>
              Klopo(Warrior) - 3 Deaths <br>
              Nikalos(Monk) - 3 Deaths <br>
              Ouden(Ranger) - 2 Deaths <br>
              Alefia(Paladin) - 1 Death </p>
            <p>Thu-08.22.02-Ouden- <br>
              -Umbral Plains- </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>We hit up the Umbral Plains last night, a good time was had by 
              all(except poor Railus who couldn't DC anything). We had a few drops, 
              although I was being lazy and I didn't write them down. Klopo got 
              a new pee-wee football helmet, Dorry got something, and I got to 
              learn that you cannot pull Dark Assassins with spells. </p>
            <p>We are currently recruiting. We are looking for at least one of 
              every class, so feel free to go over our guild info and see if you'd 
              be interested. </p>
            <p>Bworld hit 60, so now he's one sexy Bard, although I think he passed 
              out from exhaustion after getting it and has been asleep ever since. 
              I hit 53, and some people have gotten AA, although I can't be bothered 
              to list Alefia. Oops. </p>
            <p>Wed-08.14.02-Ouden- <br>
              -Kael Again- </p>
            <p>We hit up Kael again last night for some more exp and armor farming. 
              Drops went a lot better than the night before. Grats Shorrtee on 
              Plate Bracer, Grats me on Silvery Belt of Contention. Also had Black/White 
              Bear Pelt Cloaks, Thunder Etched Gaunts(x2), and several other pieces 
              awarded to that loot whore MQ. </p>
            <p>More experience and Kael to follow for the rest of this week. Grats 
              Klopo on level 58, and congrats to Shorrtee on having the hardest 
              CoV faction to fix in the entire world. </p>
            <p>Tue-08.13.02-Ouden- <br>
              -General, Kael, Exp- </p>
            <p>We've mostly been exp'ing, have a few new levels. Grats me on 52, 
              Dorry on 54, Bworld on 59, Brigug on 58, and several others to ding 
              very soon. </p>
            <p>Wacked General Gay again in the past week. Last night we hit Kael(after 
              we found out Fear was camped), had a pretty good turnout but crappy 
              drops. Grats Alefia on Plate Bracer, me on Chain boots, and grats 
              MQ on silk bracer. Dannie got a sceptre. That was pretty much it. 
              Was a pretty good night for exp though. Thanks to the CC members 
              that tagged along for faction and helped us out. </p>
            <p>If you're interested in applying for Juggernauts, post on the boards 
              and talk to either Sithray or myself in-game. We are currently looking 
              for several classes to move into the next phase of shorty race domination. 
            </p>
            <p>We'll be doing more experience camping for the rest of this week, 
              and next week it's back to raiding. Expect more updates. </p>
            <p>Tue-08.05.02-Sithray- <br>
              -EXP and General Gay- </p>
            <p>Grats Ouden on Ornate Sword. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>How a Ranger goes OOM on an MR mob noone knows...healing? That 
              finishes up primary's for this sword and now we can farm him for 
              twinks. </p>
            <p>Been Exping it up quite a bit to increase our average level and 
              good to say that most of us have gained 1-2 levels in the last week. 
              Still have a bit more EXP time in Umbral, ME and Caverns. </p>
            <p>Some minor Grats to Bworld on his Axgoreth's Belt of Defense, Ouden 
              on Shrouded Medallion, Deadey on Belt of Defiance, Dorry on Stone 
              Idol. All in all been decent EXP and gear upgrades over the last 
              week and will continue through this week. </p>

              Day 158 - Cursed</p>
            <p>Killed Vyzh'dra the Cursed today with EoD, after killing the left 
              over Euro'ized Glyphed and Exiled placeholder triggers. Anyway, 
              as always the fight was a nice one, not to many glitches, not with 
              our crack team of Clerics and Mages who I don't have to say but 
              I will kept the fight from being a wash, just loosing oh I don't 
              know, maybe 4 clerics and 2 or 3 mages from that cursed fight (or 
              even replacing them with double box'd ones) would have probably 
              made that fight impossible. But well we won't worry about that. 
              Also, big congrats to the rest of the team that came out and beat 
              down Vyzh, another great team effort or at least I thought so.</p>
            <p>Anyway, image sucks, but its an image and it will have to do.</p>

              Day 157<br>
              Spent the day doing little things here and there, killing in chardok 
              to finish off a cleric epic, then killing some rogue epic mobs to 
              almsot finish that off, and thankfully some good people spent some 
              time in Ssra killing snakes getting key pieces, god bless their 
              souls. Anyway, not much happened at any rate, so I'll enlighten 
              you with news that brought near tears to my eyes yesterday. I read 
              that on test they are going to be unveiling stacking code that will 
              help and in all likelyhood solve brells and every other stupid group 
              buff spell with overwritting Warders Protection and hopefully other 
              buffs (Strength of Nature). You have no idea how happy I am, after 
              living with vindictive paladins who think its funny to overwrite 
              buffs out of spite or because they're bored, for nearly 9 months, 
              finally I'll be able to laugh in their faces as their stupid buffs 
              bounces off me! MUHAHAHA!!!!!</p>

              Day 156 - Wasting away in SkyfireVille</p>
            <p>*mini update* - Congrats to Mnayr on a successfull ragefire killing 
              this afternoon .. now I will say what I say after every rage, ok 
              so I don't say it after every rage, and probably have never said 
              it .. but &quot;No Ragefire - 1 Year!&quot;</p>
            <p>Camping ragefire is like being in the stockmarket during the depression, 
              you are constantly looking for a very large, very tall office building, 
              or cliff, to jump from. But anyway, we did it, he didn't spawn, 
              there was a GM talk of somesort, explaing that rolling is player 
              enforced, not GM enforced, so the next time some guide asks you 
              and someone else to roll, and both of you don't want to do it, tell 
              the guide that rolling isn't GM enforced. But thats beside the point 
              I guess, I don't know if the bastard even spawned last night, after 
              5 days (GG Timesinks, if farming snakes and either level 60 or very 
              green mobs for shards wasn't bad enough, verant still see's fit 
              to enforce timesinks wherever they can even in expansions 2 years 
              old). Anyway, my tribute to those lost men of the early 30's.</p>
