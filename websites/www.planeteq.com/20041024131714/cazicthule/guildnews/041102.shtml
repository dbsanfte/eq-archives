              Tunare Dead!! Oh, and some dorf too... <br>
              <br>
              Posted by: Mirax on Thursday, April 11th, 2002<br>
            </p>
            <p>Yesterday afternoon, CC/Talons made our first attempt at killing 
              that damn high elf. </p>
            <p>First, while we waited for people to get to PoG, we decided to 
              set up and make an attempt on Ail the Elder..mistake!! 50% dead, 
              most of us were, gave up on that idea! </p>
            <p>Then Tunare...she's a lot taller outside that treehouse she lives 
              in! First attempt, 75% dead...hmmm. </p>
            <p>Tried something new and what do you know? </p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Grats Makvelis on his Golden Leaf Earring, Jozz, Sylverblade, and 
              Allar on their Braids of Golden Hair and Tigerstorm on a Shaman 
              BP and Talliesin on a Wizard Robe. Oh, and a terrific job by Mildaan 
              on his wonderful kiting technique!! </p>
            <p>A bit anticlimatic yeah, but after that we went and killed Dain. 
              Grats The Fely on the Dain head, Karri on the Frostreaver's Velium 
              Crown, Nollian on the Ring of Winter and Sabvlik on the Frostreaver's 
              Embroidered Cloak.<br>

              Creator Dead, Take Two! <br>
              <br>
              Posted by: Mirax on Wednesday, April 10th, 2002<br>
            </p>
            <p>Okay, so Tuesday was patch day...what to kill? what to kill? How 
              about the Creator again, did him once... </p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Almost a flawless defeat, Creator dead before the room spawned. 
              Only death was a little gnome wizzie that decided he needed to melee 
              when he went LD...bad idea Lrogg!! </p>
            <p>To the basement and the Glyphed and the Exiled guy. Bad mass LD 
              almost caused us to lose the cycle, but we rallied and got the Glyphed 
              down, Exiled was a piece of cake. </p>
            <p>Grats to Kajawana on the Headband and Fayda on the Dagger from 
              the Creator, Talons on the Cord and Staff and CC on the Skull from 
              the Glyphed, and Talons on the Geo Focus and Soontace on the Memory 
              from the Exiled.<br>
              <br>
              Creator Dead...FINALLY!!! <br>

            </p>
            <p>It took us several tries, but we finally got the big ugly snake 
              dead last night. Looks like Rasten didn't believe it and was trying 
              to give him a rez... </p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Grats Whopper on the Bonechiller and Dannie on the Monk Headband. 
            </p>
            <p>It was a very well fought battle, grats to everyone on finally 
              slaying this beast.<p>

            <p>CC and Talons took down Rhags 1 and 2 last night. Grats Sabbat 
              and Nalfien on their focus crystals, and everyone that got some 
              much needed spells.<br>

              Tormax, Yeli, and CC's First Ring War <br>
              <br>
              Posted by: Mirax on Wednesday, April 3rd, 2002<br>
            </p>
            <p>Monday was a busy day for us. First, Tormax respawned and he had 
              to die. Then, our good friend Yelinak spawned and we wasted him 
              too. Grats Abominis on her ST key, Avar on the head for his new 
              gloves and Nurilbus and Grakus on their pretty new robes. </p>
            <p>Then CC went on to do our first ring war, with the help of some 
              Talons. First, Druss met his new best friend: </p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>The dorfies all formed up, ready to defend Thurgadin against the 
              giants: </p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>The battle raged on, but finally, the giants were dead, Thurgadin 
              was secure, and Druss had a brand new ring! </p>

              Death to the White Dragon Lady <br>
              Posted by Grisnalg On Apr 10 2002<br>
              It was a cold, windy night in the land known as the Dreadlands. 
              Snow swirled all about obscuring the vision and playing tricks on 
              the mind. In the distance the defiant roars of the Elder White Dragon 
              could be heard. Across the land in a voice laced with rage Gorenaire, 
              the Dread White Lady, cursed those foolish enough to tempt her wrath.
            <p> </p>
            <p>Bravely the intrepid adventurers of Project Eon and Council of 
              Grey marshelled thier forces under the cover of a nearby forest. 
              Under the direction of the Mighty and Fell Wizard Redracer the eager 
              blades and spells of the adventurers raced forward to slay the Lady 
              Gorenaire. Countering with her own magical art the Dread White sent 
              many of her would be slayers running in fear. Alas for Gorenaire 
              there were too many, too strong for her to escape. With blade, axe, 
              spear and rending spell did the adventurers wound the dragon till 
              she fell limply to the earth.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>In the end the haunting beauty of such a dread creature could not 
              be marred by the many terrible wounds she had taken. Honor was paid 
              to such a noble beast by those who had slain the Lady Gorenaire. 
              A worthy opponent was heard to issue from many lips. Within her 
              carcass, secreted in a hidden place, were many treasures that were 
              shared by the victorious.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Congratulations to PE on Sunstrike, Battleskar &amp; Clawhammer 
              on Voice of the Berserker, Mancinia on McVaxius Horn of War, and 
              a White Dragon Scale, Legacy of Thorn for the CoG bank. Hail to

            <p>Gratz to me(Grasnalg) and Grusnalg on the epic pieces. Also gratz 
              to Bromm on his new Bloodfire and Varrak on those uber puppet strings(10 
              charges of allure). </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Along with the drops off the boss mobs we had a handful of drops 
              off the regular mobs, but unfortunately, I don't think much of it 
              was needed. At any rate, nice turn out for an impromptu raid. We 
              had 50+ there for most the raid and it made things seem almost too 
              easy. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Gratz also to PE on a 40ac shield that dropped off of Dracoliche 
              and thanks to Redracer for running the show while we were there.<br>

              Hot time in the old town tonight. <br>

              The council moved through the Halls of Testing tonight, with great 
              success. We had a somewhat rusty enchanter, but he seemed to manage. 
              Drops were fast and furious, so forgive me if I leave one or two 
              out. Chain sleeves went to Picket, chain gauntlets to Muldur, silk 
              ROBE to Doleb, silk sleeves to Mayu, plate helm to Naezariit, plate 
              bracers to Bahgoon and Thooven. There were a couple of leather drops 
              as well, my apologies for not remembering which pieces specifically, 
              with one of those drops going to Liinc. Great work all, we were 
              killing them very efficiently, and not even slowing down when there 
              were adds.</p>

              Spent most of the evening in Kael mainly for faction and ended up 
              with a bunch of loot... Grats to blasko on chain helm, gisele on 
              plate BP (!!!), nikolette on leather legs, allegory on chain legs,

              the shield and grats to project eon on the map piece - thanks for 
              helping us. We also got arch lich, death peace, and ice spear of

              20hp effect: turtle skin) and club of the ice ocean (14/27 3str

              Hate raid today to get some resist gear gems and take down as many 
              epic mobs as possible. Non-stop killing, and very quick pace. Most 
              of the first floor was cleared within an hour, and by the second 
              hour, pickings were rather slim. Still, managed to come away with 
              a nice number of gems and a few epic pieces.</p>
            <p>APR 03, 2002<br>
              Raid on Chardok royals. Killed prince, king, and queen with very 
              few losses. Grats to Lumper for warrior epic item. We are very close 
              to our first warrior epic.</p>

              on some nice plate arms. Earlier in the week we teamed up in Umbral

              Ups and downs - Merauk (4/11/2002) <br>
              <br>
              Really started off TOV tonight bad (I mean bad). Two shitty attempts 
              on Roy. Third attempt was flawless so felt good about that (though 
              with 2 dead guards on attempt #3 not really that big of an accomplishment). 
              Pulled a nice flurry train after that then let a mob gate. But after 
              all that went through and killed Fesh, Dagarn, Koi, Kriezzen all 
              flawlessly. Lost a couple of people on Mirn because we sucked so 
              bad earlier tonight a flurry spawned right on top of her half way 
              through fight.</p>
            <p>Grats to CC/Talon's on their first Tunare killing tonight.<br>
              <br>
              What is it like to be marked for death? - Merauk (4/9/2002) <br>
              <br>
              Killer attempt at AOW tonight, first tank goes full disc to get 
              him to 50%. Fantastic job of positioning by Browny, even though 
              The Rauk was in wrong spot and almost killed everyone :-(. Bodmerian 
              scores points again for uber slow on Idol as shamans were having 
              bitch of a time getting it on. Great team effort. We transition 
              flawlessly and go another 60 seconds, hit a lag burp and it turns 
              to shit. </p>
            <p>No big deal log, in, rez up and get this</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Now as anyone can tell you chat channels are pretty lagged and 
              thus not really of use for a heal rotation on AOW. So we sort of 
              were scrambling to come up with a way to do heal rotation (mind 
              you we have used /ooc now for 16 months) and just generally wasting 
              time AOW despawned on us.</p>
            <p>While I could fault Tilol for this he was following the rules as 
              written (which actually I found on EQ site in regards to use of 
              /ooc). I could bitch about the rules being unfair, but not a lot 
              I can do about that. I can fault the two people and the guild that 
              I am reasonably sure that petitioned. Considering two people bitched 
              about out use of /ooc and shortly thereafter Tilol issued the message, 
              I am confident that one of these two or their guild petitioned. 
            </p>
            <p>Just a little note for the sorry bastards in that guild (and the 
              two names I saw in /ooc bitching) revenge is a bitch. Rest assured 
              that your life will be miserable to the point where you will quit 
              EQ. You can all draw your own conclusions what forms the misery 
              will take. If you think a little /ooc was annoying you ain't seen 
              nothing yet. <br>
              <br>
              Well... - Zippo (4/9/2002) <br>
              <br>
              AOW didnt go down tonight, but we did find out using OOC to heal 
              is an offense, punishable by disbanding your guild! Thanks Tilol 
              for clearing this up for us guess we should use your Laggy ass chat 
              rooms!<br>
              <br>
              Whole lot of JK2 and Dungeon Siege - Merauk (4/8/2002) <br>
              <br>
              About the only thing that could make people log in from these crack 
              laden games was a quick TOV jaunt prior to the patch.</p>
            <p>Probably the worst killing of Roy in recent history, but wtf he 
              died so not going to belabor the point.</p>
            <p>I will say this though. Some people log in for ph4t l00ts, others 
              log in to play. Casters OOM can't get the slow back on, Bodmerian 
              steps up and slaps bard slow on the mofacka. Nice to see still a 
              few people around who get out of the box and make shit happen. Big 
              hearty salute from The Rauk to you.<br>
              <br>
              The bitch goes down. - Zippo (4/5/2002) <br>
              <br>
              Well atleast we got her dead first shot tonight, too bad she had 
              the shittiest loot ever, 2 monk weapons, 1 braid, and 1 belt. Woulda 
              killed SoL mobs if we wanted monq loot. =(<br>

              Day 2 of HoT and the drops continued to flow. Best day there yet. 
              Was able to stay up front but still got lots killed. Zero wipeouts. 
              Drops were as follows...
            <p>Chain BP - Niklas <br>
              Chain Boots - Trinady <br>
              Silk arms - Edawen<br>
              Silk robe/hats/boots - Isthan<br>
              Plate legs/bracer/boots - Gorewyn/McDizzor<br>
              Plate arms - Hawkmen.</p>
            <p>We will be back soon! <br>
              <br>
              April 7, 2002<br>
              Day 1 of our 2-day HoT raid yielded some great results. Got off 
              to a slow start due to another raid being there and some mutual 
              toe stepping. But we finally got humming and moved deeper in and 
              things went much more smoothly. Had the following drops...</p>
            <p>Plate helm - McDizzor<br>
              Plate arms - Ishkaron <br>
              Plate gaunts - Liath<br>
              Chain gaunts - Mistyrain</p>
            <p>Seems like a lot of chain and plate lately. I'm sure the leather 
              and silk will start flowing soon. <br>

              for another chance to take down a few epic mobs. Our objective will 
              be to log out on the Pegasus Isle on Friday night after clearing 
              all of the 
              previous islands. We'll log back in on Saturday refreshed and ready 
              to push forward. We've always run out of time on our previous journeys 
              in Sky. Making this a two-day event should give us the opportunity 
              to 
              progress further than we have before. The port up will be promptly 
              at 9pm EST. Please be in WC at the wizzie spires ready for port 
              up. Congratulations to our loyal and dedicated raid leader, Enyon 
              on his new job OOC. Even tho it takes you away from us more, we 
              are still happy for you bro! Hurry up and get settled in so you 
              can get back to the important things! EQ and HZ! We love you bro, 
              and miss you bunches! Get well soon Iillawen!

              blue floaty notes at a raid near<br>
              you. :) Kelorek Dar felt like trying his hand at poker, so we sent

              Cazic Thule mortified <br>
              Well, we got summoned to Fear but our master, first it seemed that 
              noone wanted to join the beating of Cazic. Those clearings are allways 
              so boring, a complete waste of 3 to 4 hours clearing fear of citizens. 
              Yesterday was different thou. Anavon assigned 3 ghetto ninja ae 
              pullers, and they did good indeed. Counted up to 5 pullers working 
              together luring mobs to the +6 Wizards present there....Wraaaaaaam 
              boom bom. Sit thigh folks, we cleared fear in roughly 1 hour 15 
              minutes. Cazic dropped with ease too, seems this fight is getting 
              trivial allready ( Grats goes to.... Infestalia on Halo of the Enlightened 
              (ANA) Iluvatar on Brain of CT (ANA) Melk on Pauldrons of Ferocity

            <p> Trakanonins Freeportius <br>
              Best planned Zerg run ever. From zonein and buffing to a dead Trakanon 
              53 minutes. Beat the old record a 55 mins. 2 deaths total this time 
              what a rocking tour. He coughed up some 5 teeth, clr bp and some 
              other bp. Fried some froglegs too, and the good Tola gave a robe 
              and group complete heal spell. Massive job all, that was a blast.....weehh...... 
              Grats to Banno on Sinew, now go quest that stuff before we waste 
              Chardok. <br>

              Rumblecrush <br>
              Killed Rumblecrush yet again. Allmost have the tactic down to a 
              flawless on him now, but rampage seems to chew a few troopers still. 
              Anyway grats to Infy on kickass earring and Ragbert on new gloves. 
              Still it puzzles me that a mediocre mob like this carries so good 
              drops, but oh well, let the farming continue. <br>

              Some good days, some not so good days <br>
              Posted By: Krak Kyllz on 10 April 2002</p>
            <p>Last night sucked. Sucked sucked bad. Sucked on the raid level 
              and on a personal note. While getting ready to pull the AOW I was 
              attacked and slain by the surname nerf mob. Plz no more tells to 
              GM-Tilol about the issue. &lt;3 to all the people who cared enough 
              to take it upon them-selves to complain.</p>
            <p>We had a really good first attempt at the AOW, but again a bit 
              of lag and everything turns to shit and a lot of people die. Nothing 
              new here, happens all the time, we were in Kael after all.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Seems using ooc and shout for raid communication wasn't an acceptable 
              practice. So we started getting ready for a second try and scrambled 
              for some way to communicate other than the ass new chat channels 
              which were giving up to 5 seconds of lag on messages. Suddenly the 
              mother of all lag spikes hits and almost everyone goes LD. Some 
              couldn't get back in for almost an hour. The AOW poofed, people 
              cried, lots went to bed sad with no phat loots to show for their 
              trouble.</p>
            <p>But we are Relentless and will be back another day.</p>
