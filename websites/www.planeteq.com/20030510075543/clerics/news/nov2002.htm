<b>Planes of Power is now Live</b>
<p>
Welcome to the Planes of Power. Of course, if you haven't purchased the expansion you can do so at our online store at www.everquest.com. If you have, prepare for adventure beyond Norrath and into the realm of the gods. We hope you have fun.
<p>
One of the new features included in the Planes of Power is a new way for NPCs deal with Player Characters. It allows NPCs to recognize certain actions taken by player characters. This may mean that an NPC will not be interested in talking to you until you've accomplished a certain task or until certain events have occurred. So some NPCs may not have much to say to you upon your first meeting, but might be more talkative later. This can also apply to events and locations that might react differently to a character that has accomplished a task than to one that has not.
<p>
<b>Important Notice about unspent Alternate Advancement points</b>
<p>
With this patch any character with more than 30 unspent AA points will have those points deleted when they log in.
<p>
<b>Patch Information</b>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Reduced the maximum NPC level that Harmony can affect
<li>Fixed a bug with the bard epic effect and singing stacking
</ul>
<p>
<b>Raids</b>
<p>
The Raid functionality has been added. Here is a brief overview of the Raid system.
<p>
In the past, experience on raids would generally go to a single group or a few groups. The group doing the most damage would get the experience on any given kill. But, that has been changed by a new Raid feature.
<p>
The Raid system is intended to aid in the formation and organizing raids and make looting on raids a little more manageable. It allows a certain amount of experience to be shared among all members of a raid. The basics of the system work very much like grouping has always worked. The Raid Leader is the leader of all the raid groups and the group leaders remain leaders of their individual groups.
<p>
Alt-R or /raidwindow will toggle the new Raid Window. This window works much like the group window. You can invite people to the raid (if you are the raid leader) and see a list of the folks in your raid, along with the status of those members (Raid Leader, Group Leader or raid member - which shows with no rank). It also shows you the group number of the individual members.
<p>
Only Raid Leaders and Raid Group Leaders can invite people to a raid. This is done with the Invite button on the raid window.
<p>
If a Raid Leader invites an individual (someone not in a group), that person joins the raid as a Raid Group Leader. If the Raid Leader invites a member of a group, the entire group joins the raid, and their group leader becomes a Raid Group Leader.
<p>
A Raid Group Leader can invite people to their group, thus inviting them to join the raid group as well.
<p>
Only a Raid Leader can remove someone from the raid. He or she does so simply by clicking on the character's name in the raid window and clicking the Disband button (also in the raid window).
<p>
Being removed from your group (using the normal grouping features) will not remove you from the raid.
<p>
You can remove yourself from the raid just by clicking the Disband button in the raid window.
<p>
Just like groups, raids have their own chat channel. /rsay works for the raid just as /gsay does for groups. Just like group chat, you can set this to be your default channel for a given chat window by choosing it from the right-click Default Channel context menu.
<p>
Experience for killing NPCs will be distributed to all members of the raid that are within range. However, the experience given will be smaller than the experience that would be earned by a single group. Generally, unless you are fighting NPCs that require a raid, you will still be better off earning experience with the old fashioned six-person group.
<p>
Raids will definitely allow for larger than traditional groups, however, much of EverQuest is designed with the six-person group in mind. Adding a small number of people to a given group will allow this "oversized" group to gain experience. However, we recommend that once a "raid" of ten or more people forms, a second, traditional group split off and adventure on their own.
<p>
The Raid Leader determines the looting permissions for any NPC killed by the raid. There are three types of looting that the leader can choose from (though the Raid Leader can always loot NPCs killed by the raid).
<ol type="1">
<li> Only the raid leader can loot until the corpse opens up for all

<li> Only the raid leader and raid group leaders can loot until the corpse opens up

<li> Raid leader chooses up to 9 other raid members that can loot until the corpse opens up
</ol>
<p>
Please note that altering loot permissions only applies to NPCs that are killed after changing this setting. See the command list below for more information about setting raid loot permissions.
<p>
When an item is looted by a raid member, a loot message is sent to all members of the raid.
<p>
<b>Summary of Raid Commands: </b>
<p>
<ul type="disc">
<li> /raidwindow - toggles the raid window

<li> /makeraidleader [name]- reassigns raid leadership - Optional argument, name of raid member to be new leader, or you can just target them. If you type a person's name, that name is used instead of your current raid window target.

<li> /raidinvite - invites the current target to the raid

<li> /raidaccept - accepts an invitation to a raid

<li> /raiddecline - declines an invitation to a raid.

<li> /raidremove - removed the current raid target from the raid

<li> /setloottype # - sets the raid loot type - Takes one number argument: 1, 2, 3.

<li> /addraidlooter - adds a raid member as an early looter to all future corpses - Target a raid member in raid window.

<li> /removeraidlooter - removes a raid member as a possible looter from all future corpses - Target a raid member in raid window.

<li> /rsay - Sends a message to all members of the raid

<p>
<b>Odd New Objects in the Land</b>
<p>
Folks across Norrath and on Luclin have reported seeing odd new objects in various locations. They appear to be some sort of magical portal, though local spell casters have yet to discover how they arrived or exactly what their purpose is. They have determined, however, that these objects are slowly building in power. Attempting to use these portals at this time can have unexpected results. Experts recommend that adventurers avoid these objects until they know more. For more information on these odd devices, visit <a href="http://www.planesofpower.com">www.planesofpower.com</a>
<p>
<b>Important Notice Regarding Alternate Advancement Reimbursement</b>
<p>
Due to the changes made to Manaburn, Rods of Mystical Transvergence and a previous change to Innate Regeneration, we are reimbursing several Alternate Advancement (AA) abilities.
<p>
Once you log in today, if you have any of these abilities, please check your AA window immediately! If you have more than 30 unspent points, IT IS VERY IMPORTANT that you make certain that your character has 30 or fewer AA points before The Planes of Power launches on October 21st! The return of these AA points may put your total number of unspent points over the 30 point maximum. Your pool will be reduced to 30 the first time you log in after the launch of Planes of Power on October 21st.
<p>
We will be refunding all Alternate Advancement points in the following abilities: <br>
Innate Regeneration<br>
Manaburn<br>
Mental Clarity<br>
Quick Summoning <br>
Refunded Alternate Advancement points may be spent in any way you choose. None of these abilities is being removed, and of them only Manaburn is changing.<br>
<i>NOTE:</i> Cannibalization, Gather Mana, and Mind and Body Rejuvenation will not function if you do not have the necessary prerequisite, Mental Clarity 3.
<p>
<b>Alternate Advancement</b>
<ul type="circle">
<li> Mana Burn will only land any given target only once every minute. If a cast of Mana Burn is unable to land, the timer will not be used.
<li> Spell Casting Mastery once again works in the same manner that it did before the previous patch
<li> Spell Casting Fury and Soul Abrasion will now stack
<li> Illusion Tree and Minor Illusion will no longer be affected by Permanent Illusion
<li> Fixed Purify Soul. It should now cure poison, disease, damage over time spells as initially intended
<li> Reduced the reuse timer on Divine Resurrection from 72 hours to 36 hours
<li> Reduced the reuse timer on Mend Companion from 144 minutes to 36 minutes
<li> Reduced the reuse timer of Warcry from 72 minutes to 36 minutes. Increased its duration from 5 seconds per rank of the ability to 10 seconds per rank of the ability
</ul>
<p>
<b>Defensive Changes</b>
<ul type="circle">
<li> Decreased Monks' ability to mitigate damage (please see the Developer's Update on  <a href="http://www.everquestlive.com">www.everquestlive.com</a> for more details)
<li> Improved the ability of Paladins, Shadowknights, Warriors and Bards to mitigate damage in some situations
<li> Upgraded Warrior dodge cap to 190
<li> Upgraded Paladin, Shadowknight and Bard dodge cap to 170
<li> Upgraded Ranger and Beastlord dodge to 170 and defense to 240
</ul>
<p>
<b>Spells</b>
<ul type="circle">
<li> Complete Healing will now heal a maximum of 7,500 hit points
<li> The Rod of Mystical Transvergence spell has been altered. The spell has been renamed to "Mass Mystical Transvergence". When cast, this spell summons a Rod of Mystical Transvergence for everyone within 300 feet. This rod is no drop and contains 3 charges of Mystical Transvergence. Each charge restores 360 mana at the cost of 450 health. A player may only use a charge from the rod once every 5 minutes.
<li> Additionally, there is a new "Rod of Mystical Transvergence" spell for sale in the Bazaar. This is a single target spell that summons a rod with 3 charges of Mystical Transvergence. This rod has the same abilities and restrictions listed above. This spell is a targeted summon that costs 400 points of mana to cast.
<li> Changed the way Focus stacks with other strength and dexterity buffs
<li> Circle of Seasons will overwrite Resist Cold
<li> Dance of the Blade should now stack with McVaxius's Rousing Rondo
<li> Harness of Spirit and Rage should now stack properly
<li> Fufil's Curtailing Chant should now stack with Occlusion of Sound
<li> Protection of the Glades should now overwrite Blessed Armor of the Risen
<li> Blessed Armor of the Risen should now stack with Lunar Whispers
<li> Fixed a bug that was causing some applications of spells and ranged attacks from great distance to go unnoticed by NPCs
<li> Contact Innates (such as Boon of the Garou) should now be working for bards
<li> Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause helmets and sometimes hair to disappear after an illusion was cast
<li> Bard songs should now blink on recipients other than the bard
</ul>
<b>Encounters</b>
<p>
Due to the number of Luclin encounters requiring original Rods of Transvergence to be defeated by a reasonably sized force, a number of those encounters have been be re-tuned to shorten their duration.
<p>
<b>Interface</b>
<ul type="circle">
<li> New Alarm feature added. When you first log in you will see a pop up asking if you wish to set an alarm and if so for how long. There is also an option to choose to never see that pop up again. If you choose this option you will need to set ShowAlarmWindow=TRUE in your eqclient.ini file in order to see the pop up again. The alarm will trigger after the time you set has elapsed, no matter what character you are playing on whatever server, up until the moment you log out.
<li> /played now displays how long you have been playing this session and, if an alarm has been set, how long until that alarm sounds.
<li> /pet sit down should now work on charmed NPCs
<li> Added 3 new context menu options for chat windows: Reply To, Tell a friend, Tell a Raidmember (for future use). Each of which has a submenu containing the list of Reply targets, Friends, or Raidmembers, as appropriate. Clicking on the player's name will place "/tell <name>" on the chat entry line, and move the focus there, closing the menu.
<li> Changed /loadskin. It now brings up a window that will allow you to select a skin from a list, determine whether to use the INI or not, then load the skin.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Beastlords</b>
<p>
In order to allow us to better tune warders, we have made changes to the way that these pets work. Previously a Beastlord would summon a pet using an ability button and then use level-appropriate buff spells to increase the pet's level. Because of the way this mechanic works, it was very difficult to tune these pets. Hopefully this will have the side benefit of making things a little easier on Beastlords by reducing the number of steps required to cast the pet.
<p>
Beastlords will now summon their pets using spells rather than an ability. The series of spells that was previously used to buff the pets will now simply summon the appropriate pet.
<p>
Unfortunately, these pets will no longer zone with the Beastlord, and will need to be resummoned (instead of rebuffed) after zoning.
<p>
We have made some adjustments to these pets already.
<ul type="circle">
<li> Added the casting time reduction that is already in place for Paladins, Rangers and Shadowknights to Beastlords
</ul>
<p>
<b>Items</b>
<ul type="circle">
<li> Merchants now highly value the Staff of Forbidden Rites and will only sell them at an extremely high price.
<li> Dance of the Blade should once again stack with Nature's Melody and Song of the Deep Seas
</ul>
<p>
<b>Trade Skills</b>
<ul type="circle">
<li> Made it slightly easier to get skill increases while doing Tailoring, Tinkering, Smithing, Baking, Brewing and Alchemy. Made it slightly more difficult to get skill increases with Pottery and Fletching
</ul>
<p>
<b>Miscellaneous</b>
<ul type="circle">
<li>Fixed an issue that was causing zones to crash in some circumstances
<li> Fixed an issue that was causing merchants to behave erratically while handling certain quantities of items
<li> Player Character corpses with no items will decay in 3 real life hours, not 7 days
<li> Fixed a bug that was causing Lay Hands to not heal enough damage
<li> Zoning while on a horse on a boat will no longer cause you to appear on the other side in the water
<li> /face (face picker) will no longer work while under the effects of an illusion
<li> Taunt should be more effective and more dependent on the level of the Taunt skill for PC's and NPC's below level 60.
<li> Levitation can no longer be cast on Traders in the Bazaar
</ul>

				Source: EQ Live Website.
				<p>
				Just like everyone else, we're people. People make mistakes.
				<p>
				Some mistakes aren't that unbalancing and are safe to keep in the game and work around. Others can sometimes yield gameplay that turns out to 									be even more fun than developers even imagined, as ingenious adventurers discover unrealized potential in their abilities.  Yet others, even the best-intentioned ones, can cause an entire style of gameplay to shift dramatically in a direction that no one particularly enjoys.
<p>
Unfortunately, today, we need to address a number of the latter kind.  For that, we sincerely apologize. It is absolutely our fault that certain abilities have been allowed to grow out of control.
<p>
In our last letter, we stated that our goal for large scale battles in EverQuest was never one of endurance contests. We'd prefer to actively return to the type of battles that everyone feels are more fun - Battles that require tactics and skill, as opposed to attendance and endurance.
<p>
Due to some specific abilities as they exist today in EverQuest, this unfortunately isn't possible. The mathematics simply cannot be made to work. In extreme cases such as that, the abilities themselves must be altered.
<p>
It isn't possible, for example, to ever make another fast-action, do-or-die-quickly style encounter as long as Manaburn exists in its current form, unless it is targeted solely at an entire group of people who have this ability, as it will otherwise be trivial to those who do.
<p>
Likewise, it isn't possible to create encounters that must be completed in a certain amount of time due to mana consumption, when Rods of Mystical Transvergence provide an essentially unlimited source of mana. Every challenging encounter must also be challenging for the massive raid of people who have infinite mana, and the encounter then becomes undoable to those who do not have the infinite supply.
<p>
Hypothetically, the only alternative to changing abilities such as these would be to inflate every other class up to the same tier of relative power (be it damaging power, or mana regenerative power), then inflate the rest of the world to compensate for the sudden rash of new found power. Drastic, world-wide changes of that sort, however, are a guaranteed way to do more harm than good.
<p>
The time has come to address these abilities. Fortunately, after doing so, EverQuest as a whole, and the encounters in Planes of Power, will be able to be tuned for forces who are interested in active participation in the game, as opposed to those forced to sit through yet another 45 minute encounter with a single NPC, as became the norm in Luclin.
<p>
<b>Manaburn.</b>
<p>
In addition to the problem described above, this ability was never intended to be a way for small bands of high level players to hold hostage the advancement of larger numbers of more appropriately leveled people. While this was not the universal case, it has unfortunately happened enough across most servers to where it became a large concern in recent months.  The concept of someone looking to complete their epic quest via teamwork and overcoming the odds, only to have their attempts obstructed, in some cases, by small teams of players looking to profit financially from their power, quite frankly, is not a behavior that we wish the game to reinforce.
<p>
<b>In the next patch, Wizards who have purchased Manaburn will find that their ability points have been refunded. Please make sure that you have fewer than 25 pooled Ability points.</b>
<p>
At that point, they will be able to purchase a new Manaburn if they choose, which has most of the power of the old one. However, the new Manaburn leaves a temporary effect on its target when used that does not stack with other Manaburns.  The delay that we will be tuning on the Test Server soon will allow a single target to be manaburned no more frequently than once every minute.
<p>
Hopefully, this will bring the ability back in line with the original intent -- A powerful ability that allows a Wizard to do massive short-term damage, but not a method for a group of wizards to destroy powerful creatures with zero risk.
<p>
<b>Rods of Mystical Transvergence. </b>
<p>
The description above shows how this spell has perhaps singlehandedly altered the balance of the end-game encounter by turning it into an event where the largest challenge is setting up a timed rotation of Complete Healing.  Once that is established, in many cases, the event is just as playable by leaving AutoAttack on, and wandering away to watch television. This does not make for stellar interactive content.
<p>
We view Magicians as an excellent source of damage, especially with the many pet enhancements that have been made over the past year. To be honest, it is a more than a small shame that their full energies have been viewed as "needed" to be spent, full-time, purely on transferring their mana to others. Magicians are supposed to be the masters of elemental conjuration and highly respected as a damage-dealer, not the masters of mana transferrence.
<p>
<b>In the next update, Rods of Mystical Transvergence will be changed so that the spell summons an item that is still a valuable upgrade over the original Modulation Rod, yet does not provide an infinite amount of mana.  The idea of sudden mana gain spells is only balanced if there is a net loss over time to counteract the rapid infusion.  The initial version of the spell that we will be testing summons a Rod containing a single charge of 360 mana for 450 hit points, and can only be used by a person once each minute.</b>
<p>
In addition, the Rods themselves will be non-droppable, and spell will turn into a "target based summon," such that the Magician summons them directly onto the recipient, as opposed to having to hand them out manually or create a stockpile on the ground.
<p>
Since there are definitely encounters in the game where this type of mana regeneration is mandatory for the encounter to be beaten by a reasonably sized force, a number of those encounters will likewise be re-tuned to shorten their duration, most frequently by lowering the hit points on the NPC in question.
<p>
Again, our intent here is provide Magicians with a desirable secondary ability that would ideally be used before a battle, not an ability which essentially compels them to suddenly transform into a full-time support role, transferring their mana to others, as opposed to dealing damage.
<p>
<b>Complete Healing.</b>
<p>
The concept of any class getting their single best, most efficient primary ability at level 39, has never sat well with most people. In the days of characters having a maximum of 2000-4000 hit points, the spell was absolutely not imbalancing. However, as time went on and characters progressed, now doubling that amount of hit points, it becomes obvious that the spell must be scaled back slightly.
<p>
<b>This spell has, over time, become the defining cornerstone of the Cleric class. As such, it cannot be altered significantly. Taking that into account, and given that those with the most hit points in EverQuest have yet to hit the full 10,000 HP cap of this spell, the spell will remain nearly as useful as it is today, by being reclassified as a spell that heals for 7,500 hit points, down from its current cap of 10,000.</b>
<p>
This will allow it to continue to be used as it has been in the past, while allowing for more dynamic types of heals to be introduced in the future. Making this change will allow us to providing more entertaining high-end encounters that require more active involvement than setting up a Complete Healing "Rotation" or "Chain," then repeating the same motions until the Large Thing you are facing, eventually falls down.
<p>
<b>Monk Defense.  </b>
<p>
Finally, the issue of defensive ability needs to be addressed with respect to Monks.  Monks in EverQuest were originally intended to be a class with excellent offensive potential, both with and without equipment.  This ability came at the expense of having only passable defensive abilities, partially in the form of an extremely small, restrictive selection of equipment from which to choose.
<p>
This, of course, caused its own series of problems of how to adequately reward the person behind the character.  It did not take long for universally equippable items (ALL/ALL items) to be considered by and large as "Monk Loot," as far back as before the launch of Kunark.
<p>
Over time, Monks' defensive abilities had been tuned up to correct a perceived weakness.  This, taken in combination with a few years of universally equippable, low-weight, high powered items entering the game, slowly transformed Monks into what is arguably the strongest defensive class in the game.  Monks get hit less than any other class, and due to the tuning over time, no longer take appreciably more damage when they do get hit.
<p>
This imbalance between the classes does need to be addressed in order for the Plate-wearing classes in the game to have their proper relative power.  The Plate-wearing classes in the game take a serious penalty to their offensive abilities in order to defend as well as they can, and we cannot fix this problem solely by inflating their defensive abilities to compensate for this.  Again, that type of change would harm EverQuest as a whole much more than altering the one class.  Likewise, we have no desire to retroactively alter all of the equipment in the game that is contributing to this problem.
<p>
<b> Monk defense will be altered somewhat.  It is no secret that in EverQuest, a character's Armor Class does not compare equally across different classes.  (A Wizard with 1000 AC defends differently than a Warrior with 1000AC, for example.)  It's not the most optimal system, for sure, but it is the one that many people have had much time to get used to.  As such, Monk defense will be altered such that they may continue wearing the same equipment, however, they will get a decreased benefit to their overall ability to take damage.</b>
<p>
Again, we have no desire to make monks unable to take any type of punishment -- far from it.  What we are primarily striving for is maintaining the defensive order of the Plate classes being able to take the most punishment, followed by the Chain classes and Monks.  The latter being technically a Leather wearing class who will continue to make up the difference by being able to avoid more blows than the rest.
<p>
In closing, we would like to again apologize for the amount of time that we've allowed these abilites to remain in their current state. With Planes of Power on the horizon, in order to make encounters that most people would consider "fun," these abilities and class attributes need to be brought back into line as sane upgrades and logical progressions, as opposed to their current manifestations.
<p>
We appreciate the many well thought-out letters that have been sent in on these topics and more.  As always, we thank you for playing EverQuest and look forward to seeing you soon in the Planes of Power.
