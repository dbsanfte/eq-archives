Avatar of War takes a dive                        <p>The CoG/Vlos death squad moved into Kael last night and put the
              smack down on the AoW. Vlos came away with the goodies as it was
              their turn to pick first on the god loot and they were lucky on
              their rolls on Vindi and the Statue. Gratz to Vlos on their 2 ST
              keys, Flayed Barbarian Skin Legs, and that sweet Bard Mask.</p>
            <p>To our own...</p>
            <p>Congratulations to Athen on your new Breastplate of the Vindicator.</p>
            <p>Congratulations to Sterling on your new Breastplate of Eradication.</p>
            <p>Congratulations to Slammak on your new Helm of Rallos Zek.</p>
            <p>Some nice caster scrolls dropped as well but, sadly, I don't know
              who got them. Congratulations whoever you are. Very sweet range

            Ingredients needed:
            <p>1-Itraer Vius 1-Grieg Venificus 1-Servitor of Luclin 1-Va Dyn
              and a splash of other named mobs. Now gently mix on about 30 of
              your favorite CrimsonTalonEliteFightingSquad and stir gently. Once
              evenly mixed pour evenly onto a cookie sheet and bake for about
              2 hours. Results should look something like this:</p>

              Submitted by Fairsong on 11/24/03... Congrats go out to Gaarbage
              on finishing up his BL Epic Claws. He wants to say thank you to
              everyone who came out time and again to give him some assistance.
              This was our first Beastie Epic as a guild, great job guys. Grats
            again Gaarbage on your Epic. </p>
            <p><img src="GAARBAGEEPIC.jpg" width="500" height="375"></p>
            <p>Raided Hate(again), PoS, Akehava Ruins(scored some shards) and
              the Torigen Mines. </p>
            <p>Torigen Mines was an excellent fight that threw some unique situations
              at us. Grats to Seudian on his new bracer, however I to say that
              one of the loot drops wouldnt be used by a level 20 and it was
            no drop. Great job Soe.</p>
            <p><img src="seudian.jpg" width="500" height="375"></p>            <p>Also wanted to note the new colors we are adopting as a guild
              along with the mount of choice.<br>

              Submitted by Fairsong on 11/17/03... Want to take a moment and
                wish all those people who left our guild recently safe hunting
                and a fond goodbye. Feel free to stop by and say Hi or at least
                send a tell once in a while. Congrats to Gaarbage on chipping
                away at his epic and as of this writing is just one mob away
                from completion. The Plane of Hate has been home for many of
                us lately. Did a quick group in HoH with 2 good friends, Shaylah
                and Mortalist and we managed to score 2 of those nifty belts,
                one for MOrtalist and one for Andorean. Also wanted to say Grats
                to the enchanter in Draconis Ascendant, seems he needed a bit
                of help taking care of one of his mobs. Another good job peeps
            on helping those out who are in need.</p>
            <p>Submitted by Swadi on 11/16/03...Lilcloe, Beni, and myself went
              to KC for some exp. We cleared our way to the Live Captain. We
              set up camp there. Kalander shows up and starts pulling. Mobs,
              one right after another! Man oh man was it a blast! Lilcloe hit
              51, congrats! Thanks Kal. Swadi</p>
            <p>Submitted by Gaarbage on 11/07/03...I was grouped in BoT last
              night with what started with an excellent group. 2 Wizzies, Mag,
              BL, Clr, and War. Stuff was dying fast with no issues. We ended
              up switching out warriors once and also had to trade in a wiz for
              shammy as well. Our replacement warrior was worried about DPS and
              conviently went LD before we even tried anything. So we all sat
              there waiting until the cleric chirps up, &quot;Gaar try to tank
              one&quot;. I was a bit skeptical knowing I get pounded for 580
              by these guys sometimes. So we decided to give it a try(no defensive
              aa's either), much to my suprise I did not squish like a grape,
              close, but the cleric knew his stuff and the shammy was on the
              spot with the slows. We did this for awhile and even ended up adding
              a 62 ranger to fill the last spot while I still tanked. It was
              quite fun. Mage had to leave and we added a 65 ranger that was
              crying about having to tank until we showed him what my pleather
              armor could do. He shut up and tanked after that. No luck on ornate
              stuff but got a parchment. So for those that are in BoT or about
              to get in there, the unconventional group can go a long way. Gaarbage
              Heap</p>
            <p>Submitted by Fairsong on 11/01/03...Was a blast last night in
              kael. aub, mad, balaz, and kali joined me to hit the tormax area
              in kael for some faction and loots. we were dropping giants like
              crazy. even tore up some level 66 giants with relative ease which
              kinda surprised me. Aub got some good raid type exp and did real
              well not taking too much agro. Even without her c3 spell she kept
              andor and fair near max mana. we did score a few pieces of armor
              ; aub - silk bracer silk bracer rotted leather arms - bank leather
              gloves - bank and some ranger sword for the guild bank. cloak of
              elemental maelstom - kalander </p>

              Small news update (submitted by Larlador at 06:17pm EST)</p>
            <p>After having a guilds week of rest, we finally picked raids up
              again, starting with killing Emperor Ssraa.</p>
            <p>we also killed:</p>
            <p>AD<br>
              TT</p>
            <p>and some other small stuff, slacking has stopped and we are picking
              up pace again (well the guild that is, ask around and they will
            still call me a slacker ;) ). </p>

              <br>
                Not FD news, but EQ news in general... Approximately 180 players
                from Ascending Dawn, Wudan, and Magus Imperialis Magicus teamed
                up on the Rallos Zek server to bring down Kerafyrm, otherwise
                known as The Sleeper. They had tried over the weekend, but the
                zone was reset when The Sleeper was down to 27%. SOE claims there
                was a mob in the zone that was causing Kerafyrm to ignore the
                players, and thus it would have been a bugged kill. The players
                felt they could have done it then, so they tried again, and this
            time succeeded. </p>  
            <p>Congratulations on doing the &quot;impossible&quot; (almost twice
              even)! You can find screenshots from the fight at MIM's site. Here
              is a thread on the Fires of Heaven board describing the first attempt
              over the weekend, as well as posts as tonight's events unfolded.
              For those of you who simply want the proof, here is a screenshot
              with Kerafyrm's corpse targeted at 0%. GMs have stated in the past
              that Kerafyrm is a part of the EQ2 storyline so they wouldn't allow
              him to be killed, so we'll have to see how that's handled. <br>

            News: Quarm Dies! <br>
posted on 11-22-2003 10:50 PM by Larry<br>
<br>
              Its been a long time coming! Over the last 8 months we have had
                a lot of ebb and flo of members in our little family. In fact
                for a stretch there we got quite good at clearing Time Phase
                1 with only 36 people. However, as it is with everything we do.
                we stayed the course and eventually succeeded. Although these
                are not the first screenshots of their kind on our unique server,
                they are by far the most important to me. You see it was only
                a little over a year ago when we parted ways with our old allies
                Element of Darkness, and although we accomplished great things
                with our allies, there is something to be said for doing it alone.
                I will be honest, its a little scary sometimes, knowing there
                isnt another guild out there to depend on or to pick you up when
                things get down. Its a little scary knowing that you must mesh
                all the different personalities into one guild as opposed to
                allowing them to migrate between two distinct guilds. We are
                really proud of all the wonderful things we accomplished with
                an ally guild like Element of Darkness while they still existed,
                however the fruit is just a little bit sweeter since we set off
            on our own.</p>
            <p>For me, I would like to thank my guild for having the guts and
              stamina to not only survive a rough time this summer when we lost
              almost 25% of our active players, but for stepping up, finding
              and recruiting what has to be some of the best talent on the server
              and allowing our officers and leaders to merge us together into
              a successful fighting machine. Quarm is dead, we killed him and
              thats all that matters! So without further hesitation here is the
              loot and spam text from the event - I swear on my great grandmothers
              grave it is exactly as the script ran, I swear.</p>
            <p>Also of note, I must apologize to wizards everywhere for allowing
              an enchanter to get the kill shot </p>
            <p><img src="quarmloot.jpg" width="600" height="480"></p>
            <p>Final Script</p>
            <p>Zebuxoruk staggers about and looks at you drowsy, from his weakened
              state. 'My thanks to you. I am surprised to see you have made it
              here. We must get back to Norrath. The time has come for me to
              share my knowledge. Something is coming, a threat to us all, and
              the sands in the hourglass are thinning. Make haste and take me
              back the way you came.' </p>
            <p>Zebuxoruk says, 'I am surprised at the gods for taking such drastic
              measures, though I suppose all of the creations of the Nameless
              are capable of displaying poor judgment and irrational behavior.
              These gods are burdened with powers and responsibilities beyond
              our comprehension, yet at times even they do not understand the
              eventual effect of their actions. I am compelled to share the knowledge
              of the gods with the populace of Norrath, so that I might save
              their creations. They do not realize that if mortality ceases to
              exist... if they are not worshipped and held aloft by the beliefs
              of those that they now have grown to fear... they will fall from
              power and a new age of darkness will wash over existence as they
              know it. I did not seek to interfere with them or their realms,
              only to free them from a fate that awaits all of us. It is this
              fate that now stands ready, greedily gathered on the edge of the
              void, ready to test the will of all mortals.' </p>
            <p>Zebuxoruk says, 'If they have taken measures these extreme I must
              rethink what I have done, and what I will do. If there was this
              much cause for conc...' </p>
            <p>Suddenly in a bright flash a feminine figure appears before you.
              Your ears ring from the loud burst as she slowly materializes. </p>
            <p>Druzzil Ro speaks with no movement of her mouth. Her thoughts
              flow through you, calming you as you begin to comprehend what she
              is trying to communicate to you. </p>
            <p>Druzzil Ro speaks to your mind, 'Zebuxoruk, my student I cannot
              allow this to happen. If you were to escape from another prison
              the will and power of the gods will have been compromised.' </p>
            <p>Zebuxoruk says, 'Druzzil, I have missed you. Wasn't it you that
              taught me in your own realm to seek knowledge and share it in all
              forms?' </p>
            <p>Druzzil Ro speaks to your mind, 'That I did, but I also taught
              you not to share your wealth of knowledge if it would affect the
              fate of others. I cannot allow this to happen. I must set things
              back to how they were before you and these mortals arrived here,
              I believe that you cannot understand this and I am sorry.'</p>
            <p>Zebuxoruk says, 'Druzzil, this is not like you. Why would you
              do such a thing - its as if you are not yourself, its like you
              have been taken over by the Marketing department at SOE.</p>
            <p>Druzzil Ro speaks while looking nervously around, 'Zebuxoruk you
              know we have no content beyond this. If I were not to undo what
              has been done here tonight all of Norrath would know the truth,
              that all they have left is a life of very boring instanced dungeons
              with beasts that have no ability to put up a fight. That they would
              be left with nothing to do but collect points to further their
              position in some imaginary caste. Yes, you would never understand
              this Zebuxoruk, you would never realize the power of the numbers
              12.95. For this I must step in and do what must be done.</p>
            <p>Druzzil Ro looks upon Zebuxoruk one last time, as a wave of sadness
              comes across her gentle face. </p>
            <p>Druzzil Ro begins to chant an incantation; mana flows out from
              her body in all directions. Things begin moving slowly in reverse.
              You become dizzy from the experience and fall to your knees. As
              you look up the last thing you can see is Druzzil Ro smiling in
              your direction. She then waves her arms gracefully and points at
              you. </p>
            <p>There is a brilliant flash and you find yourself displaced through
              time and space. For a moment you lose touch with yourself. As you
              wake, you find yourself back in the Plane of Knowledge, moments
              after talking to Maelin with the information of retrieving the
              Quintessence of Elements. Druzzil has preserved the timeline, and
            restored existence back to its normalcy. </p>
