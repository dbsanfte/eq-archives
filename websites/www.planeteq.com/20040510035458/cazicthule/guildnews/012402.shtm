              Jan 24 2002 1:18AM - Well, patch day and... Deacis <br>
              We went to kill the two bosses in Temple of Ssraaarararararaaa...Twice, 
              due to the wee emergency patch ;) Dropped a lot of decent spells 
              for us all ;) And...Grats Balak from PE on this: 
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Then we proceeded to go to a place, very few people go to these 
              days... </p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Thats right, Sleeper Tomb ;) </p>
            <p>Was a good run, resulting in a primal 2hander for Banno, netting 
              PE their first Primal :) </p>
            <p>On a side note, then it is really depressing to have The Progenitor 
              dropping nothing but Gift of Brilliance...Thats not fun to get on 
              a first kill :p <br>
              <br>

            <p>Tonight along with our CC friends we visited the Deep and killed 
              the Thought Horror Overfiend and we got 6 spells off him. The we 
              moved on to Icewell Keep and made quick work of the Dain. Grats 
              to Widowstein on the Dain's head, Sylverblade on his new hammer, 
              Keely on the Frostreaver's Embroidered Cloak, and Spuds on his new 
              axe. As we finished the Dain, Zlandicar put in a short-lived appearance. 
              Congratulations to Avar on his new ST key. After Zlandi, we zoned 
              out and finished off his brother Kland, grats to Shar on her ST

            <p>JAN 22, 2002<br>
              Killed spawned Trakanon again this evening. Managed to get a cobalt 
              breastplate this time [Swolore] and another set of guts [Kilwean]. 
              Brewall did turn-in for bard epic, Singing Short Sword: 1HS 16/26 
              str15 dex10 sta5 cha20 hp100 resists10 with Dance of the Blade proc 
              (55% haste 30str 30atk 150' radius). Perhaps the best feature of 
              the sword is that acts as though you are holding a store-bought 
              instrument of every type in your hand and even magnifies the strength 
              of voice skill songs. This item completely changes how a bard is 
              played, song selection, and melee capabilities.</p>
            <p>Grats to Greymask for reaching 60!</p>
            <p>JAN 19, 2002<br>
              Finished off Chiun's epic today for our third epic so far this year. 
              Grats to Chiun for monk epic!</p>
            <p>JAN 16, 2002<br>
              The resident dragon of Seblis, Trakanon, met an untimely death this 
              evening to the forces of Crimson Talon. The night got off to a good 
              start with numerous spell drops and even a cobalt helm [Swolore]. 
              We finished off Jumpy who dropped wizard epic piece and a robe [Imotep]. 
              After some buffing, Brewall spawned Trakanon and were able to kill 
              him with only a couple deaths. Flawless execution of the plan by 
              the well-seasoned dragon hunting crew led by Brewall's research 
              and everyone's desire to see this beast dead. Drops were Guts [Brewall's 
              last item for epic] and a Druid BP [Tomwin]. Thanks to everyone 
              for coming and we will certainly return to kill many more.<br>

              Hooray for the Hero! Posted by Pipette<br>
              1/23/2002<br>
              Our guild members will go out of their way to help each other. A 
              day or so ago, our doughty rogue Galaeil (aka Timon)had an unfortunate 
              boating accident in the Ocean of Tears. Niord, a Hatchling bard 
              (aka Hodur), swam the length of the ocean and back to retrieve Galaeil's 
              corpse from the watery depths. It was an act of selflessness and 
              loyalty. Loud applause and cheers to Niord for his outstanding heroism!

              of Norrath</b></a><br>
              Wednsday, Jan 16th <br>
              Ok, Drunkards taken down Lodi twice now (Congrats Loh on shield, 
              eyepatch, Xia/Smuge on boots, myself on eyepatch, Tigerstorm/Bonecrusha 
              on their shields- and myself again on the ringy thing :D ) It was 
              fun and good and we'll probably do it again sometime. However; on 
              our second killing we accidentally pulled Lodizal off another person- 
              now, he was solo, and almost certainly could not have taken Lodizal 
              out by himself- but regardless of that pulling Lodizal off of him 
              is something we should not have done- Despite not being sure of 
              all the specifics- in general- don't pull off someone else unless 
              they ask for it :) In other news, people are probably leveling and 
              stuff, eh. Furthermore, Roso got a custom title on the boards (Viva) 
              and Bumwuk has rejoined us a-la Bummy (hooray)!</p>
            <p> One final bit of news, according to sources, the name of my warrior 
              (Srukin) means ASSHOLE in russian, can anyone confirm this? If it's 
              true I'll be very proud, haha.<br>

              After a zillion hours of trying we finally managed to get a key 
              for third floor of SSRA. We went and open up a nice can of whoop 
              ass on Xerkizh The Creator.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Gratz Kellan on his hammer which adds 5% to Black Smithing (you 
              think I am kidding don't you).</p>
            <p>We then moved along and had a can of whoop ass opened on us by 
              The High Priest.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Actually is an easier mob then Xerikizh IMHO got him to about 80%. 
              Unusual AOE's and figuring where to put him was most the effort 
              tonight. Will be a dead mofacka next trip.<br>

              Wednesday, January 16 Vindi dead again, etc. <br>
              Charoth writes &quot;In case you haven't logged in all weekend, 
              we whacked ole Derakor the Vindicator again on Saturday after dragging 
              ourselves around ToV for a few hours. Started to clear over to attempt 
              the Statue, but the combination of the late hour, horrendous lag, 
              and some other folks there itching to pop him stayed our hand... 
              this time. Dropped BP and his head. Grats Gwendle... and whoever 
              ended up with the head.<br>
              <br>
              We killed stuff <br>
              Solias writes &quot;So the past few days we've got several big kills.. 
              We went after the Vindicator and after a few borked attempts, managed 
              to down him and get a BP of Vindication (Gwendle). Were gonna attempt 
              Statue but our pullers couldn't seem to split it and it was getting 
              late so we took off. </p>
            <p>The next night we did Ixiblat Fer for 2 of our clerics, the Hole 
              for Damain, then took down Trakanon, winning a Donal's BP (Eloine) 
              and Shaman BP (Damain) plus about 5 teeth I think, as well as a 
              Jumpy robe (Prespone) and Hardened Clay Bracer and some spells etc. 
            </p>
            <p>The nite after that (Tuesday) we hit up Trakanon again (patch day), 
              drops being a Pally BP (Vigil) and Bard BP (Jammen). Then we headed 
              to VL and dropped Velketor for a Crystal Rod of Confusion (Solias, 
              yay me), Sword of Somethingorother (Pyriana), Some_Necro_Bracer 
              (Tylerkx), and Velketors Spellbook (Arae), plus 4 spells (pretty 
              loaded corpse) including Ice Spear of Solist. Then those remaining 
              dropped down to whack Lord Monklewts, who didn't surprise us by 
              dropping an Tunic (Buhf) and Glowing Red Stone (Fuddrick). </p>
            <p>Grats all on the good work, we are improving our skill in dropping 
              these guys greatly =)<br>

              Patch day <br>
              Patch day and some interesting mobs were up. We started with Boss 
              mob 1 in Ssra Temple that dropped a new weapon that was sort of...well...very 
              good. Due to Verant and an emergency patch we all had to camp in 
              the Temple for 90 minutes before we could start all over again. 
              1 more Boss mob 1 kill before we did Boss 2. All in all a lot of 
              great spells...2x C3 and other nice ones too. </p>
            <p>After Ssra the ST key holders went to Sleepers Tomb and got some 
              nice stuff there. Rest of EoN peeps went to Sebilis and told Trakanon 
              to leave the lair. This time he dropped shammy and druid BP's. <br>

            <p>The pain started doing Sontalak. 4 level 60 wizards not being there, 
              lag issues, people leaving early and some poor luck resulted in 
              attempts, but no kill. </p>

              finally got their act together and did it the way we use to do it. 
              Dropped some great spells, some armour and ST key for Regor. </p>

              Today was the day we decided to move to Fear and do our first attempt 
              on that big ugly mofa CT on Plane of Fear. We have delayed trying 
              him, knowing he is hard. </p>
            <p>A long story short: Many LD problems, some attempts to figure everything 
              out and an outstanding attitude from you all: CT died today for 
              the first time to the Alliance. </p>
            <p>Drops: Robe of Inspiration and 2x Bile Etched Obsidian Choker. 
            </p>
            <p>Very well done everyone, and now that we know how and were to do

              Soon......So very soon....With an absolutely stunning turnout of 
              alliance members for this epic fight, the SS/DA alliance took on 
              the Avatar of War and had him really worried on our second attempt. 
              On our first attempt we were just warming up and got him down to 
              50%. Here's a lil somethin somethin from our second attempt.</p>
            <p>
              As you can see above, it wont be long now till the AoW is holding 
              his ankles on the SS/DA guild house lawn. We had about 60 people 
              in attendance give or take some untagged invites. I expect that 
              with a similar turnout and a couple adjustments to our late fight 
              transfers we'll take him down next time we try him. Stay tuned for 
              the gear that he drops for us! Congrats go out to all the alliance 
              members who gave it their all and especially to our top notch tank 
              and heal crew that let the rest of us lay the smack down on him.

              ponies). We had a blast, wiped 'em twice, fed them Thund (just look 
              for yourself) then moved on. Oh, and the answer to Thund's question 
              is &quot;Proving you are gullible&quot;.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>We also had a few other notable occurences in the last few days. 
              We killed a couple white dragons. The first was noteable as the 
              dragon was dead before half of us had figured out it was there to 
              engage, the second because we had somehow never killed this guy 
              before. Oh, and on that second guy....the dragon and wildlife commissioner 
              showed up and measured some of the loot....it was too small so we 
              had to throw it back.</p>

              Shahmat rocked Kael.<br>
              Quite a few trinkets, gems and jewels dropped. And we picked up 
              8 quest items as well. Minimal deaths - all in all, a most successful 
              raid.<br>
              <br>
              Currently Shahmat is taking Applications for level 55-60 members... 
              preferably level 60, 55 is the bare minimum for consideration. See 
              Sneeky, Kitska, Malachy, or any officer in game. <br>
