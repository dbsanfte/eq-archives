              Well something had to die and Vindi wasn't around so BG headed to 
              Akehva. Lo and behold both Vadyn and The Itraer Vius were talking 
              smack about us. We decided to kill that. Chalk up another 2 dead 
              mobs that cried for their mommies before they died. Grats on the 
              first ever (and in house) kill of Itraer Vius.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Grats to Nastily on Shield of Infused Power, to Avoreen on Crown

            <p>Since our last update (well, excluding Veteran's Day), we've been 
              mainly focused on leveling up. In between all the marathon experience 
              camps, we have managed to do a few things:</p>
            <p>First off, the daily grind sorta stuff - Killed Cursed and friends, 
              AoW and friends Twice, Burrower Parasite, Cazic Thule.</p>
            <p>As to &quot;new&quot; stuff: We hit VT and killed some stuff...picked 
              up 2 gorgets of superiority and some nifty shoes...but not a whole 
              lot was up. Gotta love a server with 5 VT capable Guilds/alliances.</p>
            <p>We also managed to knock down this ho for the first time:</p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>I was surprised at what a fun fight this was, and I can't wait 
              to see more of the PoP bosses. Congrats to Talons on their Bracer 
              and shoulders, and Taraddar of CC on his new Veil. </p>
            <p>Finally, earlier this week Cohort set foot where no other CT guild 
              has been so far - the Bastion of Thunder, Karana's Domain. So far, 
              we've only seen one loot drop, a pretty nifty lance, but we're hoping 
              we'll have other trophies to show off soon.<p>
              Veteran's day <br>
              <br>
              Posted by: Druss on Monday, November 11th, 2002 @ 12:31 AM<br>
            </p>
            <p>In 1921, an unknown World War I American soldier was buried in 
              Arlington National Cemetery. This site, on a hillside overlooking 
              the Potomac River and the city of Washington, became the focal point 
              of reverence for America's veterans.</p>
            <p>Similar ceremonies occurred earlier in England and France, where 
              an unknown soldier was buried in each nation's highest place of 
              honor (in England, Westminster Abbey; in France, the Arc de Triomphe). 
              These memorial gestures all took place on November 11, giving universal 
              recognition to the celebrated ending of World War I fighting at 
              11 a.m., November 11, 1918 (the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 
              11th month). The day became known as &quot;Armistice Day&quot;.</p>
            <p>Armistice Day officially received its name in America in 1926 through 
              a Congressional resolution. It became a national holidiay 12 years 
              later by similar Congressional action. If the idealistic hope had 
              been realized that World War I was &quot;the War to end all Wars,&quot; 
              November 11 might still be called Armistice Day. But only a few 
              years after the holiday was proclaimed, war broke out in Europe. 
              Sixteen and one-half million Americans took part. Four hundred seven 
              thousand of them died in service, more than 292,000 in battle.</p>
            <p>Realizing that peace was equally preserved by veterans of WW II 
              and Korea, Congress was requested to make this day an occasion to 
              honor those who have served America in all wars. In 1954 President 
              Eisenhower signed a bill proclaiming November 11 as Veterans Day.</p>
            <p>On Memorial Day 1958, two more unidentified American war dead were 
              brought from overseas and interred in the plaza beside the unknown 
              soldier of World War I. One was killed in World War II, the other 
              in the Korean War. In 1973, a law passed providing interment of 
              an unknown American from the Vietnam War, but none was found for 
              several years. In 1984, an unknown serviceman from that conflict 
              was placed alongside the others. To honor these men, symbolic of 
              all Americans who gave their lives in all wars, an Army honor guard, 
              The 3d U.S. Infantry (The Old Guard), keeps day and night vigil.<p>
              Have you thanked a Veteran today for their service?<br>

              Raid on West ToV again to slay both Gozzrem and Telkorenar. Some 
              nice drops: Bracelet of Protection [Groovit], 2 Circlets of Silver 
              Skies [Imotep, Hattrick], 2 True Mithril Breastplates [Sabretta, 
              Devaberiel], and a Pauldrons of Blight [Maxist].

              Kael raid on Vindicator this evening and we easily slayed him with 
              a minimal crew. Unlike other guilds that kill with sheer numbers 
              or uber gear, we are able to accomplish tasks with teamwork and 
              tactics. We obtained our first Sleeper's Tomb key in addition to 
              a few other nice items. Definitely starting to move up the scale 
              in boss mobs.</p>
            <p>NOV 11, 2002<br>
              Raid on ToV yielded some nice items this evening. At one stage, 
              we killed three dragons at one time just for fun. Drops were: Tattered 
              Silk Robe [Goratrix], Leather Bracer [Ippit], Plate Bracer [Zypheal], 
              Plate Boots [Stein], Silk Bracer [Silvercaster], and Plate Gauntlets

              Took about a half a dozen tries over two days to figure it out, 
              final result. Saryn dead, zero EOD dead. Certainly a fun encounter 
              changing the traditional dynamics of SOV/SOL.</p>

              -Lots of Crap- <br>
              Got lots of hoosafudge to talk about. Sorry for the lack of updates, 
              but me and Sithray have been very busy cybering lately over all 
              the new Skyshrine armor coming into the guild. Naturally, most of 
              the screenshots I have are of people goofing around, and not the 
              actual raids. But what do you expect from me? </p>
            <p>We've done Halls of Testing quite a bit recently, gotten good drops 
              for the most part. Gratzors to Sithray on Plate BP(he did his tongue 
              in a way I'd never seen for that one), Grats Bworld on Plate BP, 
              Tiliu on Chain Legs, and Railus on never going to get a Silk Robe. 
              Were lots of other drops as well, but as I've mentioned before, 
              I'm too cool for them. </p>
            <p>We went down to Sebilis not long ago, to take out Trak for Bworld's 
              epic. With only 18 of us present, didn't work out too well. We tried 
              to go back last night, but he was no longer up :( :(. Anyway, we 
              did pretty good against Trak and fully plan on going back in. While 
              we were all dead we decided to have a naked Gnome take over of Seb. 
              It went well. Brigug is one fat little gnome. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Since Trak wasn't up last night, we headed to Iceclad to do the 
              8th Shawl war for Abanado(he puts out good too). War was too easy 
              for us, so we got bored and all cybered through the whole thing. 
              Anyway, here's the results: </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>While camping Stormfeather, Nik thought he'd give me some company, 
              unfortunately the Gnomes hadn't forgotten his gangster ways and 
              got right back to the chase. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Luckily for Nik, he'd gotten in some hot beast sex with the cougars 
              in the area and they had not forgotten their lover. They defended 
              him against the gnomes. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>When you're guilded with me, it's always good to be on your toes. 
              Nik will deny it, but he was worried for a few minutes after this 
              tell. And I don't even know what happened to Dorry after the following. 
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>I might as well just call this the Nikalos comedy hour and stop 
              actually bothering with other guild news. He's an attention whore, 
              but he's also another kind of whore. ::wink, wink:: </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>There was absolutely NOTHING going on the other night, so me, Nik, 
              and Tiliu headed to the arena in Bazaar to goof around. Not long 
              after, our good buddy Cilumbik showed up with Korra. Well, we ganged 
              up on Korra and killed her. Next thing we know, the entire Fates 
              Defiance guild is showing up to kill us &quot;lamers&quot;. Grumpie, 
              Shaylan, Gref, and Feelorn all showed up to help. So to be annoying, 
              I sat right on the edge of the pvp. It seemed to work. Cilumbik 
              kept trying to cast on me :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( Apparently 
              Cilumbik already knew my entire history as well, and was laying 
              down the law. So apparently in addition to being ebay, I was also 
              kicked out of TR, the devil, and I started the Vietnam war. </p>
            <p>Anyway, after a bit of jibba jabba back and forth, and me being 
              as annoying as possible running in and out of the arena. More and 
              more FD people kept showing up. Eventually they had quite a few(like 
              10). Anyway, Dorry, Buru, and Nyene all showed up(Nik had to go 
              to bed, sissy). So 5 of us vs. a bajillion of them. First round, 
              none of us die, but quite a few of them did. We stayed for a bit 
              longer goofing around, but that was the fun part. Here is a pic 
              I like to call...Juggerowned! The /w of FD in the zone looks crappy, 
              so deal with it :( </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>That's about it for now, except that we'd like to welcome Nildir, 
              Enzime, and Wizban to full membership. As well as welcoming some 
              new recruits to the guild. You can check them out in the Bio's section. 
              OMG Bye2u!</p>

              Busy night last night, and some serious ownage by The Relentless. 
              Targets were as follows:<br>
              Glyphed, Exhiled, Cursed, pre-emp insignias (4), Emperor of ssra, 
              Creator, Arch lich, Shei, and a half-assed attempt at the PoV dragon 
              by 30 toons early in the a.m. (15 of which were two-boxed), which 
              got the bastard down to 2%. 
            <p>Loot was insane, I'm not even going to begin to list it off with 
              so much dead stuff. </p>

              So what does everyone think of PoP?</p>
            <p>Personally, I like it. After being able to explore the planes for 
              a couple weeks, I have to say that it does have much more &quot;instant&quot; 
              appeal than its predecessor. For the most part it's brighter, more 
              imaginitive, interactive, and stuffed with content. Not too bad 
              of a job so far...but this is just the begining. </p>
            <p>What have we been up to? Basically the same shit everyone else 
              is; flagging for the planes, leveling up, and exploring new content. 
              We're also taking full advantage of Luclin mobs, getting sick gear 
              and FT while we're at it. We continue to surge forward, however 
              we're not afraid to take a step back and use our resources to the 
              fullest advantage for our members, old and new.</p>
            <p>When I get some new screenshots, I'll post them. Unfortunately 
              my hard drive was just recently formatted thanks to the NIMDA virus, 
              so I've got a lot of pics to catch up on...stay tuned.</p>
            <p>Feel free to give your opinion on what you think about the new 
              expansion in our general public forum. Tell us what you think - 
              likes,dislikes, what does the future hold, etc. Let's get your take

            <p>Done. Finished. Fully measured, cross typed, isolated, and hooked 
              up to the machine that goes PING!</p>
            <p>Leave it to my loving guildmates to wait for the one day I am offline 
              completely to complete Luclin.</p>
            <p>That's right, you heard it here first on Cazic Thule....Luclin 
              finally done. On the side of the guild we have little painted silhouettes 
              of every boss in the entire expansion with an X through them. Well, 
              except for Blob1. That still has all the flowers and hearts drawn 
              on it, with some &quot;Ode To Little Puddin&quot; thing scrawled 
              by Apoc. We tried to paint the X there, but Apoc went off and stopped 
              eatin his cheetos for like a week....so we let him keep it that 
              way.</p>
            <p>As for the details on how Seru died...well, the big boy made a 
              run at us and we gave him a sharp one to the tabernacle, if you 
              get my meaning. Having been there for our big spree on him somewhere 
              about 8 months ago (before any of us knew what the hell a bane weapon 
              was) and enjoyed all the pain of engaging a mob you can't damage....I 
              had been hopin to be there for the kill. Since I wasn't....you all 
              have to pay. No pretty pictures, no funny quotes....just bitter 
              me.</p>
            <p>It sort of made a nice capper for our little Luclin jaunt the past 
              few days. Blood, Emp, Vex Thal (including a new personal best of 
              killing &quot;Aten The HA HA HA Ra!&quot; with 44), and now Seru.</p>
            <p>We now return y'all to the race to be next...... <br>

            <p>November 11th: Our first foray into PoP, we did fairly well killing 
              spiders in PoD after dying gruesome deaths in PoI. We also spent

              some of the 40s we brought along to learn our tactics. Grats to
