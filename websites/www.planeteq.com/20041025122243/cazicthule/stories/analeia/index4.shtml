<b class="heading">Analeia, Part IV</b><br>
<i>by</i> Penya Dreamlight

<br><br>
What can be said about the passage of events, other than that in the end all things work out the way they should? This is true even when individual events seem unrelated or even tragic.
<br><br>
In Befallen, messengers were being sent out across the realms. The shadowknight had gotten a good look at the entire party that had invaded the sanctuary. Although the Dreamlights could not be harmed, all that were with them could - including the cleric and rogue who had just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.
<br><br>
In Freeport, the loosely formed group discussed where to go with the information they had. It was decided that Loralie, Analiea, and Worlik would use the services of a druid to port them to Butcherblock. Once there, they would check the family estate for any sign of a sword and ask amongst the elder residents of Felwithe what they remembered about the Dreamlights’ father. Anarchy would travel to Neriak and start asking around about the D`Irinik family. They would meet back in Freeport to share any information they could gather in a week’s time.
<br><br>
Half a world away an evil man - or what was left of a man - went to the lower chambers of his home to visit a captive held there. He traveled past the center room where he accepted visitors, and into the crypt area in which he slept. For a moment he paused at an empty sword display on the wall, his form stiffening in frustration and hatred. He then continued into another darkened hallway into an ancient prison area.  The stones smelt of mold, age, and lack of use. The silence was unbroken except for the sound of the rodents in the darkness.  He moved to the last cell in the row where one lone prisoner sat. The captive’s hair was long, but his elven heritage did not allow for a beard. His features had long recovered from the beatings he had received, but his arm was at an odd angle where it had been broken and not set properly. It hurt him every day. A quick look in the cell proved that the prisoner was alive and still had enough energy to stare at the evil dark elf with a defiant hatred.  The skeletal form of the dark elf laughed hollowly at the sight of the prisoner and said contemptuously, “The girls are slow to figure this out. Not smart at all. I may have to prod them on a bit.” The prisoner muttered a curse and threw himself at the bars, but the evil man just laughed more and walked away.
<br><br>

In Highpass Hold, a female halfling was joking with one of the attendants of the gambling tables. Zeebop had just gotten off duty herself, her pay jingling at her side. The house liked her, for she was very good at her job. Zeebop drew the line at using loaded dice, but she had an art of goading drunken gamblers into betting higher and riskier than they should. This helped her make a very good living. Her little frame and neatly bundled hair had an almost maternal air that instilled trust in her patrons, and her mischievous nature caused them to forget their problems and financial obligations. The good nature might fade some if the customers realized she was married to a rogue, or that she too had – well – certain skills. Redo and Zeebop had moved away from Rivervale after a few unfortunate - if mostly true - rumors started circulating about the couple. Tired of the ever suspicious eyes on them, they moved to a place where there was a different standard of honesty. Redo had gone off somewhere adventuring, while Zeebop stayed in Highpass waiting for him patiently. He was due to meet her soon and tell her of the adventures he’d had. He would be gone for about a month at a time, never really more than that. This suited Zeebop. She had no taste for the lifestyle herself, but loved to hear her husband tell her of the events of his life. She had no worries that he would come back with her. Redo loved to come home to her as much as he loved to adventure.
<br><br>
As if her thoughts of him were a summoning spell, Zeebop felt affectionate hands drop on her waist and a quick brush of a kiss against the side of her head, smiling she turned to see her husband looking at her appreciatively. Unmindful of the crowded room, she threw her arms around him squeezing him tightly as she said, “You’re back! How did it go?”
<br><br>
Redo kissed her and said, “Pretty good. I brought you a trinket.” He pulled a silver carnilian ring from his pocket that he had purchased from the elven jeweler before the party had broken up.  He was rewarded with a wide smile as Zeebop put it on. She was captivated by the lights of the room that reflected in the facets of the stone.
<br><br>
“It’s beautiful,” she said.
<br><br>
Redo grinned a little evilly, “It has benefits.”
<br><br>
Zeebop looked at him, eyebrow raised but simply smiled. Looping her arm into her husband’s Zeebop said, “Come back to the inn. You’ll tell me what happened and then we can figure out how we will spend our evening.” Her expression told Redo very well what she had in mind as they left the well crafted stone keep and headed into the surrounding hills where the inn that had become their home. It was safe to say that Redo and Zeebop traveled light, so the small room at the inn was ideal. The owner had fallen victim to Zeebop’s convincing charm and agreed to rent the room to them on a somewhat permanent basis at a discounted rate. They were saving up their money to go back to Rivervale in style, rumors be damned. Redo had certain skills he used against the orcs that were very helpful in the goal of acquiring cash. They had plans of settling down and living the honest life in Rivervale, but in the meantime, they had a lot of work to do. 
<br><br>
As they walked they talked very little and just enjoyed being together in the fading light. They walked along the passages cut through the mountains to the lake where the inn was located.  Suddenly, Redo heard something behind him. Spinning, he saw a group of three orcs. Redo was surprised, their type normally did not get this close to the keep.  A quick glance at the creatures told Redo that although he may be able to handle one, three might be difficult. Zeebop turned to see what her husband was looking at as two more joined the original three. Redo simply said, “Run!” The pair turned and began to run back to the keep where they knew the guards would quickly dispatch the creatures. When Redo saw Zeebop stumbling past him due to a blow to her back, he knew they were not running fast enough. Redo turned, drawing the dirks at his belt to strike at the creature that had struck his wife. This pulled four of the creatures on him. Zeebop regained her balance and continued to run as the spires of the keep began to appear over the top of the hill. She was calling for help to try to alert the guards while the last orc chased her.
<br><br>
Redo was certain that he was facing his death when a female warrior and a male bard in varying shades of blue, plate armor turned the corner of the bend. Seeing the halfling’s predicament, they jumped into battle. The scene was blurred for a moment as the bard swung his dual swords. He sung a lulling song that caused the orcs who were not enganged in battle to feel as if they were going to sleep. The warrior carried a huge axe, the likes that Redo had never seen. She swung it with deadly precision, landing critical blows to the creatures. Redo slipped behind the orc she was fighting and quickly dispatched it with tandum thrusts to the vital organs in the small of his back. Seeing that the two strangers had the situation well in hand, Redo ran in the direction that his wife had gone.  She hadn’t made it to the hill. Redo got there in time to see the orc turning back to return to his companions, Zeebop’s still form lying at its feet. With a cry of rage, Redo leapt at the creatures, all reason gone. The area was filled with the sound of steel against steel. Under any other circumstances, the orc might have bested the already fatigued Redo, but fury gave the halfling a strength and a quickness that he might have been otherwise missing. The creature was killed when Redo’s dirk plunged into the creature’s neck, severing a vein.
<br><br>
At the creature’s death, Redo knelt at his wife’s side, dread filling him as he saw the lack of movement and the growing pool of blood around her. Redo gathered her lifeless body into his arms, tears beginning to flow down his cheeks.  He could feel that the orc’s attacks had shattered her ribs and spin. There were to be no parting words between them, as broken bones had pierced her heart and lungs, killing her instantly.
<br><br>
The two strangers appeared in view. At the sight, the bard knelt in sorrow at Redo’s side, laying a comforting hand on the halfling’s back. “We can try to find a cleric,” he said. Redo nodded dumbly and stood, carrying his wife. The bard followed behind him as he made his way to the inn at that water where they had made their home. “Is there a temple here?” the bard asked. Redo shook his head.
<br><br>
As the pair carried on with their somber task, the warrior began to shuffle through the bodies of the orcs. As she approached the one that was adorned in better armor than the others, she saw a parchment sticking out of its belt. She pulled it out, her eyes widening at its contents. Quickly she turned to catch up with the other two. She found them at a room at the inn. Redo had placed Zeebop’s lifeless form in their bed, as the innkeeper sent out his children to see if a cleric could be found.
<br><br>
The warrior respectfully approached Redo as he sat at the bedside.  Gently she laid a hand on his shoulder and held out the paper. Wordlessly Redo looked at her then hesitantly reached out to take the paper he was offered. He was shocked to see his own features roughly drawn there along with the people he had met in Befallen. On the sheet was also a statement in common promising 100 pieces of platinum in reward for the return of their heads. An odd symbol of interlocking circles was provided as a signature. “I don’t know what you are into,” the woman said quietly, “But if this has circulated among the gnolls as well as the orcs, you have to leave Highpass. I don’t think you can safely stay here.”
<br><br>
Redo looked down at his wife gently running a finger along her cheek. The fading light streaming in from the window made it appear that she was asleep. He knew they would not be able to revive her, and the strangers were right. He would not be safe. Zeebop wouldn’t want him to put himself in danger. The bard said softly, “We will take care of her.”
<br><br>
Redo looked back down at her and said softly, “Bury her by the water. She liked it there.” Behind the strangers the innkeeper nodded. Slowly Redo stood, his eyes never leaving Zeebop’s face.
<br><br>
The warrior said, “We will try to find a cleric. If we find one, we will transport her to Rivervale. We will see to it, but you must go. Can you get out of Highpass safely?”
<br><br>
Redo nodded. The bard asked, “Do you have a place to go?”
<br><br>
Redo looked at him steadily and said, “Yes. Freeport. There are some people I must find. I have debts to collect on.” He looked at his wife one last time.  Then without another word and unmindful of his bloodstained appearance, Redo left the inn to disappear into the shadows of the gathering twilight.
<br><br>
After the rogue was out of earshot, the bard commented, “I hope he doesn’t get himself killed trying to avenge her.”
<br><br>
The warrior shrugged, “He strikes me as a pretty resourceful guy.” Within an hour they would determine that there were no clerics in the area that could perform a resurrection. The travelers finalized the burial arrangements with the innkeeper and continued on their way to the Karanas. They wouldn’t think anymore about the tragedy of that night.
<br><br>
Redo on the other hand, left Highpass Hold with a new purpose to his life. Someone would pay. He may die in the attempt, but someone would answer for the death of his wife.
