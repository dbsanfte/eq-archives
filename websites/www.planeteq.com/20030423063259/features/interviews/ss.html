              Alliance: &quot;Doing More with Less&quot;</b>
            <p align="center"><b>by Kwill Heartfyre</b>
            <p><b>In our ongoing series of guild leader interviews on EverQuest 
              servers, I interviewed Pirotess, the guild leader of Shadowed Soul 
              on the Cazic Thule server. Shadowed Soul has an established alliance 
              with the Divine Alliance guild, and many of their high level encounters 
              are done as a two-guild effort.</b></p>
            <p><i>Kwill: How did the guild get started? How long have you been 
              playing?</i></p>
            <p>The guild got started back in April of '99 but we didn't get our 
              tags for a month or two after that. Bgup, Shendra, Naeen and I lived 
              together so we leveled up quickly and met Caleal, Codas and Geshp 
              in Najena before 
              the bulk of the players on CT got to it. Our crew was actually trying 
              to kill the front ogres and ended up training Caleal and his crew 
              by accident. We talked for a bit while we recovered and decided 
              to work together. In time 
              we worked down and started farming Jboots off Drelzna which back 
              then was the ultimate gear. We learned to play well together and 
              decided to form a guild to facilitate that. Since we didn't have 
              the required 10 people to form the guild we recruited several work 
              acquaintances and took a few days to come up with a name from scratch.<br>
            </p>
            <p>I've been playing EQ since the start of Beta 3 which I believe 
              was in the Sep-Dec 98 time frame.</p>
            <p><i>Kwill: How did the alliance with DA get started? Can you talk 
              about how that works?</i></p>
            <p>The alliance with DA started back in October of 2000. This was 
              about 2 or 3 months after SS went through a split which left us 
              at about 50% capacity. Instead of mass guilding a bunch of players 
              that we really didn't know and growing to the point where the guild 
              and its schools of thought became unwieldy again, we decided to 
              find an ally. We started out trying to get something going with 
              various smaller guilds but unfortunately it never seemed to 'click'. 
              Around the same time we heard that DA was also looking for a way 
              to take it to the next level. If I remember correctly, CN [Coterie 
              Nocturne] one of their former allies, was looking to do more solo 
              instead of being allied.</p>
            <p>In any case DA and SS got together and tried a joint raid in the 
              Plane of Hate. To make a long story short, it was a complete disaster 
              and I think it would be safe to say that afterwards neither guild 
              thought it would work out. At the time SS was pretty militaristic in the way we raided 
              and DA was much more relaxed so we butted heads in the fundamental 
              way we wanted to go about raiding. However we persevered and over 
              the following months the officers of the two guilds banged out a 
              plan of attack were we met in the middle as 50/50 partners which 
              has served us quite well to this day.<br>
            </p>
            <p><i>Kwill: How do you handle the organization in your guild?</i></p>
            <p>I have 5 officers that have different responsibilities in running 
              the guild.</p>
            <p>They are:</p>
            <p>Chionia - Recruitment Officer<br>
              Valkemier - Vault/Merchant Officer<br>
              Tritolus - Raid/Loot Committee Chairman<br>
              Imrik - Raid/Group Officer<br>
              Isifhan - Internal Affairs Officer
            <p> Any of the officers can step in for the others if they are unavailable 
              and I can help with any of the responsibilities if need be as well. 
              Primarily I run the alliances raids with Aliudyen, DA's guildleader 
              and cover Foreign Affairs and general negotiations with other guilds.<br>
            </p>
            <p><i>Kwill: What membership requirements do you have?</i><br>
              <br>
              Presently we have an official level requirement of 58. However that 
              will be raised and we will be adding some basic AA requirements 
              if we decide to reopen recruitment. Right now it is closed. Past 
              experience has shown me that keeping a tight grip on our class balance 
              is extremely important to the health of the guild. It is my belief 
              that if you get too many of any one class people tend to feel unimportant, 
              unrewarded and unchallenged to excel. This has proven to work very 
              well for us.</p>
            <p>If we have an opening for a particular class and the character 
              meets our level requirements they then have to pass through 3 additional 
              stages of the recruitment process. First, they need to complete 
              an interview with our recruitment officer who asks basic recruitment 
              questions to give us an idea of what the lead is looking for in 
              a guild. This helps us determine if we have a possible match. If 
              we feel good about the interview, an invitation to apply is extended 
              and the lead becomes a candidate for a month where we judge their 
              raiding and group skills. At that time a vote is taken by the membership 
              and if it is positive, the candidate becomes an initiate who wears 
              the SS tag and adheres to our ethics and policies. After a month 
              as an initiate a final vote is taken and if positive they become 
              full members with all the privileges that entails.<br>
            </p>
            <p><i>Kwill: How do you get your members to remain loyal?</i></p>
            <p>In my position a lot of the loyalty of my members is based on trust. 
              If people don't trust me they won't follow me into the mouth of 
              a dragon. :)<br>
            </p>
            <p><i>Kwill: What have you done as a guild/alliance that you are most 
              proud of?</i></p>
            <p>I'd have to say winning the CT Test of Tactics 3 competition was 
              one of the moments that made me proudest. We were an underdog and 
              ended up beating some pretty stiff competition through teamwork 
              and a good strategy.<br>
            </p>
            <p><i>Kwill: As on every server, there is always politics involved 
              in high level game play. What is your take on the politics of the 
              Cazic Thule server? Who are the most powerful or influential guilds?</i></p>
            <p>Politics on CT always keep you on your toes. I think CT is very 
              unique in that it has a very large concentration of highly capable 
              guilds. Its pretty rare for a single server to have 7 guilds in 
              Vex Thal for example. This makes negotiating VERY important as its 
              pretty easy for any guild to completely screw the other guilds if 
              they really wanted to.</p>
            <p>That said, during Luclin things were fairly amicable between the 
              high end guilds on CT. Rotations were accepted pretty well and we 
              managed to stay out of each others hair for the most part. Prior 
              to Luclin, and now that PoP has launched, that seems to be changing 
              again. To a degree that is understandable since regardless of the 
              vast difference in ethics that drives each of the guilds, each has 
              a responsibility to its members to be successful. For that reason 
              negotiations can get pretty heated at times and quite often of late 
              erupt into all out wars. Like I said it keeps you on your toes. 
              :)</p>
            <p>Most powerful and influential? Shadowed Soul and The Divine Alliance 
              of course! =) All joking aside, SS and DA have been around as guilds 
              for longer than any of the other high end guilds so name recognition 
              has certainly been good to us. SS in particular became very well 
              known back in the days when we were the only guild to be killing 
              Nagafen and later Vox regularly until EA came into the picture. 
              We even had the server GM broadcasting each of our major kills for 
              awhile. =) The SS/DA alliance also tends to do things with less 
              people than our competition so we've adopted the motto &quot;Doing 
              more with less&quot; for the alliance.</p>
            <p>Past that I'd have to say that The Relentless and Element of Darkness 
              are the guilds we are most often in competition with. Due to the 
              nature of PoP however that could change pretty quickly as we all 
              progress through its storyline.<br>
            </p>
            <p><i>Kwill: How would you like SS to be thought of by other players 
              and guilds on the server?</i></p>
            <p>I think SS's reputation proceeds us pretty well. We've long been 
              known as a fair and just guild to the general CT populace. Naturally 
              our direct competition wouldn't agree with that as we are often 
              at odds when we have to stick up for ourselves but we always manage 
              to do so without breaking Verant's rules. Many times we have helped 
              less fortunate people and guilds with their epics and encounters 
              and we've stepped aside to let other guilds learn how an encounter 
              works instead of breathing down their necks. A few times we've finishing 
              an encounter off at another guilds request, ressed them up and had 
              them loot the drops. So far our ethics have almost always given 
              us a positive image and I'm happy to be a part of that.<br>
            </p>
            <p><i>Kwill: Your guild has stayed fairly stable over time. What causes 
              guilds to break up?</i></p>
            <p>Well from first hand experience they typically break up for a couple 
              of different reasons. SS split into EoD and SS because two unreconcilable 
              schools of thought formed and polarized the guild. There were the 
              people who felt we had a right to take what we wanted when we wanted 
              it and could roll over anyone who got in our way. The other school 
              wanted to continue to uphold the good name of SS and not be quite 
              so confrontational to the other people on the server. Naturally 
              there was more to both sides but those were the fundamental differences 
              in the two schools.</p>
            <p>The other thing that typically does it is growing too large. Its 
              really hard to keep people happy when they don't see any personal 
              reward for months at a time since loot needs to be spread across 
              so many more people. Loot really is the root of all evil in EQ.</p>
            <p>Last but not least, the &quot;grass is greener&quot; syndrome. 
              If you aren't pushing the bleeding edge of the game you're in danger 
              of losing your people to someone who is. Everyone wants to succeed 
              and people will migrate to people who are successful.<br>
            </p>
            <p><i>Kwill: What is your policy on loot, then?</i></p>
            <p>I'm a pretty big fan of our policy. We split gear with DA 50/50 
              by randoming the first time we kill a new mob and then winner gets 
              first pick. On the next kill the other guild gets first pick. SS 
              then has a loot committee made up of officers that take tells from 
              all members interested in the items. We consider playtime, gear 
              replaced, number of pieces recently awarded among other things before 
              coming up with the member the item will go to.</p>
            <p>Additionally we purchase items for our members as Thorn[song, from 
              the Relentless] does. In fact the vast majority of our cash reserves 
              goes towards buying spells, FT3 boots, mosquito earrings, horses, 
              raid components etc to make our members lives easier.<br>
            </p>
            <p><i>Kwill: What about people who leave the guild? What happens to 
              the loot you have given them?</i></p>
            <p> Some extremely hard to get or rare items are given on loan to 
              members such as Scepters of Destruction or Blades of Carnage. However 
              we feel that unless we specifically state that an item is on loan 
              when we give it to a member, 
              it is theirs to keep. Our thinking is we wouldn't be giving it to 
              them unless they earned it in the first place.</p>
            <p>These days we have very few people that leave the guild to go elsewhere. 
              The last one in recent memory who did was just an initiate. We do 
              have a fair number of people who have left the game but 9 times 
              out of 10 they leave their 
              account for the guild to use. The nice thing about that is it makes 
              it easy for them to return after they have attended to RL and play 
              with us again.<br>
            </p>
            <p><i>Kwill: Do you consider EQ addictive? Do you have players in 
              your guild that you would consider excessive players? </i></p>
            <p>I absolutely think EQ is addictive, it's an escape from reality. 
              I love EQ addicts since I consider myself one. Unfortunately in 
              reality there is only a small percentage of people in our alliance 
              who would qualify as true addicts and play at that level. I'd say 
              95% of our membership is 21+ and have jobs and families to attend 
              to so they really cant be true addicts. We have a policy in SS. 
              RL before game, group before guild and guild before self.<br>
            </p>
            <p><i>Kwill: How do you handle the casual players in your guild that 
              can't play as many hours?</i></p>
            <p>We have quite a few members who work night shifts but they make 
              their contributions during the day or in setting up the raid even 
              though they aren't there for the kill shot. We take that into account 
              and reward them as best we can when they are there when gear drops 
              for them.</p>
            <p>People who have RL events like sicknesses, dates whatever dont 
              get rewarded as much as the extremely consistent members but we 
              do try to spread gear around to everyone. Luckily our alliance with 
              DA allows us to have real lives and still be successful since we 
              have enough depth for some of us to be out and still succeed.</p>
            <p><i>Kwill: What are your guild's goals?</i></p>
            <p>Our guild/alliance is about doing more with less. We strive to 
              push ourselves to the edge and beyond. An example of what I'm talking 
              about is we recently had an 80 minute fight in Vex Thal with 40 
              people. At one point we had 15 mobs mezzed in camp, most of which 
              were splitters. Before we could get camp clear and move up, respawn 
              started and we got in a tight spot as we chain aggroed a boss mob 
              and had to advance through the zone fighting the remains of those 
              15 mobs, the boss and respawn as it continued. At the end we were 
              all drained but intensely proud that we had lived through it.</p>
            <p>While we certainly dont mind server firsts, we don't live for them 
              as some of our competition does. We find that it is rewarding to 
              get to an encounter at our own pace and under our own power instead 
              of making any concessions just to succeed. To us, making concessions 
              cheapens the game and robs us of the pride of success. If we fail 
              an encounter, we hit the boards, work out a new strategy as a team, 
              and apply it the next time until we prevail. While that sometimes 
              slows us down, in the end we often do the encounter itself quicker, 
              with less people and less deaths than the competition. I think we've 
              managed to keep pace with the rest of the pack while maintaining 
              our standards and that makes me happy.<br>
            </p>
