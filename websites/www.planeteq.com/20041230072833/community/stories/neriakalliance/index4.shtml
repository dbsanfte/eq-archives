              <i>by</i> Jack Holt <br>
              <br>
            </p>
            <span class="headline">Chapter 4 - Call To Arms</span> 
            <br><br>It took Dvinn two 
              days, but he found the land of the Crushbone Orcs-or more accurately, 
              the Orcs found him. A raiding party came across him in the darkness. 
              They were expecting him, and immediately took him through the pass 
              separating the Elven forest from the mountain stronghold the Orcs 
              called home.
            <br><br>It was surprisingly 
              small. Dvinn was also surprised at how neat it was. He had never 
              seen Orcs take pride in their appearance or their property. Additionally, 
              everything was well ordered. Regular patrols swept the land. Orc 
              slavers drove work parties of captive Elves, Gnomes, and Humans 
              from task to task. On a mountain in the middle of the stronghold 
              a trainer worked with the young Orcs to ready them for battle. A 
              mine, worked by slaves, provided a constant flow of treasure to 
              the Castle that occupied the northeast portion of the stronghold.
            <br><br>A deep, clear mountain 
              river surrounded the castle. Dvinn was taken across on a wooden 
              bridge and turned over to the guards at the entrance. These Orcs 
              were larger than the common Orcs and were designated as Legionnaires. 
              They took him inside the castle entrance where Dvinn finally saw 
              something he would have expected from Orcs. It was a fountain flowing 
              with blood. The Legionnaires explained with pride how victims were 
              regularly sacrificed, and their blood added to the fountain to keep 
              it flowing.
            <br><br>Dvinn then was led 
              into the throne room to meet King Crush. The Orc was huge, and hideous, 
              with the most extended fangs Dvinn had ever seen on one of his kind. 
              The throne he sat upon was carved from a single stone, and was 18 
              feet high. Flanking the throne were his Emissaries, Oracles, the 
              crown prince Lord Darish, and the king's Warlord. This last Orc 
              did not suppress at all his distaste for Dvinn. He glared at him, 
              and barely nodded when he was introduced.
            <br><br>Dvinn bowed slightly 
              before the king, and gave the communiqué to the King's Emissary. 
              The Emissary promptly opened it and read it to the king. Only then 
              did Dvinn understand why the Warlord hated him so. The king had 
              agreed with Neriak that the Dragoon would lead the Orcs in their 
              quest to destroy Kelethin.
            
            
            <br><br>
			<script type="text/javascript" src="http://ads.gamespyid.com/ad.aspx?S=planeteverquest&A1=NONE&G1=RPG&T=3&P2=0&A2=0&A3=300x250?unique"></script>
 
			A meal had been prepared, 
              and once again Dvinn was reminded that in spite of the unique things 
              he had observed earlier that these were still Orcs. They ate like 
              a pack of wolves pulling apart a rabbit. Rancid blood was drunk 
              freely, and the meal consisted of foul dead things-snakes, rats, 
              Gnomes, and even one of their own kind. The ambassador's meal was 
              provided by Elven slaves, and consisted of bread, honey, berries, 
              some venison, and wine. He ate it thinking all the while of how 
              glad he would be when he could return to Neriak.
            <br><br>After the meal the 
              Orcs slept through the afternoon. As darkness fell they rose, and 
              a meeting was called to complete the battle plans.
            <br><br>The overall plan was 
              simple. The Orcs of Crushbone were to attack Kelethin, and draw 
              the defenses towards Crushbone. Then the Neriak troops from Lesser 
              Faydark would attack the undefended side of the city and complete 
              its destruction by fire. The Orcs from Lesser Faydark would split 
              into three bands. One would stay in Lesser Faydark to block any 
              interference from the Gnomes. A second band would move to Felwithe 
              and engage its defenders in a diversionary attack. The final band 
              would march to cut off the Pass into Butcherblock so the Dwarves 
              could not interfere. As long as they could keep the Wood Elves, 
              High Elves, Dwarves, and Gnomes separated they could defeat each 
              in turn.
            <br><br>The challenge that 
              Dvinn, and "his" Orcs faced was not getting destroyed before the 
              trap was sprung. It was essential for them to pull away as many 
              of its defenders as possible; but they had to see to the security 
              of Crushbone until the Elves realized the nature of the trap and 
              fell back to defend the city.
            <br><br>An all out frontal 
              attack would not do, but the Orcs knew little else when it came 
              to battle. For several hours Dvinn argued for, and repeatedly explained 
              his battle plan. Half the Orcs would stage an attack on the Orc 
              Lift of the city, and then fall back through an ambush the rest 
              of the Orcs would set up along the way. The elves would be taken 
              by surprise. They would fight through the trap, but the time it 
              took would be more than enough for the Neriak Regulars to burn the 
              tree city to the ground.
            <br><br>Dvinn was not used 
              to having his authority questioned when he made a battle plan, but 
              the Orc Warlord was determined to save face and wrest control of 
              the battle from the ambassador. Dvinn tried to ignore it, and then 
              argued with him. He appealed to the king for a ruling, but the king 
              remained silent.
            <br><br>"We should not split 
              our force!" the Warlord said as he pounded the table. "The Elves 
              are too strong. And I will not turn my back to them and run!" The 
              other Orcs agreed with claps and whistles.
            <br><br>Dvinn had no choice. 
              He would have to assert his authority as if he were an Orc. He rose 
              on a pretense of refilling his cup of wine as the jeering died down.
            <br><br>"Hail, King Crush! 
              I will lead our troops in battle. This ambassador is a coward!"
            <br><br>It was the last words 
              the Warlord would ever speak. In a quick motion Dvinn buried his 
              dirk in the throat of the huge creature. He then seized his sword, 
              and hewed a great gash in its chest. Reaching in, he tore the still 
              beating heart from its chest and threw it on the ground at the king's 
              feet.
            <br><br>There was a moment 
              of total silence. The king's face then slowly drew back in a hideous 
              grin. "Brethren! We have a new Warlord!"
            <br><br>The Orcs cheered and 
              shouted in their foul language, and then descended as one on the 
              body of the former Warlord to devour it.
            <hr>
            <br><br>Niffun was surprised 
              when he awoke in a warm room in Kelethin instead of the forest where 
              he had lost consciousness. Maesyn Trueshot was leaning over him 
              and casting healing spells. Ahnog stood at the bottom of the bed 
              looking concerned, and then relieved when he saw the Halfling open 
              his eyes.
            <br><br>"Welcome back little 
              Niffun," Trueshot said softly and with affection.
            <br><br>"Indeed!" the Dwarf 
              bellowed.
            <br><br>"You are ok," Tureshot 
              said. "With a little rest and food you will be up and around in 
              a few hours."
            <br><br>"The Neriaks! The 
              Orcs! They are coming," Niffun blurted out as he struggled to rise. 
              The Ranger and the Dwarf pressed him back down.
            <br><br>"We know. Ahnog has 
              told us everything. While you were recovering we tracked the Neriak 
              you fought to Crushbone, and messengers have been sent to the High 
              Elves, the Gnomes, and the Dwarves. We are preparing for the assault 
              here. Everything will be fine."
            <br><br>"The Neriak is not 
              just any Neriak Master Trueshot! He is an ambassador and a Dragoon. 
              He resisted all my spells, and he's…"
            <br><br>"Yes, yes," the old 
              Ranger interrupted. "Ahnog has told us."
            <br><br>"The Stormguard will 
              defeat him, his cohorts, and the Orcs," Ahnog said.
            <br><br>"Maesyn, I let him 
              get away. I failed to the get the teleportation device."
            <br><br>"What more could you 
              have done? You survived and we have been warned. You are a hero 
              Niffun!"
            <br><br>"I don't feel like 
              one. I feel… I feel little."
            <br><br>"Nonsense!" Ahnog 
              snorted. "The size of a person is not measured by his stature but 
              by his heart. You took on the Dragoon alone and survived. Many giants 
              have fallen before them."
            <br><br>"I was foolish, and 
              I left you alone. I was wrong. Forgive me?"
            <br><br>"There is nothing 
              to forgive! You did the right thing."
            <br><br>"Thank you Ahnog for 
              saving my life."
            <br><br>"We are even now," 
              the Dwarf said with a smile.
            <br><br>Trueshot stood up. 
              "I need to go. There is much to be done to prepare for the battle. 
              Rest. We will need you."
