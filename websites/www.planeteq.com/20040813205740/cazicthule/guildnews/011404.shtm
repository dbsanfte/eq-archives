  to Mastix on Shouldarpads of the Visionary. We then took a leisurely stroll
  to PoD and slapped Grummus around didn't hang around for drops gratz to all
  that got something =p. Well after that what else could you want ? O.. yea seems
  Vindi, Statue and AoW were all due up as well, so we just couldn't resists
  the fun. After our defiling of the Temple of Rallos Zek, Engress walked away
  with a new cloak Cloak of the Falling Stars and a pair of Flayed Barbarian

              We took up a small group of adventures to pay a visit to our
                  old friend Auliffe. He had a nice layout, including 2 wands
                  of babba yagga (ok, I don't remember
    the name, nice caster wand, extended range IV and stuff). Grats to Duco and
    Khaymus on your nifty new wands. He also dropped a RUNE, which Gabbin won.
    Good luck with the turnin bro! <br>

    burrower beastly thing <br>

    The alliance of CoG and VdV marched down to the Deep and kicked some burrower
    buttocks in their latest adventure. We conquered the invisible bridge with
    some nice thinking on a few guildmate's parts and we beat the main nasty
    after cutting and casting through his 7 waves of kin. Grats to VDV on the
    good loot
    (since I rolled badly on the random heh) We now have a copy of Moonfire,
    Khuras focusing, a lvl 60 mage spell and something else for our effort. Grats
    to Crunchii
    on a Glowing orb of luclinite. Keep up the good work all, and thanks for
    the attendance!</p>            <p> <b><a href="http://www.crimsontalon.com" target="_top">Crimson

            Posted by: Chantress on Wednesday, January 14, 2004                         
            <p>So what has Crimson Talon been up to you ask? Let me tell you.</p>
            <p>In the past week or so we have done several things. We have killed
              several of the BOTT bosses and gotten upgrades for members. We
              have killed Manaetich Behemoth and gotten flags and upgrades for
              members. We have done the Burrower Beast ring event a couple of
              times and killed THO a couple of times as well. We have been very
              busy, and all getting our members better equipped so that we can
              handle whatever comes our way. The best part is, with the family
              style guild, and the hand-me-down loot system, upgrades for us
              have a good ripple effect! Grats to all those who have gotten upgrades
              recently!</p>
            <p>On a side note! Check out our message board and application section.
              We could use a few good members. If you think you are good enough
              to call yourself one of us, feel free to apply.</p>
            <p>On another note....Congratulations
                GISH! Gish has accumulated 500aa points! Absolutely amazing!</p>            <p>Grats Kyndyl on 65! <br>

  Kyndyl Dinged 65 today in a BB ldon adventure with Divyn, Altus, Missycat,
  Windsensai and I. Our little group was killin so fast some of us didnt even
  notice the fact till afterword. So guildie blindness aside give Kyndyl a grats
  and a 41% haste item. *wink*</p>
            <p><em><strong>Editors note: As a personal friend of Kyndyl, I want
                    to congratulate him as well! Kyndyl and I have been friends

              The deep was a very different place this evening after we were
              through. We did the burrower ring event to yield some nice items:
              Ancient Burrower Spine (Pizacatto), Bile Drenched Robe (Lumadin),
              and a Shard of Unfathomable Depths (Bianka). A few of us decided
              to remain to take on THO. With less than 24 people and only 2 clerics,
              we executed him with our usual solid tactics. We weren't dissapointed:
            Winterstorm (Hijinks), 2 Helm of Grim Blessings (Riverwake &amp; Tico).</p>
            <p>Dragu 65. Hic! <br>

              <br>
              Brewall has finished his map of Nedaria's Landing. Although this
              is a small zone and green to most of us in Crimson Talon, there
              may be more going on in this zone as the next expansion approaches.
              The map will be released to the general public next week. To obtain
              the map, go to the &quot;Brewall's Maps&quot; option under the &quot;CT
            Lore&quot; menu.</p>
            <p>Happy New Years.. Fay dies horribly! <br>

              Greetings and Salutations fellow CTers. Happy New Years to all.</p>
            <p>Assemblying quickly into groups than into raid, CT formed the
              Faydedar Must Die death squad! We quickly offed this gimp fish
              and helped Xendria get her final piece for her epic! Yes, Fay gave
              it up faster than River at a raid. Quickly thereafter, another
              druid epic was added to the CT roster. Congratulations to Xendria
              on her new leafblower. Well deserved.</p>
            <p>I would like to add a personal note and wish all of Crimson Talon
              a Happy New Year and the best for 2004. Many happy days and memories
            for you all I hope.</p>
            <p>Happy Birthday, Guild <br>
              Posted by: Altus on Monday, December 29, 2003<br>
              <br>
              A while ago, a few people decided to engage in the electronic equivalent
              of wearing an &quot;I'm with stupid ==&gt;&quot; t-shirt and formed
              a guild. It is with more than a little sense of amazement that
            I realize that the guild is now four years old.</p>
            <p>I normally save my ramblings for the privacy of our members forum
              because those people have to listen to me. Four years does not
              seem like such a long time to me anymore. It seems like just yesterday
              that we were waiting for the world to end in an orgiastic meltdown
              of silicon wafers and ATM cards when the clock struck the doom
              of Y2k. And we were Livin' La Vida Loca, or at least Ricky Martin
              was. What ever happened to him, anyway? Is he off living somewhere
              with Dexy's Midnight Runners, pondering a comeback?</p>
            <p>But, I digress.</p>
            <p>Four years ago does not seem like very long ago in some ways,
              but in other ways it does. All the while, we have spent more days
              together than days apart. That time, and the relationships with
              those who spent it with us, is the only lasting value I see in
              an experience like this.</p>
            <p>To all those who have truly been a part
                of our guild experience, and all the others who have made this
                ride a fun one, thank you.</p>

              Submitted by Fairsong on 01/05/03... Our little family has grown
              very quickly in the past 30 days. We have merged with many members
              of Clan Wolf in Exile and Legion of Nox. With these great additions
              we have begun to work very hard on getting everyone flagged for
              as many PoP planes as we can. Now on to the juicy details </p>
            <p>Arhok our lovable bard completed his Epic this weeked so grats
              are in order to him. He found out the Undead Bard was up so we
              rumbled down into Trakk and smoked him along with the Trakk respwan
              in a flawless victory. Grats to Mindaarie on her new Donals BP.</p>

            <p>The above image shows just a partial list of the nice pull we
              had in SSRA. I set a personal best for damage with one nuke. I
              managed to throw out over 17k of damage in one shot, as I stepped
              up like some crazed fanatic. Of course of the impending beat down
              happened so fast my life bar never even reached 0%. Still we managed
              a dozen shards and a couple of Bane weapons in a nights work.</p>
            <p>Slipped into Velks last night after helping a friend kill Ixi
              B. in burning woods. Aliciarose picked all her needed threads for
              her shawl quest. Grats to her and good luck on that most tedious
            quest.</p>
            <p>The new year is off to a flying start and it looks to be
                one of the best years yet for our little family of adventurers.

            <p>This has been a massively hectic week for backflagging to ensure
              that all our guildies can join in the fun in elementals.<br>
              Another almost flawless Berty kill. Couple of Rallos with Relentless.
              Saryrn and KoS, VZ, Grummus, AD, all three HOH trials, Agnarr you
              name it, this week weve killed it. At one point there wasnt a single
              flag mob up anywhere on the server for 2 days. Hmm, what to kill
            next... </p>

    No news this time.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Hellions</strong></a><br>
            Members of the Cazic Thule server,<br>
            <br>
            It is with a heavy heart that I bring you news of another long-standing
            guild disbanding.<br>
            Hellions which has been home to more then 600 players in 2 years
            on the CT Server decided as of Jan, 12, 2004 to disband its roster
            to the corners of the server.<br>
            <br>
            As founder and former leader I am saddened to see the Hellions follow
            the path of so many prior to it, Legion of Nox, Tuatha de Sgalain,
            Viking Lords, Pale Riders, Seventh Sword, Project Eon, to name a
            few of the countless. Yet, I am heartened when I remember its great
            achievements.<br>
            <br>
            Had it not been for the inception of Hellions, many of the players
            on Cazic Thule would likely not have progressed as they have. From
            the countless completed epics, to the barrage of Coldain Prayer Shawls,
            to the raid loot from many different places we have seen. The members
            of Hellions have indeed benefited from they're well earned membership.<br>
            <br>
            Some of you may ask why we have decided this course. The answer is
            not simply stated. Though we have many achievements, Hellions has
            been plagued by turbulence nearly since its founding day. We have
            had 6 different guild leaders, 200 of its members leaving for the
            creation of the guild House of Ancients, and many other trials.<br>
            <br>
            To the leadership of the guild, the trials have become exhausting.
            We learned that in order for our guild to have a rebirth for its
            members of any sort, we would have to close this chapter first. And
            as of this day my friends, the chapter has been closed. Forever.<br>
            <br>
            In ending I wish the members of the guild the very best in the days
            ahead in the game. To the heart and soul of the guild, Dejose, Keagedon,
            Manaderf, Abbi, Cailen, Xondio, Dwerfish, Celestiant, any guild who
            tags you in the future has gained a member with the worth ten times
            their over.<br>
            <br>
            As for me.... The time of Eadric Highroad is ending as well.... The
            war wizard of Cazic Thule tires and needs a long rest before he wields
            his magics again. No, not death.... Just a long rest.... And his
            own rebirth as well. To shed the weight of the difficult decisions
            and sad days I have witnessed. This day brings the birth of a new
            character, one in which the identity and legacy of Highroad will
            not be intertwined and will forever remain secret to all but a select
            few. Until the say comes again when my other characters are near
            my own levels and I will again wield their magic at their side.<br>
            <br>
            Thank you for your ear Cazic Thule.<br>
            <br>
            Eadric Highroad<br>
            Founder and Proud member of Hellions<br>

              Well as I told you guys previously, we had a little Relentless
                Fantasy Football league. When I say little of course I am lying.
                We had 16 teams trying to oust last year's champion Thornsong.</p>
            <p>Some of you may know some of the participants, but here are some
              of the players:</p>
            <p>Assassin Solknar Kenji Remyth Iuvas Dorrin Ghoat Ragathor Thornsong
              Valde Sarjent Duran/Zaero Vigro Taosen.</p>
            <p>The Semi-finals broke dow as Dorrin vs Thornsong and Ghoat vs
              Assassin.</p>
            <p>In the final Relentless Fantasy Bowl - Dorrin, aka Lucky Ranger
              that rode Jamal Lewis to the win, soundly defeated Assassin!</p>
            <p>Congratulations Dorrin! The check is in the mail!</p>

            <p>News: My first rant at Verant! <br>
  posted on 01-06-2004 12:09 AM by Thornsong </p>
            <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
              I have never done this before as I am usually pretty happy just
                sending /feedback when I have ideas or thoughts in the game and
                I know I do not have the witticism of a Tigole, the leetspeak
                of a Furor or the audience of a Thott.</p>
            <p>But tonight my guild did Xegony and it went as easy as pie although
              we had not touched the woman in a few months. A couple weeks ago,
              out of sheer boredom, and cause I promised our bards we would do
              it again, we did the spider island in Air (to no avail of the bard
              weapon) and squeaked through with a victory.</p>
            <p>It got me to thinking. How many encounters does Verant screw up
              and make the end mob a let down? It amazed me how many instantly
              popped into my head. Aten Ha Ra was a joke if you could actually
              get into VT and then go through the mind-numbing clear. After struggling
              through Rallos Zek, you move onto his counterpart in Solusek Ro.
              He is a pushover in comparison. And after you struggle through
              that spider island crap to get your Xegony key, Xegony herself
              is a letdown. Get the Rathe council down to run into the badboy
              Earth Avatar (NOT!). Then you get to Time and Quarm is silly easy
              compared to the gods before him.</p>
            <p>Can you please not repeat this theme in the next expansion? Take
              your baddest, meanest mob and stick him at the END of the expansion,
              not smack dab in the middle.</p>
            <p>While I am ranting, can you please FIX LDON raids. In every other
              raid format, when someone has to go or shows up late you can add
              them. In LDON raids, a person signs on 5 min after you start and
              you tell them to go experience for the next four hours. Their night
              is shot. I am perfectly ok with limiting raid sizes, but make those
              flexible cause we play a game, live all over the world, people
              come and go and it makes LDON raids the total suck when you cannot
              include people or your main tank has to log because of an emergency
              and you got four tanks outside who could sub in for him but can't
              cause they are in the wrong time zone.</p>
            <p>Enough ranting, I must add that I enjoy your game and still get
              a lot of enjoyment out of it. If you can continue with endgame
              content, I am sure The Relentless will be around for years. If
              not, or you continue with blunders like this farce with raids in
            LDON, your game will change from Evercrack to Everyawn. </p>

              Far better it is to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs,

              poor spirits who neither enjoy much nor suffer much, because they

            <p>Since the scheduled guild decided to pass on the Plane of Time
              tonight, we decided to give it a shot knowing we only had one day
              to do it. Seven hours and 10 min and 46 loots later, we walked
              out of Time with a server-first one-day time clear and a great
              start to the new year.</p>
