              We are all very thankful as a guild to be made up of players that 
              like to play EQ as a game and treat each other like family. As we 
              have progressively climbed up the encounter difficulty ladder, we 
              remember where we came from and how long we have played together. 
              Cherishing our friendship, we stay together, and look forward to 
              the next new encounter and challenge. In just the last month, we 
              have taken on and killed: The Statue of Rallos Zek, the Avatar of 
              War, Aaryonar, and the 10th coldain ring war. NToV and other new 
              encounters are coming up as well. Next!

              An epic day today as a few groups were able to slay long-outstanding 
              mobs that have a horrible habit of never dropping their epic items. 
              Sabretta was able to obtain the Essense from the Ashenbone Drake 
              in hate, the hand of maestro for Dakatsu, and a Magi kill for Fluteria. 
              After countless empty kills, they all managed to drop what we were 
              looking for! </p>
            <p>Mar 12, 2003<br>
              We made a raid into VP again this evening after tearing it up the 
              last three weeks. It seems the zone was bugged though with a few 
              things that made it virtually impossible to move into the zone. 
              Chanters could not mez or charm ANY mob in the zone (huge nerf to 
              enchanters if this was intentional) and there were numerous mobs 
              with absolutely insane regen. Regen on some mobs was so high you 
              could beat on it and see its health ticking back up after a wizard 
              nuke that would barely dent it. In the end, we took our fustrations 
              out on another zone...</p>
            <p>Mar 11, 2003<br>
              Another successful joint raid with OC on the Avatar of War and his 
              henchmen. Drops were very generous: Chestplate of Vindication [Tigerbane], 
              Hammer of Battle [Kynlore], Reaver [Tico], Iron Scroll of War [Kridak], 
              Blade of Carnage [Cmgal], Helm of Rallos Zek [Trast]. After that, 
              we went on to kill Sontalak for our very first time and took him 
              down flawlessly: Sontalak's Talisman [Tigersbane], Circlet of Silver 
              Skies [Justan], Rekelos War Sword [Dexuran], and numerous spell 
              drops. The West ToV dragons fell shortly after that.</p>
            <p>Mar 10, 2003<br>
              Eigth shawl quest for Skylynn this evening. Protected the General 
              and Skylynn is now the proud owner of the 8th Coldain shawl congrats!</p>
            <p>Mar 09, 2003<br>
              PoI factory raid which was followed up with finishing the 8th shawl 
              for Brewall. Probably one of the few bards that has this item and 
              this may have spurned all the casters into finishing it as well.</p>
            <p>Mar 08, 2003<br>
              Off to kill the Avatar of War again, and we weren't disappointed. 
              Another flawless kill resulting in: Flayed Barbarian Hide Leggings 
              [Ashant, Wynndy], Flayed Barbarian Hide Mask [Kitpoke], and a Helmet 
              of Ralos Zek [Kynlore].</p>
            <p>Mar 07, 2003<br>
              We stormed into Fear with our friends in OC to kill Cazic Thule. 
              After clearing the zone, we sent our bards out to pull him into 
              our trap netting us: Groteque Girdle [Zionmaster], Crimson Robe 
              of Aledine [Satashi], Pauldrons of Ferocity [Shinlae], Cloak of 
              the Fearsome [Bruize], and a Bile Etched Obsidian Choker [Riverwake].</p>
            <p>We also killed the Kael statue with loots of: Breastplate of Eradication 
              [Kilwean], Shard of Hsaga's Talisman [Chiun], Cloak of Falling Stars 
              [Jonasin], and 2 Reavers.</p>
            <p>Tormax also fell to us for a first time kill! Drops were: Shard 
              of Hsaga's Talisman [Tico], King Tormax's Head, and 4 count'em 4 
              White Dragon Scale Sashes [Tribul, Bimie, Kandye, and Fayluna].</p>
            <p>Mar 6, 2003<br>
              Ringwar! Tonight, the forces of CT and OC combined to fight our 
              first tenth coldain ringwar. Fenik turned in the orders and the 
              war was on. Lasting just a tad over two hours, we slayed wave after 
              wave of giants. In the end, our forces prevailed and we reveled 
              in our victory over the giants. All of the coldain heros were kept 
              safe, adding to our loot bounty. Grats to Fenik on the ring and 
              to OC for the lance and crown.<br>

            <p>Do you fear the night? - Trucari (3/4/2003 7:30 PM) <br>
              <br>
              My eyes wandered down my body grasping what had just happened. As 
              my gaze lingered on my feet my body shuddered in trepidation. I 
              contemplated the future. The transvergance gave no rush of power. 
              I stepped out.</p>
            <p>The clouded chambed that ate light lay behind me. The fields lay 
              before me. The future lay in front of me. My minds eye saw the battles 
              that would be waged and the forces that were against me. As time 
              flowed, the sun crested over the far away peaks of the mountains 
              and the light shocked me from my reverie. The night had passed but 
              it's time was not done.</p>
            <p>As my forces gathered to once again be sent out to do battle. To 
              conquer the world of mortals and assail the bastions of the gods 
              they noticed their officer was changed. As they noticed the insignia 
              branded on his chest marking him as their leader their visages were 
              sprayed with a myriad of expressions. Outrage quickly checked, fear 
              disguised as suprise, and pain, above all pain as waves of nostalgia 
              crashed over them and they knew things must be different.</p>
            <p>The temple that had been cloaked in eternal darkness was now lit 
              with the light of a new dawn. &quot;He has gone to reside in the 
              shadows and now I will command our forces.&quot; They nodded in 
              silent assent, the shock fading, determination replaceing it.</p>
            <p>&quot;How do we fare?&quot; I questioned. &quot;The night treated 
              us well but with the dawn the new forces have arrived and we are 
              now ready to assault the planes of our gods.&quot; &quot;Good&quot;, 
              I challenged, &quot;Soon we will test ourselves against the most 
              powerful of deities even if it means we must stop the flow of time.&quot;</p>
            <p>Silence descended on the gathering. Hesitation tempered everyones 
              mood.</p>
            <p>&quot;Do you fear the night?&quot; The question floated from the 
              back. &quot;No,&quot; I replied, &quot;the darkness cloaks the power 
              that is lurking in the shadows.&quot;<br>

              Roleplay Version - ShadeStorm (3/4/2003 5:30 PM) <br>
              <br>
              As the servant walked down the dimly lit hallway, the cool breeze 
              from the window was making the candles dance and creating surrealistic 
              shadows around the chamber. In the middle of the room was the throne 
              of his master who he has served for countless years, just staring 
              at the shadows. Sire, I have the latest battle news from the frontline. 
              Let me see that, the deep yet soft voice said, and as he gave the 
              letter to his master, a cold chill once again raised from his spine 
              and he knew the master was once again figuring what to do. Master, 
              what is it? You seem pre occupied with something. The master peered 
              down from the notes and information and said do you truly wish to 
              know what is going on? </p>
            <p>The servant glazed into the deep dark eyes, those pure black eyes 
              that no light could ever penetrate within, and stuttered meekly, 
              yes master&#133;what is on your mind? Very well the master said 
              softly but still each word chilled the servant as it always did. 
              The master got up and moved to the center of the chamber and started 
              to concentrate. An image fell upon the middle of the room and the 
              servant looked at the image thoroughly, seeing all the worlds the 
              master and him traveled, the wars, the killing, the bloodshed, the 
              coldness, the shadows and castles that were built. We have traveled 
              worlds destroying all that lies between us. We have never changed 
              our course when we started and the armies we commanded followed 
              us without questioning the reasons. When we came to this world, 
              many leaders of various tribes tried to kill me, and my armies and 
              they all failed because they never understood what they were facing. 
            </p>
            <p>The master looked at the servant and said, as you know, we traveled 
              the worlds. We have seen everything, watching these mortals fight 
              among each other never being able to kill each other, always in 
              a constant state of war but war of what? They never reach their 
              goal. We then became involved because we wanted to created death 
              and destruction. We killed several of the leaders, and the others 
              weren&#146;t ready for this and they tried to study us. They tried 
              to use the strategies we placed, but because they have mortal minds, 
              they have mortal capacities of understanding. They tried to do the 
              same and even some were bold enough to try to come after myself, 
              yet they were fighting a losing battle as I have been doing this 
              for eons where they just started. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>As the pink skin mortal entered the room, the master walks up to 
              him his face still impossible to see. Did you finish the last test 
              I had for you? The master said. Yes, I did the high elf said. Good, 
              good, everything going fine with it? We are integrating the armies 
              now, and getting used to each other. Very good the master said softly 
              and coldly. Its now time to make sure your command cannot be questioned 
              by anybody the master said with a cold voice. I hereby now make 
              you leader of the armies of the element of darkness. Go forth and 
              keep my legacy strong. </p>
            <p>As the high elf leaves, the servant goes&#133;.master I don&#146;t 
              wish to question your motives but why? The master looked at him 
              with those dark eyes. We shall watch from the hillsides and mountains, 
              we shall still be part of the process, just not the one leading 
              it anymore. But he&#146;s young, and not truly battle tested, why 
              him? He shows the greatest promise of the commanders I brought into 
              the fold. </p>
            <p>And what of us master? The servant said. The master stares out 
              to the clash of battle and the cold breeze and softly says&#133;.I 
              am ShadeStorm ShadowMaster, from the plane of shadows, master of 
              the shadows, and we shall be around watching and fighting alongside 
              the armies we made. We shall always continue to be part of the events 
              as we always have been, just now we will be more where we need to 
              be, in the shadows. The light hurts my eyes anyways, now we will 
              finally be back to being in the shadows. </p>

              Stepping down as GM - ShadeStorm (3/4/2003 5:20 PM) <br>
              <br>
              Yes its time for this Gm to finally step down and allow a new one 
              to take the cup. I have seen it all and done it all basically. </p>
            <p>My in game resume is as some would say is quite impressive and 
              I have been an officer/gm for over 13 years. There is really nothing 
              I haven&#146;t seen or anybody truly trying to think they could 
              pull one over on me. <br>

              &quot;Blimey...jus have a look there at that HUHHHGE Croc. It's 
              gotta be at least 100 feet long, and teeth sharp as a razor! One 
              false move for me and it's an all expense paid trip to Freeport. 
              Watch carefully now as I go introduce myself&quot;</p>
            <p>Well, I guess that's kinda what it would be like if Steve Erwin 
              played EQ. At any rate Vanessa Snaggletoof, the giant croc in PoEarth 
              went down last night. </p>

              It started out as most days do. The call went out, mini's were up 
              and we needed to change that. After dropping a few baddies in Fire 
              we moved our efforts to Earth where we continued our search for 
              the Lord of the Rings </p>
            <p>However somehow we managed to lose the giant croc...not lose to, 
              like lose my car keys. How we managed to lose a 100 foot long crocodile 
              is beyond me, to quote the infamous Bricktop &quot;It's not as if 
              it's a packet of peanuts now is it?&quot;.</p>
            <p>After a number of rings we decided to call it a night and get a 
              little xp in. About 10 minutes later that idea was scrapped due 
              to the apperence of more PoFire mini's. Dawneyes, General, the Archmage, 
              and Blazzax all got owned promptly by a late night skeleton crew 
              of 39 with some of the 39 2-boxed.<br>

              February closed as a great month for the Relentless. Into the elementals 
              we are, and we pulled down more than 300 loots for the guild this 
              month alone, including 96 pieces of elemental armor. That's a good 
              step, but still aways to go.</p>
            <p>While we hoped to have Fennin Ro dead by the end of the month, 
              we know we are close and expect to have him dead for sure by the 
              end of March. I wouldn't be suprised if he dies in our next facing 
              off. <br>

              We heard those astronauts on the international space station hadn't 
              gotten a phat lewt in like months, so we tried to send them a few. 
              Our booster was a little shy on thrust, but I feel confident you 
              will see us pop one of these bad boys into orbit for them RSN. Oh, 
              and yes, you astronaut guys CAN trade in the spy photos of the &quot;Friends&quot; 
              cast for DKP to buy the lewtz. Welcome to the Family, &quot;SS Astro's&quot;!</p>
            <p>So, what have we been up to? Basically learning the different encounters 
              in the planes. Haven't quite explored it all yet, but we're having 
              a blast seeing new stuff. Took our first look at this fellow today....<br>

              Was a real blast moving up to this guy, seeing named mobs we had 
              no clue about, pulling them to us and dropping each in one try. 
              Until we got to Fenin. Ok, he's a bit tougher, but we had a fun 
              time sittin on the bench and playin with the pencils and we will 
              be back real soon....<br>

            <p> Sunday, March 2, 2003 - A Little More Bite And A Little Less Bark... 
              <br>
              Posted by: [Kyrthor] on March 3rd, 2003 @ 08:52 AM</p>
            <p>So....we dropped Bubba a while back and what did we do? That's 
              right folks....backflag. We've been tearin through every flag encounter 
              makin sure everone gets to play when we turn to the elemental planes 
              in force. It took a while and was a little boring, but nobody wants 
              to leave a friend behind, so it's what ya gotta do.</p>
            <p>So we came into the weekend only needing a few things to be essentially 
              done with flagging and turn our attention to the elemental planes 
              in force and figuring out how to get into Time. So we rested ourselves 
              nicely on Saturday and sat down to work today to get it done.</p>
            <p>First up...</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p><img src="Rallos2FS.jpg" width="520" height="390"><br>
              That's right...our friend Bubba. We lined him up this morning with 
              71 folks and raced through everything nicely only to have the wheel 
              fall off in the arena. Obviously, we were being punished by the 
              gods for zerging. So we tried again with 68 and had a run for the 
              ages. Tallon Zek - clean as a whiste. Vallon Zek - we lose 50% of 
              our force to LD DURING the fight and we still punked him. Rallos 
              Zek - well....ol Bubba rolled over and showed us his belly. With 
              less folks than we had originally, we killed him cleaner than we 
              did...losing only a handful of folks during and after (and oh, how 
              easy it is to die after). If only the stupid yaya would die OUTSIDE 
              a damn wall so I can get a decent screenshot.</p>
            <p>Anyway, with Rallos dead and our whole alliance ready for MOST 
              of the elemental planes....we just needed one fellow....</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p><br>
              First time we ever even looked at this guy....what a yawner. I would 
              write something exciting about him, but he wasn't.</p>
            <p>So now the full expanse of the elemental planes are open to us, 
              time to have some fun!</p>
            <p><br>
