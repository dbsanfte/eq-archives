            <p> COG took a force of 17 in to tackle one Grieg Veneficus. After
              a bit of trouble on the first run, COG recovered and took him down
              with out having a single Chanter, BL, Bard, OR Druid in the house.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Grats to all Lootz Winnerz<br>
            Drift'in on some nice FT3 gloves, Bizull on a Cuirass and someone
              got a Glowing Orb of Luclinite and I think some other stuff...
              so if
              I missed you, drop me a note
            and I will add it :)</p>
            <p> A special thanks goes out to Crestess for comming to help after
            the first try :)</p>
            <p> Great work COG !!</p>

  A CoG lead pick up raid last night dropped Eindride Icestorm like a bad habit.
  Lead by Naezariit the battle cleric we stormed the towers in record time and
  netted two ornate BP's for CoG and a rune for an invite. We only had one fatality
  which was due to Naez's heal being interrupted by the swinging of his hammer.</p>

                Murphy's LAW <br>
                Posted by Loadan On Mar 28 2004 At 10:14:12 AM <br>
  Well, CoG found out that Murphy's Law is alive and well in EverQuest last night!</p>
            <p>We went to the BoT towers to take out some boss mob (visions of
              taking ALL 4 out in a night were in my head at least). We mobolized
              very quickly (great job), got up there, and thats when Murphy's
              Law kicked in. Somehow, we got a boatload of giants on the second
              level of Auliffe's tower, and wiped out. Quick thinking and a timely
              invis for Khalimari (thanks to Everyedy/Woodyelf) and we got rezz'd
              up there, and continued on. Long (LONG) story short, we finally
              got all up there and took that punk out, but not until after his
              tower caused us every possible problem it could. Grats to Engress
              on his new beat stick, and Adorah on her new wand! Spriggan got
              a spec, and I got a ring to combine my agnarr key with.</p>
            <p>The second tower we tried was a &quot;harder&quot; tower, but
              we went through it flawlessly. Kuanbyr died quickly after we seperated
              and killed his guard (another great pulling performance), and Sharkan
              got a brand new pig sticker and Rhatzazz got a nifty new ring for
              our troubles. I got the fungus clumps on that one (woot)..<br>
            </p>
            <p>            Great
              job sticking with it, we showed a lot of tenacity in some pretty
              ususual circumstances up there! Good show!!</p>            <p> <b><a href="http://www.crimsontalon.com" target="_top">Crimson

              The Crimson Talon has entered the Tower of Solusek Ro! With the
              excellent leadership we've become accustomed to, Lord Mithaniel
              Marr fell before us on our first attempt ever. Altus had to crack
              the whip a few times, but in the end we were victorious. Over 70
              CT were online for the fantastic event of which I was proud to
              be a part of. More people died getting to him than actually died
              during the fight. Unfortunately a few guildies had to sit the fight
              out and wait for another day. We are grateful to those flagged
              apps / guests who helped beef up the 85% access. Congratulations
              to Fluteria on her new Gemstone Choker &amp; grats to Perpetuary
              on his new Bow of Contortion.</p>
            <p>In the past couple weeks, CT has had its first Saryrn kill (2nd
              attempt), first Agnarr kill (4th attempt &amp; 1st 2 were bugged),
              and first MM kill (1st attempt ever). We also killed TZ on our
              first in house try, and killed VZ twice after only failing the
              first attempt due to an unexpected train. In addition to that,
              CT has done a lot of backflagging and will be doing more.<br>
              <br>
              Only RZ
              stands in our way of becoming an Elemental guild. Can a god sweat?

            <p>Lord Mithaniel Marr Falls Under the Might of CT <br>
              Posted by: TidyKat on Tuesday, April 13, 2004 - 07:51 AM (2 Reads) <br>
              <br>
  After a bit of a frustrating night of sorting out flags, and arranging a proper
  raid to 85% a few folks in, we had a nicely rounded raid ready to pummel the
  loyal servants of Lord Mithaniel. But alas, they were no match for us as we
  marched onward with their corpses in our wake. Onward ho, we marched, to the
  room of the Lord himself, only to be confronted by 3 rather unhospitable guards,
  all of which we dispatched only to send Mithaniel into a rage wishing our demise.
  However, he was not prepared for us, and we gave him a beating of a lifetime!
  First attempt upon Lord Mithaniel Marr, and a very successful one at that!Congratulations
  to Fluteria on a brand new Gemstone Choker and to Perpetuary on a shiny new
  Bow of Contortion. I believe that places 5 people into the elements to research
  future targets, and a truckload of us are now capable of entering the Tower
  of Solusek Ro! He know's we're coming, and he know's he shall fall under our
  might as have many others! All that blocks our path now is Rallos Zek the Warlord!
  Soon he too shall taste the steel of Crimson Talon!<br>

  Another One Bites the Dust!
  Agnarr Bows Out! Posted by: Thespis on Thursday, April 08, 2004 - 11:48 PM
  (5 Reads) <br>
              <br>
              Well, we tried Agnarr the Stormlord twice while the encounter was
              still bugged and did not get very far. After the encounter and
              portal destruction was fixed, we tried him once and got to Agnarr
              but messed up the final portal process and got all spread out with
              a lot of deaths fast. However, this time on the final wave to face
              Agnarr, the wizzies destroyed every single portal before a single
              add spawned. The kiters did a fantastic job with Agnarr and the
              minis. There were a few deaths spread around, but in the end, the
              minis and Agnarr fell one by one to the Crimson Talon. The talon
              claw grip is tightening and surging with power! Congratulations
              to Udian on Longbow of the Stormcaller. Grats to Romell on Stormriders
            Gauntlets.</p>
            <p>Only Lord Mithaniel Marr and Rallos Zek the Warlord respectively
              stand blocking our way to the Tower of Solusek Ro and the Plane
              of Earth, Air, and Water. The power growth of CT is quickly going
              from a steady but slow hum to a rising roar. We're banging on the
              Tier 4 planes' door.<br>

              Backflagging <br>

              With 2 more solid nights of backflagging under our belt, we are
              getting closer to having all of our members caught up on flags.
              Aerin`Dar fell to our forces the night before last, and we quickly
              dispatched the horde that was trying to get to the girl in HoH
              trial 2 last night. Rydda`Dar thought he had a thing or two for
              us but we showed him that he was just another corpse laying on
              the floor at the end of the night. Good job to all and grats on
              your new shiny toys and best of all more flags! <br>

The past 30 days have been a blast. We have picked up a few more people who have
added some more sick dark twisted humor into the mix as well as some fun events.
The borg collective continues to grow as Ligoris returned to our ranks and Muabdib
joined us recently as well. Every night now we find ourselves knee deep in innards,
gristle, sinew and blood.<br>
<br>
We have been dropping this mounted wonder now on a regular basis and have picked
up a couple of those shoulders as well as his heart on a few occasions. Grats
to Charlibroue, who also returned from a long time away from the game, on his
new shoulders and Aliciarose on her new book.</p>

              Ole Zug here has been chugging along and grinding exp like a
                prisoner busting rocks. We keep him up all night and day doing
                it.</p>
            <p>Congrats to Tatalis for completing his shammy epic. Of course
                he had to sacrefice himself like all good shammies do. Was a
                good fight and great turn out and Gwendan managed to pick up
                a Jade Reaver on the way in so one half of his ranger epic is
                done.</p>

            <p>Grats to Rathiss on completing his monk epic. I dont have a
                picture of it as yet but as soon as we do it will get posted
                for all to marvel and oggle upon.</p>
              <p>To wrap up our news we did a double take down of Rumblecrush
                and Doomshade last week. Always a fun event and the loots were
                pretty nice as well. Grats to Katslayer on his new haste item
                and we finally got a bp to fit our very own princess Leia dwarfkin
                version. Grats.</p>

  DoKR is entering its 4th year of existence as a guild on the Cazic Thule server.
    In 2001 a small group of friends started the guild so we could easily chat
    and enjoy each others company. The goal of the guild was to provide a forum
    for friendship not to be the biggest or baddest in the game. We chose a name
    that poked fun at the notition of being UBBA and picked one of the most obscure
    places in the game that nobody goes to.<br>
  As it happened we finally came together in our first ever lan style party.
  It started out as a 1 day event and turned into a 3 day weekend affair with
  members coming from Florida, Tennessee, Ohio and Canada. The MO for the weekend
  was no sleep, lost of alcohol, some EQ playing and a ton of jokes, teasing,
  and laughter. Sslanis and Eraserd returned to the guild from their retirements
  from the game. They were original charter members who helped to grow this guild
  from day one. Trinady, the RL wife of Eraserd, also came back to us from her
  retirement as well. She joined the guild less than a month after its creation.
  Kithov also rejoined us as we had need of someone to feed and water the Kerrans
  and he wanted to see if the grass was greenier on Kerra Ridge (/pokes).</p>

                places we hunted in to haunt on saturday for our lan party adventure.
                Plane of Hate hosted us for a few hours as we simply slaughtered
                many beers and mobs while rehashing old tales and new ones. We
                then decided to move over to Cazic Thule where many of us spent
                weeks leveling up through the 20s. We then decided to hit PoN
                to finish off the night with one of the newer zones clearing
                out the mephit cave in a quasi crawl event. </p>

              <p>The weekend was an awesome time for everyone who came and for
                those who didnt make they were entertained im sure by our off
                color guild chat as well as the pictures and web cams. <br>

    Busy few days! (submitted by Catabrie Fatewielder at 10:02am BST)</p>
              <p>We had our first full evening in PoFire recently and killed
                7 bosses. Criare, Jaxolis, Pyronis, Magmaton, Babnoxxis,Blazzaz,
                Druav and got Quavonis to 7% on our first attempt ever. Not bad
                at all for 4 hours work :)<br>
                Pofire = the new VT /cheer. Loot heaven.<br>
                So as not to over endulge ourselves on this and get bored of
                it we've also done quite a few POE ring events and got a few
                nice bits from there and also started work on Xegony keys. So
                much to do and so little time... <br>

              <p>The picture below shows all that remains of Rallos Zek. The
                cheeky SoB thought he had evaded Exhumed with a couple of very
                close shaves. This time we were closer than Remmington...and
                we lopped has head off!!<br>
                This mob finished off a lot of peoples elemental access and took
                another 23 people all the way into PoFire too. 98% of the guild
                are now flagged for PoFire....WOOT!</p>

                head above water and Ill Bred as one, has snagged 3 parchments
                and is currently waiting for 1 last turn in before the big epic
                turn in. It was costly, being taken down twice and being saved
                by the &#8220;Ladder from Hell&#8221; Special thanks to Yalc,
                Sanru, and Chirl for not leaving him stuck in the ladder....and

              <p>Do GM's Really exist ??</p>
              <p>Ever since that danged dwarf ate my shawl this question has
                been plaguing me along with the rest of Norrath. After over a
                week of extensive research I believe that I can solve this dilemma.</p>
              <p>GM sightings abound in Norrath but all seem to be a story heard
                from a friend of a friend with no reliable witnesses stepping
                forward with comprehensive proof of their existence. Doctored
                screenshots aside there is infact nothing to prove that GM's
                are more then an empty platitude to placate the EQ masses. </p>
              <p>So a week ago when my shawl was unfairly eaten I set out to
                find these so called GM's in the hopes that in the issue of justice
                they would give me the shawl I have earned. Despite checking
                atleast twice every 12 hours I have never seen a GM and due to
                this I am forced to conclude that GM's are nothing but a folk
                tale spread by SoE. </p>
              <p>I am sorry to ruin the delusions of those who believed in these
                miraculous creatures and won't tell you my conclusions on Faeries
                or the Easter Bunny. </p>
              <p>OH BTW - Grats Eil and Loki!!<br>

              Our adventure started out quite uneventful. Elvair, Galar, Cerrasu,
              Moriah and I all hitched the Griffon from Stormwind to Ironforge
              and then from there to Refugee Point. Our goal? To seek out new
              and exciting places to explore and conquer. Unfortunately our first
              stop at Stormgarde caused quite a few deaths as we werent able
              to reliably pull the L36+ mobs solo and they pack a real punch.
              Several deaths later we realized we just werent able to hit the
              mobs often enough because of the level differential.<br>
