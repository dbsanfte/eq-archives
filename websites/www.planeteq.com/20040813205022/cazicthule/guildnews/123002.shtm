              Christmas Pants <br>
              <br>
              Posted by: Druss on Tuesday, December 24th, 2002 @ 11:13 AM<br>
            </p>
            <p>The one present Roy Collette wasn't looking forward to getting 
              for Christmas 1988 was those damned pants. Yet he knew he was in 
              trouble as soon as the flatbed truck bearing a concrete-filled tank 
              off a truck used to deliver ready-mix rolled up. Sure as God made 
              little green apples, those pants had to be in there. And he was 
              going to have to fish them out, else declare his brother-in-law 
              the winner of a rivalry that had spanned 20 years. </p>
            <p>Being the sport he is, brother-in-law Larry Kunkel thoughtfully 
              supplied the services of a crane to hoist the concrete-filled tank 
              off the flatbed. </p>
            <p>What's this game, you ask? What was the significance of these pants, 
              and why were two grown men going to such efforts year after year 
              to retrieve them, only to send them off again? </p>
            <p>It all began in 1964 when Larry Kunkel's mom gave him a pair of 
              moleskin pants. After wearing them a few times, he found they froze 
              stiff in Minnesota winters and thus wouldn't do. That next Christmas, 
              he wrapped the garment in pretty paper and presented it to his brother-in-law. 
            </p>
            <p>Brother-in-law Roy Collette discovered he didn't want them either. 
              He bided his time until the Christmas after, then packaged them 
              up and gave them back to Kunkel. This yearly exchange proceeded 
              amicably until one year Collette twisted the pants tightly and stuffed 
              them into a 3-foot-long, 1-inch wide pipe. </p>
            <p>And so the game began. Year after year, as the pants were shuffled 
              back and forth, the brothers strove to make unwrapping them more 
              difficult, perhaps in the hope of ending the tradition. In retaliation 
              for the pipe, Kunkel compressed the pants into a 7-inch square, 
              wrapped them with wire and gave the &quot;bale&quot; to Collette. 
              Not to be outdone, Collette put the pants into a 2-foot-square crate 
              filled with stones, nailed it shut, banded it with steel and gave 
              the trusty trousers back to Kunkel. </p>
            <p>The brothers agreed to end the caper if the trousers were damaged. 
              But they were as careful as they were clever. As the game evolved, 
              so did the rules. Only &quot;legal and moral&quot; methods of wrapping 
              were permitted. Wrapping expenses were kept to a minimum with only 
              junk parts used. </p>
            <p>Kunkel next had the pants mounted inside an insulated window that 
              had a 20-year guarantee and shipped them off to Collette. </p>
            <p>Collette broke the glass, recovered the trousers, stuffed them 
              into a 5-inch coffee can, which he soldered shut. The can was put 
              in a 5-gallon container filled with concrete and reinforcing rods 
              and given to Kunkel the following Christmas. </p>
            <p>Kunkel installed the pants in a 225-pound homemade steel ashtray 
              made from 8-inch steel casings and etched Collette's name on the 
              side. Collette had trouble retrieving the treasured trousers, but 
              succeeded without burning them with a cutting torch. </p>
            <p>Collette found a 600-pound safe and hauled it to Viracon Inc. in 
              Owatonna, where the shipping department decorated it with red and 
              green stripes, put the pants inside and welded the safe shut. The 
              safe was then shipped to Kunkel, who was the plant manager for Viracon's 
              outlet in Bensenville. </p>
            <p>The pants next turned up in a drab green, 3-foot cube that once 
              was a 1974 Gremlin. A note attached to the 2,000-pound scrunched 
              car advised Collette that the pants were inside the glove compartment. 
            </p>
            <p>In 1982 Kunkel faced the problem of retrieving the pants from a 
              tire 8 feet high and 2 feet wide and filled with 6,000 pounds of 
              concrete. On the outside Collette had written, &quot;Have a Goodyear.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>In 1983 the pants came back to Collette in a 17.5-foot red rocket 
              ship filled with concrete and weighing 6 tons. Five feet in diameter, 
              with pipes 6 inches in diameter outside running the length of the 
              ship and a launching pad attached to its bottom, the rocket sported 
              a picture of the pants fluttering atop it. Inside the rocket were 
              15 concrete-filled canisters, one of which housed the pants. </p>
            <p>Collette's revenge for the rocket ship was delivered to Kunkel 
              in the form of a 4-ton Rubik's Cube in 1985. The cube was made of 
              concrete that had been baked in a kiln and covered with 2,000 board 
              feet of lumber. </p>
            <p>Kunkel &quot;solved the cube,&quot; and for 1986 gift-giving repackaged 
              the pants into a station wagon filled with 170 steel generators 
              all welded together. Because the pants have to be retrieved undamaged, 
              Collette was faced with carefully taking apart each component. </p>
            <p>What happened to the pants in 1987 is a mystery, and their 1988 
              packaging (concrete-filled tank) was mentioned at the beginning 
              of this page. Sadly, 1989's packaging scheme brought the demise 
              of the much-abused garment. </p>
            <p>Collette was inspired to encase the pantaloons in 10,000 pounds 
              of jagged glass that he would then deposit in Kunkel's front yard. 
              &quot;It would have been a great one - really messy,&quot; Kunkel 
              ruefully admitted. The pants were shipped to a friend in Tennessee 
              who managed a glass manufacturing company. While molten glass was 
              being poured over the insulated container that held them, an oversized 
              chunk fractured, transforming the pants into a pile of ashes. </p>
            <p>The ashes were deposited into a brass urn and delivered to Kunkel 
              along with this epitaph: </p>
            <p>Sorry, Old Man Here lies the Pants. . . An attempt to cast the 
              pants in glass brought about the demise of the pants at last.</p>
            <p>The urn now graces the fireplace mantel in Kunkel's home.</p>
            <p>Merry Christmas, everyone! <br>

              Now's the Time - Trucari (12/30/2002 1:16 AM) <br>
              <br>
              Everynow and then people need a break or find more worthwhile uses 
              of their times. It's those times when we scream out WTF in guildchat 
              and on the boards but shortly thereafter we move on.</p>
            <p>On the other hand that opens a door for everyone not in the family. 
              If you've been looking for a home to beat big baddies, a reason 
              for staying up till all hours of the morning, and someone to bullshit 
              with at any hour of the day, check us out(oh yeah, we get this stuff 
              called &quot;loot&quot; too).</p>
            <p>So take a look at these guildlines, if you think you fit the bill, 
              post an app on our general board and try us out.</p>
            <p>Bards = Want (30+ AA) <br>
              Beastlord = Don't Need (60 AA+) <br>
              Cleric = Need (SCM3) <br>
              Druid = Indifferent (60 AA+ MGB SCM3) <br>
              Enchanter = Need (SCM3, MGB) <br>
              Monk = Don't Want (80+ AA, Max Lightning Reflexes) <br>
              Necro = Want (40+ AA) <br>
              Paladin = Don't Want (all PoP defensive skills maxxed, 305 sta buffed, 
              and excellent raid attedance) <br>
              Ranger = Indifferent (Endless Quiver, Max Archery Mastery) <br>
              Rogue = Want (40+ AA) <br>
              Shadowknight = Don't Want (100+ AA) <br>
              Shaman = Want (MGB, SC3, Can 5, 60+AA) <br>
              Warrior = Don't Want ( all PoP defensive AA's maxxed, Planar Power 
              and 305 Sta buffed) <br>
              Wizards = Don't Need (max planar crits, harvest, new familiar, 280 
              buffed int, 90+AA) </p>
            <p>For now these are guildlines and we're specifically looking for 
              65th level people. As time changes we'll make some changes but if 
              you have any questions or concerns feel free to talk to Trucari 
              in game.</p>
            <p>Happy Holidays and I look forward to kicking ass with you!<br>

              Hat's off! - Trucari (12/29/2002 5:13 AM) <br>
              <br>
              I'd like to take a moment to Congratulate my fellow guildmembers. 
              What is so special about this occasion you ask? Well, it's because 
              I'm reminded once again how much we sacrifice to do the shit we 
              do.</p>
            <p>So props guys, we may do it the hard way, time and again dying 
              on mobs where just one little thing we didn't know about happens. 
              That's EQ for us. The constant struggle to attack, fail, learn, 
              and attack. And yet, oddly, it makes us stronger. That is why I'm 
              so proud. In the end, we do it the right way, and though we may 
              not have the right classes, or enough numbers, everyone's willing 
              and every now and again, we step out and do the improbable. So be 
              proud, when you do it the right way, you have the distinguished 
              priviledge of saying,&quot;My guild and I, have conquered this mob, 
              so STFU bitch gimme some lewtz.&quot;</p>
            <p>On that note, our bitches of the evening were AoW, Vallon, Tallon, 
              Overseer, Villager Trial, PoS mini's, and then some desert, Cazic 
              Thule falling at 4AM EST. Grats all on your new toys and congratulations 
              for earning that loot with your blood, sweat, and tears.<br>

            <p>Why is it the first time you kill something you never have any 
              time for screenshots? Oh well thanks VI for giving Necros wake the

              <br>
              Did angarr again, hell even had less people this time and actually 
              was a cleaner kill. Then decided to make it a retro weekend so clobbered 
              seru(which can be easily done now with 30), al(which can be done 
              with 18-24), BB(did the tanks even get hit?), and other assorted 
              mobs. </p>
            <p>Happy holidays, hope ya got your lewts in game and out of game.

              Man, my guild loves to raid. I log on yesterday afternoon and decide 
              to give everyone a break from raiding so I post no raids til after 
              Christmas. </p>
            <p>No sooner had I changed that to MOTD that Klutch says I just got 
              all my pieces for my cleric epic, can anyone come help? Technically 
              a raid, I let it slide since it's a two-group affair.</p>
            <p>Soon as that is over, the tells start pouring in. &quot;This is 
              up, let's go do it. That is up, let's go do it.&quot; Everything 
              from HOH trials to ring wars, people wanted to raid. &quot;I want 
              my exp time, darn it. No!&quot;</p>
            <p>Finally after two AA, I finally break down when Illusion of Apathy 
              informs me they are doing statue and willing be leaving AoW up. 
              Doing a quick /w all GUILD shows 34. I like tight fights so we go 
              for it.</p>
            <p>Well, someone announced Factionpaloozafest 2003 in the bazaar or 
              something because by the time we get formed up, over 80 people are 
              there to help us down AOW. He went down like a chump. Grats Pikn 
              on her AOW ring, Grats Kamzan on your BoC and 11th loot of the month 
              (a new record), and guild funds on monk legs.</p>
            <p>Now, I am announcing it again. No raids til after Christmas and 
              make sure to call your mom! </p>
            <p>In other news, I want to give a hearty congratulations to our former 
              ally, Element of Darkness, for making it to the Temple of Solusek 
              Ro. Contrary to popular belief, our split wasn't one of bad blood 
              or ugly -- it was just a decision of what we wanted to accomplish, 
              which made our guilds incompatible. </p>
            <p>I believe in following the loot faction and making sure that everyone 
              gets loot and as you can see by TLW (Team Loot Whore) representative 
              Kamzan above, since PoP came out we have been doing that. We skipped 
              focusing on PoP and concentrated on gearing up our people since 
              we had recently split and had quite a few poorly equipped players. 
              That has been a tremendous success for us as I believe we are now 
              the best equipped guild on the server. Our #1 warrior might not 
              be the best equipped, but our #7 warrior blows everyone else's away. 
              Down the line, we have very nice gear now.</p>
            <p>EoD, on the other hand, skipped gaining loot completely in order 
              to concentrate solely on PoP and being the first into Temple of 
              Sol Ro. They accomplished that goal last night and I give another 
              grats to them. It shows that they are quality players and validifies 
              the reasons of our two-year alliance with them. I wish them the 
              best of luck in their farming. And saying that, enjoy your time 
              there now, because we are going to catch you quickly </p>
            <p>To everyone else on the server, I say Merry Christmas and Have 
              a Happy New Year!!! (And don't forget to call your Mom!)</p>

              Saturday was a fun day all around. We started off in the Halls of 
              Honor, once again working on the trials. It's a good feeling to 
              see the guild come together and act as such a fluid machine even 
              in the face of uncertainty.</p>
            <p>It's also amazing how soon encounters become beyond trivial. When 
              we first downed Grummus it was a mess, full of death from the huge 
              AE. Yesterday he died flawlessly and his AE may as well have been 
              flame lick. Go figure</p>
            <p>Since the holidays have come around and people are being with their 
              families, and that mangy little hobbit is still lining his pockets 
              I have nothing left to report save these words of wisdom.</p>

              What can I say except, &quot;Yay for patch days!&quot;. It was really 
              impressive to see us get the stuff down we did with half our squad 
              on vacation/finishing finals etc etc, but we got it done and done 
              in style.</p>
            <p>We started of our night in Ssra, taking down the Creator in a 15 
              or so minute romp that involved four groups (cough). After that 
              we went and dropped the High Priest in similar fashion. Same story 
              for Glyphed, Exiled, Cursed. I'd post some pictures, but they all 
              look alike anyway.</p>
            <p>With some numbers logging in we went back to PoP and worked a little 
              more on the HoH trials...hoorah. </p>
            <p>Terris-Thule went down next, more or less because we were bored...and 
              the necros wanted to look up her dress.</p>
            <p>We next paid a visit to a Eurolyzed VT and took down the Aten Blobs, 
              I don't want to say we were short on numbers but...well you decide. 
            </p>
            <p>As nervous as that made everyone involved it got the job done, 
              grats on more VT loot.</p>
            <p>A late night skeleton crew toughed it out to drop the AoW. He dropped 
              4 helms...worst loot ever.</p>

            <p>Hey there Mousketeers, been a while.</p>
            <p>Hope Santa was kind to y'all. He brought me a get out of jail free 
              card for all the updates I missed, so I am being overly kind when 
              I tell you even this much....</p>
            <p>What did we do in December? GUESS!</p>
            <p>Ha ha! That felt good.</p>
            <p>Actually, all my updating time was eaten from the intensive psychotherapy 
              sessions I needed to help get this image out of my head. I thought 
              I had drunk enough beer to blank it all out....I was wrong! But 
              since I am past that now, I can fill you in on what has been going 
              on of late....</p>
            <p>Hiatus! Well, not total hiatus....we did do the big tour of VT 
              tonight to prove we rember how to raid. We also proved we know how 
              to ask Jeeves questions that would get our moms to slap us silly. 
              I am sure several members made FBI watch lists this evening....so 
              if you're out there wondering how to get into SS....just wait for 
              the police to do their work...some spots will open up.</p>
            <p>Now....run off and play in traffic, plzthx!<br>
