Natasha Whitewater lowers her head in mourning. 'It is a shame that fate has decided one so young and from such a background should perish, but we must not attempt to change what was destined to be. Naxot sacrificed herself selflessly so that others may be spared the horrors Ixiblat would have brought to Norrath. May the waters of Norrath forever remember her reflection. I thank you for delivering Naxot's message to me and give you this pearl imbued with the power of the Triumvirate. Should you find Zordak Ragefire, speak with him before all else then hold this pearl before him. When the pearl begins to swirl it's enchantment will have taken effect.'

<p>
Rather than spawning in Lord Nagafen's lair, Zordak Ragefire spawns just off the first ramp, outside the Fire Giant castle (neg1379, pos351).

Once inside Sol B, head to the fire giant castle, you come to the "front gate" of the caste, where you go over a small bridge that is over a lava river. if you look over the side of the bridge to your right as you are facing the castle you will see a ledge. either jump or levi down to that ledge. Pinned on the wall of the castle, at that ledge is a flag. he spawns under that flag, on the ledge.
<p>
From looking at the map on eqatlas.com, (I hope i don't confuse you totally here). From room fifteen, follow the map as if you are headed to 16. when you reach the part that crosses the lava, that is where you jump down. standing on that bridge, with the fire giant castle on your right, the spawn point is below you. He is a 24 hour spawn, and seems to be spawning properly. Hand to him your pearl, he will despawn and you will recieve a 'Swirling Pearl' and 'Zordak's Box of Bindings'.

<blockquote>
<i>While I was waiting for Ragefire, the fire giants started respawning.
If they're not cleared, you will aggro them when you turn in your pearl.
If there's a full spawn, you'll get 5, including King Tranix.  I got
killed while waiting for Ragefire there because I was sitting too close.
My guild got a small group together and they helped me get back there.
We killed the first two fire giants near the Lava Duct Crawlers, and
I was able to get my corpse.  We were standing on the ramp and AS we
were getting ready to take the next few, Ragefire spawned.  Rather than
risk losing my corpse-recovery group, I asked them to move back into
the tunnel.  I punched Divine BARRIER, ran up the ramp, into the room,
onto the table and jumped down.  I did the trade with him, jumped into the
lava and ran back to my group in the LDC tunnel.  We then evac'ed out.
I used Divine Barrier because it takes 2 seconds to cast, and in case
I needed another Divine, I still had the 1-second-cast Divine Aura left.
<p>
I shared that story because its another strategy for getting your pearl
if you can't muster the forces to clear the fire giants (if, for example,
Zordak spawned at 5:00AM and none of your friends/guildmates are on-line).

My group was not to familiar with Sol B in fact we got
lost a couple of times.  We did not feel that we could
split the Fire Giants to clear a path to him.  So I
decided to follow the lava river and see if I could
reach him and bypass the giants.  I found that if you
follow the wall on your right as you follow the river
you can go underneath the throne room of the giants
and is a direct line to Ragefire.  The giants did not
agro when i turned in the pearl but we also evac'ed
after I made my turn in.

Zordak Ragefire stares at Yumanea with unblinking eyes. A wide grin crosses Zordak's face and flames flicker in the depths of his eyes. 'Welcome to the new fortress of the Plasmatic Priesthood! It's a shame about Lord Nagafen's untimely death, really it is! Such a powerful and noble creature should not perish at the hands of mortals.'

Head to Skyfire Mountains once you have your pearl and seek out Warder Cecilia. (loc 3000, -3200).

 <i>Yumanea says, 'Hail, Warder Cecilia' <br>
 Warder Cecilia says 'Greetings, you have made excellent time. We received word that Zordak was gathering his power here, and we still have little knowledge of his true intentions. Scattered throughout these mountains there are small Pearlescent Shards, binding four of these shards together within a Box of Binding should allow me to create a Seal. This seal, when fused with a Swirling Pearl inside Zordak's heart should allow our seers to divine his true intentions, even after he has been slain. Once you have the seal I will release Zordak, make haste I will not be able to hold him for long.'</i>

<p>
Drop rate on these shards is reported to be about 1%, they seem to have an equal chance of dropping off any mob in the zone. so, you collect the four shards, combine them in the 'box of binding', which produces 'assembled pearlescent shard'.
<p>

Hand this to Cecilia. she will hand you back a seal and spawn ragefire for you.

He spawns as the human form, but will attack on sight. He's level 55 and seems to be the same as the old agro version in SolB. Once he dies, his dragon form, Zordakilicus Ragefire will spawn. The new dragon is level 60 and casts a much more powerful dispel and fire damage AE. It's been reported that the dragon has 65,000 hit points.

He will drop an 'Impure Heart of Zordak Ragefire'. This is a container, place the Swirling Pearl and the Seal in the heart and combine.
<p>
<center>
<img src="images/epic_shots/heart_open.jpg" width="130" height="257">
</center>
<p>
You will end up with 'Zordak Ragefire's Heart'. Take this to Omat Vastsea in Timorous Deep.

Omat Vastsea says 'I see now that Zordak Ragefire and the exiled elder dragon Zordakalicus were the same being. That explains how he resisted our attempts to divine his affairs and past. Each of these orbs I have granted you represents one of the Triumvirate. Jhassad Oceanson awaits on the shore below to perform the ritual that will merge the orbs into a single Orb of the Triumvirate and summon an avatar from the Plane of Water. Present the Orb of the Triumvirate to the Avatar of Water when it arrives and allow your destiny to be unraveled.'</i>
<p>
Receive 'Orb of Vapor'.
