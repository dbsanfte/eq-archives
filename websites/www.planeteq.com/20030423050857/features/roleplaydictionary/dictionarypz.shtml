            <p>My friends, I write to you with earnest hand of the information 
              I have collected from scholars scattered over the four corners of 
              the land. Much work by many wise and brave souls has gone into the 
              gathering of lore and artifacts to uncover the history of Norrath 
              and the peoples who live there. I hope my humble effort will advance 
              the knowledge of all peoples, to bring peace and prosperity to all 
              the races that must live together in our fair world. <br>

            <p><b>Paladin</b><br>
              A paladin is the very embodiment of a holy knight, fighting for 
              the cause of good in every aspect of his or her life. As the paladin 
              gains life experience and proves his devotion, he will be granted 
              the ability to use limited clerical magics. They share some of the 
              powers of clerics along with a good deal of the fighting ability 
              of warriors, but have a few virtues all their own. (The History 
              of Norrath, Verant International)</p>

              In the final battle between the necromancers and other spell casters 
              during the civil war in Erudin [see the Age of Enlightnment], great 
              mystic energies were released and an immense hole leading to unknown 
              depths beneath the earth was created. Into the sides of this chasm 
              the heretics built their own city which they called Paineel. [See: 
              The Hole] (The History of Norrath, Verant International)</p>
            <p><b>Peacekeepers</b><br>
              In Erudin, at the Temple of Divine Light can be found the Peacekeepers. 
              These followers of the Tranquil are taught their ways by the Cleric 
              Leraena Shelyrak and the Paladin Depnar Bulrious. The Peacekeepers 
              are allied with the High Council of Erudin and oppose the Heretics.

			<b>Permafrost Keep</b><br>
              Permafrost Keep is an ancient ice giant castle that has fallen into 
              ruin, buried in the glaciers that are slowly claiming the northlands. 
              Most of the ancient castle lies in ruins, and what is left consists 
              of rediscovered areas of the old castle and a warren of caves dug 
              out by the goblins who owe fealty to the great dragon Lady Vox. 
              Ice Giants also live here.</p>
            <p><b>Phinigel Autropos</b><br>
              Ruler of Kedge keep. The fish of Kedge Keep are all loyal to Phingel. 
              He is possibly the last of the Kedge race, created by the god Prexus. 
            <blockquote> 
              <p> <i>The Relic of Brell Serilis</i><br>
                At last, with the long sought after scroll in his possession, 
                the mighty Al'Kabor unravels the secret behind the demise of the 
                Kedge race. Phinigel Autropos, the last surviving Kedge, consigned 
                his brethren to permanent undeath with a magical spell of great 
                power. Al'Kabor, armed with this knowledge, confronts Phinigel. 
                The unspoken threat that he could use the very same spell on Phinigel 
                himself is made clear, unless Phinigel cooperates with the wizard. 
                The last Kedge is not one to take such threats lightly, however, 
                and though he could more than likely destroy arrogant Erudite, 
                he reasons it wiser to teach him a valuable lesson rather than 
                risk his own life.</p>
              <p> Phinigel uses his arcane magic to send out a vision of an ancient 
                artifact, long guarded by his minions, the aqua goblins. </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><b>Pirates of Gunthak</b><br>
              Bandits that prey on travellers and the Sisters of Ellorosi in the 
              Ocean of Tears.</p>
            <p><b>Pirates of Iceclad </b><br>
              The Pirates of Iceclad Ocean are the gnomes found in the Icy Fingers. 
              They are a vengeful bunch and trust no one.</p>
            <p><b>Plane of Air</b><br>
              Home to followers of Veeshan. Seven islands suspended in air are 
              populated with all sorts of wonderful creatures. A huge windmill 
              dominates the landscape. The traveller must purchase a jewel to 
              enter this plane.</p>
            <p><b>Plane of Fear</b><br>
              The plane of Cazic Thule. Populated by many horrible creatures, 
              including Cazic Thule.</p>
            <p><b>Plane of Growth</b><br>
              The plane of Tunare. Tunare herself can be found here, along with 
              the Tunarian court.</p>
            <p><b>Plane of Hate</b><br>
              The plane of Innoruk. It is overseen by Maestro of Rancor.</p>
            <p><b>Plane of Mischief</b><br>
              The plane of Bristlebane the trickster.</p>
            <p><b>Prexus: The Oceanlord</b><br>
              During the Elder Age, Prexus created a race called the Kedge, hearty 
              aquatic beings of great mental power and stamina, as part of the 
              gods' plan to watch over the dominance of Dragonkind.</p>
            <p>Followers of Prexus believe true power lies in the vast depths 
              of Norrath's oceans. They believe that eons ago life first formed 
              in the murky deep and that one day the oceans shall rise again to 
              consume those who are unworthy and to embrace the faithful. The 
              Oceanlord's servants tend to live and work near, on, or beneath 
              large bodies of water. They seek to spread the word of Prexus to 
              all who will hear and defend the oceans and seas of Norrath against 
              any who would cause them harm. Many sailors and fishermen are followers 
              of Prexus. (The History of Norrath, Verant International)</p>
            <p><b>Priests of Innoruk</b><br>
              Just inside the Entrance of Neriak's 3rd Gate, surrounded by a nice 
              moat is the Temple dedicated to the Prince of Hate. Here the Priests 
              of Innoruk, under the leadership of Perrir Zexus train clerics of 
              all seasons. The priests are loyal to the Dark Elf King Aythox Thex. 
              Dedicated to Hate, there is no Love lost on the Dark Elven Queen 
              Cristianos Thex. The Priests of Innoruk oppose the Priests of Marr 
              in North Freeport, the Clerics of Tunare in Felwithe, and the Priests 
              of Life in Qeynos. (The History of Norrath, Verant International)</p>
            <p><b>Priests of Life</b><br>
              Cleric and Paladin Guild for followers of Rodcet Nife.</p>
            <p><b>Priests of Marr </b><br>
              In North Freeport can be found the Temple of Marr. This temple is 
              dedicated to the trinity of Marr. The Queen of Love, Erolissi Marr 
              is worshiped here, The Lightbearer has a seperate gathering place 
              in the Hall of Truth, and her other bother diety remains a mystery. 
              Under the guidance of Tholius Quey, clerics receive their training, 
              and Palidins dedicated to the Queen of Love receive their training 
              from Gygus Remnara. The Priests of Marr are Allied with their brothers 
              in the Knights of Truth in fighting off the Freeport Militia. Talking 
              with the priests will reveal how a crusade into the Ocean of Tears, 
              leaving Freeport undefended, and allowed the Freeport Militia to 
              come to power under Sir Lucan D'Lere. </p>

              During the Lost Age, a strong and noble band of Humans, lead by 
              Antonius Bayle the First, founded Qeynos under the lofty principles 
              of law. (The History of Norrath, Verant International). The name 
              is rumored to be &quot;Sony EQ&quot; spelled backward.</p>
            <p>Qeynos is one of the largest cities in all of Norrath, and one 
              of the two large coastal cities run by the humans. The docks of 
              the city provide trade from Qeynos to the high human city of Erudin, 
              as well as to other areas along the coast. The Guards of Qeynos 
              command posts throughout the surrounding terrain, providing protection 
              to travellers as far away the the Plains of Karana. Most of the 
              major guilds are present in this town, and it is the home of the 
              Clanhouse of the Silent Fist. There is a seamy underbelly to this 
              city, like other port cities, and rumors of corruption and smuggling 
              as well as unsavory street dwellers are a part of everyday life 
              here. There are many (some say too many) drinking establishments 
              within the high walls of the city. Further from the gates are the 
              Hills of Qeynos, an area jointly patrolled by Guards of Qeynos and 
              the rangers and druids of Surefall Glade. These hills are more dangerous 
              to the traveller, and wild animals roam freely. Haunted ruins dot 
              the landscape, and the hideous entrance to the dark hole of Blackburrow 
              juts out of the cliff face here. 
            <p> The Qeynos Catacombs is the vast ancient water supply to the city 
              of Qeynos. The area was long ago walled off when it was no longer 
              used, but then became a home for the lawless element in the city, 
              including the beggars and thieves, smugglers and thugs, and up to 
              the members who worship the Plague Bringer himself.</p>

              Followers of Quellious seek peace. They are not strict pacifists 
              though and will fight to defend themselves and those they care about. 
              The peace they seek is an inner one. They wish to know all there 
              is to know about themselves and the world around them. They thirst 
              for knowledge of their true selves and strive to help others attain 
              enlightenment. It is through the sharing of this knowledge that 
              they believe universal peace can be obtained. If every creature 
              fully understood itself and its neighbors there would be no need 
              for conflict and war. Followers of Quellious often follow a nomadic 
              lifestyle, constantly seeking what there is to know and hoping to 
              find themselves along the way. (The History of Norrath, Verant International)</p>

              The first ogreian kingdom in the nearby Rakthokian ridge mountain 
              range, named after the first ogre leader &quot;Rakthok the Warlord&quot;.</p>
            <p><b>Ralem Cristoff</b><br>
              A ranger serving as the Field Marshall for Antonius Bayle's roving 
              patrol.</p>
            <p><b>Rallos Zek: The Warlord</b><br>
              At the beginning of the Elder Age, Rallos Zek created the races 
              of giants as part of the gods' plan to watch over the dragon-dominated 
              lands.</p>
            <p>When Brell suggested a second alliance with the new gods coming 
              to Norrath, Rallos Zek returned to the surface, pleased with his 
              sanction to create even more peoples for his army. He made then 
              the Ogres, massive, unmovable beings of questionable intelligence, 
              and the Orcs, bred for battle and singled-minded in their desire 
              for conquest. </p>
            <p>Several of the races became bent on expansion and warfare became 
              part of their developing cultures. And of all the races, it was 
              the Ogres who quickly proved the most interested in battle and plunder, 
              and their empire grew outward from their mountain home until it 
              eventually encompassed a large portion of Tunaria, largest of the 
              known continents. Their knowledge of magic grew as did their greed, 
              until they became weary of only Norrath, and when they learned of 
              other planes and dimensions, invaded the Plane of Earth itself. 
              Rallos Zek watched with pride as his creations challenged the gods 
              of that realm, and when they eventually knew defeat, the Warlord 
              himself led a second invasion. The war that ensued shook the heavens 
              and angered the greater gods. Through their combined might, Rallos 
              Zek was finally thwarted and forced back to his domain, after which 
              a great barrier to the Planes of Power was erected, denying entry 
              to both the lesser gods and mortals as well. And then, in what some 
              view as spite and others justice, the gods cursed the Warlord's 
              creations. Thousands of Ogres were slain and their empire collapsed 
              around them. The Giants were spread from one end of the earth to 
              the other, forced to flee their homes as the gods brought snow and 
              ice to their previously lush lands. And the goblins were also cursed, 
              but no writings remain of their punishment as they no longer keep 
              records of their history (which is perhaps some indication as to 
              the severity of their curse). Thus began the Age of Monuments.</p>
            <p>The followers of Rallos Zek believe in survival of the strong and 
              death to the weak. In the heat of battle is the only place where 
              enlightenment can be gained. The universe was formed by conflict 
              and in conflict it will end. The victors feasting upon the remains 
              of their fallen enemy. No respect or regard is given to the dead, 
              for if they were worthy their hearts would still pump blood through 
              their veins and not upon the soil of Norrath. Followers of Zek are 
              almost exclusively warriors. (The History of Norrath, Verant International)</p>

              Rangers are at home in the forests of Norrath, as knowledgeable 
              about beasts as druids, if less magically inclined. Their strengths 
              bespeak their abilities as warriors and a true meld they are between 
              the two classes. Few races have the instinctual nature which will 
              allow them to excel in this class, as certain innate senses must 
              be quite acute. Rangers can become adept at using distance weapon 
              such as the bow and arrow and have often been known to study the 
              skills of the bowyer and fletcher. Members of this class are unsurpassed 
              in their ability to pursue their quarry, be it friend or foe. (The

              Kurn Machata, Karatukus, and the vampire Chosooth. The Dragon lords 
              saw the threat from Rile, and convened the Ring of Scale and discussed 
              how to proceed. Trakenon advocated swift intervention; but he was 
              voted down and the Ring of Scale elected to intervene in the affairs 
              of Sebilis only indirectly. Trakenon took matters into his own hands, 
              and conjured a squall at sea, drowning King Rile. This action triggered

              Rogues are the secretive, mysterious class of the world who sneak 
              about in the dark. Some say they are assassins, and some say that 
              they are nothing but common thieves, but the truth lies somewhere 
              in the middle and they are capable of both. They are quite skilled 
              with many weapons, but they cannot stand toe to toe with a warrior. 
              Rogues prefer to make the kill by a sudden attack from the rear; 
              backstabbing is their forte, after all. They move like smoke, in 
              the thick of the fray one minute, causing tears to come to one's 
              eyes, then evaporating as you turn their way. The less honorable 
              skills of picking pockets and stealing are also among what they

              word or two but when someone would point at something and say &quot;kill 
              it&quot; it is assured that it will stand no more, be it human or 
              inanimate object. When not fighting he enjoyed staring into empty 
              space and drooling. 
            <p> Glunn was another matter altogether. He was as happy-go-lucky 
              as an orc could be. He was celebrating his 12th birthday but because 
              he could not remember exactly when he was born, he had been celebrating 
              his birthday for several days and planned to continue to celebrate 
              it for a few more, just to be safe. (History of Norrath, Verant

              The Lord of Flame arched the spine of the Serpent Mountains, bringing 
              heat from the burning sun to the ancient forest. The rivers ran 
              dry, it rained less each year, and while the great elven druids 
              fought long and hard, using their powerful magics to combat the

              nor desire. They demand the respect of their peers and more often 
              than not, earn it as well. Those who seek true elemental power follow

                learn and expand, and be one with the underworld. We were born

                quite prosperous. In time, we grew to be a large race, riddled 
                with a rutheless empire that spanned many a mile. Our worth was

              Fists and Tails of Cabilis </i> 
            <blockquote> It was in dawning of the Sebilisian Empire that the art 
              of fist and tail was forged. In the beginning, the pugilists of 
              the great tribes were nothing more than warriors without weapons. 
              Soon we would be forged into weapons. 
              <p> Grandmaster Tynn was the father of our disciplines. He came 
                to the empire from an unknown tribe. Some say he was a ronin who 
                wandered the worlds of Norrath where he formed the basis of the 
                city of Sebilis with no rebirth. He entered to form a caste which 
                did not exist. He was quickly challenged by the warlords. He spoke 
                his words and they did not listen. He knew the only way to make 
                them understand was to challenge their finest in The Gauntlet. 
                He called for four of the finest warlords and allowed them arms. 
                The warlords agreed, thinking his challenge as easy task. 
              <p> Grandmaster Tynn quickly dispatched of the warlords with nothing 
                more than fist and tail. He fought in a way never displayed. His 
                victory earned him much respect and Emperor Sathir soon commanded 
                him to form the Court of Pain and raise an army of monks. Tynn 
                formed the Swifttail Caste. 
              <p> Soon the way of fist and tail had hundreds in its ranks, climbing 
                the rungs. Tynn showed them they were not warriors, but monks. 
              <p> They would don shackles as testament to the Age of Snake when 
                the Iksar were a race enslaved. Inner strength and harmony were 
                taught. The Swifttail were born. 
              <p> The Swifttail were disbanded during the End Days. It was not 
                till the rise of the new empire under Emperor Vekin did the caste 
                reform. Grandmaster Glox, a former disciple of Tynn, came to New 
                Sebilis to rebuild the Court of Pain. In honor of Tynn, all masters

                the Sarnak. He told of intense torture. He survived the ordeal. 
                He escaped from the claws of the Sarnak with numerous scars which 
                proved of his painful ordeal. Most of the worst scars were never 
                to be seen. Talon worn a robe which he never removed. The scars

            <p><b>Takish-Hiz</b><br>
              Ancient city of the high elves during the Elder Age in the land 
              of Tunaria. </p>
            <p>The last of the old races to decline was the empire of the Elves. 
              The Elddar Forest spread across the entire southeastern quarter 
              of Tunaria. Cities and villages built high into the trees housed 
              thousands of Wood Elves, and the marble cities of the High Elves 
              were built in the forest's clearings and meadows, their white towers 
              and spires climbing out of the forest, higher than the tallest tree. 
              But then came the last curse of the gods, as Solusek Ro, Lord of 
              Flame, arched the spine of the Serpent Mountains, bringing heat 
              from the burning sun to the ancient forest. The rivers ran dry, 
              it rained less each year, and while the great elven druids fought 
              long and hard, using their powerful magics to combat the change, 
              they could only delay the inevitable. Slowly the forest gave way 
              to desert, and eventually even great Takish-Hiz crumbled and the 
              elves were forced to flee Tunaria, leaving much of their greatness 
              behind. Thus began the Lost Age. (The History of Norrath, Verant

              The ocean that lies between Kunark and the other continents of Norrath. 
              The Deep is separated into many separate islands, with different 
              creatures inhabiting them. This is the home of the Combine Empire 
              Teleportation room. There is also a dragon that frequents the southwestern

              is shrouded in mystery, but it appears that the once-living members 
              of the tower were brought here to remain safe during the Erudite/Heretic

            <p><b>Toxxulia Forest</b><br>
              Toxxulia Forest is a dark, quiet forest that encompasses much of 
              the island continent of Odus. It is separated into two areas by 
              a river running roughly east to west through it, the northern half 
              more habited and the southern half controlled by the kobolds and 
              the necromancers. <br>
              Also, since the recent reopening of the Hole deep beneath Paineel, 
              elementals have started to roam the forest, mostly staying below 
              the river, but occasionally venturing north of it. There are two 
              evil characters that roam this forest. The first is the necromancer, 
              Talrigar Eklorin, and his pet, who roams the entire area south of 
              the bridge. The other is Rungupp, a dark elf magician, who is in 
              league with the guards of Erudin. (Eq Atlas)</p>
            <p><b>Trade Skills</b><br>
              The citizens of Norrath have also developed a number of trade skills 
              over the course of their history, as would any civilized world. 
              Merchants on all continents buy and sell components to supply those 
              who opt to learn these skills, be they apprentice or master. Some 
              learn the skills to feed themselves, to earn money, or simply to 
              provide themselves with items they would otherwise lack, due to 
              their cost. Some of the trade skills widely practiced on Norrath 
              are: fishing, tinkering, baking, tailoring, blacksmithing, jewelry, 
              and pottery.</p>
            <p><b>Tracking</b><br>
              Rangers, druids and bards, through natural or magical abilities, 
              are able to follow traces of others over varying distances. They 
              have never been known to share the secret of this ability with the 
              other classes, which leads one to believe that it is a very difficult 
              skill. </p>
            <p><b>Trakanon</b><br>
              An ancient dragon. The once ruler of Sebilis after he defeated the 
              Iskar. Those loyal to the undead dragon are mostly his guards and 
              the population of Old Sebilis. Trakenon at one time befriended the 
              trolls, but then abandoned them. Trakenon opposed the Ring of Scale 
              in the war against the Iskar, taking a band of dragons and killing 
              King Rile. Trakenon is shunned by the other dragons because he started 
              the war with the Iskar. He looks wounded at the present time because 
              he was hurt during the battles and the Iskar shaman magic kept him 
              from completely healing.</p>
            <p>Another tale recounts that he was once the companion of Phara Dar, 
              daighter of Jalad Dar. Wishing to be the ruler of Veeshan's Peak, 
              he tricked Jalad Dar into fighting with the Iskar Ganak and dying 
              in the process. When Phara Dar learned of his treachery, she shunned 
              him. He was not able to take the throne in Veeshan's Peak. </p>
            <p><b>Trakenon's Teeth</b><br>
              Trakanon's Teeth is a vast, swampy area in the mountains of the 
              same name. The most notable feature is the vast ruins of the ancient 
              city of the Iksar, Sebilis. The ancient ruins of a massive aqueduct 
              lead from the small lake in the area to near the old city. Now, 
              however, the city and the surrounding area are filled with the tormented 
              dead. Other creatures of the swamp also roam freely in the large 
              areas of the jungle, including Frogloks of all types, and the more 
              dangerous trakaraptors and trakanasaurs.</p>
            <p><b>Trakenon's Prophecy</b><br>
              Three great warriors were chosen by Trakenon to be the saviors of 
              man: Miragul, the necromancer, who was given grat magic; Nalikor, 
              the troll, who was given a great sword, Edril, the elf, who was 
              given a dragon pendant. These three will be reborn in bodies of 
              others and can combine their gifts to enhance a fourth, yet unnamed, 
              person who will destroy all of Norrath. Edril is buried with his 
              amulet in Elizerain Lake in Faydwer, which is hidden at the present 
              time.</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><i>Of Trakanon's prophecy, excerpt from &quot;The Book of Edril&quot; 
                by Edril's late wife Almaril: </i><br>
                The great dragon looked on Edril as a father on his son and smiled 
                widely. &quot;So,&quot; Trakanon spoke in a voice that shook the 
                very ground, &quot;at last you have come.&quot; Edril, great among 
                the elves, felt himself begin to tremble as he stared deep into 
                the dragon's fiery eyes. &quot;You have no reason to fear me, 
                warrior, even though you have come here to kill me. But I doubt 
                that even you could perform such a task. You see, child, I was 
                born before the stars were made, before the foundation of this 
                world was ripped by Veeshan's claw, and before the gods gave birth 
                to the elder races. I have been and always will be the eternal 
                mystery between life and death and gods and man.&quot; With that 
                said, Edril bowed his head in awe and somehow knew the great beast 
                spoke the truth. </p>
              <p> &quot;And yet,&quot; the dragon continued, &quot;I am but a 
                watcher. For while I claim this world as my own I am forbidden 
                by laws forged millenia ago to change it's course. It is the curse 
                of all my kind: to love a world so much and to have to watch it 
                die. Take heed, warrior, because Norrath's death is fast approaching.&quot; 
                Edril lifted his head, his eyes wide in a look of shock and fear. 
              </p>
              <p> The dragon simply nodded. &quot;Yes, Edril, Norrath's fate was 
                decided long ago, or so the gods think. But the visions of your 
                gods are often warped by their own vanity and selfishness, the 
                future is never set, and the elder races may yet prove them wrong. 
                The gods made you all as a means to an end in their struggle and 
                as the wars of the elder races escalate, so shall the gods descend 
                from their planes of existence and make the whole of Norrath suffer. 
                But there are those among the races untouched by the taint of 
                immortals whom I have chosen as the saviors of man.&quot;</p>
              <p> Trakanon then stabbed deep into the ground with his left claw 
                and ripped the bottom of his cave dwelling asunder with one powerful 
                stroke of his arm. Edril looked over the sides of the newly formed 
                chasms and noticed the walls glowing a bright red. A face began 
                to form from the blackness deep within the cracks, and Edril could 
                clearly make out the aging face of an old man. The face had sad 
                eyes, gaunt cheeks, and long silvery hair. </p>
              <p> &quot;His name is Miragul,&quot; said the dragon, &quot;a human 
                mage, gifted in all talents of magic and able to bend the laws 
                of life and death to his will. He exists now as an empty shell, 
                wandering his tombs filled with powerful magics.&quot; </p>
              <p> The next face that formed was that of a troll, but surprisingly 
                it was a noble and proud visage. Scars ran from both eyes down 
                to the troll's mouth, and the troll's eyes were strong and unwavering. 
                &quot;He was called Nalikor. He was the troll first to enter my 
                kingdom and find me. He ended centuries of brutal war, was greatest 
                among his soldiers, and was able to lead his people from death 
                and starvation to a powerful kingdom.&quot; </p>
              <p> The dragon then turned his eyes to Edril. &quot;You, elf, are 
                my third chosen. You are Edril the warrior, a brilliant soldier 
                and great hero. Death haunts you at every turn but you are always 
                able to overcome your obstacles. You are a deadly fighter, a wanderer 
                of Norrath, and a lord among elves. And now I award you with a 
                much bigger destiny.&quot; Trakanon spoke deep in a language Edril 
                couldn't understand, and suddenly a small pendant flashed into 
                existence around Edril's neck. &quot;To Miragul I revealed the 
                existence of artifacts that would enhance his powers in the arcane 
                arts. To Nalikor I awarded a flaming sword to enhance his warrior 
                prowess. To you I give this: a small pendant that will allow you 
                to talk with me always. But it does much more. My strength is 
                finite, Edril, and already my powers begin to weaken. Soon either 
                the gods or the elder races will find the means to my destruction, 
                and when that happens then the final war for Norrath shall be 
                waged. But when I die, before I leave for the afterlife, I will 
                impart my power to the bearer of this pendant, and he shall have 
                all the wisdom and the strength of the most ancient of creatures.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p> Trakanon then laid his serpent-like head on the floor of his 
                cave. &quot;That time is fast approaching. Here is my prophecy, 
                young one. Everything I say now shall soon come to pass. When 
                the wars of the elder races begin to come to fruition, the gods 
                shall take notice and plan for their coming into the world. Then, 
                on the third day of the third season, in the dark of the night 
                on all the continents of the elder races, shall be reborn my chosen 
                in the bodies of other men, representing all of the three virtues: 
                good, evil, and the gray neutral between them both. They will 
                arise to the call of a fourth chosen, great among them, who will 
                collect my gifts unto himself: the magic enhancements of Miragul, 
                the flaming sword of Nalikor, and your dragon pendant. The peoples 
                of Norrath will revere this one as Trakanon's chosen, and he will 
                watch the whole world burn.&quot; </p>

              <p><i>Of the ancient trolls and the dragon Trakanon: </i><br>
                The present day kingdom of Grobb has always been fairly secretive 
                about it's heritage, but common trollish lore tells us that the 
                kingdom has it's roots in the blasted continent of Kunark, a land 
                of venomous rivers, gray wastes, and seething deadwood forests. 
                It is written that here, nestled on the banks of the Murkdweller 
                river, Innoruk chose to taint the bodies of man with cruel magics 
                in his attempt at further having a hold on the prophecied surge 
                of human power in the third age. But with the advent of the war 
                of the broken crown, sages tell that Innoruk eventually forgot 
                about his trollish abominations and left them to die on Kunark. 
                What followed for the trolls was decades of brutal combat as they 
                struggled for the scarce natural resources of their dead continent. 
              <p> It was at this time that the ancient dragon Trakanon took notice 
                of the slowly dying race. To call the ancient one a dragon is 
                purely speculative, as no one has ever seen the terrible beast 
                many think is reponsible for the present condition of Kunark, 
                but the garbled texts of the trolls describe him as one. The dragon 
                is said to have gathered the entire population of Kunark onto 
                one island in the broken teeth chain and there offer the trolls 
                a pact: Trakanon would supply the forgotten children of Innoruk 
                with food and water from his personal jungle lands if they would 
                become his servants. The trolls agreed, regarding Trakanon as 
                a powerful savior, king, and god. Trakanon organized the trolls 
                into separate tribes each to occupy a certain part of eastern 
                Kunark so he could control them better. It was at this time his 
                servants adopted the name &quot;troll&quot; which is a shortened 
                form of the phrase &quot;troll quel'dom gik Trakanon&quot; which 
                meant &quot;the green children of Trakanon&quot; in dragonish. 
              <p> <i>Of Trakanon's seclusion and the wars of the seven tribes: 
                </i><br>
                It has never been in the power of either man or troll to determine 
                the great dragon's reason for his abandonement, but we can't hope 
                to understand the ways of the immortals. Every text simply states 
                that Trakanon may have just changed his mind. Nevertheless, after 
                centuries of relative peace and harsh rule under their godlike 
                king, the twenty-five tribes of Trakanon entered the second age 
                with their food supply dwindling and shipments coming in less 
                and less frequently. At first there was no panic, the tribal leaders 
                sent messengers to their king to ask forgiveness for whatever 
                they had done wrong, but the messengers started to come back with 
                word that they had been denied an audience with the great dragon. 
                Trollish caravans by the hundreds started to crowd the dark hills 
                of disdain, waiting for the gates to open into Trakanon's hidden 
                kingdom, but that day never came. When word of Trakanon's seclusion 
                started spreading throughout Kunark, each tribe began to move 
                closer and closer to the east where food had once come through. 
                They arrived next to Trakanon's kingdom only to learn that the 
                great dragon king had not been seen for more then 50 years and 
                just recently had closed his gates to all messengers and caravans. 
                The trolls were confused, distraught, and starving, and so they 
                waited in the Kunark east for some word to come from their god. 
              <p> When that word never came, the tribes of Trakanon started to 
                grow restless. Battles started to erupt haphazardly and tribal 
                villages were attacked and plundered. In the shadows of the mountain 
                range &quot;Trakanon's teeth&quot; a new trollish war erupted. 
                The 25 tribes of Trakanon attacked eachother viciously for food 
                and water, and for ten years they battled nonstop until only 7 
                tribes were left. These 7 tribes retreated to every corner around 
                what is now called the field of bone, named for the countless 
                trollish skeletons which cover the ground. For centuries more 
                the surviving trolls would fight what has been called the war 
                of the seven tribes in their attempts at stealing whatever they 
                could for food and drink, even the flesh and blood of other tribal 
                members. Trollish shamans say that every day while the war raged 
                beneath him, Trakanon sat perched high above his jungle throne, 
                watching his trolls die with a grin on his face. The war would 
                almost cause the complete destruction of the troll race. 
              <p> <i>The Troll Migration: Of Chief Nalikor and the end of the 
                tribal wars: </i><br>
                In the middle of the third age, the tribes of Trakanon were all 
                but completely destroyed. The wars had continued for a century 
                or more and when the seven tribes began to finally die out, mostly 
                from starvation and disease, the trolls moved completely to the 
                north of the field of bone and away from the swamp of no hope, 
                the spot of their creation, forever. There the starving tribe 
                of chief Kateera and the desperate followers of chief Nalikor 
                squared off in one final confrontation. Across the northern shores 
                of Kunark raged a battle so terrible elven bards dare sing of 
                it only in the dark hours of the night. Troll was pitted against 
                troll in the end of a war that would prove what tribe would rule 
                Kunark, and each tribe fought with the single goal of completely 
                destroying the other. Slowly, the two tribes began to die. Trolls 
                began to consume the flesh of slain enemies, as was the accepted 
                custom of the tribe wars, but also the flesh of fallen comrades. 
                In fits of madness, trollish warriors would attack their own tribesmen 
                and then commit suicide. The fights degenerated into scenes of 
                utter insanity as trollish warriors started attacking anyone around 
                them, friend or foe, to eat whatever they killed and to steal 
                whatever they could grab. 
              <p> The two most unaffected by the insanity around them, being veterans 
                of the tribe wars themselves, were the two chiefs: Kateera and 
                Nalikor. Realizing that the battle they had begun would be the 
                beginning of the end of the troll race, both leaders met face 
                to face with a host of their most trusted warriors on what is 
                named Nalikor's Mound by the ancient trollish texts with the simple 
                intent of ending the war once and for all. Every text says Kateera 
                was the one who issued the challenge, and some troll shamans describe 
                Kateera as a foolish, rash young leader who could have never stood 
                a chance against the older Nalikor. Others, however, say that 
                Nalikor and Kateera entered in on an understanding that in order 
                for the trolls to stop the war the young leader had to die. Either 
                way, while the rest of the trollish camps settled down from the 
                war if only for a brief rest under a new moon, the young chief 
                Kateera was run through and beheaded by the old Nalikor. Rather 
                then carry out trollish customs and consume the bodies of his 
                enemies, Nalikor only took Kateera's head as proof of his victory, 
                then buried the young chief and his fallen guards on top of the 
                highest hill in the field of bone, the one most stained with blood. 
                Here the old chief stacked the weapons of warriors that had been 
                dead for centuries and the place was called Nalikor's Mound, a 
                monument to the old tribes of Trakanon and the mark of a new age 
                for the troll race. No one has reportedly seen the mound, but 
                the texts speak of it as a horrible site: a small red mountain 
                with spears and swords thrust through it, surrounded on all sides 
                by the endless troll-skeletons which cover the field of bone. 
                At it's top Nalikor set Kateera's severed head, grinning as it 
                hung from a metal pike. 
              <p> <i>Of Trakanon's chosen and the fleet of bone: </i><br>
                The tribe of the now defeated Kateera surprisingly did not put 
                up much of a resistance when they were told about the death of 
                their leader and their loss in the war. For a week, the survivors 
                of both tribes rejoiced in the end of centuries of warfare, feasting 
                and dancing over the corpses of the dead, but many questions still 
                remained unanswered and many problems were left unsolved. For 
                decades troll shamans had prophecied that the tribe to win the 
                wars would be given unimaginable riches and power by their dragon 
                lord, but Trakanon never revealed himself to the last tribe even 
                after the war was over. Kunark was now completely a blasted land 
                and a graveyard. All the creatures were dead and the undrinkable 
                rivers were red with blood. The tribe of Nalikor thought themselves 
                the sole rulers of their continent, but their continent was left 
                with nothing they could use to survive. When tensions started 
                to rise again among members of the same tribe, Nalikor realized 
                that his followers were ready once more to destroy themselves. 
                Powerless and desperate, the old chief then decided to commit 
                an act of trollish blasphemy: he would cross Trakanon's Teeth, 
                steal his way into the jungle kingdom of the great dragon, and 
                speak to the king of the trolls personally. 
              <p> Many different stories are written about the month-long journey 
                of Nalikor into the forbidden territory of his once-god Trakanon, 
                but all have these few things in common: It is said that the old 
                chief did actually meet the great dragon and that he told Trakanon 
                all but one of the tribes had been killed. The ancient beast obviously 
                admired the chief, as he awarded Nalikor with a magic blade and 
                a key into his eternal kingdom, but the dragon also told Nalikor 
                bluntly that he would give no aid to the trolls. It was then that 
                Trakanon told Nalikor of the other continents and the other races, 
                and that the chief could either lead his people away from Kunark 
                or watch the last tribe die. Nalikor was especially outraged at 
                the mention of more fruitful continents and the elder races, and 
                it is speculated that the hostility trolls have towards all other 
                Norrathians is spawned from this scorned jealousy, like a grown 
                man emerging from a troubled childhood. When Nalikor returned 
                to his tribe he found it in chaos, split among five different 
                leaders each with different plans for Kunark. The old chief killed 
                each would-be-leader quickly, his flaming sword easily cutting 
                them down, and when word of Nalikor's new-found power spread the 
                trolls once more united behind him and gave him the title &quot;Trakanon's 
                chosen.&quot; 
              <p> The old chief told all four hundred of his remaining followers 
                what Trakanon had told him, and quickly began to lay out the plan 
                for an escape off their island-continent. With a very limited 
                supply of natural resources, Nalikor and his men built a fleet 
                of five massive ships entirely out of wood, steel, and the bones 
                of dead trolls. With nothing left on Kunark, the trolls gladly 
                boarded the fleet of bone, leaving behind them their entire culture 
                of war and death, and sailed aimlessly for many weeks until coming 
                to the broken skull rock off Antonica, in the middle of the gulf 
                of Gunthak. 
              <p> <i>Of the Ogre attacks and the treaty of the burning blade: 
                </i><br>
                Even before they had landed, the ogres of Oggok knew of the formidable 
                and ivory ships sailing for their borders. Thinking they had something 
                to fear from the mysterious troll fleet, which was landing next 
                to the weakest part in the natural defense of Oggok, the ogres 
                immediately gathered a large force of warriors to stop the trolls 
                from advancing. To their complete surprise, the ogres found the 
                strange trolls to almost be their exact equals in combat and the 
                warriors were turned back by the massive tribe of Nalikor. Over 
                the next few days, the ogres would continue their attacks on Nalikor's 
                tribe. The fierce troll warriors, still homeless and starving, 
                were able to fight off the ogres many more times but were only 
                barely keeping Oggok at bay. The Greenblood river is named for 
                the many trolls who died in it's waters as a result of ogre raids. 
                Nalikor, not fully understanding the ogre race or these recent 
                skurmishes, sent word of a treaty to Oggok. To the surprise of 
                all the other races, king Gharn, the eighth warlord of the ogres, 
                whole-heartedly agreed. 
              <p> The ogres and trolls shared a mutual respect, as much a respect 
                as members of those two races can possibly produce. The ogres 
                saw the trolls as merciless warriors with strange powers, but 
                with a harsh and warlike attitude the ogres found pleasing. The 
                trolls, also, respected the strength and kill-or-be-killed ways 
                of the ogre kingdom. Soon the two races found themselves fast 
                allies. On the very place where Nalikor and his followers first 
                landed, broken skull rock, the ogres and trolls signed an agreement 
                that neither force would attack the other. Instead, the ogres 
                would help the trolls establish a kingdom and routes of supplies 
                on Antonica in exchange for troll military support and magical 
                aid. To seal the kinship between ogre and troll, Nalikor gave 
                his own magical blade as part of the arrangement. The sword is 
                still kept on broken skull rock in that same secret meeting place, 
                encased in a magical field of crystal. On it's surface is etched 
                &quot;Here the great alliance was formed between king Gharn the 
                slayer and Trakanon's chosen. May death come to those who seek 
                to disrupt it.&quot; Thus the alliance was called the treaty of 
                the burning blade. 
              <p> With the aid of the ogres, out of the ashes of the last tribe 
                of Trakanon sprang forth a new kingdom for the trolls. Nalikor 
                chose the edges of the Innothule Swamp for the trolls to live, 
                which most closely resembled the place of their creation: the 
                swamp of no hope on Kunark. The ogres taught the trolls how to 
                hunt in their new land and how to build fortifications. Nalikor 
                himself was deeply involved in creating the new hierarchy of the 
                troll kingdom and ending the old tribal system of Trakanon, but 
                he died before he could completely achieve his goal. His death 
                resulted in many days of troll mourning, and the burial site of 
                Trakanon's chosen was made the foundation of the new troll city 
                of Grobb- named for Nalikor's successor and the first official 
                king of the trolls. It is said that somewhere deep inside the 
                temple depths of Grobb the trollish shamans still keep watch over 
                Nalikor's key: the only remaining link between the trolls and 
                the ancient kingdom of the dragon Trakanon. </p>

            <p>Vahlai has been an enemy of Firiona Vie and her companions--namely 
              Dagda Icefury--for countless years, since before the group of hearty 
              adventurers set out for the undiscovered lands of Kunark nearly 
              ten years ago. Vahlai has since kept an eye upon the returned party. 
              Her goal was to wipe them out one by one while they were still weak,

              wounds upon the surface of Norrath, staking her claim to this promising 
              new world. Dragons then walked the land and flew the skies, powerful 
              beings of great intellect, wisdom, and strength. Thus began the 
              Age of Scale.</p>
            <p>Non-dragon followers of Veeshan believe that dragonkind is superior 
              to all other forms of life. They swear allegiance to the Mother 
              of Dragons and often sacrifice themselves or their loved ones to 
              one of Her children. In return for this undying devotion, Veeshan 
              is very protective and generous to her loyal followers. Many humanoids 
              have gained great riches and ancient knowledge through servitude 
              to the Wurms, but these gifts came with a high price...knowing that 
              one is less than cattle to the dragons, and that they can take your 
              messy life whenever it suits. (The History of Norrath, Verant International)</p>
            <p><b>Veeshan's Peak</b><br>
              Found in Skyfire Mountains, inside of a large gate guarded by elder 
              wyverns. Veeshan's Peak is the ancient fortress of the Ring of Scale, 
              the mighty rulers of all dragonkind. Only the bravest adventurers 
              dare to explore this mountain area, which is fraught with danger. 
            <p> <b>Velketors Labrynth</b><br>
              This is the ancient home and laboratory of the spellcaster Velketor, 
              a powerful magician. It was designed with an eye towards security, 
              and is very difficult to penetrate deeply inside. This dungeon consists 
              of one section where you must move vertically over narrow ledges. 
              The dangerous part is that these ledges are often covered in very 
              slippery ice, so you must move carefully or risk falling off. Also, 
              these ledges and overpasses are filled with many pit traps, which 
              you can fall through to the lower levels as well. Spiders here can 
              turn invisible to attack, and many monsters can also see invisible 
              as well. 
            <p> <b>Velious</b><br>
              Before recorded time, Veeshan the great Crystalline Dragon marked 
              Norrath by striking the continent of Velious with her foreclaw, 
              and deposited her brood there to dwell. The legends of that time 
              also tell that Veeshan blasted Velious with her breath, encasing 
              it in eternal ice and creating a barrier of deadly ice flows and 
              stormy weather. This marked the beginning of the Age of Scale. The 
              Age of Scale lasted untold millennia. From the tidbits of information 
              passed down, it is known that a group of dragons mastered magic 
              and spellcasting during this era. Additionally, dragons of power 
              and influence among their kind gathered together and formed a hereditary 
              ruling council known as the Claws of Veeshan, who rule the dragons 
              of Velious to this day. Few of Norrath's inhabitants know more of 
              this Age,and none that do would dare to speak. <br>
              <br>
              The end of the Age of Scale was marked by the Gods creation of the 
              other races of Norrath. Many of Veeshan's vainglorious brood perceived 
              that they might rule over these lesser beings and left Velious. 
              This splinter group became known as the Ring of Scale. Those dragons 
              that remained upon Velious had little interest in temporal power, 
              and were content to pass the millennia in homage to their goddess, 
              and in quiet contemplation and the study of magics. <br>
              <br>
              In the Elder Age, the Ogres, Giants and Goblins conquered much of 
              Norrath and began an assault on the Plane of Earth, precipitating 
              retribution from The Rathe in the form of a great curse against 
              all of Rallos Zek's creations. The fertile homelands of the Giants 
              (now known as Everfrost) were frozen, and those giants caught in 
              the epicenter of the curse were transformed wholly into immortal 
              creatures of living ice. Those nearby were struck to the core of 
              their beings, becoming lesser creatures in mind and body than they 
              had been. Those few who escaped the effects fled Tunaria for other 
              lands, coming to the attention of Prexus the Oceanlord, who sent 
              a great storm to destroy them. The storm drove many ships back to 
              Tunaria and to Kunark, where the curse of The Rathe took hold to 
              a lesser degree than in Everfrost. Many of the most powerful giants 
              managed to escape the storm thanks to their great powers, and passed 
              through the Frigid Barrier to land upon the Icy Fingers in Velious. 
              The Kromrif established themselves in the Eastern Wastes and lived 
              as nomads, eventually coming into conflict with the Coldain. The 
              Kromzek were the most powerful of all Rallos Zek's creations. Not 
              content with a nomadic lifestyle, they established a mighty fortress 
              city named Kael Drakkal in the Great Scar of Veeshan. The Claws 
              of Veeshan took exception to the intrusion of the Kromzek upon their 
              sacred lands, and thus began the long conflict between the two mightiest 
              races on Norrath, in this most inhospitable of all places. Ages 
              passed, leaving the eastern regions of Velious largely in the control 
              of the Giants. It was during this time that the ships of the Coldain, 
              or Ice Dwarves, were wrecked upon the ice of the Frigid Barrier. 
              Those few who survived to reach the shore escaped the notice of 
              the Claws of Veeshan, but were devastated in a conflict with the 
              fearsome Kromrif. Fleeing the giants, the Coldain established Thurgadin, 
              a hidden underground fortress in the mountains. Since these times, 
              none of the other races of Norrath have dared to approach the Frigid 
              Barrier, and thus Velious remained undiscovered. <br>
              <br>
              In the present day, the Gnomes of Ak'anon have revealed an ocean 
              vessel with the capability of navigating the roughest seas and breaking 
              through ice flows. Upon it's maiden voyage, the Gnomish Icebreaker 
              successfully penetrated the Frigid Barrier and discovered the islands 
              known as the Icy Fingers. Upon the largest of the islands, the crew 
              discovered an ancient and massive bridge, which arced away into 
              the mists and revealed the tip of a massive glacial continent - 
              Velious! (History of Norrath, Verant International)</p>
            <p><b>Venril Sathir</b><br>
              Venril Sathir was the Emperor of the Iskar empire. He united the 
              five tribes and brought them together as the Kingdom of Sebilis 
              to conquor most of the continent of Kunark. Their rising power eventually 
              attracted the attention of the Lords of the Ring of Scale, the Dragons 
              of Veeshan's Peak. Sathir and his Kunzar armies conquered and annexed 
              the other tribal states into Sebilis, which Sathir as King. Sathir 
              captured the giants and frogloks to help him to maintain his powerful 
              empire. </p>
            <p>There are two stories about Sathir's death: The first is that King 
              Sathir did not want to die, so he made a pact with Innoruk to rise, 
              undead and immortal, but his son Rile thwarted his plans and trapped 
              Sathir's soul in an amulet. He burned his father's body and the 
              amulet with it. </p>
            <p>The second version of the tale tells that Venril Sathir indeed 
              did become a lich and now focuses on regaining the Iksar throne 
              from his stronghold in Karnor's Castle. The outpost of Drow in the 
              Overthere are loyal to Venril. It would seem that this might be 
              the truer of these two tales, and Venril Sathir is known to walk 
              the earth at this time The inhabitants of Karnors castle are maintained 
              in their unholy life by the eternal iksar vampire, Venril Sathir, 
              as are the spiders in Kaesora dungeon.</p>
            <p><i>As described in the Iksar Lore Books in Cabilis: </i><br>
              <i>The greatest lizard to walk upon the land was Venril Sathir of 
              the Kunzar tribe. All that is known of his youth was that he was 
              a member of the ancient Kunzar Tribe. This was during the time of 
              division among the tribes of the Iksar. He was said to have never 
              been a mere broodling. He was forever a master of combat. </i></p>
            <p><i>Venril would soon slay his father and take his rightful place 
              as chief of the Kunzar Tribe. He led the Kunzar on many expeditions 
              into the ruins and wilds of Kunark. He sought knowledge and weapons.

            <p><i>In his late youth, he find the hidden library of the necromancer, 
              Kotiz. He would come to open a large book which opened into a small 
              room. Climbing into the book he finds a floating book. The Unholy 
              Writ of War is its title, made of Iksar skins and containing great 
              knowledge of combat. Venril becomes the books master. </i></p>
            <p><i>Venril soon shows signs of dark knowledge. He begins to wield 
              the forces of the dark circle and his knowledge of combat tactics 
              becomes supreme. He trains his army new tactics and even raises 
              the bones of the fallen to fight yet again for their master. His 
              army grows and marches to all corners of Kunark. </i></p>
            <p><i>Venril Sathir's army is now unstoppable. He shall soon plot

              tribe states of Iksar shall unite and a new age shall dawn. 313

            <blockquote> 
              <p><i>The Plot to Capture Firiona Vie and Rule the World</i><br>
                Venril Sathir moved back into Karnor's Castle some 50 years ago. 
                Before that time, the Iksar Lich-King spent more then a century 
                in hiding in The Bile at his Fortress Varis, after his defeat 
                at the hands The Alliance of Stone. The Alliance of Stone's victory 
                came only after the leader of Venril's Lycanthrope army, an Iksar 
                wizard serpent changer by the name of Thuuga, was deceived by 
                the Ring of Scale and joined the Alliance.</p>
              <p>Venril Sathir vowed to rebuild his empire to its former terrible 
                glory of two thousand years past. However, he had learned a valuable 
                lesson at his last defeat. Choosing to stay out of the public's 
                eye from now on, he has since become secretive and has been rebuilding 
                his strength quietly, biding his time as the tendrils of his influence 
                snake their way into all levels of society. He has many agents 
                and moles placed strategically all across the continent that report 
                to him and see that local politics resolve themselves in a manner 
                favorable to his designs.</p>
              <p>One such agent is a shapeshifter by the name of Korucust. Appearing 
                as a Sarnak, Korucust managed to become a member of Sarnak Overking 
                Bathezid Di'zok's council. The Ring of Scale had a representative 
                that once sat upon the Sarnak king's council but he disappeared 
                mysteriously around one year ago, shortly after Korucust was elected. 
                The truth of the matter is that Korucust assassinated this representative 
                at Venril's behest. One of Venril's goals is to subvert the influence 
                that the Ring of Scale has over the Sarnak. Indeed, he viewed 
                the Sarnak as a means of eventually destroying the Ring of Scale.</p>
              <p>Before he ordered the assassination, Venril learned very important 
                information about the Ring of Scale through the reports he received 
                from Korucust. He found that a few years back the Ring of Scale 
                were able to steal the memories of a certain High Elven Paladin. 
                The notion that it was possible to actually steal the memories 
                of another and take them as your own was one that was quite attractive 
                to Venril. </p>
              <p>Venril has been watching the elves and their small settlement 
                with interest. Far from posing any sort of threat, they have been 
                creating a pleasant distraction that has kept the Frogloks, giants 
                and others busy much to his delight. Nevertheless as in all things, 
                he pays close attention to their activities through his spies. 
                He favors the Lycanthropes, those that still remain loyal to him, 
                for that particular duty. Their superior senses allow them to 
                watch and hear things from a great distance, without alarming 
                the elves.</p>
              <p>He was fascinated when he began to hear that the elves were telling 
                stories, once again, about this certain High Elven Paladin that 
                had her memories stolen. The rumors say this High Elven Paladin 
                currently has in her possession a staff, allegedly given to her 
                by Tunare, which seems to have an enchantment upon it that is 
                helping the High Elf to regain her memories. Furthermore, Venril 
                hears that this High Elf will be travelling to this elven small 
                settlement very soon, to embark upon a journey to find and confront 
                the Ring of Scale.</p>
              <p>Upon hearing that the Paladin would soon be traveling to the 
                continent, Venril swore that he would learn the secret of stealing 
                memories. He sees this as a way to exponentially increase his 
                knowledge while destroying his enemies at the same time. Indeed, 
                a ruler without memories is one whose kingdom is easily conquered. 
                If he can gain access to this ability he feels he may finally 
                realize his goal of total control of the continent and eventually, 
                the entire world.</p>
              <p>Venril Sathir wants both Firiona Vie and her staff, The Lifeguide, 
                so he can study them both and learn how it is that he can steal 
                the memories of others and take them as his own. Venril begins 
                to hatch a plot to bring this about.</p>
              <p>Of course, the last thing Venril wants is to gain the attention 
                of Ring of Scale or anyone else for that matter. He tasks a powerful 
                shaman by the name of Danak Dhorentath with kidnapping Firiona. 
                He will have her hidden in a remote location, far away from his 
                Castle Karnor. Venril knows without a doubt that there will be 
                elven search parties and the like for a time after her disappearance 
                but he is not concerned. Patience is a trait he has learned in 
                his roughly 400 years as a Lich. </p>
              <p>Danak Dhorentath hatches a foul plan to accomplish this goal. 
                Venril lends Danak a powerfully enchanted magic necklace. This 
                necklace has the ability to open a gate to remote encampment far 
                from Venril's domain. Taking a team of four Lycanthropes and a 
                lesser Initiate of The Arisen, Danak and his party make their 
                way to the small elven settlement to fulfill his dark master's 
                wishes and capture the High Elven Paladin.</p>

              He becomes a hero. The blacksmiths are ordered to create a tail 
              made of iron. He is now Captain Irontail. <br>

              constitutions. &quot;A warrior is not made,&quot; they say, &quot;a 
              warrior is born,&quot; and so it is. Those whose very birthright 
              proves them to be more hardy than others are perfectly suited for 
              the rigors of this class. Though slow to regain their health when 
              injured, warriors are excellent companions for healer types, as 
              each can complement the other. (The History of Norrath, Verant International)</p>
            <p><b>Warsliks Woods</b><br>
              A forest that spreads from Cabilis to the ocean to the north. In 
              between lies the most untamed area near to Cabilis. This area is 
              home of the forest giants and the goblins.</p>
            <p><b>Weapons </b><br>
              <i>Swords: </i>come in all lengths and styles including short swords, 
              longswords, broadswords, two-handed swords, bastard swords and more. 
              They are either fullered (grooved) or ridged for strength and balance 
              and some have been known to have magical powers. All are effective 
              at slashing your opponents to ribbons. </p>
            <p><i>Hammers</i>: Many classes of citizen have forsworn slashing 
              or piercing weapons of all kinds, generally because of religious 
              beliefs. Others favor the bashing weapons for the satisfying &quot;thwock&quot; 
              they hear when bashing an opponent's skull. There are all sorts 
              of bashing weapons, but hammers, staves and clubs seem to be the 
              most common. </p>
            <p><i>Axes: </i>Many sorts of axes are in use as weapons in Norrath. 
              Some have a single blade and others are double-bladed. The later 
              are often quite beautiful, having ridges and designs on the great 
              winglike blades and undoubtedly strike terror into the hearts of 
              foes. </p>
            <p><i>Spear</i>: Originally these were simply branches with rocks 
              attached to the ends. Some primitive species still use such implements, 
              but other, more civilized hunters prefer these piercing weapons 
              for their range and power. </p>
            <p><i>Bow</i>: Archery is a very precise art for those who care to 
              learn it. One must often learn the trades of bowyery and fletching, 
              in order to gain the best possible outcome. Bows have great range 
              and arrows do varying damage, depending on the skill of the fletcher.</p>
            <p><b>Werewolf</b><br>
              Those stricken by Lyncanthropy, the werewolves. The Drovlargs are 
              considered Lycanthropes. (The History of Norrath, Verant International)</p>
            <p><b>The West Commonlands</b><br>
              The western continuation of East Commonlands. Home to Freeport guards 
              and the agressive dark elf, Kizdean Gix, as well as cuthroats and 
              an occassional dragoon. The dark elves have set up camp here as 
              well. In this zone can be found the dungeon of Befallen.</p>
            <p> <b>The Western Plains of Karana</b> <br>
              On the route from Qeynos area and the west coast of Antonica to 
              the east. There is one major path that dips to the south of the 
              mountain region at the northern edge, connecting Qeynos Hills and 
              the Plains to the east. A river forms the southern boundary of the 
              zone, and mountains the northern boundary. 
            <p> <b>The Western Wastes</b><br>
              is the last remaining home of a large number of dragons on Norrath. 
              They are frequently found roaming the wastes. Many of the dragons 
              are allied with The Claws of Veeshan.
            <p> <b>Wizard</b><br>
              Wizards are seekers of the most powerful knowledge, and their talents 
              and spells are focused on this goal. They are able to use potent 
              spells not only to see things from afar, but to transport themselves 
              and others to those distant locations as well. The wizards' thirst 
              for arcane knowledge has also made them the true masters of the 
              most effective form of defense: offensive spells of pure destruction. 
              In their ability to do magical damage, they have no rivals. (The 
              History of Norrath, Verant International)</p>
            <p><b>Wood Elf (Fier`Dal)</b><br>
              Wood elves appear somewhat human at first glance, but their very 
              sharp features and pointed ears set them apart. Elves are weaker 
              than humans, but more than make up for this with their amazing agility 
              and superior dexterity. They equal the high man in their intelligence 
              and wisdom, but are much more fair and charismatic. Wood elves make 
              their homes high up in the trees which provide them not only safety, 
              but a view of their cherished woodlands. </p>
            <p>Being in tune with nature, wood elves gravitate toward &quot;nature&quot; 
              professions. Their high charisma, dexterity, and agility come in 
              handy for those who hear the call of the muse and become bards. 
              Their admiration and respect of nature allows them to serve as druids, 
              or become rangers. Of course, a strong arm is sometimes needed, 
              so some Fier`Dal become warriors. And of course, it would be such 
              a waste not to put that high dexterity and agility to proper use, 
              so the wood elf makes for a very talented rogue.</p>
            <p><b>Wolves of the North </b><br>
              The warriors of Halas are otherwise known as the Wolves of the North 
              under the leadership of Kylan O'Danos. They are opposed to the Rogues 
              of the White Rose, the rogues of Halas. The Wolves of the North 
              support the Merchants of Halas and the Steel Warriors of Freeport 
              and Qeynos. </p>
            <p><b>Yelinak</b><br>
              King of Dragons in Skyshrine</p>
            <p><b>Zlandicar</b><br>
              &quot;The Eater of Dragons.&quot; Zlandicar went into the Dragon 
              Necropolis and ate the bones of dead Jaled Dar, thus getting around 
              the law of the Dragons not to harm their own kind.</p><p><a href="http://www.planeteq.com/features/roleplaydictionary/dictionaryae.shtml">Dictionary
