			">The Good Old Days<br>
              by Kolanin</font></b></p>
            <p> I was playing my Druid not long ago, and had to run through the 
              East Commonlands for some reason or another, and was stunned as 
              a realization struck me. There were no players auctioning anything 
              at all, it was like walking into a ghost town. Even the calls for 
              group members for the Orc camps there were absent for the most part. 
              I decided to stick around for a while, tracking low level characters 
              there and buffing them with Druid goodness.<br>
              <br>
              While I was busying myself with that, I started talking to the people 
              in the zone about the old days of the EC Tunnel, when /auc's came 
              so fast and steady, that you were constantly scrolling back up, 
              looking for that one item that caught your eye. Players had even 
              formed a firm etiquette for how you could auction your wares, and 
              there was little tolerance for that one urgent salesperson who wanted 
              more attention by using /shout instead. The realization that those 
              days were gone when someone chimed into the /ooc conversation asking; 
              &quot;What are you guys talking about? Is the EC tunnel here?&quot; 
              I got a few laughs as I replied; &quot;Only in spirit, my friend.&quot; 
              I moved on to complete the errand I was undertaking, and began thinking 
              of all the other things that have gone by.<br>
              <br>
              Much later, after some hunting, I was setting up my trader and realized 
              something about the Bazaar. With weight being a factor in the old 
              EC tunnel, prices were limited, there's no way you could carry 50,000 
              platinum all the way from Freeport to the EC tunnel without the 
              help of at least a couple of burly friends. With the removal of 
              the weight restrictions in the Bazaar, however, why not charge 50,000 
              platinum for a Cobalt Breastplate? I'm not saying I don't like the 
              bazaar, but I find the prices are largely inflated, and if you can 
              come up with that much platinum, you probably deserve the equipment 
              you're buying.</p>
            <p>One glaring example is the abandoned boats that still drift across 
              the various bodies of water on Norrath. I met a good number of people 
              while taking the boat from Butcherblock to Freeport, sure it was 
              simply boring half the time, and I was really reading a good book 
              while checking the screen occasionally, but the only reason anyone 
              would take that boat now, is if you don't have Planes of Power, 
              Luclin, or the platinum for a teleport.<br>
              <br>
              There is another thing; the biggest platinum makers were Druids 
              and Wizards once upon a time. They would ply their trade in a great 
              number of zones, offering teleports in trade for a &quot;donation&quot; 
              that was often &quot;not required, but appreciated.&quot; You can 
              still make platinum doing this, but I don't find it's worth the 
              time anymore. One of the good things about the addition of common, 
              convenient transportation is that there are many zones that are 
              largely ignored, since it's such a long journey to them from any 
              &quot;PoK Book&quot;, or &quot;Spire.&quot; The other day I was 
              asked; &quot;Where is Unrest?&quot; by someone who had never been 
              there after raising one character all the way up to level sixty 
              five, and another into his forties. The days of making one thousand 
              platinum in under two hours from teleports are gone, my Druid and 
              Wizard friends.<br>
              <br>
              The addition of easy transportation in Everquest has changed the 
              game irrevocably, and to be honest, I don't mind one bit. According 
              to several interviews I've read, the old developers for Everquest 
              have been slowly replaced by a new breed. This happens in any workplace, 
              and it's not surprising, as being one of the first programmers for 
              the most commonly played on line role playing game must be one hell 
              of a good tidbit on your resume. The new programmers, and this is 
              something I've seen in many interviews as well, are mostly players 
              themselves, and know well the pain of getting a level twenty nine 
              cleric from Mistmoore all the way to Overthere. Now you can simply 
              Gate to the Plane of Knowledge, then click on the Overthere Stone. 
              Minimize travel time? Increase the pleasure and pace of game play? 
              Why not? I'm all for it, especially when I don't have the time to 
              play like I used to. I'm sure the new programmers for Everquest 
              don't have as much time either, considering how frenzied the pace 
              is rumored to be over there.</p>
            <p>There is one more significant change I'd like to mention here, 
              and that's there removal of &quot;Hell Levels&quot;. This is where 
              you would have a grand old time getting all the way up into your 
              thirties, and then you hit, say, level thirty nine. You run off, 
              gleefully buy your spells (if you use spells with your class), then 
              return to the group only to find that after an hour of hunting the 
              same things as you were before, that your experience bar seems to 
              be stuck at zero. Hours pass, and finally, you're seeing a little 
              bit of experience there. Most often players would go off and find 
              something else to hunt, a little higher level, and often more risky. 
              If you don't die several times as your group tries to bite off a 
              little more than it normally chews, you quickly realize you've hit 
              a Hell Level. This is where it takes several times the experience 
              to get through your current level, as it did to get through your 
              previous one. No, not say, 10%, 30%, or even 70% more, but, and 
              this may be off a little, more like 300% more. <br>
              <br>
              From what I understand, one of the reasons for this was to slow 
              down your level advancement so your skills could catch up, which 
              in itself isn't a bad idea, but the time investment it took to get 
              through that Hell Level was so much greater, and the frustration 
              for some people was endless. The most common approach to getting 
              through a Hell Level was to go off and try to hunt creatures that 
              were much higher level, and very dangerous. Of coarse death would 
              result quite often, thus making the level that much more hellish. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Quite some time ago, around the introduction of the Luclin expansion, 
              hell levels were removed, and they now adhere to the normal experience 
              progression of all other levels. I've heard people dispute this, 
              but believe me, it's in the patch history (on www.eqlive.com), hell 
              levels are gone, and so is one more thing to blame your bad luck 
              on. Now, the term Hell Level is still used, but these days it refers 
              to a level you're having a lot of trouble (and in which death is 
              so common that it's normality), getting through. Normally this is 
              because of the players you're hunting with, the spot you're hunting 
              in, or your own hunting style, or lack thereof. </p>
            <p>There have been a great number of other, more obvious changes, 
              such as the new graphics that came with Luclin, the new level cap 
              of sixty five, armor dying, the new user interface, the addition 
              of charms, and many free zones, such as Jagged Pine Forest and Stonebrunt. 
              There are even rumors that Sony Online Entertainment is working 
              on new Epic Items (often referred to as Epic 2.0), and that we can 
              expect to see a few new free zones in the next few months. Now, 
              don't take my word for it, those are just rumors, but one of the 
              changes that is coming involves the complete revamping of bow usage 
              in Everquest, which will make Rangers directly accountable for the 
              damage they do from a distance. That in itself should be interesting, 
              and it leaves me wondering what other changes are on the horizon 
              other than pathing corrections that are currently being made on 
              the test server. I, and I'm sure I'm not alone in this, see a bright 
              future for Everquest, and am very much keeping my eyes and ears 
              open for the new, as I enjoy the already rich and vast world of 
              Norrath.</p>
