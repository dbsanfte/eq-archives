              Talendor dies in epic manner <br>
              Posted by Grasnalg On Feb 19 2002 At 4:58:51 PM <br>
              CoG teamed up with SA as we took down Talendor in a quick and easy 
              fashion. Loot was split up between the two guilds with SA getting 
              an RBB, one set of gauntlets of fiery might, Druid spell Spirit 
              of Oak and Cleric spell Word of Redemption, while CoG came away 
              with:</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Necro spell - Demi lich - Lowkii</p>
            <p>Necro spell - Enslave Dead - Rigormortica</p>
            <p>Gaunts of Fiery Might - Razorclaw</p>
            <p>and SA gave us their last loot(thanks SA), which was:</p>
            <p>Wizard spell Vengeance of Al'Kabor - Sirturo</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Gratz to all the above mentioned and a big thanks to SA for the 
              fun and chance to do something together. You were all fun to be 
              around and did a great job. Thanks again for the generosity also.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>After Talendor was taken out, we move to Burning Woods where Ixiblat 
              Phir was made short work of. This moves Meff to one step within 
              his epic. Gratz Meff.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>One last stop on the epic train as CoG went to Steamfont to get 
              Allegory one step closer to his epic. Gratz Al.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Gratz and thanks to all who attended.<br>

              Another guild was clearing fear tonight, so we had another open 
              experience night. Killed Uulump for Yazz and now within Faydedar 
              of epic.</p>

              The real Trakanon was up this evening and we decided to take him 
              down. Excellent job fighting down to the lair and great job on the 
              battle. Trak collapsed into a pile of rotting flesh with minimal 
              losses to our small force of 33. Drops were 2 SK Breastplates (the 
              one class we have no members of), 4 teeth [Groovit, Greymask, Shcammer, 
              and Khallin], and some very nice spell drops. Although it took a 
              while to kill him, we made off with some incredible spells and the 
              glory of beating this foul wurm.</p>
            <p>Grats to Valstorm for making 60!</p>
            <p>FEB 17, 2002<br>
              Raid on Dragon Necropolis this afternoon. Several nice gem drops 
              and some other nice loots: Spirit Talkers Headdress [Denor], 4 Pabella 
              Fetish, and several batskull earrings. </p>
            <p>FEB 16, 2002<br>
              Grats to Chadmoe for making 60!</p>
            <p>Small group killed VSR this morning. Both Gilthanus and Maemura

            Ianya, Jonzer, Swadi, Behrine, Behru and Ligoris have all hit new 
            levels recently and have put in a terrible<br>
            amount of time. 
            <p>Congrats to Andorean for advancing her blacksmithing skills and 
              completing the Green Dragon Scale bp quest.<br>
              Its an awesome piece.</p>
            <p>We smacked around Kael this past weekend and walked away with some 
              nice loot drops. Eraserd and Qwexton<br>
              cleaned up a bit.</p>
            <p>Sirens Grotto took a beating earlier in the week and Ianya made 
              out like a phat cat with the netted kelp. <br>
              Also shared some of the wealth with Kithov and Aliciarose.</p>
            <p>We spilled some blood in Dragon Necro as well recently but had 
              no good loot drops. That is either an all or<br>
              nothing type zone. We did pick up some decent loot in Sirens on 
              the way to DN.</p>
            <p>Qwexton and Ligoris took steps forward on their epics as well. 
              Congrats to them.</p>
            <p>Killed a few cavemen on the moon and picked up nice loots there 
              as well. Congrats to Andruew, Ianya, and Katslayer.<br>

              Royal rumble part two - ShadeStorm (2/17/2002 1:26 PM) <br>
              <br>
              the two that im aware of that is. The melee and caster one. Melee 
              one there was just so much love for xate that they all gangbanged 
              him in the first 10 minutes(how he lasted 10 minutes is something 
              of a mystery). So we lost that one ;/ Caster one we asked the gm 
              a simple question, does caster mean ANYBODY who can cast spells 
              via a spell book? The answer was YES. Seeing we didnt have some 
              of our melee in the melee one(slackers), we threw them in the caster 
              one ;&gt; I started off with a pb ae just to see how many were slow....found 
              out over half the casters were slow ;&gt; Side effect was...i had 
              every bloody pet on me. Well after we killed anybody non EOD, we 
              went after each other. You think being GM of the damn guild people 
              would well let me win, but so much h8 for me ;/ Winner was Halon 
              an SK. <br>

              <br>
              Seems tonite the gms had a few royal rumbles. We won both the sk 
              and necro one, and lost to the druid one because stormy likes to 
              hug tigers ;&gt; Winners were Halon, and Adios. Congrats Guys<br>

              NToV first encounter! <br>
              And WHAT an encounter! Trial period from wednesday to friday. With 
              a little trouble here and there, we managed to get it going on thursday, 
              wednesday was just a nightmare of nothing. Friday passed, killed 
              Eashen finally and got our asses on rotation, and from there it 
              just rolled on. All dragons killed on first attempt except from 
              Eashen and Dok (didn't have time to try Vyemm, and patch was today 
              again). So something to be proud of! Click Read more for pics. <br>

              Solid Day <br>
              Posted By: Thornsong on 20 February 2002</p>
            <p>Today we had a serverfirst. Always a solid day when that happens. 
              We started the day off at Tormax. Took him down rather easily I'm 
              told (started before I got home from work). Grats Kampf on Tormax 
              Belt and guildfund on monk bracer.</p>
            <p>Then we moved onto Ssra. Down goes the glyphed - down goes the 
              exiles - down goes the creator.</p>
            <p>The creator is a tough guy. You think we would be amply rewarded. 
              Two different paladin weapons drop!?! No paladins there for us. 
              Grats Tammelin in EOD on your toys.</p>
            <p>Then we took out the Archlich. Was a fun fight. Grats Zith on your 
              new helm of goodness. Having a ranger breaking 1450 AC is wrong.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p> Tunare 2.0 Falls <br>
              Posted By: Thornsong on 19 February 2002</p>
            <p>Clearing POG is a pain but since the server hiccuped yesterday 
              and it was a holiday for some, we took advantage of that and cleared 
              POG and downed Tunare 2.0.<br>
              At first we were excited cause she wasn't wielding. Then someone 
              aggroed her and she respawned in the forest wielding a rogue dagger 
              and a whip. Since the whip is ghey (or actually cause she despawned), 
              we aggroed her again and this time she spawned with a bard sword 
              and a staff. So I guess her loot table is reassigned each time you 
              aggro her. So for those really bored ....</p>
            <p>Anyway, she went down after we figured out how to deal with her 
              knockback effect. Fourth try I believe. (We are Relentless) Grats 
              to Fflewdeur on your bard sword and Archimedez on your ensnare staff. 
              Also Ugrenom picked up an Assassin's BP.</p>
            <p>Since it was still early, 10:30 pm pst -- we ran to Ssra and with 
              a skeleton crew took out Rhaug Mozdeth who was the only one up. 
              F this delayed spawn crap. Magnuss got some 15/22 dagger for his 
              bank and Fane got a new range slot. Good part of the night was Ganar's 
              clarity ho can now buff me for much longer on driveby crack donations. 
            </p>
            <p>We also nailed another copy of C3 so you enchanters jonesing for 
              some crack look for Talzok. The bidding should go high. </p>

              Posted By: Thornsong on 17 February 2002</p>
            <p>Yesterday we raided.<br>
              First up was VP. Haven't been there in so long forgot how monotonous 
              it is. Anyway, besides Hoshkar showing up just as we zoned in, the 
              clear went smoothly.</p>
            <p>Loot of note was a Rend Robe for Talzok, a Robe of the Azure Sky 
              for Ratskeller and a Shroud of Veeshan for Ganar. We also pulled 
              out three copies of demilich so all our necros are kitted out now 
              and then some.</p>
            <p>After VP, we headed to Great Divide for our second attempt at a 
              ring war. The first didn't go to well as we didn't even have a full 
              group that was non-kos. This time about half the squads were non-kos 
              and we worked the giants pretty good. Grats Mintern on his 10th

              Are your clerics uber?<p>
              Well we've been pretty easy on our clerics lately and not really 
              pushing them too hard. I mean all we've been requiring them to do 
              is heal on average 8 people a piece and count to 2 or 3 on AoW raids. 
              =P So we decided they needed a real test to show their stuff. Enter 
              Lady Mirinella. This wench is usually not any sort of an issue for 
              us. We've killed her flawlessly and even a couple times with 2-6 
              adds during the fight without really breaking a sweat. Last night 
              however we got to play with Lady M 2.0 and while shes no different 
              besides the &quot;loose root&quot; which keeps her from being pulled 
              too far out of her lair, our new positioning on her needed a little 
              work. =)</p>
            <p>
              We started the fight and just about every single melee promptly 
              ran out of range and subsequently died. You might be thinking how 
              is this a good test of our clerics if they let people die? Well 
              I'll tell you. First we went from about 25 melees down to about 
              5 pretty quickly. A couple monks, a ranger and an SK kept Lady M 
              busy while we dragged all the melees back, ressed them and MGB'd 
              them, then slapped em on the ass and sent them back into battle. 
              Most died again but have no fear, super SK and ranger were there! 
              I believe Kyrthor and Soulvoid each counted about 10-12 CH's that 
              hit them with less than 100 hps left while we recovered enough to 
              lay the smack down on her. While shes not a massive dps mob she 
              can lay a nice smack down especially when we miss her dmg shield 
              with 2 annulls! /boggle. Eventually the wench dropped after most 
              of the melees had gone down once or twice. While this is not the 
              recommended tactic to use for every fight I have to admit it made 
              that fight the most fun fight of the night. Anyway if you want to 
              really see what your clerics are made out of, kill all your tanks 
              and melees except a few, drag the corpses under a tough mob and 
              then engage! Loads of fun for the whole family. =)</p>
            <p>When the dust finally cleared we had taken out Eashen, Ikatiar, 
              Aaryonar, Feshlak, Dagarn, Kreizenn, Vyemm, Koi'Doken and Mirinella 
              in about 5 and a half hours. Not a landspeed record but not too 
              bad being a little light on clerics for the night and having to 
              learn the differences with the new rooting of Lords and Ladies as 
              well as how to pull the area without beads.</p>
            <p>Sunday we killed Ikatiar, Eashen, Aaryonar, Feshlak, Dagarn, and 
              Kreizenn before calling it a night and getting trapped in our camp 
              spot by the server crash and respawn. Saturday we warmed up with 
              a fear and CT clear followed by a Dozekar, Lendinara and Sleepers 
              Tomb clear. Congrats to Genevra on your new Robe of Ispiration, 
              Mads on his Brain, Khemosahbe on his Brain, Kerlen on his Cloak 
              of the Fearsome, Aliudyen on his prismatic scale, Tangor on his 
              Primal Claidmore, and Carrot on his Primal Bow. On Friday we took 
              down the Glyph Covered Serpent to get Diabolus a nice Rancorous 
              Skull of Szaldrezh and then headed over to Akheva to kill the Itraer 
              Vius. Congrats to Jackedd on his Vex Xi Vius and Doggl on his Sunbeam.</p>
            <p>On Thursday we dropped Rhag`Mozdezh and Rhag'Zhezum before getting 
              wind of a Tunare spawning. Naturally she is now Tunare 2.0 the uncheesable. 
              Gotta love having encounters nerfed just before you get around to 
              taking advantage of how easy they were. Oh well we like a challenge. 
              In any case we started too late to clear the zone so we just dropped 
              the majority of the named in the zone figuring we would come back 
              the next day and finish up. Nuh uh didnt happen. Tunare knew she 
              wasnt going to last another day and promptly hiked up her skirts 
              and despawned. What a pansy. =( We'll get her later this week I 
              expect.<br>
