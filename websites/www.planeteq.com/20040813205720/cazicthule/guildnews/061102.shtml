              So it hasn't been a very busy week for us in EQ, but a few nice 
              things have happened to a few nice people. Congratulations to Chec 
              and Biran on completing their shaman epics. Also we went to Hate 
              for some cleric armor and Magi P'tasa staff.
            <p> </p>
            <p>Unfortunately the Magi didn't give up his staff, but Caeld was 
              able to fit into an Apothic Robe, and a ranger stone dropped too.<br>

              Customer Service in action!!! <br>
              Posted by: Druss on Tuesday, June 4th, 2002 @ 12:46 AM<br>
              Mad Props to GM Tilol and his L337 Customer service skills. </p>
            <p>So...as we prep to do the cursed, a rival guild &quot;races&quot; 
              us to do him as well. To make up for the fact that they lack the 
              numbers to do him...they decided to exploit one of the trigger mobs. 
            </p>
            <p>The GM's solution? Roll the dice.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Sure thing. So, we win the roll for the Cursed...and find out the 
              other guild has despawned him while the GM was mediating. </p>
            <p>Tilol, however, was there to set things right! Too bad my screenshots 
              of this turned out like crap. </p>
            <p>Tilol shouts &quot;If I receive any more petitions this evening 
              about spawn disputes in this zone, I'm going to clear the zone and 
              you will not be allowed back in for 24 hours. So I suggest you work 
              spawns out like adults&quot;. </p>
            <p>Well gee, thanks Tilol! The spawn's gone now, k, thx. Good game, 
              sir! The random your guide enacted was ignored. </p>
            <p>They'll be other Cursed spawns. We managed to do some more key 
              farming, so the night wasn't a total loss. I just wanted to make 
              sure that GM Tilol knows that Cohort salutes his wisdom, dedication, 
              patience, and diplomacy in dealing with this matter. And that we 
              know in the future we can count on him to Do absolutely NOTHING 
              but express his irritation at being bothered. </p>
            <p>And yes, I know Tilol checks this page. What's he gonna do? Hold 
              this little rant against us by ruling against us in a spawn dispute? 
              Even Volot used to handle this crap better... </p>
            <p>Enough bitching and moaning...on with the week in review!!! </p>
            <p>So CC and Talons started the week out by sailing through the dragons 
              of ToV North, and much phat lewt abounded, much too much to list. 
              Oh the Uberness... </p>
            <p>We followed that up with a smackdown of Tunare. Its amazing how 
              such a small change in tactics can have such a large impact- this 
              was easily our smoothest kill of her ever. We got her to 35% before 
              we had our first death, and ended with about 6 deaths total. Congrats 
              to Murf on his Girdle of Living Thorns, Pava and Tanarra on their 
              &quot;Nature's Melody(s)&quot;. </p>
            <p>Follow this up with another sucessful ring war, for Parr. Once 
              again, all 5 hero's lived, loot got banked and sold, yada yada yada. 
            </p>
            <p>The Dain died again (/yawn), and Fayda is the proud owner of a 
              rotting dorf head, which someday will become a rather nifty belt. 
            </p>
            <p>Sunday afternoon rolled around, and we realized something was amiss. 
              There was great imbalance in the universe. A &quot;good&quot; god 
              had fallen, leaving the Evil gods free reign over Norrath. Only 
              one thing could restore peace and balance to our souls... </p>
            <p>Or maybe we were just bored on a sunday afternoon... </p>
            <p>Anyway...this poor excuse for a god died to the bored folks killing 
              time waiting for the LA/Sac game to come on. The amazing thing here 
              was...even though we knew his loot table from the spoiler sites, 
              I still wasn't prepared at how truly crappy his drops were until 
              I saw them with my own eyes. </p>

            <p>Redracer, our good friend from Project Eon sent a tell requesting 
              assistance with Ragefire and our guild responded quickly and with 
              good numbers to go help out in Skyfire. Ragefire was killed quickly 
              and efficiently, with a CoG group getting the kill! WTG guys! Stay 
              tuned as the continuing saga develops!!</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>After Ragefire was dealt with, everyone headed back to ToV. At 
              the end of our run, we accumulated the following armor pieces:</p>
            <p>Plate Greaves(warrior) - Bladestrike(Last piece he needed I believe, 
              gratz Blade)<br>
              Silk Bracer(necro) - Lowkii(Lowkii Lowroll steals away with more 
              silk)<br>
              Leather Gloves - Guild bank(again)<br>
              Leather Legs(druid) - Devraider(He can finally shed those raw silk 
              ones he's been wearing)<br>
              Plate Gauntlets - Guild bank(yes, I said guild bank for plate again. 
              Miracles will never cease)<br>
              Plate Helm(warrior) - Madix(befitting for an Ogur)<br>
              Silk Arms(magician) - Ztalten(last piece he needed for his full 
              set, gratz Z)<br>
              And our big winner of the night was:</p>
            <p>Chain Breastplate(ranger) - Varrak(He's been waiting a long time, 
              not as long as Rut did, but still, a long time. Gratz V and also 
              to Madix whom V is passing his old tunic to. Nice gesture V, that's 
              what being a good guildie is all about.)<br>
              One last note of interest. Draconal in his continuing quest and 
              obsession with his epic managed to finish not one, but two more 
              parts of his life long quest. With a little help from some friends 
              and one of them being Aaneck running Drac, they were able to take 
              down Verina Tomb and later in the night when Vessel Drozlin spawned 
              in Cabillis, we were lucky enough to get the forces necessary there 
              to kill him and take his rod(not a nice thing to do to a dead Iksar). 
              Gratz Drac!</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>***Edited by the Power of Neazariit***Drac also let us know that 
              the tangrin was up, so secured a third piece of his lifelong quest 
              when a crack squad of cogs helped him to fell the big ape. He now 
              has one piece remaining. ***End edit***<br>

              Drops on our first night in ToV were pretty exciting and heavy. 
              I'll break them down by type and class to help keep it easier to 
              read. I hope this doesn't take up the whole front page. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Drops were as follows:</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Chain boots - Allegory(rogue)<br>
              Plate bracer - Grisnalg(shadowknight)<br>
              Plate gaunts - guild bank(yes, you heard right, guild bank)<br>
            </p>
            <p>If we can match this kind of output on our next few trips, we'll 
              only have to go back another 20,193 times and we'll be done! j/k, 
              it was fun and we're getting there. First time ever that we had 
              a plate drop go to the bank.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Nice job, no wipes and pretty easy going night. Seeya all tomorrow!<br>

              TOV got off to a shaky start with a couple of wipes, but after the 
              sacrificial Pallies were offered things started moving.</p>

              Grats to Denor for finishing the Shaman epic! At the same time as 
              the CoM raid, we broke into Fear and proceeded to clear the zone. 
              Lot of BP drops, too bad no one needed them.
            <p>JUN 08, 2002<br>
              Grats to Dreamthief for reaching 60!</p>
            <p>JUN 07, 2002<br>
              Cleared out Fear this evening for some epic loots: Broken Golem 
              [Minmin], Amy whip [Kilwean], and Shissar [Kestel]. After that, 
              we went to Kael arena to slay giants once again and came away with 
              chain legs, plate legs, and a plate bp.</p>
            <p>JUN 06, 2002<br>
              Killed both Severilous and Talendor today. Sev was stingy and dropped 
              a dragon bone bracer [Chadmoe], Pouch [Greymask], and 6 spells - 
              no green scale though. We followed that up with Talendor, but no 
              books. Loots from these raids, even with our mana burning crew, 
              is always given to guildmates - and are never sold. These two kills 
              on top of a big dungeon crawl of Grieg's End. If you have never 
              done a crawl of a dungeon before, you are really missing out. We've 
              gotten much faster as a guild on quick assembly and rapid fire take 
              out of the Kunark dragons. We have killed all 4 within the past 
              3 days - and yes, we are killing them because we want the items, 
              not to sell them.</p>
            <p>JUN 05, 2002<br>
              We decided to raid the Hole to get a slew of needed epic items. 
              We quickly fought our way down to Nortlav and dispatched the rusty 
              weilding fighter. Grats to Kilwean for the Red Dragon Scale. Also 
              killed many other epic mobs on the way back up for everyone else 
              who needed something.</p>
            <p>JUN 04, 2002<br>
              As a guild, we have been working hard and refining our tactics. 
              Looking back on the last few months, we have steadily moved up the 
              ladder of difficulty, and tonight was no exception. Coming off last 
              nights two dragon raids, we wanted more. First, we decided to make 
              our first attempt on Vindicator, and we were wildly successful. 
              Loots were: Head [Tomwin], and Boots of the Vindicator [Awll].</p>
            <p>After we plowed Vindicator into dust, we decided to make our first 
              attempt on Velketor. With no one with any prior experience with 
              the fight, we still managed to kill him. Two big mobs in one night 
              - again. Loots were: Shield of Freezing Wind [Chadmoe], Vermillion 
              of Refraction [Mmatil], Crystal Crown of Confusion [Jarheuu], and 
              5 spells.</p>
            <p>JUN 03, 2002<br>
              The dragon hunting force was in full swing last night. We started 
              in Dreadlands with Gorenaire, and dispatched the dragon with much 
              fanfaire. Drops were nice for epics: WDS [Kilwean] and 2 Frost Books 
              [Hawkien, Khandrahcir]. After Gore, we decided to do Juggs for more 
              spells, only to discover that Trakanon himself was up. We then decided 
              to dispatch him as well and killed him in record time. Drops were: 
              Jaundice BP [Khallin], Deepwater BP [Chadmoe] and 2 Teeth [Brewall, 
              Mmatil]. Along the way, we also managed to get 2 Dragon Sinews [Greymask, 
              Kestel]. After Trak, we then rolled on some extra Kael armour to 
              MQ: Plate legs [Tico], Plate arms [Kilwean], and Plate gaunt [Zypheal]. 
              Excellent raiding by everyone with very minimal deaths (ZERO deaths 
              on Gore and just 2 on Trak).<br>

              After a rough start in Kael (100+ peeps in zone) we beamed over 
              to the Hole. We rumbled very deep real quick and then ran into a

              drops after holding the camp for most of the day. Grats to Somnus 
              who snagged some arms, Houfter picked up an Idol, Flammin picked 
              up one, and a few other &quot;trinkets&quot; like Jonzer grabbing 
              a centi long sword.<br>

            <p>I think that we can all say that the High Priest encounter is nothing 
              short of spectacular. This one took teamwork and coordination, and 
              even though we almost lost, we kept pushing and somehow we ended 
              up victorious. Props to my guild and allies, this shit wouldn't 
              die if it weren't for you fine folks.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Yep, we cleared NToV this weekend. Our placement of mobs was less 
              than spectacular, but hell, we still made it through, Vyemm died 
              first shot, and the loot failed to suck. We even had time to try 
              the RoVulak. We died, of course, otherwise there would be a big 
              fat picture of Mr. Vulak on this page right now. </p>
            <p>That's it for the news, so that means it's quote time.</p>

              Tuesday - May 28, 2002 - Demana Azulene </p>
            <p>Well, folks, it's been a slow week or so. Between the school year 
              ending, Star Wars, and a holiday weekend, we've been lucky to get 
              enough on to raid Crushbone, let alone something really cool. Meanwhile, 
              the trade skill bonanza is slowly drawing to a close--because those 
              of us who have been working on them non-stop are slowing going insane 
              and are being forced to stop due to doctor's orders. Some of us 
              went all out:</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Anyway, sometime last night, our very own Tarrath completed his 
              8th shawl. Grats, it's very well deserved.</p>
            <p>Between protecting dwarves and tailoring new clothing, we went 
              into Veeshan's Peak to kill Silverwing. Screenshot ninjas stole 
              the picture I took, so I have no proof of our leet kill. We also 
              killed this guy:</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Ok, I lied. Cinno soloed him while we watched. Cinno's brave efforts 
              got us a Donal's for the High Priest Stumpyman, and a shadowknight 
              bp for EC tunnel :p What can I say? We were REALLY, REALLY bored.</p>
            <p>It's not been entirely dull since our last update though:</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Loots were particularly phat--some monkeys got some new red pants, 
              a certain shadowknight is wielding a flamberge, a pasty wizard got 
              a new robe, and some of our clerics got decked out in some new jewelry 
              and sweaters. </p>
            <p>Anyway, that's all for now. Hopefully, stuff will spawn, we'll 
              kill it, and Chadd will continue to send me tells to load up my 
              hard drive. Speaking of Chadd...</p>

            <p>Chadd's explanation for the &quot;disappearance&quot; of our raid 
              channel. And honestly, it's the most reasonable one we were able 
              to come up with :p</p>

            <p>Due to his special capabilities, we are now granting Sanglant Jones 
              special &quot;double membership&quot; because, as you can see above, 
              he's more than just one paladin. </p>

              Killed blood defeated Portugal (apparently this is important for 
              Euro's and gay Americans as nobody else really cares).</p>
            <p>Was a really good Emperor fight as well, another round or two and 
              he should die. While it is an interesting encounter I feel zero 
              excitment over it the way I did with many of the Velious mobs. Anyone 
              associated in any way with Luclin should pretty much just be shot.</p>

              June 5, 2002:</p>
            <p>Cold winds blow through the halls of Caer Bythol stirring the fallen 
              leaves and signalling a time of reflection and investigation. Strange 
              bits of news have filtered into the hands of House Zebulun regarding 
              an ancient temple of the Ssraeshza. Located in an airless wasteland, 
              the temple beckons to us to be explored. House Zebulun will be mustering 
              their forces and will be seeking to uncover the mysteries of Ssraeshza 
              Temple on Friday (9 pm EST) and Saturday (8pm EST) nights.</p>
            <p>PROMOTIONS</p>
            <p>A chorus of raucous cheers rang through the Caer in celebration 
              of the promotion of Imlarin as an Officer in the house. Imlarin 
              has been working closely with Matriarch Tayzia and she has seen 
              the wisdom in assigning him his additional duties. Congratulations 
              to Imlarin and to the House as the recipient for his exceptional 
              skills!</p>
            <p>EPICS</p>
            <p>A discordant song was silenced in a pitched battle between the 
              House and the Dark. Rising from the din of that battle, a new song 
              filled with hope and vigor was heard with rising strength and clarity. 
              As eyes turned towards the powerful song, the image of a beaming 
              Acappella was revealed to the House and guests. Congratulations 
              to Acappella on the completion of the House's first Bard Epic on 
              5/29/02!!</p>
            <p>Another epic was partially completed as the dashing Ranger Palinjolith 
              received his first epic sword, Swiftwind on 5/26. He will soon be 
              acquiring his second blade pending a raid into the streets of the 
              Plane of Hate. Congratulations Palinjolith!!</p>

              Had another perfect Blood kill last night. The Emperor attempt, 
              however, did not go so well. Every attempt gets better though, so 
              it wasn't looked upon as a loss by any means.<br>
              Verant keeps changing this encounter. Tactic refinement is a serious 
              bitch when everytime you attempt a mob like the Emperor, with a 
              cut &amp; dried plan, it turns out different. Hopefully they can 
              pull each others' heads out of their asses and leave him be for 
              a bit. At any rate, through all of the changes we experience on 
              a regular basis with this mob, we continue to improve at each attempt.<br>

              A completely sick day for the BFA. We couldn't be stopped, and everyone 
              was totally on top of their game. Just to give you a little peek 
              at the action, here's a list of some of the gimps who were slaughtered 
              tonight:</p>
            <p>Rhag's 1 &amp; 2 - Grats Valde on Focus Crystal, Carnor on Righteousness, 
              and Jekhar on Crystal of Interpretation.<br>
              Arch Lich - Grats Bonshee on Pristine Jade Idol.<br>
              The Creator - Grats Jashtere on Dagger of Entrapment and Soel on 
              a rotting headband.<br>
              Runed - Grats Nickk on your Skull Ring.<br>
              Glyphed X 2 - Grats me on a new ring and Athren on Blazing Rapier.<br>
              Exiled X 2 - Grats Duron and Ianin on your Braided Strands of Corrupted 
              Mana.</p>
            <p>And my personal favorite of the night, Vyzh'dra the Cursed. Second 
              time ever(both times by us ) to be taken down on the Cazic-Thule 
              server, this fight was ballZ out madness.</p>
            <p>The entire fight took over half an hour from start to finish. Major 
              props are due to our healing crew for making the seemingly impossible, 
              possible. Check out our main tankin' TRULL Foulbreath posing in 
              front of the kill. Good game man, but don't quit your day job ya 
              ugly bastard! Grats to Mesmer on your Circle of Smoke, and Faen 
              on your new pants.</p>
            <p>In other news...</p>
            <p>The Lewis/Tyson boxing match was on tonight. I have to give props 
              to Lewis for doing what every red-blooded American would love to 
              do; Kick the living shit out of Tyson. GG!<br>

            <p>News: Interesting past couple of days <br>
              posted on 06-06-2002 10:21 PM<br>
              Before yesterday&#146;s patch(s) ill side effects were realized, 
              we decided to go take out the Cursed once again in Ssra. It didn't 
              take too long to notice that channels were bugged so needless to 
              say we promptly got smooshed.<br>
              Tonight, on the other hand, was a much different story. We gathered 
              up this afternoon with the intent of taking out the Arch Lich. You 
              see, our last few visits to AL (since he has been upgraded) had 
              been a complete embarrassment in my honest opinion. Thanks to a 
              quick evolving tactic that finally turned out to be AL's demise, 
              we can all sleep easy tonight. Grats Valde on your bracer and grats 
              Crest on the sword.<br>

              Took out Blood again last night, flawless fight.<br>
              Afterwards we moved onto the Emperor, which turned into our best 
              attempt to date. I'd like to give a lot more info on this, which 
              would surely prove to be a much more interesting news update for 
              everyone out there in EQ land, but alas, I cannot.<br>
              I will tell you this much:<br>
              This bitch is going down soon. <br>

              Posted: Tue Jun 11, 2002 9:41 am<br>
              Day 81 - The day the Dwarfs were Silent<br>
              <br>
              In what was perhaps the weirdest ring war I've participated, seen 
              done, heard about, etc. was preformed last night for my 10th Coldain 
              Ring last night. No, there was not a bunch of ultra spawning giant 
              forces, that never despawned or all in human model form, but perhaps 
              something a little less exciting, to everyone but me! </p>
            <p>There is something different in actually doing this war for someone 
              else, and doing the war for yourself. Perhaps if it was for someone 
              else's ring 10, I'd have not been getting a little nervous everytime 
              a giant broke to run. Perhaps I'd not have had a near stroke when 
              one almost made it to thurg, smashing through the front line of 
              dwarfs, but to be pulled to safety by a group of valient players. 
              Its the little things and small miracles and good luck chances that 
              you begin to value when you are doing the war that you yourself 
              have triggered. </p>
            <p>Now, on to the reason why it was all weird. First, my keyboard 
              quit out just after the first wave of wave 1. So I'm stuck with 
              only mouse control, having to trade with my cleric who was on machine 
              2 to myself to enable myself to move things around to do hand ins 
              at the end. That was weird thing number 1. </p>
            <p>Number 2 was that there was no npc shouting between waves, narandi 
              didn't shout at all, and the head dwarf guy only shouted once at 
              the start to get his forces in place. </p>
            <p>Number 3 was that the time between each wave was very very very 
              very long, at times 3 times longer then it was supposed to be from 
              what I remember doing this the last time. During the early waves 
              this was a burdon, but perhaps during wave 3 where we had so many 
              near misses (well, not alot, I guess, but it seemed like that to 
              me! )). </p>
            <p>So, here comes number 4, after a 5 hour battle in very small steps, 
              we kill Narandi, I loot head, go to do my turn ins for the other 
              loot, as I had gotten my ring (glee), and I forget I have a crown 
              of narandi already, so the last turn in poofs the crown that I was 
              going to get handed to me, since they are lore items. And just my 
              luck, with the new roving GM policies, there are no GM Admins on 
              CT to take the petition since guides can do squat. So now I have 
              to pray to see if I can get this helm to give out, or it stays in 
              virtual limbo forever ;( </p>
            <p>Anyway, other then that .. Great night, Ring 10 = Omg )) </p>
            <p>Oh, capped the night off with a ghetto clear to trak (no chanter/shaman) 
              then a 10 second kill on trak (Good God wizard boom!!!). 2 Cobalt 
              BP's and lots of nice teeth (5).<br>
              <br>
            </p>
            Posted: Mon Jun 10, 2002 12:55 pm<br>Well well well well .. where to begin. 
            7 Days, new record! 
            <p>I kind of took a few days off this past week, so I'm excused from 
              updating those days, but from what I hear, we killed some first 
              broods, killed some guy in Griegs End and alot of people must of 
              died, cause no luclin raid is done without alot of people dieing! 
            </p>
            <p>Then on Wednesday I think, we killed Cazic Thule with 63 (our lowest 
              number yet!) with the combined forces of Unseen Hand and Legacy 
              of Darkness. 2 drooltastic Robes, one for our very own Nariel! And 
              Veschar got a slime blood of neverdroppyness. </p>
            <p>Then there was the patch day maddness, think we concentrated on 
              first broods, on thursday's to Friday. Umm, I can't remember, I 
              do know some unpleasantness happened on Friday with Ragefire, but 
              enough mud has been slung over that. 1 Person's choice does not 
              reflect everyone in the guild, that much I can say. Oof, what a 
              mess. </p>
            <p>On Saturday, we completed the Triple Crown of the West Wing, killing 
              Lendi the Keeper for her phat lewts, then Telk the red dragon of 
              boringness and then finally gozzerm the white dragon of other boringness, 
              but at least they dropped all useable stuff this time! Woo. Then 
              we went and cleared Sleepers and got some priceless, and got some 
              primal, a 2hb for Slashem and a 1hs for Sonk of the mini peepee. 
            </p>
            <p>Sunday was a free day, so I spent it in Droga, killing lots and 
              lots of goblins, almost 400. only 10 times more to go! Must have 
              ally chardok faction, must have the ring of *omg* and then the spirit 
              racked cords of *take my left arm*. Its not as boring as you might 
              think, you go around killing these gobs and then you somehow get 
              down to the Chief area and kill and kill and then you sometimes 
              get a lucky break and the chief spawns, and you can farm Essanses 
              of Dol's! </p>
            <p>So, thats the incorhearent, didn't make any sense, boring cause 
              I suck, update for the past week. Will this week bring any of the 
              same? Will this week bring in fantastic kills of mobs? Ohhh, only 
              time will tell, my guess is I die alot and have to get more then 
              1 blue of level 60 experience again .. teehee. </p>
            <p>Palan OUT!<br>

              Johnny Was Bad, Even As A Child Everybody Could Tell.....<br>
              And now Johnny is in charge of EQ Patches for VI.</p>
            <p>Welcome once again to Almost Anything Can Happen (AACH) day. Wait, 
              I made a small error, let me start over.</p>
            <p>Welcome to Almost Anything Can Happen Week.</p>
            <p>Those logging it today were treated to all kinds of surprises. 
              Opening your inventory was equivalent to taking 2 or 3 tabs from 
              the blue strips of acid making their way through the crowd (stay 
              away from the brown tabs, man, we have some bad brown acid going 
              around, we just need everyone to remain calm). Focus effects were 
              introduced onto pre-existing items. What Wily E Coyote SUPER genious 
              put a caster focus ability on Lady Nev's LEFT eye, you know, the 
              MELEE item? Whoever it was, I would like to see the dartboard they 
              used to select the items and effects. level 3 effects coming off 
              of easy drops from stupid places. Runed Mithril Bracer getting conserve 
              reagent 3? You must be joking.</p>
            <p>Of course, since it is AACH Week, look for more genious moves shortly, 
              such as:</p>
            <p>Swiftwind to get Reanimation Haste I<br>
              Executioners Hood to get Improved Damage III<br>
              Paladius Axe to get Summoning Efficiency III</p>
            <p>Perhaps VI will wise up and move the level III effects onto better 
              items, but until then, my condolences to every caster now looking 
              at banking half the good items they got in the past year so that 
              they can wear items they sold 2 years ago. </p>
            <p></p>
