<p>
<I>You say, 'Hail, Shmendrik Lavawalker'
<p>
Shmendrik Lavawalker says 'Hail, good Yumanea!! Be wary near the waters of Lake Rathe! The Riptide goblin king, Lord Bergurgle has been commanding his minions to murder and rob all who come near it! I am here seeking his death but I am afraid I am no match for all of his subjects. I shall reward you greatly for the death of Lord Bergurgle.  I simply ask that you bring me his crown as proof. '</I>
<p>

</center>
<p>
For this you will need enduring breath, wolf form is also a plus as it means the goblins will not agro. They will however still return the consider message "scowls ready to attack". Lord Begurgle is in an underwater cave in the middle of Lake Rathetear. The cave entrance is located at positive 2804, negative 911, negative 220. Inside the cave there is a three spawn of goblins on the top floor of the tower. The outside two are for the druid epic, the middle one is Lord Begurgle's place holder. The Goblins are all approximately level 40, conning green and light blue to a level 54. Lord Begurgle and his Place Holder are on about a 29 minute timer. Begurgle casts wrath, and complete heals. Kill Lord Begurgle and Loot from him 'Lord Begurgles Crown'

<p>
<I>Shmendrik Lavawalker shoves the crown into a scorch marked leather satchel and cackles uncontrollably as madness twists his features and flames dance in his eyes. You, Yumanea, have reduced the Riptides into chaos! Without a king to keep them in control they will ravage the settlements surrounding this lake! After the slaughter I shall return and easily burn the remainder of the villages and fishing shanties to the ground! None shall escape the fires of the Tyrant!!
<p>
You gain party experience!!
<p>
Natasha Whitewater begins to cast a spell.

<p>
Natasha Whitewater shouts 'The Triumvirate of Water has decreed your fate, Shmendrik Lavawalker!! I am here to deliver said fate!! '
<p>
Shmendrik Lavawalker says 'I'll slay you like I slaughtered your fellow missionaries! The Triumvirate can not decide the fate of a follower of the Tyrant!! '
<p>
Natasha Whitewater says 'Enough!! Your existence has come to an end! '
<p>
Shmendrik Lavawalker is overcome with madness and rage
<p>
Shmendrik Lavawalker begins to cast a spell.
<p>
Natasha Whitewater says 'This conflict has been destined by the waters of the Triumvirate! '
<p>
Shmendrik Lavawalker begins to cast a spell.</I>
<p>
Let Natasha kill Shmendrik, on top of his corpse will spawn Spirit of Flame. Kill Spirit of Flame. Contrary to everything I have read about this, Natasha did not agro the Spirit at all, leaving us free to kill him without worry. Loot from Spirit of Flame 'Damaged Goblin Crown', give this to Natasha.

Natasha Whitewater says 'I will have this crown returned to the Riptide Goblins immediately! Should you ever come across an Erudite name Omat Vastsea give him this sea shell. The waters of Norrath shimmer with awareness of your deeds here today! '</I>
<p>

</center>
<p>
Omat can be found in Timerous Deep on the island where Faydedar spawns. To get to where Omat is you need enduring breath again, as the tunnel is underwater. Head across Timerous Deep, SoW, Levitate and Enduring Breath are needed. The entrance to the first tunnel can be found at negative 11530, negative 3728. Once through this tunnel, swim until you reach the second tunnel at negative 11336, negative 1307. Head across the wooden bridge to the Inn, Omat is standing behind the Inn.

You say, 'Hail, Omat Vastsea'
<br>
Omat Vastsea bows deeply.  'I have been expecting you, Yumanea.  The waters have foretold your arrival. I am High Priest Omat Vastsea of the Triumvirate missionaries.  Please feel free to enjoy the quiet solitude of this inn.'</I>
<p>
Hand Omat the Sea Shell you just received from Natasha
<p>
<I>
Omat Vastsea says 'So, you are a friend of Natasha's? That is good to see. She is a very wise and gifted woman. The Riptide goblins have adopted a new king but are still in a vulnerable state until his subjects accept his rule. The Plasmatic Priesthood is aware of the weakened state of the Riptides and has convinced the Fire Peak goblins to strike against them. Although I do not agree with the mannerisms or actions of any goblin clan, such a war would be detrimental to all who are caught in its path. Lord Gimblox of the Fire Peak clan has been meeting with a member of the Plasmatic Priesthood in the Temple of Solusek Ro. Locate the Plasmatic Priest, hand him this statue to hinder his powers, then eliminate him and bring me his robe. '</I>
<p>

<img src="images/epic_shots/coral_statue.jpg">
</center>
<p>
You receive the 'Coral Statue of Tarew from Omat Vastsea. Take this Coral Statue to a seeker in the Temple of Solusek Ro, you need the male seeker, not the female ones.  He is at (positive 326, positive 38) he spawns at 7 A.M. and despawns at 8 P.M. game time.
<p>

<img src="images/epic_shots/seeker_spawn.jpg">
</center>
<p>
 <i>a seeker shakes violently as his hand closes on the coral statue and flames dance in the depths of his eyes! The statue begins to emit a reddish glow then shatters in a burst of a fire and smoke! The flames in the plasmatic priest's eyes vanish with the explosion and only madness remains!  'The Triumvirate thinks that destroying my spirit of flame will stop me?!!  I will kill you all now, the goblins will continue to war, and when my spirit is restored I will ensure that Ixiblat Fer consumes all of Norrath in his flames!!'
<p>
a plasmatic priest begins to cast a spell.</i>
<p>
When you give it to him, he will take it and change into a Plasmatic Priest and start attacking you.  He hits in the high hundreds and has 3000-3500 hit points.  He is level 55 and casts Complete Heal, Tremor, Annul Magic, Reckoning.  You should pull him to the zone before attacking him because his AoE Tremor makes the keepers around him attack him and if they get the kill then you loose the corpse and you must start over.  Once you have killed him, loot his Blood Soaked Plasmatic Robe.
<p>
<center>

</center>
<p>
Go to Solusek A and kill Lord Gimblox (location negative 796, negative 367).  He is a rare spawn on a 19 minute spawn timer with a placeholder (Either Large Fire Goblin or Fire Goblin Shaman).  He is only level 30 and shouldn't be hard to kill.  Loot his Lord Grimblox's Signet Ring.
<p>

</center>
<p>
Take the Blood Soaked Plasmatic Robe to Omat Vastsea, causing him to give you Orb of Frozen Water and making Natasha Whitewater spawn again in Timorous Deep.
<p>
<i> Omat Vastsea says 'You have proven yourself to be one who is willing to take responsibility for his own actions. Such a trait is desired by all deities to be present in their faithful. I pray that you had the wisdom to slay Lord Gimblox as well as the Plasmatic Priest in order to prevent further advancement of the incursion against the Riptides. Priestess Natasha awaits inside the inn for Lord Gimblox's ring, make haste for she is a busy woman and will soon depart. '
