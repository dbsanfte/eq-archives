                In the last couple of weeks we have had several raids. The most 
                noteworthy were two AoW kills, the last one being last weekend 
                with a duel BoC wielding AoW takedown. Tonight we took out the 
                XTC. Although not the best one everyone did an excellant job on 
                the takedown and recovery from multiple adds during the fight!!

              <p>Nothing really exciting happening lately. We are gearing up for 
                POP, getting a nice assortment of ancient spells, and pissing 
                off half the server with our ae bread/water summoning toys from 
                VT. </p>
              <p>Expect EW to hold some nice swimming contests soon. We promise 
                it has nothing to do with these dropping in VT. </p>
              <p> LOL, sometimes you just have to wonder who did the loot in VT. 
                Shit like +swimming, +meditate, ae summon food, etc..</p>

                witnessed with the excpection of the never-ending Luclin patch

                bard issues, again. Aggro got broken. UI's got broken. Zanbar 
                crashed every time someone linked an item stat to guildchat(was 
                funny, actually). Anyways, this patch day was teh sux!</p>

                Guess what? Yeah, another patch starting right about.. NOW(2AM 
                PST). This patch is the fix of the patch that was supposed to 
                fix the stuff addressed but broken the last re-patch of the prior 
                patch. Hopefully this coming up patch will be the last for a week 
                or two so we can get back on track killing stuff. /rude VI FIX 
                BARDS! Oh yeah, I know how to mod rod while botting a cleric during

              <p>Been a little slow the last few days. Taking a break from daily 
                website updates is nice! Also, some joker linked my guild section 
                to : http://www.gofuckyourself.com/ &lt;------ that site kicks 
                ASS!</p>
              <p><br>
                We killed Vindicator &amp; Klandicar since I last updated I think. 
                We also went to kill Sontalak but he turned up the heat on the 
                clerics and they all died. Buncha rangers died too WOOT! Sontalak 
                is going to die soon! Loots.. Ermorden got a Vindi BP &amp; Crown 
                got a Sleeper's Tomb key. Thats about it, but I'm sure we'll have 
                a big update after patch day/night is over.</p>

              <p>Started out killing Zlandicar tonight. In my secret ploy to ruin 
                Eteid's gaming pleasure I sent her in to position the mob and 
                hoped she would die. Alas, Elcarbone came in and pissed the dragon 
                off and tanked it instead. No dead ranger, but I think a cleric 
                died and maybe a chanter? /shrug</p>

                Long evening for those of use who started in DN and stayed through 
                Feshlak, but agreed by all to be alot of fun. We did some major 
                ass kicking tonight with reasonably decent numbers(no zerg like 
                lame guilds)! Next raid a ranger will die, one MUST DIE!</p>
              <p>Advice of the day -- If you are botting the MT remember to turn 
                off attack on enrage.. </p>

                <br>
                While trying to figure out what to do today we figured we could 
                check Plane of Hate for named, so we ported up a little scout 
                party 20 minutes before raid started and saw that most of the 
                minibosses and Innoruuk was up. Yay!</p>
              <p>But first things first, we all went off to Howling Stones to 
                finnish Donnels Cudgel quest, it was way overdue. Now, that went 
                fairly easy, the triggered VS and friends went down quick and 
                within an hour or so we were back in nexus and ready to port up 
                to Plane of Hate. Grats Donnel =).</p>
              <p>We owned hate, this once so scary place was not so scary anymore. 
                After clearing all the nameds on the first floor went on to the 
                second floor and cleared a way to Innys home. We cleared his house 
                and then moved upstairs to his &quot;lair&quot;.</p>
              <p>Jokers vs. Inny ... Wo would win...</p>

                <b>Plane of fear </b><br>
                <br>
                Today we went to plane of fear totally unplanned. We were asked 
                if we could help a group with CR and it turned into a smaller 
                raid. Well, actually we ended up clearing the whole plane and 
                all golems.</p>
              <p>When we broke the plane we found Fright, Terror and Dread up 
                along with the broken golem for the wizard epic. </p>
              <p>We started With about 20 people, and in the end, before we charged 
                the broken golem (really called enraged golem after it's triggered) 
                we were about 24 people.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Honestly, we were not entirely sure we could do the broken golem 
                with the force present, so we were quite happy when he went down. 
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Congratulations Kalyxx on your epic piece! </p>

                <b>Call to arms: Trakanon </b><br>
                <br>
                A group of Jokers were in Sebilis headed to Trakanon lair for 
                experience, spells and some fun only to find that Trakanon was 
                in the way.</p>
              <p>We decided to make it a call to arms, so all Jokers dropped what 
                they were doing and headed to Sebilis to try to take the bugger 
                down. Totally 21 jokers managed to come to Sebilis, so we were 
                not too many, but not bad for a tuesday evening.</p>
              <p>The reinforcements arrived and worked their way down to the lair 
                fast.</p>
              <p> After a little mishap at the first attempt when we managed to 
                get Trakanon as an add on a pull we tried again, this time we 
                charged him in spawn point and managed to kill him even though 
                about half of us or more got killed in the process (not to mention 
                the half dozen people that ended up in the shroom maze =) ). </p>
              <p>For a first time on the real Trakanon we were very satisfied 
                with the outcome, and he was generous with loot too. We learned 
                alot and I bet we will make another visit quite soon again. </p>
              <p></p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Congratulations goes to: </p>
              <p>Dorina for the Undead Dragon Sinew for the Spirit Wracked Cord 
                quest.</p>
              <p>Arnie, Meggan and Milken for the Trakanon's Tooth for the Veeshans 
                Peak key quest. </p>
              <p>Jobboom for his brand new Donal's Chestplate of Mourning! </p>
              <p>Ander for &quot;Spell: Avatar&quot; (dropped of Sebilite Protector) 
              </p>
              <p>We also got the following loot that ended up in the guildbank: 
              </p>
              <p>Blood Ember Breastplate, &quot;Spell: Lure of Ice&quot;, &quot;Spell:

                <br>
                First of all congratulations Sivass to his Epic! After a long 
                and painful Journey, Sivass finally can wield his Glowing Skull 
                Sword!</p>
              <p></p>
              <p><br>
                Afterwards we went off to Acrylia Caverns to pay the Ring of Fire 
                a visit. The first time we happened to stumble over the Ring, 
                we got wasted within 3 minutes. This time we wanted to check our 
                power and see how far we make it.<br>
                The first try was ok but very messy. Then we tried mezzing the 
                mobs and kill one by one. Since there are 3 skellies every minute 
                you got 20 seconds to target, move and kill. That didn't work 
                out and we had to abort. So the third try we split up in 2 groups 
                and killed the skellies as they popped. That was the trick. We 
                even got some time to medd between the waves. After around 40 
                or so skellies, we got behind and again had to abort. All in all 
                it sure was a success since you can't expect much more then 40 
                kills with the power we got :)</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Besides that I have to announce that half the Guild was blind 
                for a longer time and unable to carry on. The reason for it you 
                can see here... :( </p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Other then that someone gave his best in creating Inc messages...</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>...and the silly Jokers found a new channel to hang around...</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Well then, off to new adventures.</p>

              <p><b>Weekly review </b><br>
                This weekend we had some fun things planned but ... due to the 
                lack of monk (Yes we are recruiting Monks so if ur interested 
                let us know.</p>
              <p>Anyways.... we did change our schedule so that we could still 
                do some fun stuff .. So we headed to Griegs to try a named or 
                2 ... But ... We needed a key to get through the doors and .. 
                yeah you guessed it .. no key to be found.</p>
              <p>Still here's a mug shot of us travelling through GE.</p>
              <p><br>
                And here we have Wolk submitting himself to Ytrok ... it seems 
                that after his Ytrok Bashing in PoG he had something to make up 
                for :)</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>And .. then we had Sunday!</p>
              <p>Of to UP we went to try and take out some spawns there and this 
                time we were lucky to find some up. Pappi asked us to help him 
                kill Radir since he only had 4 people and since we were already 
                in the zone with about 14 he figured we might give him a hand 
                .. and we did .</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Radir was the target and he was gonna die no matter what :)</p>
              <p>It was a clean execution althou Otea killed due to sitting on 
                Radir's Spirit Spawn Spot :)</p>
              <p>Sorry Otea!</p>
              <p>He dropped some nice goodies and Pappi's guild got em all (aren't 
                we nice ;) Honestly ... we won a nice MNK/BST weapon but Pappi's 
                monk really wanted it and he arranged it with our BST that he 
                could loot it .. so Lebashe was rewarded a nice Hiero Cloak :)</p>
              <p>All in all it was a fun day ...</p>

                guild nor do I intend to start anything until the release of a 
                few game systems due to come out shortly. Once these games come 
                out, I will be starting up CR once again. If you should like to 
                join me in these new games, I would greatly like to have your 
                presence within the ranks of the guild. Until that point, the 
                news will not be posted unless something REALLY important should 
                come up. I still check the message board from time to time and 
                am still in contact with some of the old members of The Crimson 
                Rose: EQ.<br>
                See you all soon....Hopefully. :-) </p>

                September 28, 2002 </b><br>
                Well, what can I say, we've had a busy week. Started out monday 
                night by heading up to Hate in search of the Essence of a Vampire 
                for Lamy's Epic. Unfortunatly it didnt drop, Did get some nice 
                loot drops and a little chunk of cash to drop in the guild bank 
                though. Tuesday night we headed off to HoT with IO, was a great 
                night, First kill drops a silk robe and then we followed up the 
                rest of the night with Plate legs, Gloves, Arms and Helm, Another 
                silk robe (yes thats 2) and a silk hat, Leather Arms, and a Chain 
                BP. Wensday night it was off to Hate again, Tore through the zone 
                like it was nothing, and Second to last Rev we hit the jackpot, 
                Grats to Lamy on her Essence of Vampire for her wiggle stick! 
              </p>
              <p>Thursday night we were off to Burning Woods to put the flames 
                out on a overgrown elemental named Ixblat, Almost 3 perfect Kills 
                later Alagrone, Gamma and Preyy are closer to being ready for 
                Ragefire. Grats to you 3!!! Friday night it was off to the Hole, 
                Once again we tore through the zone like it was nothing using 
                no other tactic than pure brute force. Guess you will have that 
                when you got a druid pulling, and another druid reading the map 
                to get us there. Gratz to Lamy and Xector on your epic drops! 
                All in all was a good week for us, rather busy, but got alot done!! 
              </p>
              <p>Oh and once again, blasted Camera was outta film, so no pics 
                along with this update. Maybe next time my guildies will let us 
                make a quick stop a the store before we get going. </p>

                Well after many weeks of random tells from Radanet saying stufff 
                like &quot;lets go to PoA&quot;, and &quot;PoA sounds good&quot;, 
                and out of sheer boredom this weekend we finally jumped up there. 
                Once we got going though we didnt stop, after the PoA fight, a 
                couple groups jumped into Nurga, killed his spawn there, and then 
                the late night crew took over and off to LOIO we went. But it 
                was getting rather late and not many of us were left on, so sent 
                a tell out to a few friends here and there and well the pictures 
                show the outcome. Thank you to Gazamel and the pep from IO who 
                showed up to help. Gratz to Radanet on getting his Monk Epic! 
                another one down, more to go.. </p>
              <p> Also over the past few days we've been jumping on the scout 
                spawn in WW to get people their Talismans, Bracers and Robes of 
                Benevolence, other than that just hanging out and having a good 
                time :) </p>

              <p>Helloooo Shadows! Some important news for today; </p>
              <p>We are happy to announce here the wedding of our revered Guild 
                Leader Chrystian to the lovely Bexie. The wedding will take place 
                on THIS Sunday, September 29 at 10 P.M. EST in The Arena Zone 
                off Lake Rathe. Bex is currently a member of our allies, the fine 
                Samaritans of Norrath, but she will be joining us after the union, 
                and hopefully will provide a strong bond between our two guilds 
                that will be to both our advantages. All members of RoS and SoN 
                are invited, and please feel free to bring friends as well, as 
                there will be food and drink for everyone, and hopefully a little 
                music by Daekkin Gnurleytrunks &amp; the Roots of Love. We hope 
                the best for our two friends, so everyone please attend to show 
                your support!</p>

                Yeah, I know it's been awhile. Things have been a mess around 
                here, while we moved guildrip.com to a new web host. That's why 
                your news updates have been slack. </p>
              <p>Ok, that's not the real reason. I can't go on living that lie 
                anymore... It's really because NO ONE WILL EMAIL ME SCREENSHOTS. 
                A news update with no pictures is pretty damn boring, so I'm not 
                going to even bother. Finally, after a few weeks, I finally got 
                enough to give you this halfass update. Enjoy it, I guess.</p>

                Eashen skipped his dentist appointment for that funky snaggletooth

                him. Err, looks like we knocked a little too hard. Oops.</p>

                two of them in the same night. Personally, I went out right when
