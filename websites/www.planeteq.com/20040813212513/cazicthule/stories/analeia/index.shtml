<b class="heading">Analeia, Part I</b><br>
<i>by</i> Penya Dreamlight

<br><br>
“Come forward so that I may know you,” the low voice spoke softly from the shadows.
<br><br>
Analeia stepped forward hesitantly from the corner that she had been hiding. Her steel armor took on the glow of the candles that surrounded the enormous stone thrown in which sat an old man in black robes. His eyes also reflected the candlelight and Analeia could not decide if those eyes were blue or purple. Both were common to the dark elf race. Dangling at his neck was a large, gold medallion with the two circular symbols tied together with a surrounding frame of deep-red rubies and diamonds. One of the symbols Analeia recognized as the holy symbol of Innoruuk. The second symbol was unfamiliar to her, but looked like some sort of family crest.  The robed man grinned evilly at the sight of her, allowing a cold gaze to pierce through her armor. “Your armor is a lie,” he finally said thoughtfully. “You are nothing but an untested child.”
<br><br>
Analeia drew herself up proudly clutching the magical sword that had been given to her. Her blonde hair shown against steel armor, her young face showing a determination beyond her years. Throwing her shoulders back she declared, “My armor is my heritage as a Dreamlight. My family tradition permits me to wear it.”
<br><br>
The dark elf stood, his bearing giving him more height than was real. Along the stone walls in the darkened chamber Analeia could see tapestries that gave testimony to the power of Innoruuk and the hatred he fostered. The blood that flowed from the torn limbs on the depictions seemed to have an illumination of its own. The artist who had created them seemed to capture the very fear of the people who were being slain by the over-running dark elf armies. The man’s lips curved coldly as he followed her gaze. “Do you like it?” he asked. “It was made after a prophet foretold the fall of the people of light. Maybe you see yourself there?”
<br><br>
And, the gods preserve her, Analeia could. The artist had shown her, slain at the feet of the man in the black robes. Her sightless eyes seemed to petition Erollisi Marr in vein as the last of her life-blood flowed. It took a physical effort for her to tear her gaze away and once again regard the embodiment of evil before her. At the sight of her troubled countenance he laughed, its cruel sound bouncing off of the stone walls of the chamber. “You are no Dreamlight. I knew your father, little girl, and he would laugh at you trying to be a warrior.”
<br><br>
“You know nothing of my father,” Analeia hissed.
<br><br>
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://ads.gamespyid.com/ad.aspx?S=planeteverquest&A1=NONE&G1=RPG&T=3&P2=0&A2=0&A3=300x250?unique"></script>
 
“I know enough of him to know that he had three daughters. I know he traveled through the world trying to catch me. I know how he looked when he died.” Analeia just stared at him in dumb amazement as he continued, “And I know he held counsel with your family, Worlik Thunderforge.” Analeia spun, surprised to see her dwarven friend behind her. He had been standing quietly in the corner, a somber vision in his blue, crafted armor. He scowled at the sudden attention, but maintained an uncharacteristic silence as the dark one continued “Such pitiful remains of a proud heritage.”
<br><br>
Worlik frowned, “You know about us, but who are you?”
<br><br>
Again the evil laughter bounced around the room. “You do not know? Of course you don’t. You, Analeia, never knew how your father died, and your family, Worlik, never adventured with Dreamlight to discover the shadows that haunted him. They should have. Their lack of courage leads to the vision on the wall.”
<br><br>
With a sudden roar, Worlik launched himself at the man, unable to tolerate the slur against his family honor. He ran across the room where the dark man stood calmly. Worlik swung his two handed sword, only to have it cut into nothing but air. The elf suddenly appeared behind Analeia, so close that she could feel his breath at the back of her neck. Thoughtlessly she spun, sword drawn. The blow that should have sliced the man’s chest missed by inches as he floated back with an incredible swiftness. Once again his laughter bounced against the walls. As he laughed his face began to resemble a dark skull as the candlelight cast shadows on his drawn features. Again he laughed, his hands beginning to move as he spoke an odd incantation. A bolt of flames emanated from his fingertips, searing towards Worlik. The dwarf screamed as the fire engulfed him, marring his features. Analeia launched herself at the spellcaster, only to be thrown back by a tremendous force. Before she could recover her balance, she found herself the target of the flame spell. She screamed as she felt the heat on her hands, face, and penetrating the armor that she wore.
<br><br>
Analeia sat bolt upright in bed, her heart still pounding in her chest from the intensity of the dream.  Her ears still seemed to ring from Worlik’s and her screams mixing with the odd cackling of the illusion. The dead silence in her small room of the temple told her that she had not screamed aloud. She sat for what seemed to be an eternity in the silence of the chamber that held nothing but a bed, a desk, and a wardrobe. This was all that the travelling warriors to the Temple of Irrolise Marr needed in their quest for spiritual healing. Analeia deliberately concentrated on slowing her quickened breath, as she allowed the simplicity of the room drive away the image of the horrible if luxurious place in the dream.  In the wardrobe she could see the dull reflection of her armor in the wardrobe. She didn’t remember leaving the door open. Somehow the sight of the steel with her family crest imbedded in the breastplate took her disturbingly back to the dream. Sighing, she swung her legs over the edge of the bed to close the door.  As she did so, she heard the clattering of metal against stone. Frowning, she lit a candle so she could see what had been dropped. She nearly dropped the flame when she saw what it reveled. Lying on the floor was the strange figure 8 that the man had worn. It was not jewel encrusted or made of a fine metal, but there was no questioning the odd symbol. 
<br><br>
After only a moment of hesitation, Analeia scooped up the medallion and charged into the hall to see if she could find one of the temple guards. She had barely made it into the hallway when she could hear a muted argument at the end of the hall near the door. Analeia moved to see who was causing the commotion. Arguing with the temple guards, wearing nothing but a simple cloth shirt and pants stood Worlik. His face was red with the frustration of trying to come into the visitors’ rooms; something the temple did not permit. When he saw Analeia, he stopped arguing and raised his hand into the torchlight. Analeia could only stare at the steel medallion that he was holding. The guards stepped back when they saw the odd symbol, and the shocked look the two exchanged. Hesitantly Analeia held out her hand to reveal the matching medallion.
<br><br>
“What is going on?” Worlik demanded.
<br><br>
Analeia could only shake her head.
