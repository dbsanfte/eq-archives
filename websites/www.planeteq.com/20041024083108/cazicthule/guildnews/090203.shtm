              Much &lt;3 for Vex Thall! Well no, not really. The zone is boring
              as hell because everything has 34507230486 hit points and the MT
              can just hit attack and go AFK for ten minutes. BUT, after much
              prodding we convinced Saze to let us Kamikaze the zone... 
            <p> Saze tells the raid, '10 or so inc'<br>
  You say to your guild, 'more than 10!'<br>
  Minkusha tells the raid, 'thats alot more then 10'<br>
  Saze tells the raid, 'happy?'<br>
  Saze tells the raid, 'whoops missed one'<br>
  Saze tells the raid, 'sorry no more mobs to pull on this lvl'</p>
            <p>THAT was fun.</p>

                <br>
                Since we took this past weekend off for a Talons get together,
                there wasn't a whole lot to post. We've been working on backflagging
                as mobs made themselves available. Fennin has been smacked down
                twice since the last update though so I thought I'd better get
            to work.</p>

                We spent some time in the much neglected Plane of Water tongiht
                and killed a couple of minis. R.I.P. Hydrotha &amp; Krziik the
                Mighty. Congratulations are also in order for our friends over
                in Cohort who whooped up on Bertoxx tonight! At this point I
                choose not to comment on the outcome of the remainder of the
            night's efforts. </p>
            <p>August 17th, 2003<br>
                <br>
                What a great week! A romp through of Mr.Fennin's neighborhood
                and a PoEarth ring clearing that netted us keys to PoEb made
                our efforts worth while, despite being set back a couple of days
                by lack of planning on the part of our Northern guildmates (*hint*).
                Congrats to all on the &quot;phat lewtz&quot; and hello Ragrax...
                We will soon be kicking the twelve collective butts. Oh ya, and
            F blackouts.</p>
            <p>August 12th, 2003<br>
                It's been a great past couple of days. We've killed a few mobs
                  in PoE and PoF, including Fennin again. Grats all on the loot.
              Every piece brings us closer to Time. </p>

                Looks like Xegony is on the menu. After many months of hard-fought
                battles we're finally ready to start whacking on the Queen of
                Air herself. Congrats Talons on another milestone! We're on a
            roll now.<br>

                Posted by Tariff On Aug 16 2003 At 9:19:16 PM <br>
  Ported into UP and who was up? None other than Rumblecrush. After a fairly
  quick rally and one embarassing wipe, we destroyed him. Grats to the following:</p>
            <p>Kenvaril on Wicked Mail (he passed his Tae Wo to Crunchii, grats!) </p>
            <p>Lunarnia on Neck of Wishes</p>
            <p>Then Zelnithak happened to wander by our camp. Dead mutant horse.
              Grats to the following:</p>
            <p>Gabbin on Ancient Medallion of Faith </p>
            <p>Crunchii on Curved Lunar Scimitar</p>
            <p>and of course, an UP excursion would not be complete without Doomshade,
              so we spawned and wiped him too. Grats to the following:</p>
            <p>Lunarnia on Cursed Halo of Thought </p>
            <p>Silini on Hoarfrost Hammer (for an alt as all mains passed) </p>
            <p>Crunchii on Mithril Edged Short Sword (as everyone passed again)</p>
            <p>Also grats to Weeser on her new copy of Nature's Recovery.</p>
            <p>Great job all!!!! </p>

              Agnarr's key </p>            <p>Many Specterals and Runes dropped and were given out as well.

              Temple of Veeshan went very smoothly once again at a record setting
              killing pace. Cleared everything within two nights and attempted
              Vulak on the third. Unfortunately, the script is still bugged as
              immediately after we started, multiple death-touching mobs spawned
              in addition to the regular spawns. We quickly called evac after
              the first few deaths, reported the bug again, and will attempt
              again on our next NToV rotation. </p>

             Submitted 8/03/03</p>
            <p>We have been pretty busy lately racking up some nice exp and dropping
              some names along the way. We teamed up with Legion of Nox and Loyal
              Defenders to tackle that big ugly cloaked fiend Doomshade. Great
              job to everyone and grats to Lexore on his new haste item. On thursday
              we hooked up with Loyal Defenders again in ToV. Lots of good drops
              and we also took out the named mobs on the HOT side. Katslayer
              and Kalander both scored BP's, Swadi got some arms, and Seudian
              grabbed some boots. Eeden scored a silkie robe earlier in the week,
              grats to everyone.</p>
            <p><img src="quest.jpg" width="363" height="649"><br>
              Pulled a double take down on Monday with a Doomshade &amp; Rumblecrush
              slaughter party. This was a pick up raid lead by Bastile. Very
              good job eveyrone for showing up so quickly and getting this thing
              moving. Again graz to everyone on their new play things and Amadicia
              on her new robe. </p>
            <p>On Thursday, LD hooked up with us again and this time we hit the
              cycle. Doom, Rumble, and Zelni fell down dead. Good job guys and
              again grats on the loots.</p>
            <p><img src="doomshade.jpg" width="500" height="375"></p>
            <p>Everyone has been hitting new levels lately and I'd like to say
              thanks guys. We have also been doing many camps and quests with
              Loyal Defenders. Keep up the good work and I look forward to dropping
              many more mobs in the future. Grats go out to Quechang for dropping
              Ixiblat as we progress toward his epic and Andorean for finally
              finishing off a bracer quest started many moons in the past. Here
              is a little snap shot for you blueberry headed heathans. </p>

              The dominos will fall. Terris Thule died tonight at the hands of
                The Relentless. It was our first attempt on her ever and she
                died the first time. She really isnt all that, and personally
                her PoNB incarnation is a lot tougher. Well here is the money
                shot, didnt get a full screenshot because she was busy looking
                in the wall for Saryn's corpse.<br>

              And her name was Saryn. I know a lot of people are going to be
                disappointed that this sex goddess in leather is pushing up daisies.
                Well to help ease the burden I am not going to show you her half
                naked clad body, lying motionless on the ground. Truth be told,
                we couldnt get Kamzan off her dead body long enough to get a
                good screenshot. So you get her foot. Here it is!</p>

              Posted by: [Kyrthor] on August 25th, 2003 @ 05:41 AM</p>
            <p>And if you know anyone associated with dev for SOE, then you know
              who I am talkin about.</p>
            <p>But I didn't come here to talk about that, I came to talk about
              the draft. Wait, that wasn't it....our week in Time, THAT was it.</p>
            <p>The first thing we learned about Time was that bugs suck. After
              getting a nice rotation set up on the zone (hats off to the folks
              that made that happen), and having SOE tell us all this flowery
              stuff about how the instancing is supposed to work....the very
              first thing we learned is, it doesn't.</p>
            <p>Wait, I went too far. Before that we learned that wave one was
              a joke and we beat it on the very first day we were ever in Time.
              So, FIRST we got the good feelings, THEN we learned bugs suck as
              we zoned into progress that wasn't ours. On the surface, that might
              look like a cool thing, but mostly it was just half our week of
              learning what we needed to progress being stolen from us by stupid
              yahoos in San Diego (please fall into the ocean). Since we couldn't
              get the zone reset (not for lack of trying) we decided it would
              be stupid to leave the zone alone for half our rotation and decided
              to see what the encounters on phase 4 were like. The answer to
              that question is &quot;pretty cool&quot;. The answer to the next
              question is &quot;No&quot; and the answer for the one after that
              is &quot;Terris Thule to 3%&quot;.</p>
            <p>But finally, the clock moved on and we got our zone back to us
              the way it was supposed to be. Cool. We punk wave one and get our
              first look at wave 2. First try we were a bit slow, but on the
              next go round it was silly how easy it dropped. Onward to phase
              3!</p>
            <p><img src="Wave3_9FS.jpg" width="520" height="196"></p>
            <p>Our first look at the phase netted us a couple loots and a truly
              awesome wipe. So we come back to the zone for a nice relaxing raid
              on a Saturday to see if we can best wave 3 and leave the zone in
              the same state we found it a week before. As you can see, we had
              all our dirty tricks lined up and ready for an epic onslaught....</p>
            <p><img src="Loaded11FS.jpg" width="519" height="229"></p>
            <p><br>
              It looked tight, but do-able. We had the mobs streamin in, we were
                making them dead....gettin our groove on when suddenly the CS
                team plays their interrupt....</p>
            <p><img src="FU3FS.jpg" width="520" height="121"></p>
            <p><br>
              So the answer is &quot;a pro is how she thinks of herself&quot;....wait,
              wrong answer....THIS particular answer is that SOE decided we get
              to wait a week to find out. Which is fine. Maybe the drop was to
              fix the instancing...although it's more likely there was a door
              somewhere in the zone that now swings the proper way.</p>
            <p>Anyway, off to join the rest of my guildmates at the mandated
              anger management seminar.</p>

              Posted by: [Pirotess] on August 23rd, 2003 @ 11:10 PM</p>
            <p>....to the paper-pushing, pencil-neck, jerkweed asshole at SOE
              who decided it was a good idea to down Time A and B during PRIME
              TIME RAIDING HOURS! Three words for you.</p>
            <p><br>
              FUCK YOU KK?</p>
            <p>So heres the deal we're on the last day of our first week in Time
              on this rotation. Yesterday we ball up our first try on Phase 1
              after doing it flawlessly our first two days in the zone albeit
              with alot more people than the 49 we had on Friday. Ok so we're
              down and out and thinking about calling it quits but decide to
              do it again because we're suckers for punishment. Lo and behold
              we off Phase 1 with our 49 people and start on Phase 2 at around
              11pm EST which is about when we start losing people for the night.
              Im thinking we're screwed but not this time, our people are troopers
              and kick it up a notch and in fact we even get up to 52 or so people.
              Result? Phase 2 complete. Well its midnight now but everyones hyped
              up so we get crackin on Phase 3 and get within 4 waves of finishing
              mostly because we had zero clue on how to pull or where to stand
              or what mezzed or rooted or whatever. Long story short we get damn
              good info and call it a night after we wipe a few minutes before
              time is going to expire.</p>
            <p>Today dawns bright and early and we start around 1:30pm EST with
              about 46. We miss winning Phase 1 by the health of two minis in
              water. Hate that but we did our best. Try two we win it with a
              good bit of time left since no group lost many like the first time
              and bam its time for Phase 3. Let me tell you our pullers kicked
              ass and our healers walked on water practically. Blew through all
              the waves and are engaging the Dreamwarp wave when we get this....</p>
            <p>[Sat Aug 23 17:40:44 2003] : Fensor : Greetings Norrath! Plane
              of Time (a) and Plane of Time (b) will be coming down in 5 minutes
              for a brief update. Sorry for any inconveniences.</p>
            <p>Sorry my ass. If you were sorry the GM-Admin I sent a tell to
              begging them to postpone CT's downing for 15 minutes would have
              come through for us. Granted the timer was getting really really
              tight but still. If you had any clue about customer support you'd
              try your best NOT to ruin the culmination of a week of great fun
              in Time with a lame ass reboot. But no this is SOE and this is
              why Im really not expecting much from them with EQ2 except another
              3 years of being screwed. We'll get some pics up later after I've
              cooled down some more. <br>

              ...and who would have thought it would be the group of us?</p>
            <p>Well, me for one.</p>
            <p>So as not to leave anyone out of Time when we move there, we worked
              on knocking out some missing targets for folks in the past few
              days, culminating with another stupendous whack on the tootsie
              pop man tonight. Just a couple minutes over 2 hours from start
              to finish (hella nice for second kill, neh?) and basically no deaths
              if you discount the 20 we put on Lowwdown for gettin uppity.</p>
            <p>It sure does feel fun as hell to look about at all the elemental
              targets and be able to steamroll any that are up, especially the
              apparantly tricky ones, as shown by a nice sidetrip over the weekend....</p>
            <p><br>
              However, it's a lot more exciting to face the stuff you're not
                sure about, so we can't wait to get on the ball and into Time
                and line up stuff we haven't seen yet. Will be fun to see how
                far we get, how fast, and how well....well, the last part isn't
                in question really, it'll all drop with style the way things
                always do.....</p>
            <p>And remember....there's nowhere you can go that you haven't learned
              to go in time..or whatever the hell it was that Sgt Pepper read.
