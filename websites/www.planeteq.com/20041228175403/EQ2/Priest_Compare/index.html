                  of Priest Classes</font><br>
Author unknown, originally from the EQ2 official forums</b></p>
            <p>Like many of you prospective priests, I've been spending a good
              deal of time attempting to figure out exactly what sort of priest
              I wanted to be, and flipping between a variety of posts and Gwynet's
              priest spell lists and so on to help me decide...but still getting
              nowhere. </p>
            <p>Today, I figured that the best way to make my decision was to
              look at the endgame (level 40+) spells of each class to try and
              get a better picture of what each priest class was going to bring
              to the table at that level. Now obviously, I haven't used any of
              these spells, in fact, I've not played the game yet. However, I
              do believe we can look at the spell descriptions, the relative
              levels of the spells and the concentration of spells in various
              categories from class to class to try and get a general picture
              of what one class will be skilled at versus another. </p>
            <p>All of the opinions in this thread are my own, and all of the
              spell descriptions are from Gwynet (thanks for posting the list!).
              I don't claim to be stating facts, these are just my opinions of
              how the various priest classes will play in the endgame based on
              the spell descriptions and levels provided. Please note that I
              also make the assumption that the spells received at lv 40+ are
              representative of the spells which the priest will primarily be
              using, because in general they are repeated versions of earlier
              spells. I also have not made a true 'ranking' of priest classes,
              but after doing this analysis, I do believe them to be well balanced
              in what they will bring to the group, though in very different
              categories. </p>
            <p><strong>Common Spell Trends: </strong></p>
            <p>lv 39 - Crowd Control utility spell. Most priest classes receive
              a spell which sounds powerful and related to controlling overpulls
              or fleeing combat at this level. I know that this spell is before
              40, which I designated (rather arbitrarily) as the cutoff for endgame
              spells, but as the spells given to each class at 39 are all related
              to Crowd Control and aren't duplicated or repeated later, I assumed
              them to be significant to the priest's role. </p>
            <p>lv 40 - flavor spell 1 </p>
            <p>lv 45 - flavor spell 2 </p>
            <p>lv 42 - 'Save-Me' utility spell. All priest classes receive a
              spell which is most likely a long-recast, self only spell. These
              spells are hate reducers and are probably to be used when the priest
              is getting too much agro. </p>
            <p>lv 50 -'uber' flavor spell </p>
            <p>lv 50 - 'uber' spell. At 50, each priest receives a unique class
              defining spell (heal, buff or nuke) </p>
            <p><br>
  I divided the spells from each class into the following categories. </p>
            <p><strong>Buff: </strong>spell which is cast on a group member and
              increases his offensive or defensive potential, or gives him the
              ability to decrease enemy combat potential through procs or reactive
              effects. </p>
            <p><strong>Damage:</strong> spell which primarily serves to directly
              reduce an enemy's health, usually through an attack. </p>
            <p><strong>Mitigation</strong>: spell which primarily serves to directly
              prevent damage to a group members health, not by affecting attributes
              but by directly affecting his health pool. </p>
            <p><strong>Death prevention:</strong> spell which has the intended
              effect of preventing the death of a character who has completly
              run of out health. </p>
            <p><strong>Debuff:</strong> spell which is usually cast on an enemy
              and primarily serves to decrease an enemy's offensive or defensive
              potential, or a spell which causes the enemy to inadvertently increase
              the combat potential of allies through reactive effects </p>
            <p><strong>Utility</strong>: spell which benefit the group or character
              in another manner besides primarily directly affecting player or
              enemy offensive or defensive potential, also including hate reduction
              or last ditch effort spells. May have buffs or debuffs as side
              effects, however the primary effect is not the buff or debuff.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Flavor:</strong> spell which has no/little effect on
                combat but serves to distinguish the character class by adding
                to atmosphere of the game world. </p>
            <p><strong><br>
                  <font size="+1">Priest Class Spell Analysis</font></strong><br>
                  <br>
                  <strong><font size="+1">Templar</font></strong><br>
  In my opinion, the templar has the most variety and probably potency of healing
  and is a good defensive buffer who has pretty much no ability to increase group
  DPS or provide much utility other than keeping the group alive. He wears plate,
  and will probably be able to save his own behind easily due to the higher AC
  and great agro avoidance spells.</p>
            <p><strong>Specialty: Healing Flexibility, Staying Alive, Armor Class
                Buffs. </strong></p>
            <p><strong>Buff (7)</strong>: The templars buffs focus on keeping
              the party alive; increasing HP and AC, and offering mental/arcane
              protection. Glory of Combat 47 is the only endgame mitigation buff
              that doesn't require getting hit, and will probably be very valuable.
              Valor at 47 keeps the templar tied with the mystic and warden for
              the highest lv AC group buff in game, although Vigilant Benediction
              at 45 is the only endgame single target buff that just buffs AC,
              and is probably the best AC buff in game. Overall, his defensive
              buffing is probably the best. </p>
            <p>40 - Praetorate - Str and Wis buff <br>
  43 - Shielding Faith - Power and arcane group buff <br>
  44 - Sacred redoubt - HP + offense buff <br>
  44 - Symbol of Pinzarn - Group HP buffs + can increase AC when hit <br>
  45 - Vigilant Benediction - AC buff <br>
  47 - Glory of Combat - Buff that gives a chance to heal the party on each succesful
  attack <br>
  47 - Valor - Stamina, mental and AC group buff
            <p><strong>Damage (2):</strong> Doesn't have much variety in damage
              dealing; uses single or AoE DD's of only divine type. Likely to
              be good against undead, but overall, probably near the bottom of
              the damage dealing scale.<br>
                  <br>
  45 - Condemning Smite - Divine DD <br>
  46 - Rays of Faith - AoE Divine DD
            <p><strong>Mitigation (8/4 instant)</strong>: Plenty of instant heals,
              the last at level 46. Has varied sources of mitigation all the
              way through 50, with some spells which probably offer very power
              efficent healing (atoning fate/involuntary curate). Gets a regular
              reactive heal at 50; Focused Benefaction the only level 50 heal
              which doesn't require immobilization (or at least it doesn't say
              it in the spell description). Templar has the most spells dedicated
              to solely to mitigation, meaning that they do nothing besides mitigate,
              which leads me to believe they would heal for more than a mitigation
              spell with an additional effect. Only potential endgame drawback
              is that he doesnt have any single target reactive heals besides
              his 'uber' heal until 50. Likely though, he's the most well rounded
              healer with a heal for every situation. </p>
            <p>40 - Greater Intercession - Instant heal + can increase AC when
              hit <br>
  42 - crucial Intercession - Group reactive heal <br>
  43 - Word of Restoration - Group heal <br>
  43 - Greater Amelioration - Instant heal and offense buff <br>
  46 - Greater Restoration - Instant heal that can cure minor Noxious effects <br>
  48 - Atoning Fate - Heals group when target dies <br>
  49 - Involuntary Curate - Can cure trauma and heal when target is hit //cast
  on enemy <br>
  50 - Focused Benefaction - Reactive heal </p>
            <p><strong>Death Prevention:</strong> The power regeneration in this
              spell may give a slight edge, but over all, most of these death
              prevention spells are pretty much the same. <br>
                <br>
  41 - Salvation - Prevents death + heal + power regen </p>
            <p><strong>Debuff (2)</strong>: Templar's debuffs focus on making
              the party harder to kill, not on making the enemy easier to kill.
              Mark of Kings at 46 is probably the second best mitigation debuff
              in the game, sliding in right under the defilers lv 40 Bane of
              Shielding. Overall a good defensive debuffer, but totally lacking
              in offensive debuffs.<br>
                <br>
  46 - Mark of Kings - Debuff that can cause regen and AC buff on attacker <br>
  49 - Sign of Infirmity - AoE str debuff </p>
            <p><strong>Utility (2)</strong>: Resolve looks to be the best of
              all of the 'save-me' 42 abilities of all classes, it will likely
              save the templar many times. The templar's 'CC' utility at 39 is
              a stun, which may give a nice tactical advantage to a group. He
              might need it though, as only he and the fury have no AoE hate
              reduction spell. His 41 Harmony is likely to be castable on anyone,
              and will probably be a very welcome spell for the other mages/priests
              in group.<br>
                <br>
  **39 - Prostrate - Stun //special CC ability <br>
  *42 - Resolve - Hate reducers and no damage for 3 attacks //'save-me' ability:
  probably long recast, self-only <br>
  41 - Harmony - Hate reducer + heal </p>
            <p><strong>Flavor:</strong> no transformations, but the acolyte sounds
              cool. Unlike all of the other classes who must all wait until 50,
              he gets his 'uber' flavor ability at level 45, holy aura. I don't
              believe that the acolyte will have any affect on combat, as it
              is given to the templar at the same time as the other classes get
              their flavor spells. <br>

            <p><font size="+1"><strong>Inquisitor:</strong></font> In my opinion,
              the inquisitor is a very good healer with lots of creative buffs
              to increase group DPS and protect them at the same time. His debuffs
              are probably not too powerful, but he has the best assortment of
              crowd control of all the priests. He will not be a direct source
              of DPS however, as his own spells aren't structured around damage. </p>
            <p><strong>Specialty: Creative DPS Buffs, Haste, Crowd Control. </strong></p>
            <p><strong>Buff (7)</strong>: The inquisitor has buffs which seem
              to be more skewed towards offense, but boost defense simultaneously.
              His Feverence at 47 is the highest single target AC buff and wards
              against trauma (which I believe is melee damage); this is sure
              to be a potent spell. The group cast Act of Faith (49) is the highest
              level DD proc. He has no spell which directly decreases damage
              from a special attack source (such as fire/arcane/disease), only
              an indirect protection at level 45. Focuses his level 50 'uber'
              spell on a self-immobilizing haste, providing even more offensive
              power to the group. Overall, seems to be the second-in-command
              at offensive buffing, right behind the fury. The inquisitor will
              likely turn up a groups DPS very nicely. </p>
            <p>43 - Vengeance - DD on enemies when attacked <br>
  43 - Zealot's conviction - Group HP + chance to haste when attacked <br>
  44 - Hallowed Aura - HP and damage buff <br>
  45 - Harrowing Inquest - Can drain power and increase arcane mitigation when
  enemy attacks <br>
  47 - Fervence - Sta + AC buff + ward against trauma <br>
  49 - Act of Faith - Group buff granting the group a divine DD <br>
  50 - Zealotry - Haste + maintening power cost + immobilization for the caster </p>
            <p><strong>Damage (3)</strong>: Like the templar, the inquisitor
              focuses on divine damage. Heretic's fate at 40 will likely be a
              power efficient source of damage as its a reactive spell. Just
              like his good brother, the inquistor doesnt have anything special
              to bring to the table as far as damage is concerned.<br>
                <br>
  40 - Heretic's fate - DD to enemy allies when enemy is slain <br>
  45 - Merciless Invocation - Divine DD <br>
  46 - Litany of Torment - AoE divine DD </p>
            <p><strong>Mitigation(5/3 instant):</strong> With his highest class
              defining heal being a group heal at 42 (salutary diatribe, a reactive
              heal), the inquisitor may have to throw more instant heals than
              other priests. His highest single target class-defining heal is
              41 Stinging Penance, which has a DD side effect, and thus might
              be lower in mitigation power than a mitigation-only heal like some
              other classes have. In fact, his highest single target heal in
              general is only lv 42, so he might be fighting an uphill battle
              on high-con single pulls that deal tons of damage to one target,
              at least when compared to the mystic and templar. His highest heal
              is also a haste, so that might help end a battle which is going
              in the wrong direction, and gives one more haste spell to his roster.
              Overall I believe the inquistor is probably slightly less potent
              of a healer than the mystic, which is probably slightly less potent
              than the templar.<br>
                <br>
  41 - Stinging Penance - Reactive heal + Divine DD <br>
  42 - Scolding alleviation - Group heal <br>
  42 - Faithful Ministration - Instant heal + offense buff <br>
  42 - Salutary diatribe - Group reactive heal <br>
  46 - Intolerant Healing - Group heal + haste </p>
            <p><strong>Death prevention:</strong> Nothing special here. <br>
  41 - Redemption - Prevents death + heal + HP buff </p>
            <p><strong>Debuff (2):</strong> The inquisitors' debuffs are surprisingly
              defensive, reducing enemy offense, or STR and INT which will likely
              also reduce damage output. These spells make the party harder to
              kill instead of making the monsters easier to kill. Vitiation at
              49 ties with the Fury for the highest level STR debuff. <br>
                <br>
  48 - Forced Compliance - AoE offense debuff <br>
  49 - Vitiation - Str and Int debuff </p>
            <p><strong>Utility (5):</strong> Wide range of utility abilities,
              the inquisitor is the only priest who can stun, fear and root individually
              (not fear+root in one cast). His 39 'CC' ability is a root which
              will no doubt help make up for some of his potentially lower grade
              (or at least lower level) healing abilities than other classes.
              His 42 'save-me' ability isnt quite the get-out-of-jail-free that
              some other classes have, but his strategy appears to be to kill
              an enemy who won't leave him alone, instead of making it attack
              someone else. Has the most crowd control type abilities of all
              priest classes, and his AoE hate reducer stuns, making it the coolest
              by far. <br>
                <br>
  **39-Imprison - Root //special CC ability <br>
  *42 - Flagellant - Hate reducer + AC buff + DD when attacked //'save-me' ability:
  probably long recast, self only <br>
  40 - Digression - AoE hate reducer + stun <br>
  46 - Coerced Repentance - Counterattack when caster is hit <br>
  47 - Fearful Conversion - Fear </p>
            <p><strong>Flavor</strong>: as with the templar, the inquisitor can't
              transform, but will likely look really cool in plate with an unholy
              aura and an adept following him around. Like other priest classes,
              i believe that these skills will have no/little effect on gameplay
              and instead just be for atmosphere. Don't expect a healing pet
              (like the mystic kind-of gets). <br>

            <p><font size="+1"><strong>Mystic: </strong></font>The mystic is
              a potent stat buffer and healer, with a nice compliment of slow
              causing spells and damage resistance debuffs. His healing power
              is probably surpassed only by the templar, and his buffing power
              is probably unsurpassed in its balance. He'll likely be the friend
              of mages, and he's able to exploit the weaknesses that he causes
              with his own wide assortment of damage types. </p>
            <p><strong>Specialty: Offensive Stat Buffs, Slow, Resistance Debuffs. </strong></p>
            <p><strong>Buff (6):</strong> Buffs everything, from power to hp
              to regen, offense to AC. Has divine and noxious resistance buffs,
              and can also protect against elemental with wards. Has the most
              variety in types of damage to protect against, but focuses on noxious.
              Avatar at 47 is the higest STR and AGI buff of priests and is the
              only direct cast end-game haste from a priest. Runic Talisman at
              47 is tied with the templar and warden for the highest group cast
              AC buff, and is the highest group cast STR buff. The mystic has
              the market cornered on offensive stat buffs, and has enough HP
              buffs to go toe-to-toe with the templar; overall he is the most
              balanced buffer. </p>
            <p>43 - Prophetic shield - Group power and noxious resistance <br>
  44 - Eidolic Mettle - HP, divine, noxious group buff <br>
  44 - Prophecy - HP + Power buff + minor regen <br>
  46 - Spirit of the Elephant - Group str and sta buff + ward protecting from
  elemental and noxious attacks <br>
  47 - Avatar - Str, sta, agi buff + haste <br>
  47 - Runic Talisman - Group str and AC buff + increased noxious resists every
  attack </p>
            <p><strong>Damage (2):</strong> Deals cold, noxious and disease damage
              (and noxious at 39). This variety may give the mystic a slight
              edge in finding weaknesses, and will work nicely with his disease
              debuffs. </p>
            <p>45 - Ire of the Grey - Cold DD + snare <br>
  46 - Fury of the Ancients - AoE disease DD </p>
            <p><strong>Mitigation (6/2 instant):</strong> Has his highest group
              ward at 42, and his highest (regular) single ward at 41, although
              all but one of his mitigation abilities are solely mitigation,
              leading me to believe they mitigate more than a spell that does
              mitigation+effect of the same level. He has the highest mitigation-only
              single target instant heal in game with Enlightened Healing at
              46. Like the other &quot;good&quot; healing classes, he has a class
              defining heal as his lv 50 'uber' ability. Unlike the templar,
              he must be immobilized while he keeps his 'uber' ward up. My best
              guess is that the mystic will mitigate very well because of his
              (mitigation's spells) focus on pure mitigation, without other effects,
              but not as well as the templar who has more a balanced distribution
              of spell levels and types. </p>
            <p>41 - Ancestral Aegis - Ward <br>
  41 - Rejuvenating chant - Instant heal + noxious cure <br>
  42 - Transcendent Blessing - Group heal <br>
  42 - Umbral ritual - Group ward <br>
  46 - Enlightened Healing - Instant heal <br>
  50 - Oberon - Ward - Immobilizes the caster and costs power to maintain </p>
            <p><strong>Death prevention:</strong> Nothing special here. </p>
            <p>40 - Eidolic Savior - Buff that prevents death + adds ward </p>
            <p><strong>Debuff (4)</strong>: The mystics noxious and elemental
              debuffs give more options for casters in group to exploit than
              other priests provide. No other priest gets a damage resistance
              debuff at endgame, and the mystic gets 2 in Howl of the Ancients
              at 40. His 49 Chemerik is tied with defiler for the highest STR
              debuff in game, and his AoE slow is the only AoE endgame slow.
              Strangely enough, he also gets a slow for his lv 39 CC spell, which
              I believe will be extremely potent, as it immobilizes him (and
              because all other priests get CC spells at that level). His debuffs
              will make it harder for the enemy to kill the party, and make it
              easier for the party to kill the enemy, and in my opinion is the
              best balanced around debuffer. </p>
            <p>40 - Howl of the ancients - AoE Sta, noxious, elemental debuff <br>
  49 - Chimerik - Sta and Str debuff <br>
  49 - Dreadful Lethargy - AoE slow <br>
  **39 - Mourning Soul - Slow but immobilizes the caster //Special CC ability
  (yes I know that a slow isnt CC, but this is where all priests get their CC) </p>
            <p><strong>Utility (4):</strong> Unlike all of the other priests,
              the mystic has NO crowd control spell at all. He spent his lv 39
              special CC slot on what is likely to be a powerful single target
              spell, and thus has little recourse for dealing with overpulls
              and the like. His 42 Fading Spirit 'save-me' spell seems to be
              effective, as it both wards damage on self and reduces hate as
              long as the enemy keeps hitting him; probably the best except for
              the templars. His AoE hate reducer is nothing special compared
              to other priests. The 45 Shadowy Attendant could be a real boon,
              depending on how the spell works in game, I'd assume it performs
              minor healing/buffs. </p>
            <p>42 - Fading Spirit - Ward to the caster + hate reducer when enemy
              hits //'save-me' ability: probably long recast, self only <br>
  43 - Accordant Spirits - AoE hate reducer + minor heal <br>
  45 - Shadowy attendant - Summons a pritective spirit that casts beneficial
  spells on the group <br>
  48 - Ursine Prophet - Bear form </p>
            <p>Flavor: no idea at all what the 40 Aura Awareness does, possibly
              a detect good/evil. 50 Form of the Stag could be fun when you're
              tired of looking like a bear. </p>

            <p><strong><font size="+1">Defiler:</font></strong> With a full complement
              of damage spells that also debuff the enemy, and a lv 50 spell
              which both heals and harms, the defiler is a very offensive priest
              indeed. While his buffs are probably not as focused on either offense
              or defense as most other priest classes, his focus is regained
              when you take a look at his debuffs; he's the clear master of stat
              debuffing and has the only priest AoE power drain. He has a questionable
              set of mitigation spells which all cause damage to enemies as they
              heal, and thus may be a weaker mitigation class. Overall, the defiler
              is likely to be the most directly offensive priest. </p>
            <p><strong>Specialties: Simultaneously Causing Damage And Healing,
                Stat Debuffing, Draining Power </strong></p>
            <p><strong>Buff (5):</strong> For the most part, the defilers buffs
              cause group members to debuff enemies, but he has some HP and stat
              buffing as well. His 47 Ghastly Shroud is a proxy of the templars
              mitigation buff Glory of Combat, which basically allows the group
              to cure itself by hitting enemies, but probably less a potent heal
              due to its other effects such as STR, AC and causing damage. Tendrils
              of Terror at 49 brings the defiler back into the shaman role of
              a slower, albeit through a buff that only works when a group member
              is hit. Overall, the defiler's buffs don't look to be as potent
              as those of most priest classes at increasing either defense or
              offense. </p>
            <p>44 - Harbinger - HP, power and defensive buff <br>
  45 - Baleful Efflux - Group HP buff + poison ward <br>
  45 - Dread Invective - Buff that drains power over time and does a disease
  DoT to attacker <br>
  46 - Voracity - Group str and sta buff - can decrease offense of enemies when
  hit <br>
  47 - Ghastly Shroud - Group Str, AC buff - can cause disease damage to the
  attacker that is convered into a heal <br>
  49 - Tendrils of Terror - Slow and agi debuff when group is hit </p>
            <p><strong>Damage (3):</strong> With DD's that debuff noxious and
              arcane at level 44, the defiler might just be a warlock/necro's
              best friend, especially if they stack (which Iwould imagine they
              do). Also, like the fury, he spends his lv 50 'uber' spell on a
              damage spell. Unlike the other fury, or all other priest classes,
              his spell allows him to play the friend and the foe at once; it's
              an AoE dot which also heals group power and health, probably making
              it the most versatile of all the priest 'uber' abilities because
              it basically damages all enemies and heals all group members power/health
              at the same time. Ya' can't ask for much more than that. In my
              opinion, i'd say that the defiler has the edge in causing damage
              among endgame priest classes. </p>
            <p>44 - Ruinous Imprecation - Disease DD + arcane and noxious debuff <br>
  44 - Aphotic Corruption - Disease DoT and noxious debuff <br>
  50 - Maelstrom of Dismay - AoE DoT that gets converted into power/health. Power
  cost is periodical and the caster is immobilized //lv 50 'uber' spell </p>
            <p><strong>Mitigation (4/2 instant):</strong> In my opinion, the
              defiler is going to be on the lower end of the endgame healing
              totem pole. He has no endgame group heal. All of his spells but
              one are mitigation+effect spells, which I think will probably heal
              for less than a mitigation-only spell (because it's just plain
              logical that a spell that just heals will heal more than one which
              heals and does something else too). And to put the icing on the
              rotten piece of cake, his highest level heal costs him health.
              Ouch. Having said that, these spells do have interesting offensive
              effects and might be very useful if there's another healer in the
              group who's able to pack a bit more healing punch. </p>
            <p>40 - Malefic Shroud - Ward + Disease DD for the attacker that
              heals the target for the same amount <br>
  42 - Carrion shield - Ward + Disease DD for the attacker that heals the target
  for the same amount <br>
  43 - Fetid Balm - Instant heal + DoT proc <br>
  46 - Sacrifical Allevation - Instant heals that costs health to the caster </p>
            <p><strong>Death prevention: </strong>Pretty much in line with the
              other classes, might provide a slight edge as it actually damages
              whoever attacks the near-death character. </p>
            <p>41 - Eerie Aevenger - Buff that prevents death. Summons a shadow
              to attack the attacker </p>
            <p><strong>Debuff(4):</strong> The defiler is the master of stat
              debuffing, almost like the opposite of the mystic who is the master
              of stat buffing. Between his 47 and 49 spells, he'll be able to
              reduce every single stat of an enemy, and STR gets a double whammy,
              being affected by both of his debuffs. Bane of shielding is probably
              the best mitigation debuff in the game, followed by the templar's
              lv 46 Mark of Kings, so this in my opinion gives the defiler an
              edge in debuffing over other priest classes. </p>
            <p>40 - Bane of shielding - Debuff that can ward the hit member and
              do disease DD damage when target attacks <br>
  47 - Loathsome Seal - Str, Sta, agi, defense debuff <br>
  49 - Abhorrence - Int, Wis and Str debuff </p>
            <p><strong>Utility (5):</strong> Fear is good, Root is good, but
              what happens when you cast them both together in one spell? Well
              if you use 39 Primordial Terror at the right time, it might just
              be a great CC spell which can keep the caster or other lightly
              armored folks from being torn apart in an overpull. The AoE Devitalizing
              Chant at 41 is the only AoE power drain, and the only non-reactive-buff
              power drain in the priest endgame, and provides the defiler with
              a unique ability. Crystalize soul 43 is most likely a good downtime
              healer which will probably be power efficient. The defilers &quot;save-me&quot; spell,
              Mail of Souls 42 is pretty middle of the road when compared with
              some other priests that get more protective versions. Overall the
              utility of the defiler seems decent. </p>
            <p>**39 - Primordial terror - Fear + roots when it wears off <br>
  41 - Devitalizing Chant - AoE hate reducer, power drain <br>
  *42 - Mail of Souls - Hate reducer + disease DD + heal //'save-me' ability:
  probably long recast, self only <br>
  43 - Crystallize soul - Places a soul essence used to heal in the inventory
  when target dies <br>
  48 - Malefic Countenance - Wraith form </p>
            <p><br>
                <strong>Flavor:</strong> 40 Turgur's Instant Relief will probably
                be a bit more fun than another illusion, as it is castable on
                others, and i'm sure that the illusory hawk image will draw many
                to the defiler class. As far as the lv 50 'uber' flavor spell,
                I have no description, but it sounds, well, hot. </p>
            <p>40 - Turgur's instant relief - Temporarily forces another person
              to be sick <br>
  45 - Form of the spirit Hawk - turns the caster into an illusory image <br>
  50 - Juka's smoldering essence - ? </p>
            <p><strong><font size="+1">Warden: </font></strong> Arguably the
              most versatile priest class, the warden can do a bit of everything.
              He can buff stats, resists, defense, do direct damage and also
              has a better variety of heals than average. His defensive AGI and
              avoidance buffs might be the best in the game, causing monks and
              bruisers to follow him around like little puppydogs. The only major
              hole in his repertoire is the lack of decent debuffs, unless for
              some reason you want to snare mobs. Also, his evac might be very
              useful depending on exactly how it works. </p>
            <p><strong>Specialties: Resistances, Damage Versatility, Snare (may
                or may not be useful) </strong></p>
            <p><strong>Buff (7): </strong>The warden has a very balanced set
              of buffs much like the mystic, but more defensive than stat based.
              He, like the defiler and templar, has a mitigaton buff and AC buffs.
              Unlike those classes, or any other priest class for thay matter,
              he can increase resists against heat and cold, as well as arcane,
              and also has what is likely to be a very powerful defensive spell,
              Duststorm at lv 45. I'm guessing that the warden's avoidance+AGI
              buffs will be very sought after. </p>
            <p>40 - Primal Instinct - offense buff <br>
  41 - Essence of the Kodiak - HP buff, out of combat power regen + small ward
    against elemental damage <br>
  43 - Praise of the Untamed - Group Power+ elemental buff <br>
  44 - Aspect of the Owl - Power, heat and cold buff <br>
  45 - Duststorm - Increase avoidance to group, roots the caster <br>
  46 - Benison of the wild - Group agi and str + arcane buff, can also heal group
  when they attack <br>
  47 - Spirit of the Oak - Group agi, wis, elemental, AC buff </p>
            <p><strong>Damage (3)</strong>: The combination of two damage types
              in the warden's endgame spell roster makes him as versatile as
              the mystic, while all other priest classes must plug away with
              just one damage type. Additionally, the presence of a DoT and a
              DD makes he (and the defiler) the only priests with access to both
              types of spells in the endgame. Dooming swarm at 43 gives him a
              defense debuff which well likely come in handy, as his regular
              debuffs seem to well...suck. Overall, the warden might give the
              defiler a run for his money as both have very versatile damage
              endgames. </p>
            <p>43 - Dooming Swarm - Divine DoT + defense debuff <br>
  45 - Winter's bite - Cold DD <br>
  46 - Winds of Winter - AoE Cold DD </p>
            <p><strong>Mitigation (6/3 instant):</strong> At higher levels, the
              warden seems to break away from one of the potential complaints
              about the druid class, that their class specific regen heals won't
              resolve a situation when a character is already low on health and
              needs protection because regen is too slow. The warden's endgame
              heals provide an instant heal to kickstart the regen, and hopefully
              bring a wounded character back into the green before the regen
              kicks in and protects from further damage. This elevates the warden
              above the fury and defiler in my opinion, in terms of mitigation.
              His 'uber' regen ability at 50 immobilizes him, just as the mystic's
              'uber' ward at 50, leaving the templar as the only priest with
              an 'uber' lv 50 mitigation ability that can still move around in
              battle. </p>
            <p>40 - Chloroplast - Group regen + elemental buff <br>
  42 - Gale of Healing - Group heal <br>
  42 - Chlorostorm - Group regen + ward against elemental <br>
  43 - Sylvan waters - Instant heal + regen <br>
  46 - Verdant Rapture - Instant heal + regen <br>
  50 - Hierophantic Genesis - Regen that immobilizes the caster </p>
            <p><strong>Death prevention: </strong>pretty much in line with other
              classes. </p>
            <p>41 - Nature's Reprieve - Prevents death + heal + regen </p>
            <p><strong>Debuff (2)</strong>: In my opinion, the warden's debuffs
              seem as if they will be the least useful of all priest classes.
              In general, stat debuffs may or may not be useful depending on
              the way the combat system works, and even if they are, agility
              is always a suspect stat to buff or debuff. The warden has 2 spells
              which debuff only agility, and have the additional useless side
              effect of snare. Pretty much the bottom of the debuffing barrel
              here. A ray of hope may be found in 49 Tranquilizing Spores, but
              i'm not really sure if this is a buff or debuff from the description
              (either way it sounds promising, but not enough for me to think
              that the warden will be a decent debuffer. </p>
            <p>47 - Undergrowth - AoE agi debuff + snare <br>
  49 - Seizing vines - Agi debuff + snare <br>
  49 - Tranquilizing Spores - Chance of regen + slow on enemy when hit //not
  sure if this is a buff or debuff </p>
            <p><strong>Utility (6):</strong> Forget crowd control, the warden
              simply evacs the group with Verdurous Journey at 39! While I don't
              know if this is a long cast time spell, or non-combat spell, I
              do know that it's given at 39 which is when the other priest classes
              are getting their crowd control spells, so I'd assume it can be
              used in combat, making the warden the only priest to have an endgame
              evac. The 42 Verdant Sigh 'save-me' spell is better than average,
              a regen that also reduces hate with every hit is likely to keep
              you alive until the mob decides to leave you alone. Unfortunately,
              Seizing brambles at 41 is possibly the worst of the hate reducers,
              as its additional effect is a probably useless snare (though that
              could benefit you if you're so wounded that you're running away). </p>
            <p>**39 - Verdurous Journey - Teleports group to safe spot <br>
  *42 - Verdant Sigh - Regen + hate reducer when hit //'save-me' ability: probably
    long recast, self only <br>
  41 - Seizing Brambles - AoE hate reducer + snare <br>
  44 - Sylph - AoE Hate reducer, snare + teleport of the caster a short distance
  away <br>
  48 - Steward of the Forest - Wolf form </p>
            <p><strong>Flavor:</strong> Leading the pack with 4 flavor spells,
              i'm going to go ahead and guess that the Warden will have the coolest
              spell flavor effects that are castable on others. </p>
            <p>40 - Form of the Strange Bear - Changes the target into a strange
              creature <br>
  40 - Curse opf the Un-natural - Changes the target into a hideous creature <br>
  45 - Fury of the Storm - Every now and then, a warden may wish to remind someone
  of inappropriate disposition towards the forests <br>
  50 - Rowyl's Furious Barrier - Surrounds the warden with gentle runes<br>
                <br>
                <font size="+1"><strong>Fury: </strong></font>The fury seems
                to be the master of increasing group DPS, with a variety of buffs
                which all work together to add attacks, cause additional damage
                and just create carnage in general. Surprisingly, he doesnt seem
                to have much to contrbute to group DPS on his own, as he has
                no endgame DD spells except his lv 50 which causes him to remain
                still, and groups may not like to have their healer focusing
                so much on DD. He has a strange assortment of mitigation spells
                like the defiler, which may or may not be effective in healing
                the group but all have other effects. He also has two interesting
                spells which may or may not work as i imagine, a group run buff
                which I believe can be used in battle (crosses fingers) and a
                group invis. These utility spells are unique enough that he may
                be sought out for those as well. </p>
            <p><strong>Specialties: Increasing Group DPS, Only Lv 50 DD Priest
                Spell, Interesting Utility Spells </strong></p>
            <p><strong>Buff (7):</strong> The fury has 7 buffs, and they all
              have the same purpose, to make your group kick butt. While the
              inquisitor has indirect DD buffs and reactive damage buffs and
              the like, the fury increases your damage the old fashioned way;
              through extra attacks, damage adds and procs. He can buff AC and
              stats also, but his buffing focus is clearly on damage, and I believe
              he'll be the best DPS increasing priest. </p>
            <p>40 - Bloodlust - Agi and str buff + additional slashing damage <br>
  41 - Ferocity of the hunt - HP buff + increase in HP regen and speed out of
    combat <br>
  44 - Vim - Power Buff + power regen out of combat <br>
  45 - Fae Flames - adds heat DoT proc <br>
  45 - Feral Salve - Instant heal + lion transformation + increase of slashing
  damage <br>
  46 - Ferine Mask - Group Agi, Str, AC buff + additional slashing attack <br>
  46 - Ferine Spirit - Group agi, int, wis, arcane buff + potential damage increase </p>
            <p><strong>Damage (1):</strong> Strangely enough, the master of adding
              to DPS is able to make very little contribution himself until 50
              (or at least his endgame spells would suggest). Pre 40, the fury
              had a couple of magic based DD's, but since then, he gets nothing,
              zip, nada until his 'uber' spell which, like the other 'evil' priest
              classes, is a damage spell. I'd imagine that it is pretty damaging
              indeed, but i'm not sure how a DD requires power to maintain, that
              sounds more like a DoT. Maybe it damages in waves. Either way,
              in my book, i'd prefer that my healer isn't immobilized while casting
              a DD...it's one thing to slip in a nuke here and there, it's another
              to forget about everything else and cast a stationary DD. </p>
            <p>50 - Porcupine - AoE DD - Costs power to maintain and immobilizes
              the caster </p>
            <p><strong>Mitigation(6)</strong>: An interesting variety of heals
              are available to the fury, most of which buff as well as mitigate
              damage. To me, that means that they probably don't heal as well
              as migitation only heals. The buffs present on the heals here,
              however, look to be the best mitigation buffs in the priest endgame.
              Lv 46 Starfire's AoE HoT DoT will likely be as useful as it is
              fun to say, meaning that it will be very nice, sort of like a watered
              down version of the inquisitor's 'uber' lv 50 DoT + power/health
              regen, except without that pesky immobilization. I think that the
              fury will probably be on the lower end of ability to actually mitigate
              damage, but the great buffs on his actual mitigation spells will
              still make him desirable. </p>
            <p>40 - Wild Bloodflow - Regen + damage buff <br>
  42 - Owl's restoration - Group heal + defense buff <br>
  42 - Howl of the Untamed - Instant heal <br>
  43 - Savage Feast - Group regen + sta and str buff when enemy dies <br>
  46 - Starfire - HoT DoT + AoE <br>
  47 - Ferine Elixir - Instant Heal + str and sta buff </p>
            <p><strong>Death prevention:</strong> pretty much like the other
              classes. </p>
            <p>42 - Feral Tenacity - Prevents death + heal + defense increase </p>
            <p><strong>Debuff (2)</strong>: The Fury ties with the inquisitor
              and defiler for having a level 49 STR debuff. Unfortunately for
              him they also have plenty of other debuffs, while fury fans have
              to hope that the Irritating Swarm at 47 does big things to enemy
              offense. Overall the debufs of the fury seem just slightly more
              potent than those of the warden, but weaker than those of all other
              priests. </p>
            <p>47 - Irritating Swarm - AoE offense and agi debuff <br>
  49 - Beastly Intimidation - Str and wis debuff </p>
            <p><strong>Utility (4):</strong> Much like his nature based brother
              the warden, the lv 39 utility spell of the fury is not a CC spell.
              It is a run speed spell, and i'm going to cross my fingers and
              hope that it works in combat (because most of the other classes
              get a spell at 39 which serves as a last ditch effort for crowd
              control). Untamed Shroud at 45 is a group invis, and if i remember
              correctly this and the run speed boost were thought to be in the
              domain of rogues. Either these are better than the rogue counterparts
              (which wouldn't be too much of a shock, as they are very high level),
              or the rogues are better and these can serve in the case that there
              is no rogue in the group. The 42 Toxic Quills 'save-me' ability
              will probably be slightly more effective than the average, because
              it not only provides an initial DD, but also throws damage onto
              the mob whenever it hits. Overall, the fury has a unique utility
              package which will probably make him sought after. </p>
            <p>**39 - Pact of the Cheetah - Increases group's run speed <br>
  45 - Untamed Shroud - Group invis <br>
  42 - Toxic Quills - Piercing DD + hate reducer + can add poison damage when
  hit //'save-me' ability: probably long recast, self only <br>
  48 - Incomparable predator - lion form </p>
            <p><strong>Flavor:</strong> For whatever reason, the fury is lacking
              a lv 40 flavor spell, giving him 2 while most other priests have
              3. Maybe it's karma, maybe it's just not in the list. Either way,
              I hope one is on the way. </p>
            <p>45 - Fury of the storm - Calls down lightning on a group member <br>
  50 - Rowyl's Furious Barrier - Surrounds the fury with rings of light </p>
