              And a little bit of that... 
            <p>Instead of showing you all the nice loot we got over the weekend, 
              I will just show you what the alts in anavon got this weekend. Not 
              trying to look uber or anything, but as fate would have it a few 
              special people got some very special things... </p>
            <p>We got this fine piece of weaponry for Sicons alt Siconns, What

            <p>Hazh, who althogh isnt an alt, but in all aspects should be one, 
              got lucky and scored a new ring, while everyone else and their wee 
              alts tried hard ninja'ing the loot off the rest of the war. After 
              a bit I actually think an officer got a hold of it, and ran off

              Oct 19 2002 3:01AM - Breaking News... AoW drops something for everyone 
              Regor <br>
              Whats this ? Varied loot ? <br>
              Something for everyone ? surely not.. this is no ordinary Everquest 
              mob ?<br>
              Blade of Carnage <br>
              Flayed Barbarian Skin Leggings <br>
              Ring of Destruction <br>
              War Bow of Rallos Zek </p>
            <p>Quick, petition, feedback.. mobs that dont drop all caster items, 
              or all melee items.. we had to call in a crack loot allocation rapid 
              crisis response team to sort this one out.. Our usual team were 
              too confused to know what to do. </p>
            <p>Ok, so im getting carried away.. <br>
              But this was something new.. <br>
              Not only did we see 4 items instead of our usual 3 (whats that all 
              about huh ?), and all different at that. But, this was our first 
              go against the 'tuned' AoW with our clerics going cold turkey on 
              there rod addictions. And it went right down to the wire.. Real 
              exciting fight, squeezing the last drop of mana from our clerics, 
              and then asking them for more. At the end there wasnt a cleric standing 
              with more than 5% mana, and after 3 perfect switches.. one dead 
              Orange Avatar. </p>
            <p>Nice fight :) I certainly hope this is a taste of whats to come 
              <br>
              <br>
              Oct 18 2002 2:51PM - More new VT stuff Regor <br>
              A Splendid run in VT last night netted us some very happy mana users 
              <br>
              New items to Anavon:<br>
              Darkened Claw Amulet <br>
              Ring of Flamewarding <br>
              Rune of Judgement </p>
            <p>Whats with all the runes ? <br>
              Dont think I wanna know what the denziens of Vex Thal are researching 
              from these particular runes.. <br>
              <br>
              Oct 17 2002 11:15AM - Oops Regor <br>
              In the last week, Anavon have visted Tunare, NToV, Some VT <br>
              Some stuff we never seen before:<br>
              Floating Rune <br>
              Helmet of Shadow <br>
              Golden Leaf Earring </p>
            <p><br>
              We seem to be just kicking it back waiting for PoP right now. Can 
              feel the tension in the air as we await the new expansion. Preparing 
              ourselves for crys of despair as boxes fail to arrive on Euro doorsteps 
              :/ ... Mixed feelings at the inevitable patches that await us.. 
              before new playgrounds open up to us. </p>
            <p>So, there are still a few mobs left on our kill list. SoL is by 
              no means complete, but we have had alot of fun getting here, and 
              there is still time yet to knock em off :) Heres to Anavons continued 
              progression into the Planes of Power !<br>

              News updates have been a bit lax because of a lack of anything interesting 
              to say. Since the last update we've killed Dain a couple of times, 
              spent a few days in N ToV, worked on AA and done some minor prepping 
              for Emp.</p>
            <p>Like I've said, nothing really major happening. It must be because 
              fall is in the air and our natural rythms are slowing down. I guess 
              the following is the most exciting loot we've gotten:</p>
            <p> The Sword of Ssraeshza - Goldenfist of Talons <br>
              Gebron's Demented Cloak - Fellus of Talons <br>
              Acrylia Handled Broadsword - Druss of CC<br>
              <br>
              All of which drops from no other that The Big Meanie. Congratulations 
              to The Black Talons and Cohort Chalybeius on the killing of Emperor 
              Ssraeshza on our 7th attempt. I'm sure there will be more to come!

              I logged in today expecting the Sleeper crew to still be buffing, 
              instead they've already cleared 6 MOTG guards, and only 2 left for 
              me to pounce. I guess they had no *ahem* obstacles *ahem* to delay 
              them today that required a GM. Anyway, shortly after, Master of 
              the GayAssLootDropper was dead and he graced us with another piercer. 
              Hooray us! Gratz Havasee on your piercer of uber procs.
            <p> </p>
            <p>Then we rested briefly and we pulled the Ganitor version 2 a few 
              moments later. Long fight and much much tougher than the first time 
              we've killed him, but he fell like Rutgereos on a Drinking Binge 
              at the Freeport Inn. he dropped the same ghetto piercer MoTG dropped 
              so gratz Kiram on your piercer of common drops. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Then we decided to check out Velketor since he was up. We were 
              kinda hopin for an ST shard drop, but all he dropped was book (BG), 
              some nifty necro bracer that Lowkii got, some gem looking thing 
              that Spiderwiz got that casts free nukage, and a dorky bracer that 
              i don't know who got (maybe destroyed). He also dropped Skar, but 
              nobody wanted to loot him so he rotted (err rezzed).<br>

              A few groups returned to VP this evening for experience, refining 
              tactics, and obtain more spells.
            <p>OCT 18, 2002<br>
              Entry into Veeshan's Peak. We have worked hard to finish a large 
              number of keys for VP, and we put them all to use for the first 
              time this evening. Almost 30 of us entered the zone and we proceeded 
              to learn and experiment within the zone. Overall, we had an enormous 
              amount of fun doing something new and reaching this guild milestone. 
              In addition to our information building, we managed to kill Silverwing 
              and came away with some decent drops this evening: Scimitar of Lifestealing 
              [Maxist], Robe of Smothering [Greymask], Hammer of Dragonborn [Khallin], 
              Voice of the Berserker [Barelil], Word of Redemption [Aorthin], 
              Sunstrike, Lure of Ice, Malo, Mala and a few other items. A great 
              time was had by everyone.</p>

              Newscaster Slain in Bloody Coup <br>
              The 9th of October </p>
            <p> In a sudden, yet well planned out, coup, control of the drunkards 
              was passed from Twyl onto Derreck.<br>
              As his first act in office Derreck disbanded the 'newsing' of any 
              'news' and also stated that 'newsers' were all to be shot.</p>
            <p>Not wasting any time he committed suicide and thus control of the 
              guild was rightfully returned to Twyl, who was quoted as saying 
              &quot;news things are ok now.&quot;</p>

              <br>
              Apparently all the spectators in the Arx and our raid channel did 
              not get a clean view at how to kill Seru the other day. Our very 
              own Delkhaan has put together a nice training film for the other 
              guilds out there to use.</p>

              Which wall?! - Trucari (10/16/2002 9:57 AM) <br>
              <br>
              I'm going to tell you the secret to killing Seru. It's wholly pyschological. 
              You have to send a tell to everyone in your guild that says,&quot;Seru's 
              AE is like warm butter melting all over your body.&quot; Then you 
              have to tell your main tanks for the night,&quot;Getting hit by 
              Seru melee is like spending a half hour getting a massage.&quot; 
              This is of course why only main tanks can tank and everyone else 
              dies after a few rounds. After that you inform people that it's 
              only possible to kill Seru if you were to position him on the correct 
              wall. You say the &quot;right&quot; wall? Yes, the friggen &quot;right&quot; 
              wall. Why not another wall? Because it's impossible. Why? Don't 
              ask. </p>
            <p>After all these preliminary guidelines have been met you are now 
              ready to kill Lord Inquisitor Seru. </p>
            <p>Using this extremely leet strategy we were about to lay waste to 
              Seru again. Props all for believing me. (Omnislash I wasn't serious 
              about the butter thing, stop rubbing yourself.)</p>

              <br>
              OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG</p>
            <p>After spending a night debating if we really had big enough balls 
              to drop emp solo inhouse for the first time on the server by ourselves 
              without any help by anyone else. We gave it a shot shortly after 
              10pm EST (which is the only timezone that counts btw). </p>
            <p>Did you know a wood elf can tank Emperor? Bullshit you say. I normally 
              would agree with you. Tonight we were shown something else.</p>
            <p>Did you know a ragamuffin gathering of clerics could keep said 
              tank alive for the duration of the entire encounter. Normally, and 
              like our fun with seru would show, I would agree you. However, I'd 
              be wrong again.</p>
            <p>When he died, I think nearly half the guild had intercourse with 
              the dead corpse(Omnislash most notably). The resounding &quot;fuck 
              you&quot;'s directed at the Emperor truly set the atmosphere for 
              the evening.</p>
            <p>All in all a superb end to a seeminly unremarkable night. I'm exceptionally 
              proud of my guild tonight. Grats to Talamyr, Halon, Llore, and Zeta

              -Epics! Epics! Oh, and Sex!- <br>
              With so many people very close to finishing their epics we went 
              out and about to try to finish a few. Still have a few more to go, 
              but we have two more epic members now. This brings us up to eight 
              epic members with four more within one piece of finishing. Hopefully 
              we can get those soon. </p>
            <p>First things first we teamed up with LoD again to bring down two 
              Ragefires. Both fights went very well and very quick. Grats Abanado 
              on his epic! </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Next up we hit up the Plane of Sky to finish my super duper Ranger 
              epic. We ported up one night, only to find out that most of the 
              zone was clear. So we took the Nestea plunge back down to Freeport. 
              Then we went up the next night and found that a super cool *cough*ebay*cough* 
              Shaman had killed the Princess on the first island. So we buy up 
              our keys and head to island two. Clear it really quickly, and go 
              to spawn Sirran. Whee, now Sirran. Naturally no GM's online cause 
              heaven forbid they do work. Here we were gathered before we knew 
              the full boredom that would hit us later. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>From past experience you can obviously guess that boredom with 
              Cybernauts leads to hot steamy sex on Island 2 of Plane of Sky. 
              Brigug refused to buffzor us if we didn't give him his jollies. 
              Although me and Sithray weren't too upset by all of this. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>After this me and Sithray decided to tag-team Tiliu, but she ran 
              off, but we didn't care.... </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>After we finally gave up in Plane of Sky we headed to Kithicor 
              with 9 people to take on the General for Fuwud's epic. Took him 
              down quite easily and lots of sex was had afterwards. Grats Fuwud 
              on his Rogue epic. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>I was goofing around in Oasis the other day, and saw that Cazel 
              was up. So a couple of people came in and we downed him with 3 people, 
              no diseaser. Although that regen sucks quite much. However after 
              Dorry left from helping, a devilish(hmmmhhmhmmhmmhhmm) ploy came 
              into mind. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>With the great success of that one, I decided to do it again on 
              my way to Velk's. Some people got smart, but I said Get back honker!. 
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>We've gotten Lodizal a couple more times as well so many of us 
              are stuck on the hell that is Stormfeather. We also have some more 
              epics coming up soon. Also working on Coldain rings. /yawn Anyway, 
              will post more sexilicious updates next time we take care of business. 
              Buhbye. </p>

              Cazic-Thule falls... Posted by Moonhawk October 12 2002<br>

              Cazic-Thule falls!!<br>
              SA and LoD at it again...
            <p>It was a very successful and exciting evening for the Second Age 
              guild last night. Several events occurred in succession, the most 
              important of which was a reconcilliation between Second Age and 
              Legacy of Darkness. The two guilds are allied again and have buried 
              their past differences. A meeting was held between them to iron 
              out any reamaining issues and to discuss what our direction and 
              goals should be.</p>
            <p>Following the meeting, the leadership of Second Age was pleased 
              to announce the promotion of five new Officers: Abroghan, Bellowes, 
              Exmoor, Graytalon, and Toroksr. Congratulations to them.</p>
            <p>As if that wasn't exciting enough, I received a tell from Fenier, 
              LoD's newly elected Guild Leader. He wanted to know if we would 
              be interested in attempting Cazic-Thule, the evil god whose home 
              is the Plane of Fear. SA's response was, &quot;H...</p>

              I know, I know.</p>
            <p>Y'all been wonderin what we have been up to. Pretty much just the 
              one thing. Vex Thal. Couple days over a month ago, we whacked Emporer 
              for the first time, and started getting completed keys. Took about 
              a week to get enough keys completed to look around. Poked about 
              for another week and then put in a serious push to learn the zone...and 
              learn it we did.</p>
            <p>We took the grand tour of VT from start to finish, and I have something 
              important to share with you. Years ago, I visited a friend attending 
              a major university, and something about it struck me. Every damn 
              building for this entire school (for 30,000 + students) looked like 
              it had been designed by the same guy and built from the same load 
              of bricks. No matter how interesting the folks I met were, every 
              place I went felt monotonous. I kinda wondered to myself what kind 
              of moron would design a university that way, and who would hire 
              such a moron?</p>
            <p>Heh.</p>
            <p>We found him. He built Vex Thal.</p>
            <p>So, while trying our best to ignore the initially cool looking 
              and then mindlessly repetitive architecture....we took our alliance 
              through the zone to test our mettle. There were wipeouts and some 
              wasted time from respawn, but every boss we lined up died, and that 
              is what it is all about. A couple bosses won the initial encounter 
              as we learned them, but nothing took more than a second attempt 
              leading all the way to mini Aten and Aten herself, which both dropped 
              first time.</p>
            <p>It has been a DAMN fine couple weeks learnin this place, and as 
              always I am proud like all get out to be runnin with the folks I 
              am...the finest bunch around.<br>
              <br>
              Now, of course, that clears the expansion for us but for one guy....Seru. 
              Comin for you shortly, white boy.<br>
