                POG tonight. After a slow start and a total wipeout we get things 
                rolling and have some nice ass drops. Gratz to Izzu on his Beserker's 
                BP, Niap on his Pantaloons of the Bonecaster, Kati/Thamak/Darious 
                on their Stonewood Mail, and Caymon on his Fist of the Silver 
                Moon. We also welcome Niap as the latest lackey into BFD. Welcome

                <br>
                07/13/01: Feeling under the weather, we did our own thing this 
                evening. Hopped on really late to help the crypt in Sebilis with 
                a CR and on the way there heard the King casting. Bastard has 
                some ballz doing that shit when we are in zone. After we res'd 
                the crypt, we hauled ass to the King only to disrobe the phat 
                phuk. /sigh<br>

				07/12/01: BFD and VG attempt to off Faydedar for Rikkir's epic 
                tonight. We are shocked as the tiny fish inserts his foot in our 
                ass and owns us. We were all briefed to bring our fire and magic 
                resist gear but we forgot the KY. It was close, but we were a 
                cleric and a few tanks shy of the taking him down, we will be 
                making sushi outta this bitch soon enuff tho. Tonight we welcome 
                Kenaniah as BFD's latest Lackey.<br>

                07/11/01: We did jack shit last night, sleep came into play for 
                once. We do however welcome Katishya into BFD as a lackey, glad 
                to have ya sis, now I can stop posting "Kati joins us for goats 
                and sheep" and have more time to poke my bunny. Holy shit, I just 
                realized that it's been almost a week since we had a good CR. 
                Better warm up the coffins, I smell death brewing. Muhahaha.<br>
                <br>
                07/10/01: We opted for a very laid back evening. Kati joins us 
                as we start the evening in Skyshrine and wind up back in Kael. 
                We pulled down some really nice loot tonight which included a 
                Lath Drinor, Join Ethereal Cape, Coldstone Wreath, Black Bear 
                Pelt Cloak, Silvery Belt of Contention, Chain Helm, Silk Boots, 
                Silk Gloves, and a Dire Wolf Hide Cloak. We also had Syalin and 
                Pava join us in Kael as we killed till the sun came up. We welcome 
                Mephesto/Skulmasher into BFD as our latest lackey, gratz bro and 
                welcome to the family. <br>
                <br>
                07/09/01: Tonight BDA, VG, and Ginss all join forces to rape Brother 
                Zepehyl for Caymon's next step in his epic quest. Gratz bro. Afterwards, 
                Kati, Kinlavae, and Rado, join us for a little Kael courtyard 
                action and although not much dropped, I did manage to win the 
                plate helm. Woot! <br>
                <br>
                07/08/01: After a hard weekend, we decide to break for a roll 
                ya own xp night. We also say goodbye to Twigs and Reddish as they 
                choose a different path at the fork in the road. G'luck to both 
                of them, we all wish them the best.</blockquote>

              <blockquote>07/07/01: After three previous battles and one false 
                start the mighty Faydedar finally fell. There was not one death 
                as a result of the battle. It was a perfectly executed dragon 
                slaying. The forces of Praxium, Holy Fire, Servants of Mystery, 
                Path of Valor and Clan Blackwatch assembled on the beach. After 
                a quick and decisive fight Faydedar crashed to the ground dead 
                and broken. The victory was a triumph to teamwork and organization 
                - yes it does work and yes victory is a result. We fought, we 
                lost, we learned and the reward was victory.</blockquote>

              <a href="http://crimsontalon.gleinig.com/"><b>Crimson Talon</b></a> 
              <blockquote>07/14/01: Faydedar fell tonight to a well prepared group 
                of adventurers determined to slay the dragonfish. Brewall worked 
                out the groups, final strategy, and the attack based on some excellent 
                first-hand Fay killing information from Aamaeb of the Talons. 
                Faydedar never moved within a foot of the main tank group and 
                went down with little difficulty, and just a couple deaths. Thanks 
                to all that attended the fish fry, and Tomwin is now the proud 
                holder of the druid epic!<br>
                <br>
                Please welcome our newest members, Hawkien and Windarii, to the 
                Crimson Talon!<br>
                <br>
                07/13/01: The dragon wurm, Lady Vox, perishes again in the frozen 
                tundra of Permafrost. Brewall led his eighth successful raid against 
                her (10-0 now versus Vox & Nag). Once again, all items were open 
                rolls with no reserved items. Had near catastrophe at start when 
                Vox wedged herself near the opening rock. Took almost a minute 
                to free her from the spot and get her into the lair. With just 
                one enchanter, she was able to get off no less than 2 complete 
                heals, but died neverless. Drops were: Crystalline Spear [Borq], 
                Staff of Forbidden Rites [Cellwin], Dragon Bone Bracer [Cowabunga 
                -> donated to Jevrulle], and McVaxious Horn of War [Brewall (on 
                the \random 1 5, I rolled a 1. Note that I had same odds as all 
                other bards on raid)]. Grats to Sabore for the kill shot. <br>
                <br>
                07/12/01: HATE! Our first guild raid of Hate went off very well. 
                We broke into Hate to find The Taken already there, and they were 
                kind enough to let us stage at SS before we moved to the NE corner. 
                Successfully cleared the entire NE side of zone without a major 
                catastrophe. Will definitely have to return again sometime soon. 
                Drops were: Rogue legs [Klepta], Mage legs [Immolar], Cleric shield 
                [Syncere], Paladin epic item [Savardar], Enchanter gloves [Saleel], 
                Paladin epic item [Kenaf] (Taken did not need), Shadowknight shield, 
                [Valoria], Shaman gloves (rotted). For a first time hate raid, 
                an excellent job! <br>
                <br>
                07/10/01: Cursed by clerics everywhere, Nagafen met an untimely 
                death this evening at the hands of another Brewall led open raid. 
                Hopefully, some lucky cleric will have another rez stick in the 
                coming days. An incredible number of people showed up, and regretfully, 
                some had to be turned away. The foul beast died quickly at the 
                hands of the well-prepared group. His drops were: Cloak of Flames 
                [Altus], Red Dragon Scale [Karamur], Heirophant's Crook [Aprisle], 
                Gold Plated Koshigatana [Rado], Gauntlet's of Firey Might [Physst], 
                Diamond [Niewlut], and 2 junk items (jacinth and a word). Giant 
                drops were: Polished Mithril Torque [Ciladin/Cilden] and Polished 
                Mithril Mask [Cerritus]. I know everyone was confused with Ciladin/Cilden, 
                but he always rolls as a paladin, his enc alt helps with buffs 
                (or with Vox, seiving), I keep all this straight in my spreadsheet.

                07/08/01: Patch day announced for Tuesday. Will plan to kill Naggy 
                that night. Also received word that Lovern (alt was Larea at Vox 
                raids) completed the Bard Epic quest last night (was present at 
                4 Vox raids with Heirophant Cloak and when caster won the WDS, 
                I enforced trade). Grats to Lovern! <br>
                <br>
                07/07/01: Raid on the Tower of Frozen Shadow. Made it to top level 
                of the tower and stayed there for a while reveling in the long 
                trip to the top. Quite a few spell drops along the way: Tumultous 
                Strength, Turning of the Unnatural, and Ro's Firey Sundering. 
                Other drops that night included: Vhal'Sera Skull Earring (ac2 
                str2 hp20 mana15), Laced Veil (ac2 dex4 cha8 agi3 fr5 dr8), Frost 
                Covered Tome (str3 sta3 hp30 fr15) [Savardar], Sparkling Soul 
                Necklace (ac2 dex5 agi6 dr5 mr5 pr5) [Saleel], Tserrina's Symbol 
                (ac3 cha5 wis5 int5 mana40) [Azalin], and Tserrina's Key (key 
                to go directly to level 7) [Sintosa] </blockquote>

              <blockquote>07/08/01: Malachy, Aegolius, Casseopaeia, Tico and Lividity 
                of Holy Fire joined allies Clan Blackwatch and Praxium to take 
                down Faydedar the dragon (or rather salamander) in Timorous Deep 
                to obtain the druid epic piece. The tactic used was to buff melees 
                and casters who then logged to the CT chat room while waiting 
                for the entire party (48 people!) to finish buffing. The melees 
                would log in first and take the dragon down to half health at 
                which point the casters would be told to log in and finish him 
                off. When the casters (including this reporter) logged in, there 
                was no battle. We were 'told' that the dragon was already dead. 
                In fact, this reporter could not even take a picture because, 
                mysteriously, there was no corpse to be seen. Some casters suspect 
                there IS no dragon and that this was a clever ruse by the melees 
                to make it appear as though they can handle uber mobs without 
                us casters. But everyone knows that's not true.</blockquote>

                last update, I figured I should let yas know what has been happening. 
                We didn't do to bad in the Hole last friday even if it was a slow 
                week for us. Many were on vacation and we found ourselves on the 
                short side of being clericaly inclined. Because of this, we postponed 
                Chardok until a later date. <br>
                <br>
                This week, we are planning on a Kedge Raid on Friday Night, 9pm 
                est. If you are planning on coming, we will need you to be in 
                the Cauldron by 830 est time. I would advise if you don't have 
                a way to cast enduring breath, you have an item, or some potions 
                for backup. All of which are relatively cheap. You will find these 
                are life saviors if our druids die. This zone is completely underwater, 
                so it should be a good experience for those who have never fought 
                in an underwater environment and preparation is the proper key 
                to survival. <br>
                <br>
                I would like to also welcome Azax to Knights of Twilight as an 
                officer. Over the past few weeks he has shown his desire to work 
                for us and I think he will rock as an officer. We have some new 
                plans and ideas about future events that I think could work to 
                better us as a whole. I have liked how the guild has bonded together 
                and I am pretty sure even though we seem to be in a lull that 
                again we will be on top.<br>
                <br>
                On a last note, please use the recruiting system in place. I want 
                us to be able to keep track of those we have been bringing into 
                KoT. I am sure many of you who have wanted an accurate roster 
                would appreciate it if we could keep track of who is coming and 
                going. Please support KoT in this use the recruiting guidelines.

                skills, clearing in Skyshrine crawling through dragon libraries 
                all the way down to the depths of Chardok, freeing Froglok slaves 
                deep in the pits below the bridge. From there we ranged far in 
                our adventures to the Western Wastes, where the dragons gave up 
                much loot.<br>
                <br>
                Named dragons in the Western Wastes fell to our forces like so 
                many West Freeport Rats. And there was much rejoicing in the land. 
                Overall - it was a very good time. I believe we managed to raid 
                every night this week. It's good to see the guild doing what it 
                does best - raiding zones.<br>
                <br>
                Shahmat really isn't about loot, or experience - we are about 
                raiding - seeing new things, traveling to new places, doing it 
                better than it's been done before. We are totally about good times, 
                with good friends who share a love of a great game.<br>
                <br>
                We hit the 50 member limit and saw more good people out there 
                and kept right on tagging folks, today we're around 60 members 
                strong. The raids are rocking, the loot is flowing and it's all 
                good.<br>
                <br>
                So if ya want to kill some dragons, see some sights, explore a 
                bit and have fun - stop by some time - we've always got room for 
                the very best players. If your looking for a guild that's a little

                07/13/01: Friday the 13th is a good day for Ghob. He is now an 
                official member of the guild. Grats! <br>
                <br>
                07/12/01: This update comes from Rikkir: Unfortunately this did 
                not go as planned. The Big Phish would not sacrifice himself to 
                feed us hungry travelers. I want to thank everyone for there support 
                and want to throw a big THX to BFD for having such a grand showing 
                for the supposed Phish Phry. Sorry you had to go home hungry =( 
                Bastard Fish!! I think next time we will have to bring BIGGER 
                POLES to land this bugger. <br>
                <br>
                07/11/01: Venswayla has become an official member of the guild. 
                Grats Vens! <br>
                <br>
                Please welcome Phlite, 46 druid, on the start of his probation 
                with the guild. <br>
                <br>
                07/10/01: Please welcome Kazlaak, 30 shadow knight, on the start 
                of his probation with the guild. <br>
                <br>
                07/09/01: Project Eon cleared Fear most of Monday so getting the 
                corpses out was easy. After getting the last of them rezzed and 
                out of Fear, we headed over to Rathe Mountains. BFD was preparing 
                to take down Brother Zephyl so we joined in to beat him down. 
                Only a few deaths before he died and Icesis was quite disappointed 
                that she only got to rez one VG body. ;) Grats to Caymon from 
                BFD! <br>
                <br>
                After Brother Zephyl, Sarlaac was turned into a puppy and sent 
                out to find Kazzel D`leyrt in Rathe Mountains. He turned in some 
                stuff and made a Monstrous Zombie spawn. After kicking him in 
                the shins a bit, he crumbled and Sarlaac completed his Life Leech 
                Spell Quest. Grats Sarlaac! <br>
                <br>
                Since we were on a roll with quests and we had some rangers at 
                our disposal, we ported to Wakening Lands to help Lumarie finish 
                up her Phenocryst's Focus Quest. She turned something into the 
                big geonid guy that spawned three giants that we had to kill.<br>
                <br>
                Ferkl and Falconian went off to track them down. Ferkl found one 
                of them while Falconian found a completely different giant in 
                a tree. He got to run to the zone and ended up sacrificing himself 
                so the rest of us could kill those giants and Lum could finish 
                her quest.<br>
                <br>
                Thankfully, Boanerges was in the zone and knew he should stay 
                nearby because rangers were around. He rezzed Falc and Lumarie 
                got her Phenocryst's Focus. Then all the crazy geonids came out 
                and entertained us with a parade. Weird rock things.</blockquote>
