              <p>The industrious EW killed Mithaniel Marr tonight. </p>
              <p>Finally, the suspense thats been building up over the last couple 
                weeks is over. <br>
                Ignoring the Demi-God Terris Thule, and going past three other 
                planes <br>
                without tasting a real god's blood, we finally met our destiny 
                face-to-face... </p>
              <p>Mithaniel Marr went in with confidence, and fought a valorous 
                fight... </p>
              <p></p>
              <p></p>
              <p>but, in the end we kicked his ass right off the map... </p>
              <p></p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Loot? It sucked but nobody really cared, it was a very fun night 
                and we really love these fights that aren't 30 minutes long... 
              </p>
              <p>To the old boring fights of EQ... justice is served, and it looks 
                like PoP will be filled <br>
                with nothing but fast paced and very challenging encounters. </p>
              <p>Update... Amidgit here... </p>

              <p>I have been slacking and throughly ENJOYING it! For the whiny 
                Eddee &amp; Popi, no updates 1 year! The death threats are what 
                made me actually update the webpage, and Kalatarain kicking my 
                dog 3 times was a big help too.. so please STOP sending the death 
                threats, and please STOP abusing my pet: here is your UPDATE!</p>
              <p>Actually, if we don't do anything new or overly exciting I generally 
                get lazy and don't update, and the other jerkoffs who have access 
                to update the news are LAZY BASTARDS(tm) Down to business I guess.. 
                And before I forget, the website will be moving and changing hands 
                sometime within the next few weeks. Until then I won't be posting 
                any of my sassy screenshots or guild quotes, but afterwards I 
                hear we have 50MEGS of hosting space for our goatporn(tm) and 
                I will be back on the ball!</p>

                Tonight we went to visit the Itraer Vius, quad hitting IV I may 
                add. Things went good, including the 8 gater mob trains(fun). 
                Then I got blinded and knocked back for the first 1/2 of the fight 
                it seemed, lame bard aggro or something! Then I got booted to 
                desktop(more fun), then I get the &quot;Cannot conect to login 
                server&quot; message, and of course 1018 after that to make things 
                just tasticly lame, something I should be used to from VI by now! 
                Oh well, everyone decided to play (edited)tard tonight and IV 
                raped us little by little!</p>

              <p>So, I've been tinkering on and off for a long time, over on Ayonae 
                Ro.. Been sitting at 119 for a while now, so I'm not too accomplished 
                at it. I made fishing poles, and eyeball things, and lockpicks, 
                and eyeglasses, mostly for fun, and the odd (and RARE!) person 
                who wanted one. I decided that with this new Planes of Power thing, 
                I could make some pretty spiffy stuff! I mean, what gnome doesn't 
                want a maximizing machine, so I can step on all those mean Iksar 
                and dark elves who wanna make Gnome Pie outta me? Or block a doorway 
                with my ogre-sized bum! Anyway.. I farmed merchants, farmed the 
                guild, farmed PoI, farmed those damned creepy alien thingies, 
                yadda yadda.. I'm at 174 now. I've made tons of minimizers, a 
                handful of maximizers, a few gauze presses (even sold a few! Now 
                I feel guilty!), and innovative cams for the guild fletchers.. 
                I've given everyone who wants one a collapsed container, rogues 
                have their lockpicks, etc. But I think the most vexing thing was 
                the piles and piles of Meteorological Rockets that I made. Sure, 
                I could saved the money and not bought the Opal and made a Happy 
                Dragon (strange images with that name, very strange indeed!), 
                but what the hey, I HATE THE RAIN!! And I figured everyone else 
                did do! Now, maybe I'm selling them for too much in bazaar, and 
                maybe I'm selling them for too little (if I undercut you, I'm 
                sorry! Send me a tell, I'll get my prices back in line, I'm not 
                used to selling this stuff, but merchants won't buy it, and I'm 
                a packrat who can't press the destroy button!), but regardless, 
                they don't sell. <br>
                So, tonight, prior to the patch, I grabbed up a bagful of Meteorological 
                Rockets, and started porting from zone to zone (I'm a wizard, 
                you know!), looking for the rain.. Me! Who loves fire and hates 
                rain, LOOKING FOR ICKY, WET RAIN! HAH! Well, I actually ended 
                up finding more snow than rain.. Oh well, beggers can't be choosers. 
                So off went the rockets! FWEEEEE! And the snow stopped! What's 
                this?!?! I defeated Norrathian weather! WHOA!! So, I went to a 
                couple zones, stopping rain, and snow.. Cackling all the while, 
                for there's nothing so joyous as making the world of Norrath bend 
                to YOUR will, and what's more, bend it using the genius of gnomish 
                technology! </p>
              <p>And you know what? I decided to put the Meteorological Rocket 
                to the ultimate test... The one test that would leave the weather 
                of the world in my small but powerful grasp! Choktok would take 
                his Weather Rockets to the KARANAS! The land of un-relenting rain, 
                the massive Karanas! So, I bundled up my rockets, and using a 
                teleport (I'm a wizard, you know!!), I went to the Karanas.. And 
                saw empty skies.. For what seemed an eternity, I zipped and zoomed 
                around in typical gnomish fashion, from East to West, from North 
                to South.. And not a drop fell. And you know what? You know what 
                I think??? I COWED KARANA!! BWAHAHAAHAHAA!!! </p>
              <p>Well, maybe not. But Solusek would have it so, I say!! Still, 
                I wanted to use a rocket there. I know, I know, it wouldn't have 
                stopped the rangers from dying (for we all know that every drop 
                of rain in the Karanas is a tear shed by The Rain Keeper for a 
                dead ranger), but it would have been the jewel atop the crown, 
                the head upon the ale, the cheese in my macaroni! Alas.. I will 
                be back for your domain, Karana, you wait and see! And while all 
                the young'ns are lauding the name of Choktok the Rainstopper, 
                I'll drink a toast to all those who were swept away by the rains 
                before Gnomish Tinkering ruled the day! ^_^ </p>

                1. Thank you so much for all your support and encouragement!!! 
                I've been doing subquests with just Galant / Sifer and me -- working 
                my way to the last few items and fights when I would need help. 
                I'm very shy for asking for help and I want to say THANK YOU to 
                Galant for his support and love and encouragement and Istarus 
                for his support and encouragement!!!! Without you two goading 
                and nudging me, I would still be sighing over not having my epic, 
                but helping everyone else with theirs &lt;HUGE HUGS!!!!&gt; Thank 
                you, too, to Tuatha, who wanted to help sooo badly and I wanted 
                to try to do it myself (couldn't have done Dark Corruptor without 
                you Sweetie)!</p>
              <p>Most of all, thank you to the two groups of brothers and sisters 
                who came and blundered their way with me while we were searching 
                for my mob in the Hole (Aelani, Sav and Ist -- your leadership 
                in getting us to Jaeil was absolutely invaluable -- I've never 
                been on a Jaeil hunt before and was clueless as to where to go)!!! 
                For the mix-up over the other guild being there first and nerves 
                and confusion and then re-mustering there again later, HUGE HUGS 
                and THANK YOUs!!!!! LOL and then we attacked the wrong Jaeil in 
                nervousness!!!! Thank you for EVERYTHING!!! And Galant -- Thank 
                you, Babe, for mustering people and organizing and, really, taking 
                such personal care and attention over anything and everything 
                that concerns me -- YOU are the BEST!!!</p>
              <p>And Kortak -- and Araniho -- THANK YOU a MILLION times for the 
                sphere MQ!!!!!!! Definitely would NOT have Swiftwind in my hands 
                without your intervention, Dears -- YOU are completely AWESOME!!!!! 
              </p>
              <p>All in all, from getting Jade Reaver in my hands to getting Swiftwind 
                in my hands -- was less than one physical day!!!! Whew!!! What 
                a lot of work and nerves!!!</p>
              <p>Now, on to Inny!!! &lt;grins&gt;</p>
              <p>Thank you soooo much again for those of you who came and those

                WToV named was the aim for today, so we slapped them around a 
                couple times. Well, once each. You know what I mean goddamnit! 
                <br>
                First down was Telk, in all of his ugliness (we think he may be 
                related to Nimbo).</p>

                It was clear who had to die next:Taino! Wait, no, Lendi The Keeper! 
                Naturally, he went down faster than Anterak in a duel.</p>

              <p>We cleared our way through to Vulak Bridge, handling some flurries 
                with a nice bunch of adds, and zoned in to PoM for some late night 
                fun. All in all it was a nice weekend, and we got some awsome 
                loot. Grats to all =)<br>

                nice big step for us and definatly moves us up the food chain 
                a bit. Great work to everyone on getting the factions, levels, 
                and other mindless BS.. /salutes. So you ask, how was our first 
                night in HoT? we kicked ass, would you expect anything else? a 
                death or two as our monks learned the work the pit pull, and after 
                that, smooth as silk, 10 total drops for the night, and only 1 
                wipe (on the last pull, go figure :P). anyways, didnt get to many 
                pic's off.. bateries died in the camera, but here are two i managed 
                to take when I did remember for a split second. </p>
              <p> Once again, Great work everyone, we are starting to look really 
                good, and just more and more to come! and Grats to those who walked 
                out with drops last night! </p>

                Here is a collection of everything you need to be know about raiding. 
                One of the basic purpose of this article is that you do not need 
                to ask the trivial tasks you have to do. If everyone do their 
                jobs as a well-oiled machine, everything goes faster and smoother.

                UDL TURNS 8 YEARS OLD!!<br>
                That's right, undead fans!! Your lords this month has turned 8 
                years old as a guild. With over hundred knights, we have collected 
                many souls for our Master, our God, old Bones himself, Myrkul. 
                We have spanned many realms and many prime material planes. We 
                have played games from the original Never Winter Nights to Dark 
                Age of Camelot today. Breathers we have touched have felt their 
                soul slip away as we rip their hearts out. We have always aspired 
                to game the Player Verses Player character with a Role-play style. 
                No guild can say the same or be the same as the Undead Lords. 
              </p>
              <p>Congrats to Fellow Knights for maintaining and growing our forces. 
                We always strive to have quality players who we can call friends 
                from years to come. I am glad to call you Kin.</p>
              <p>PRAISE MYRKUL!!! </p>
