              Sep 26 2002 11:59AM - Happy 40th Uros ! Regor <br>
              For some, getting drunk is a requirement to log onto EQ<br>
              For the rest of us, we have to put up with the monkeys still trying 
              to get us killed with VT trains <br>
              /auction WTB Compass for Volkaran 
            <p>A quick couple of Va Xakra kills netted us a few items we havnt 
              seen before:<br>
              Boots of Silent Dreams <br>
              Bracer of the Silent Star <br>
              Gorget of Superiority </p>
            <p>Finding the additional haste on the gorget came as a pleasant surprise 
            </p>

              Sep 21 2002 2:12AM - More VT, and then some more VT... Deacis <br>

              teamwork and utter dedication, except from Poor Garulfo who fell 
              asleep and had to be sacrificed to an angry horde of respawn :p 
            </p>

              We came, we saw, we fought, we lost, but we know our enemy and have 
              learned from our mistakes.<p>
              &quot;Thus it is said that one who knows the enemy and knows himself 
              will not be endangered in a hundred engagements. One who does not 
              know the enemy but knows himself will sometimes be victorious, sometimes 
              meet with defeat. One who knows neither the enemy nor himself will 
              invariably be defeated in every engagement.&quot; - Sun Tzu ~ The 
              Art of War<br>

              Woot! This one is special because the guild graciously let me loot 
              the talisman. Thanks guys! Thanks especially to Allegory who went 
              with me to DN to unlock Jaled Dar's shades' room for the turn in.

            <p>A few of us went to Sleepers and killed 2 named golems who dropped 
              1 primal velium claidmore on one, and 1 primal velium battleaxe 
              on the other. No priceless dropped while I was there. Pics below...<p>

              This must be Stormy's week. Not a day after getting Verina Tomb 
              knocked out for the count, she finds Vessel Drozlin up in Cabillis 
              and gets a fine group of Coggies to take him out early in the morning. 
              Gratz Stormy and I think that gets it down to just the Shissar in 
              Fear for her now.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>And the big gratz goes to our newest epic wielder in the guild, 
              Mancinia. Only CoG's second bard to finish their epic and a long 
              time coming. Gratz Manci on finally getting it done. You deserved 
              it and we all love you.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Also gratz to Ayanar on the Cloak of Piety that dropped off of 
              the spawned Trakanon. No more complaiing about haste now!!<br>
            </p>
            <p> <b><a href="http://www.crimsontalon.com" target="_top">Crimson 
              Talon</a></b><br>
              SEP 23, 2002<br>
              Killed Trakanon again to obtain more teeth. Drops were: 2 Teeth 
              [Klaminar, Lumper], Donal BP [Aorthin], and a Cobalt BP [Guild bank].
            <p>SEP 21, 2002<br>
              Finished Aorthin's epic this evening. Grats to Aorthin for the water 
              sprinkler! Ragefire also dropped 3 red dragon scales. Would have 
              preferred 3 cloak of flames. From there, we did a bit more epic 
              work in the Hole.</p>
            <p>SEP 20, 2002<br>
              Experience night after a lot of raiding. A few of us went over to 
              skyfire and managed to obtain 2 more shards within an hour using 
              Brewall's patented camping technique. Aorthin is just a Ragefire 
              away from epic!</p>
            <p>SEP 19, 2002<br>
              Another night in ToV. Got off to a slow start, but then we cleared 
              the Halls of Testing in record time. Drops were very light for plate, 
              but the other classes were very happy. Loots: Chain BP [Shcammer], 
              Leather Gloves [rotted], Silk Wrist [Chantress], Chain Helmet [Dreamthief], 
              Chain Legs [Klaminar], White Symbol [Brewall], Leather Legs [for 
              MQ], and a Silk Turban [Kestel].</p>
            <p>After we zoned out of ToV, we realized that Escorpa was up, and 
              with information consisting of 'has a drop I need', we decided to 
              attack. On our first attempt, we had Escorpa down to under ten percent 
              when it gated on us. We quickly recovered and pummelled Escorpa 
              on the second attempt without losing a single person. Not bad for 
              learning a mob on the fly, and testifies to the good players within 
              the guild. Drops were a Talisman [Groovit] and a Book.</p>
            <p>SEP 17/18, 2002<br>
              Played around with Grieg a couple times. Good learning experience 
              for us, and perhaps with a bit more weapons and armour we will try 
              again in the near future.</p>
            <p>SEP 16, 2002<br>
              ToV, The Halls of Testing. Cleared the entire east side of the zone 
              without difficulty. Drops were: Chain Boots [Khallin], Plate Bracer 
              [Gish], Ruby Symbol [Klaminar], Poison Symbol [Kestel], Silk Arms 
              [Zionmaster], Plate Gaunts [Devaberiel], and Runed Symbol [Maxist]. 
              We were resoundingly successful killing Dozekar a second time as 
              well.<br>

            <p>Id like to take this opprotunity to say thank you to everyone in 
              our guild for sacreficing so much time and effort in helping the 
              clerics get their Rage Shards in skyfire. Its not the best zone 
              for loots or to exp grind in, so I fully understand your effort 
              in helping so many of clerics get into a position to finish their 
              epics. Congrats to Duffil, Andorean, Celtin,and Pitterpatter for 
              loading up on those shards. Rezz sticks are inc.</p>
            <p>Massed up and dropped Ixleblat Fer for another step in the cleric 
              epic. Grats to Pitterpatter, Andorean, &amp; Mindaarie for getting 
              their Ixy wand. Blitzer walked away with a play toy or 2 and I believe 
              Jackum found himself a new pair of shoulder.</p>
            <p>Speaking of Jackum with some help from Fadari, Fellkin, and Jonzer, 
              he was able to take down Renux for another step in his epic.</p>
            <p>We hooked up with our buds from legion of Nox and mauled our way 
              into Fear on Wednesday. After some slow cautious pulls we did take 
              out 2 of the Mini Bosses before it got to late. Grats to Billpal 
              for some new pally legs, Garyn pocketed a new sword, Kalley a new 
              belt,and Jackum picked up some Bazaar fodder. Houfter did managed 
              to beat up some little kiddy iksar for a piece of his epic. Grats 
              to all.</p>
            <p>Teamed up with Yoricks Merry Men and Bregan D'Aerth and pounded 
              our way into Chardok and roughed up the Royals a bit. Grats to Pitterpatter 
              on some nice gloves as well as her epic piece. Celtin and Duffil 
              also got their Epic notes from the King as well. It was a great 
              3 guild effort as many peeps stayed on for long time to ensure a 
              successful King looting for all the clerics there.</p>

            <p> Seru, Seru, Everywhere... - Stormhaven (9/23/2002 3:50 AM) <br>
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Well, apparently there were some &quot;issues&quot; with Sanctus 
              Seru so to our surprise we found Seru had spawned for us again. 
              Well, we couldn't pass up another chance to gank'em, so...</p>
            <p>Anyhow, LOOT:</p>
            <p><br>
              Oh, and I know some of you are keeping track, so for those of you 
              who are curious about our &quot;leet manaburn abilities&quot; we 
              had about eight wizards at this most recent attempt. Assuming they 
              all crit'd for a full 12-15k worth of damage (they didn't), that'd 
              be approximately 4% of his total hitpoints. So needless to say, 
              you figured out our ultimate sekret Seru strategy. We estimate that 
              if we just used manaburn on Seru, he'd be dead in about 23hrs. Give 
              or take a few hours.</p>

              Possibly one of the best performances I've seen out of my fellow 
              guildmates in a long, long time. With a meager force of around 48 
              or so we ventured into Sanctus Seru to take on the Lord Inquisitor 
              himself. He had been a thorn in our side for long enough, and tonight 
              he fell for the first time on the Cazic Thule server.</p>
            <p>Have no doubt, Seru's a big boy who's given a lot of guilds problems 
              in the past (including us!) A fight with only 48 people is definitely 
              not for the faint of heart, for the battle itself lasted a little 
              over an hour in real time.</p>

              Sorry about the lack of updates lately, I've been out of town and 
              staying pretty busy. So no more lip out of you people! You know 
              who you are. *Cough*Kwill*cough* </p>
            <p>We went to Halls of Testing with Legacy of Darkness last week, 
              I wasn't there personally, so don't have any screenshots and posting 
              information second hand. Halls of Testing went pretty well, with 
              even a little loot. Dozekar was attempted, and fun was had by all. 
              Grats to LOD on Plate Boots/Bracer, Azeros on Silk Bracer, and Brigug 
              on Chain legs. Hopefully we can head back before too long when I'll 
              be around to solo Dozekar for them. As always thanks to Legacy of 
              Darkness for being a class act and great to team up with. </p>
            <p>Bworld was very upset that I didn't give him a title in the Hate 
              screenshot, so I took this one just for him. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>We've been rampaging through Kael quite a bit lately, getting closer 
              to our goal of finishing up our armor. Did Dlammaz with 5 people(no 
              warrior) last week. MQ has been back to the loot whorish ways, but 
              also gotten Leather legs, breastplate, plate legs, Mask of War, 
              Silk Robe, and several other things. Grats to everyone with new 
              loot, and to the others better get better at the cybering. </p>
            <p>This is how you get loot in Juggernauts. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>We also went to West Wastes last night and had a good time smacking 
              around some dragons. Had a few problems early with wanderers. And 
              me being the only person on Giant faction there was especially fun. 
              First pull we got an add, so I wound up getting to do this: </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Which of course when you can't run to TOV for safety ends in this: 
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>After the initial problems things went well and we wound up bagging 
              six dragons before calling it a night. Not bad for a few hours. 
              We'll be back there tomorrow night to ruin our dragon faction some 
              more. I'm also quite proud of the 4 man kill of Ayllish. Which would 
              have gone faster had Bworld not been AFK, although that wouldn't 
              have made it a 4 man kill. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Anyway, it's 4 in the morning and I promised I'd do an update, 
              so there it is. More updates to come as we do stuff. </p>

            <p>We didn't do alot this weekend, but we did get some stuff banged 
              out of the way. Avatar of War went done in &quot;Push over&quot; 
              fashion, seems to me once you kill things in Ssra, everything else 
              seems just a wee bit easier. And a Ring of Descrution actually dropped 
              if you can believe that. Anyway, much love for AoW for providing 
              his cut and dry fights, I think he needs to come with some adds 
              that you have to tank mez and enchanter mez at the same time! *ducks 
              from the flying weak chanter nukes that are bound to fly my way* 
              ;)</p>
            <p>Lets see, what else .. Went to Plane of Air on Friday, cleared 
              Island 7, no crowns, went back on Monday, cleared Island, 4 crowns 
              .. Lets hope we never ever ever ever have to go back again!</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Other then that it was the usuall camp fest of shards, exp and 
              even maybe 1 or 2 key pieces in ssra that everyone and their dog 
              hates to do. 3 shards left, and I'm still paying 20k for a ME shard, 
              so send me tells! I'm serious :( Also, cause I just didn't want 
              to give you a stupid PoA picture, I went to the old stand by to 
              bring in a giggle.</p>

 Tuesday, September 24th, 2002 - Hit Me, Hit Me, Hit Me With Those Laser Beams... <br>

Today it was time for pansy snake to die again. We sized him up, stepped in, and laid into him. VI decided the lag spike flurry Kung Fu was wasted, so they got rid of it. Bad move on their part. We had around 70 folks again this time, and without any kind or special help from the lag, the Emporer proved once and for all what a joke he can be. We had the same tank holding him, start to finish and not a single moment did the fight ever get out of hand.<p>

Damn, that felt good...mostly.<p>

It was honestly frustrating as hell to get to this guy. It sapped months of time that I could have been watching Nick At Nite or exploring my navel or any of a thousand other things more pleasant than key/ shard camps. Any fight that is this tough to even get to should feel like an all nighter at a nudie bar with yer bosses Amex card every time you fight. And it did, for the first couple fights....now it's too easy. There just isn't a payoff big enough to balance the effort to get here. Ah, well....<p>

Guess there just isn't any problem that can't be solved by the correct use of the assling cannon.<p>
