                Lots of mobs have died lately, so the swarm has been somewhat 
                satiated, growing fat off the land. The Hydralisk Emporer died 
                again so we have over 100 rifts now. We'll be ready to start farming 
                shards after we AE the Emp like 3 more times or something (not 
                sure, though, nobody has responded to my thread on the Safehouse 
                yet).<br>

                Posted By: Zehn on 02-21-03<br>
                The upside of raiding with 150 zerglings is that you don't need 
                any skill, patience or execution. The downside is when you don't 
                have the required quorum of 90 people you really can't kill anything.<br>
                <br>
                Last night Agnarr was up but we only had 60 members of the hive 
                spawned. Anyone who is anyone knows you need at least 132 people 
                to kill Agnarr, so we left him alone. As a result, Arbok did not 
                get a fancy new earring and Satul did not get a new bow. </p>
              <p>To add insult to injury, after we didn't kill Agnarr we heard 
                the Hydralisk Emporer was up. Overlord Gandien wanted to try it 
                with our paltry force. I was like, no way dude, you can't AE Emp 
                and his guards into a nice, neat pile with anything less than 
                175 people. I said, let's post it on the boards and see if 115 
                peeps log on in the next 5 minutes. He was like, ok. </p>
              <p>In addition, there was another guild that wanted to kill emp. 
                This guild is a real power on the server and never does any lame 
                stuff. They never stall-tank Statue to get more on for AoW. They 
                never steal shard dropping mobs from our camps. They never dot 
                the mezzable (I dunno what a mezzable mob is, mind you, but they 
                do) adds in Emp's room when they are failing (which they'd never 
                do) so that the other guild there will have a harder time. They 
                never get official guild warnings from GMs that put their tags 
                in jeopardy. They never get spare rifts from friendly european 
                allies and they never ninja rifts from another guild's emp kill.<br>
                <br>
                They don't do any of that stuff because they are way more respected 
                than we are and they are truly uber and noble; they do the Protoss 
                proud. So we backed off and let them have their shot. </p>
              <p>Ok I lied, we wanted to do it but we were still waiting for 115 
                people to log on. They owned emp hard, with nary a death, using 
                big words like &quot;strategy&quot; and &quot;add-control&quot;. 
                Given that we have no hope of copying their sophisticated manner 
                of killing, we've elected to lower the level requirement for applicants 
                to 42 in the hopes of increasing our chances. Please see our application 
                forum if interested. </p>
              <p>So if anyone tells you that Fazin got a new pony, or that Dalph 
                got a new ring of anal, or even that Kasaris got a new walking 
                stick, don't believethe hype.<br>

                <strong>The SWARM was Victorious! </strong><br>
                Posted By: Zehn on 02-20-03 <br>
                Supreme Overlord Gandien called to power the mighty zerg forces 
                once again, converging on not one, not two, but three of the mighty 
                sources of power in the Plane of Power. Our unstoppable romp rolled 
                over Mithaniel Marr and Saryrn by force of our sheer numbers alone. 
                Alas our hive mind had felt it had met its match against the great 
                Terran Bertoxxulous. After five days of non-stop sieging their 
                mighty forces, sacraficing zergling after mutalisk to the cause, 
                our sources of vespene gas nearly depleated and cries of &quot;SPAWN 
                MORE OVERLORDS&quot; arising from the ranks, we pooled our collective 
                resources together for one last try. The event began later then 
                usual, and our forces began to collect and set up our base defenses 
                near the pillar leading back into the safer regions of PoTranq.<br>
                [<a href="http://www.casus-belli.net/images/zerg5.jpg" target="_blank">picture</a>]<br>
                Then one of our brave ultralisks burst forth and pulled the spectre 
                of corruption, and our brutal forces set to work. For hours upon 
                hours we lay threw ourselves against the forces that rose to oppose 
                us. Until at last we wore them down to one final battlecruiser!<br>
                [<a href="http://www.casus-belli.net/images/zerg2.jpg" target="_blank">picture</a>]<br>
                However, fate bears a cruel hand! The mighty Bertox was set forth 
                on us unpreprared! Our forces were decimated.<br>
                [<a href="http://www.casus-belli.net/images/zerg6.jpg" target="_blank">picture</a>]<br>
                Alas! Luck was with us as time was working for us! One of our 
                elite lurkers was able to escape the carnage and hide, providing 
                us with inside information about the rampages of Bertox while 
                we proceded with a massive respawning attempt!<br>
                [<a href="http://www.casus-belli.net/images/zerg3.jpg" target="_blank">picture</a>]<br>
                Once again our massive forces charged without regard for life 
                or limb, seething numbers eager for the blood of an enemy! We 
                knew no fear! Losses were heavy, but we cared not! More and more 
                we heaved against him! 30, 60, 90! It did not matter! HARVEST 
                MORE VESPENE GAS! SPAWN MORE OVERLORDS! SERVE THE SWARM!!!!<br>

                Our forces began to waver! Our defenses began to collapse! Time 
                was running short! We had mere minutes remaining before our enemy 
                would cowardly flee back to his base beyond our reach! But the 
                rally cry went forth from our fearless leader! ALL HAIL GANDIEN!<br>
                [<a href="http://www.casus-belli.net/images/zerg7.jpg" target="_blank">picture</a>]<br>
                At last! Oh at glorious last! Even now as I return to the bliss 
                that is the overmind's singular conscience, I praise Gandien and 
                his superior intellect as we sacraficed ourselves en masse to 
                slay this vile fiend. Soon...soon our numbers shall swell again, 
                and the Burning Prince shall know our wrath...<br>

                Halochanter writes &quot;WARNING: Guild firsts may be dangerous 
                to your health. The word of the week? Ownage. Well ladies and 
                gentlemen, I dedicate this news update to all of those Lotj haters 
                that have sprouted up around the server lately. What's a matter, 
                can't you stand a bit of competition? Well if you can't, you're 
                not gonna like this update. This week we killed some great guild 
                firsts, Dagarn the Destroyer, Zlexak, and, oh yes: Arch Lich Rhag'Zadune!!!!!!<br>

                Bypassing half the content people usually go through before they 
                do AL, we saw a shot at him and took it. Hello, I like to rampage. 
                Yeah no kidding. Dangerous, nerve wrecking, and goddamn fun. Nice 
                one all, and thanks to RiP for doing the right thing.<br>
                The Phatz0r L3wtz0r:<br>
                Shield of Auras--- Csirke<br>
                Polished Bone Collar--- Mediquick<br>
                Sword of Lost Crusades--- Taino<br>
                Obviously triggering AL, we also took out Rhag2 again this week. 
                Is it just me, or do we have way too many decent rogue piercers 
                in this guild now?! Spoilt sonofa's..<br>

                So that was our Ssra exploration for this week. Deeper in we go. 
                I'm pretty sure you'll see more random dead snakes that all look 
                the same, in the next few weeks.<br>
                Well apart from Ssra we also, as we quite frequently do, slapped 
                the inhabitants of NToV around. Netted ourselves 2 guild firsts, 
                and we are now left with only ONE mob left in NToV to kill before 
                we've killed everything :P Not too shabby, me thinks. We're coming 
                for ya Vyemm, oh yes, we are! *pinky in the mouth* So like, first 
                down was Dagarn the Destroyer!<br>

                Yummy stuff. Dagarn had evaded us for all too long, but we finally 
                tracked him down and well, he's just an overgrown HoT wurm, that 
                hits harder. More of a challenge, infact a LOT more of a challenge, 
                was Zlexak. The hardest and last tripplet we needed to kill. Several 
                times we've cleared his brothers and decided to wait a little 
                longer before trying him, but his time was up. 55% AE slow/1250 
                DD, yeah, he was no piece of cake. The end result? His corpse 
                :P<br>

                They have GOT to change that 1 drop crap from the tripplets, seriously. 
                Anyway, Zlex's younger brother also died, Sevalak. AoW called, 
                he wants his DPS back.<br>

                The week couldn't be drawn to a close without the slaying of Ikatiar 
                the Venom. You know, I've been thinking, I think I finally know 
                why this mob is so easy. Well, he drops monk loot, so, he's a 
                monk. Thus, he is easy. Clever eh?<br>

                Guild news : The Deep Excursion. </strong><br>
                Posted by Ytrok on 2003/2/24<br>
                This Sunday we went out into The Deep for an excursion to discover 
                what is out there.<br>
                It was a great, exciting and dangerous trip into the unknown.<br>
                Walking over invisible bridges, encountering mobs that nuke for 
                1600+ and pulls that took all our concentration to get rid off.<br>
                We found out that moving around in this zone takes necro&#8217;s 
                and coffins to do the CotH procedures since Mages can&#8217;t 
                CotH down there&#8230;<br>
                We went in Deep until we were almost at Ssra&#8217;s door.<br>
                And then .. well we had to bail out due to people needing to go 
                after 4 hours of intensive travel, Scions cutting his finger on 
                an orange can! (That guy will only be given plastic from now on 
                during raids) &#8230; But we can say that this trip was worth 
                our time, was fun to do and will be continued as soon as possible.<br>
                I didn&#8217;t make screenshot since I was too busy duying (enc 
                pulling 4+ mobs is not very smart I know).<br>
                Great fun .. and prepare for our next move into the unknown&#8230;</p>
              <p><strong>Guild news : Exploration of Griegs... </strong><br>
                Posted by Ytrok on 2003/2/23<br>
                Well.... today we took around 12 - 14 people on an exploration 
                trip through Griegs to see what was up and how hard that would 
                hit :)<br>
                We found out Praetorian Myral was up holding the Divine Hammer 
                of Consternation A funny thingie to get and Gratz go out to Wolk!<br>
                The fight itself was just time consuming but in general very easy 
                ... (Little tip ... You don't hit it :)<br>
                [<a href="http://www.matahari.nuke-host.com/screenshots/22022003/griegs1.gif" target="_blank">picture</a>]<br>
                After this we went on searching for another target and well after 
                a long zig zag through the tunnels of Griegs End we found Prast 
                Ianitor hiding... Well at first we were a little carefull in approaching 
                him cause we had no really good info on this guy, but soon found 
                out he too is not much risk.<br>
                [<a href="http://www.matahari.nuke-host.com/screenshots/22022003/griegs2.gif" target="_blank">picture</a>]<br>
                He dropped the needed key to move in further in Griegs (and so 
                people all stood in line to beat the #### out of me at the end 
                of the event to keep key on corpse for a while) and he dropped 
                Black Bladed Ulak a nice little toy :)<br>
                All in all it was a nice excursion.</p>

              <p><strong>Phoenix has left the Halls..</strong><br>
                Febuary 24, 2003 - Karii <br>
                Under four months ago Phoenix started to farm HoT for armor drops, 
                as of today we are done. We are short all but a small handfull 
                of peices and its time to move on. The Halls have been good for 
                us, getting almost everyone into full armor in under 4 months. 
                Its been a long, exciting and boring trip to get here, and only 
                more and more great things to come. </p>
              <p>Also over the past couple weeks we've managed to finally down 
                our biggest white whale.. the Restless Burrower!!! Was a kill 
                long time in the coming and although it didnt drop exactly what 
                we were looking for it still felt great to finally down the bitch!

                Legacy of Ykesha is live, and the frogs are jumping all around!!! 
                Beyond that, LoY gave us some fun little tools, neat armor dyes, 
                and some very very LARGE dungeons / zones.<br>
                Aside from that, last night we took a small group of Yaara and 
                explored the new zones. Got through Gunthak, and began looking 
                into Nadox. Nadox is a very very HUGE Zone. Our Party consisted 
                of 12 adventurers who began in Gunthak, and then worked our way 
                towards the castle of Nadox . . we had a few drops, even a charm. 
                Some of the drops look to be used in some quest of some sort, 
                posibly even some spell quests.<br>
                The Raiding Party consisted of:<br>

                Out of those that attended, we walked out with various gems, odd 
                ball fs like weapons, lots of no-drop items which are possibly 
                quest items. Out of pure interest, we did pull out 1 charm from 
                Gunthak called Mammoth Tusk Powder that went to Blaze, although 
                accidently *grins evily*. Seems this charm increases its stats 
                the higher wisdom and agility get. Blaze reports no stats so far 
                heh . .stupid charms lol.<br>
