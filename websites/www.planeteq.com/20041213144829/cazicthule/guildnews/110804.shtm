            Hail all <br>
            Tonight we did 50s xp in Griegs End. There were six of us with a
            seventh toon joining late.<br>
            We started with myself as What, Doy, Mal, Canor, Merry and Ketahs.
            Can had to leave and we started checking the LFGs for a cleric. Fortunately
            Eihd logged on about that time and after a short wait for him to
            arrive we continued killing everything in sight.<br>
            We had a blast with Ketahs Ding 55 and What ping 1 it was a great
            xp night. We also had a lot of fun for the last hour or so talking
            about &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;. A really fun movie. If you
            havn't seen it I recomend it highly for a clean family movie.<br>
            Next week we do the 20s xp night so lets have a good turn out of
            that lvl toons.<br>
            Untill then May the Circle be unbroken

              Hail all<br>
              It's Thursday again [you know that seems to be happening a lot
              lately about once a week :)]. This week was 50s Ldons, the goal
              two crawls in three hours.<br>
              There were only 5 of us tonight, What (myself), Doyen, Kethas,
              Glorvendale and Zabrae.<br>
              We did one crawl in EF which took about 45 minutes, and then another
              in Nro that took just under an hour. So the goal was achieved.
              There were three augments dropped tonight which went to Doyen,
              Kethas and Zabrae. Grats to all three. </p>
            <p>Next week we do 50s xp grind possibly to GE or maybe someplace
              else Doy and I have yet to decide. GE has better xp but we may
              be able to get better drops and more platt elsware. Your comments
              and suggestions would be welcome.</p>
            <p>Looking forward to next time<br>
  May the Circle be unbroken<br>
  What </p>

  Big Grats to Mack on fully completing his KodTaz flag last night! After a LONG,
  hard fight, we finally wrapped up sewer #4 and that was the last one he needed
  to complete his flag!                        <p>WTG man, let's keep this ball rolling and get a raid in there

              Crimson Talon headed into Bristlebane's domain, the Plane of Mischief,
              Monday night. After many unique turns, hidden walls, and clicked
              ports, we made it to the hedge maze where we found and killed an
              All-Seeing Eye.
            <p>Congratulations to Greymask on his Oculus of Persuasion!</p>

  Over the recent weeks Crimson Talon has raided in the Elemental planes and
  this last week we had our first Elemental armour drops. No less than four indeed,
  over two raids ! Congratulations to those winners and also to the guild who
  perservered with the flagging and backflagging to make these drops possible.
  There are many many more to come. </p>

              DW goes 60+<br>
              Added by Sabyre on 11/1/2004 9:29 AM<br>
              --------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
              DragonWrath is now only recruiting players 60+. As our goals get
              more specific and intensify we feel that maintaining a member base
              of only a 10 level spread is the best way to acomplish our goals.
              Before OoW came out we were a 55+ guild but with the expansion's
              release came 5 more levels and we feel 15 levels is a bit much.
              There is one exception to this though. We NEED clerics. We will
              still openly recruit clerics level 55+. </p>
            <p>Why join DragonWrath? </p>
            <p>DragonWrath is a fine group of players with an easy going feel.
              Our members are kind, goal oriented, willing to help, inteligent,
              and fun to be around. We expect the same from our new members.
              We are not a raiding guild. We have no intensions of becomming
              a raiding guild. We officially raid roughly 3 times a week. With
              unofficial events dotted throughout the week. You will never be
              made to attend a raid official or otherwise, but failing to attend
              an official raid without a relevant excuse will potentially hinder
              attendance at an event that you want specifically. </p>
            <p>Once invited and tagged as a Dragon, your first 30 days will be
              an open door. Realisticly not all things are for everyone. Your
              first 30 days will not only be for you to try us out but for us
              to try you out. You may leave and we may leave you with nothing
              owed and no hard feelings. No raids will be scheduled for you until
              at least 30 days of good member standing. After 30 days of good
              standing you will be considered a &#8220;vested&#8221; member. </p>
            <p>I invite you to check us out and see what we are all about. Take

              Charasis Exploration<br>

              --------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
              After a couple of weeks of getting keys we did our first Charasis
              raid this past Friday. Everything went extremeley well and we stayed
              for a good number of hours. Drops weren't that bad, we had a haste
              belt drop and some others. Lots of spells dropped. Most of the
              time spent there was figuring out the key system and aquiring those
              keys. We didnt make it to the final zone boss as it was pushing
              2 am and people were getting tired. Evidently there is a 100% weight
              reduction container that resembles a glove. You fill the glove
              with body parts and can aquire a master key. That would have been
            nice but maybe next time. </p>

              <p>Our first raids as allied with Veredi Arcanum went very well. <br>
                We managed to down a few backlagging mobs before moving on to
                  Wall of Slaughter where we killed Velitorkin and finally Slumbering
                  Beast in Bloodfields. A very successful first raid-day with
            our new alliance and hopefully even more to come.<br>

              I am pleased to say that we did a great job on the PoN Hedge Walk.
              18 Knights now are ready to take on Terris Thule. The next day
              some of the knight's attended a pick up Terris Thule raid in which
              she met an undesireable end. I have attached some screen shots
            for you to enjoy.</p>

            - by Pirotess On Oct 27, 2004 - 3:03 AM <br>
            You know I really need to hand it to SoE they made a zone that DEMANDS
            near perfection. There is no slacking or semi-afk in Uqua you gotta
            be there 100% or you might as well go home. We first started learning
            Uqua a week or so before OoW released. Unfortunately we only got
            the two subbosses down before the expansion hit and our goal for
            L70 was put in place as everyones primary concern. We went back to
            Uqua from time to time as we leveled and learned a little more here
            and there but damn if it wasnt hard getting the proper turnout to
            raid the zone since its so healer/warrior intensive. Well thats all
            behind us (at least until next week when the lockout is off) since
            we finally dropped Barxt and stepped into Qvic for the first time.
            Its damn satisfying doing it all in house and I couldnt be happier
            to have that monkey off our backs. The team really pulled it together
            after some really frustrating attempts but thats part of what makes
            SS successful, our perseverance. </p>

                    <br>
                      These past few weeks, since the end of the Summer Blues,
                        Second Age and their friends from OGS, have been steadily
                        and forcefully marching forwards through the Elemental
                        Planes. Fennin Ro fell easily, Coirnav fell in a fight
                        we partnered with SS. We have done full clearings of
                        the Plane of Fire, the Plane of Water, the Plane of Earth,
                    and are keyed for the Xegony fight in the Plane of Air.</p>
                    <p>A big thanks to all the members for sticking it out through
                      the tough Summer months and being here to continue on our
                      path through success.</p>
                    <p>Our latest accomplishment came last Saturday, when we
                      cleared the Plane of Earth and triggered and slew, The
                      Mystical Arbitor. This has flagged us for PoEb, and allows
                      us to start preparing fo The Rathe Council.</p>

    <p> Enter Vex Thal <br>
  Posted by admin on Monday, September 06<br>
  As much of Norrath was settling in to a slow afternoon, a band of adventurers
  descended upon the castle of Vex Thal with the intent on learning as much as
  they could about this sleepy backwater area. <br>
  For many this was a new kind of adventure, one wrought with peril. Before the
  day was out many a soul would be lost, but all would learn the true meaning
  of teamwork. As the band of friends moved through the courtyard they were confronted
  with a grand statue, seizing the moment they stopped and posed for a family
  portrait. </p>
