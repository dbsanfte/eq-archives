            <p>Hail all,<br>
  Once again we have met to do battle.<br>
  Tonight was 20s nite, and we had a nice turn out,<br>
  even though I was a bit late. Those who attended were: Shortugly, Gonalas,
  Snakebait, Gohome, Miahlosh logged shortly after I arrived Also Glorvendale
  was there to help keep us out of trouble.<br>
  We went to Hollowshade Moor to fight the owlbears.<br>
  There is not a lot of loot to be had but the xp was great. Gohome dinged 29
  and Ganalas also dinged, 25 I belive. I don't remember if any one else dinged
  but it was a great night.<br>
  Next week we do the 50s Ldons so please sign up and be on time.<br>
  Untill we fight again.<br>
  May the Circle be unbroken</p>
            <p><br>

                Hail all.<br>
                Well another Thursday night has come and gone, and once again
                we set out to bring honor to the name of COI. Our goal tonight
                was to finish two Ldons in three hours. We did not do that however
                instead we completed three Ldons in three hours.<br>
                We had a great group and started in EF and went then to N Ro
                where we completed two crawls. <br>
                We had Malvron as puller and main tank, Ssaurus to back him up,
                Nianque to slow the mobs and buff the toons, Daemion for crowd
                control, Heellin to keep us alive, and ofcourse Lios who once
                again had the most difficult job of the night, I had to DS and
                Cloroplast the whole group. No no that is not the hard part.
                The hard part was staying on line as I went LD three times. <br>
                It was a great night. We finished the EF crawl in 45 minutes.
                The first N Ro crawl in 47 and the second N Ro crawl in 58 minutes.
                Add to that total the time it took to run to the entrance and
                the time it takes to get an adventure and you can see we had
                little time to waste. <br>
                There was one snag though, In the last crawl just minutes before
                we were finished with only one more item to collect Daemeon fell:(
                we all bowed our heads in sorrow when the mobs were destroyed
                and we had a few seconds of free time. After Heellin rezzed him
                he looted the last item and we were done for the night.<br>
                Unfortunately no augments dropped in any of the three crawls
                but Ssaur and Nian both pinged and I dinged lvl 55. I am now
                a pet wielding druid. So be careful or my lvl 30ish bear will
                rip you apart (he he he). <br>
                All in all a fabulous night for fun and xp.<br>
                I hope you can join us next week and remember that tomorrow and
                saturday night there is a Seb raid to aquire keys for those of
                you who don't have them.<br>
                These are joint raids with our allied guild Dragon Wrath so if
                you are available to help or if you need a seb key check out
                the events calander and sign up.<br>
                Untill we fight again.<br>
                May the Circle be unbroken</p>

              TNH followup<br>
              Added by whatsisface on 10/8/2004 5:35 AM<br>
              --------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
              Hail Circle<br>
              This may be a repeat as I have asked Doyen to post the TNH followup
              tonight. My comp was not fuctional for awhile but is now up and
              running again.<br>
              Tonight we went to Griggs End again for 50s xp grind. There were
              only five of us tonight. <br>
              Myself as Whatsisface, Doyen, Mezzerina, Heelin and Torknon. <br>
              Malvron logged on around 6:45 or so but we had already filled the
              group with a ranger who was lfg in the zone. We had a bit of trouble
              at first as mezz died twice before torknon and the ranger got there
              and we were unable to get past the first entry room.<br>
              However after we filled up the group we had better luck. We fought
              in the second room while I pulled from the rooms to either side
              which gave us three rooms and a hall to pull from.<br>
              We did well for about an hour and What gained a little over one
              full yellow bubble of xp so I assume the others gained a similar
              amount. However just after 8 I had pulled a mob from the first
              room when the first two in the second room popped. So we had three
              mobs on us and they resisted mezz and root so Mezzerina died for
              the third or fourth time and Tork and I also died. Luckily Doy
              and especially Heelin survived and we were able to get rezzes. <br>
              By now it was 8:30 and I called a ten minute warning for the nights
              closing. We decided to hit the entrance room again and Mezzerina
              tried to mezz the first mob only to have it resist and he and another
              hit us again and again Mezzerina died along with Tork and Myself.
              So by the time we got rezzes again and rez eff wore off it was
              time to head out.<br>
              My guess is that Heelin got the most xp tonight and Mezz the least
              especially since the first two death she suffered she chose to
              not get a rezz but chose C3 instead.<br>
              All in all it was a lot of fun. At least I thought so.<br>
              Heelin was feeling a bit ineffective but he did a great job. I
              know that if I was playing Lios as healer He would be totaly out
              classed. Even though he is 54 his heal is only for 583 points which
              is laughable when the mobs hit for over 100 points at a pop.<br>
              Next week we have 50s Ldons so sign up and be on time. We want
              to do two crawls and need to get our first one and be ready to
              go at 6:00 in order for me to have time to do both.<br>
              See you there.<br>
              May the Circle be unbroken<br>
              What</p>

With all of the luck demons that have been working against us in Sewer #2 expedition
in Barindu, I thought I'd notify ya'll that we FINALLY got through it! Last night,
a bit after midnight, we finally rolled up to the turn in gal and handed her
the skulls she's been looking for (I think she wanted them for candleholders,
but not sure on that).                        <p>Let's get some more done next week!!<br>

              Thursday was another epic night for Crimson Talon. We ensued two
              battle grounds, first taking out a greasy clockwork in the Plane
              of Innovation for Greymask and then following it up with Tarlang
              for Fenik.
            <p>Congratulations Fenik on your Soulwhisperer!</p>

              Our members have been working hard to obtain quest items and finish
              the key quest to enter the revamped Veeshan's Peak. As many were
              down to just needing the final piece of the key with many quests
              ready and waiting (and taking up bank space), completing this quest
              became one of our guild priorities. After several close attempts
              over the past few weeks, we finally defeated Suled Dar's Shade
              with strategy, balanced numbers and excellent execution. The floodgates
              were opened for forty-eight of our roster and many members enjoyed
              completing one or more of the quests within the temple.</p>
            <p>Congratulations to all who received the book and/or completed
              their new key. Thanks for all who attended and here's to another
              kill in the near future.</p>
            <p>Great Epic Work Done Today <br>
              Posted by: Duudah on Saturday, October 09, 2004<br>
              <br>
  Many members of CT took time from their plans and schedules today to offer
  assistance to several folks in the quest for epics. Beginning early Saturday
  morning with Fluteria's quest - a group of 18 joined together to run nearly
  to the Temple to get an important piece for her from Grigor Rojna. He was stingy,
  but we convinced him to give Flutie her Codex of Ice and Ether.</p>
            <p> From there the group moved to Natimbi to assist Spectralus on
              his piece and learned alot for the next attempt at the Noc Behemoth.
              Which sadly timed out as we were learning the process of spawning
              him. We will easily take him down the next time.</p>
            <p> Ferubi was the next stop and a shot at pages for the clerics
              and some water for the mages. We obtained three pages for the clerics
              and killed a bunch of turtles without any success on the water
              - I guess they were just not pregnant enough.</p>
            <p> Next we headed to Umbral Plains and took on the Swarmfiend for
              Barelil's last epic 1.5 piece. We took it down and Barelil got
              his piece. Congratulations!</p>
            <p> Greymask's turn was on tap now and we headed to Siren's Grotto.
              We beat up the sirens and bulthorks and finally some nasty lady
              - Falenial of Darkwater - to give it up to us. Congratulations
              Grey.</p>
            <p> All in all it was one of those very enjoyable days where many
              members of the guild had a chance to spend time together helping
              each other out - just like the wonderful family we are.</p>

The new 3 way alliance is off and running. It seems almost every night teams
of us are gathering together to knock down mobs,quests or events. Our October
Lan/Halloween party is quickly approaching and it should be another sleepless
weekend. Now on to news from Kerra Ridge, where the Erudites shake in fear.</p>
            <p>Grats to Balazar on completing his 8th shawl. It takes a ton of
              work and trade skilling to get that completed. Thanks to all the
              alliance members who showed up to help out. After the dwarf walk
              we scooted over to POI and walked the Gnome. Grats to Hfmudd on
              his new choker. </p>
            <p>Grats to Stringbean and Houfter on finally completing the POJ
              trials. It was a flawless smooth event with mobs dropping like
              chads. </p>
            <p>Grats to Charlibroue on hitting level 70. Nice work. Now ill leave
              ya with some images to ponder.<br>

              BoT Flag<br>
              Added by Sabyre on 10/12/2004 11:21 AM<br>
              --------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
              Recently many of us have been working on BoT flags. This flag is
              aquired by complete a quest in Plane of Storms. To complete this
              quest you will need pieces from the giants. You will need a head,
              beard, sash, bone, and 2 medalions. Everything except the medalions
              are easily aquired with 1 good or 2 groups. They are common drops.
              You will need 2 medalions, 1 from each camp and these are more
              difficult to obtain. These will require 3 or more groups in a raid
              style hunt. They drop off the named giants.</p>
            <p>Plane of Storms is accessed by a portal in the last tunnel in
              Plane of Tranquility. You will need to 55+ or be flagged to enter.
              If you get a chance to get into a group to get the BoT flag I encourage
              you to do so. Planer progression is much more important than XP
              and the further you go in the planes the better the drops.</p>
            <p>BoT (Bastion of Thunder) Has some nice drops. Ornate patterns
              can be found here among others. Not to mention the excitement of
              upper tier planes. BoT is reccomended 62+ but get the flag if you
              have the chance. </p>
            <p>Hopefully we can get everyone in DW flagged and work woth our
              allies to spread the excitment.</p>

              Lastnight we spent almost 10 hours getting guildy's flagged. After
              much patience we finally got everyone through and flagged. Some
              people had to go and some could not stand the wait. I hope that
              next time they will understand what it takes for these types of
              events. </p>
            <p>We were joined by our ally Circle of Iron. It took a couple of
              trials to get the right &#8220;dream team&#8221; but we finally
              got it and things went smoothly.</p>
            <p>My thanks goes out to those that were on the &#8220;dream team&#8221; for
              staying so long to get everyone through. I also would like to thank
              those that came out for support. </p>
            <p>In my mind it was a succesful event and it may be the corner stone
              to Planer progression and a happier, stronger guild and alliance. </p>
            <p>Congratz to all that were flagged and see you next time.</p>

<br>
Well boys and girls, ladies and gentlemen, here is another fun filled edition
of IoA news! This time, this update is brought to you by the good folks at Sony,
and the letters &quot;F&quot; and &quot;U&quot;. More on that later.</p>
                    <p>Well, IoA has been pretty busy this week. We have been
                      busting ass in OoW and old content finishing up some epics
                      for people. These fights, I must say, are pretty fun. They
                      are new, interesting, and can net some decent upgrades,
                      were 1.0 was pretty much only for the person doing the
                      quest. Previous posts show who has gotten their epics,
                      expect more of those to be incoming.</p>
                    <p>Also, we got another crack at PoTime this week. I must
                      say, we were much smoother than previous attempts. I expect
                      that in the coming days, we will be farming this very quickly.</p>
                    <p>Well, day one we breezed though Phases 1 though 3, and

                      language, please turn away now. This is for your own safety.
                      You've been warned.</p>
                    <p>Alright, then came day 3 of our rotation. It would be
                      our last day in Time. Now, we had alot of people log on,
                      finally, for a freakin change. Our hopes were up. We has
                      cleared alot of shit the night before, and we were looking
                      good and ready to go say hi to everyone's favorite 4 headed
                      dragon. Well, we buffed up, and went into Phase 1. Flawless.
                      Maybe 2 or 3 people died, but stupid shit happens. We flat
                      out rocked them. Best effort to date. We port up to Phase
                      5, clear the armies, and get our shit together for Bert.
                      Now, right before the pull, Gwendle goes LD. Whatever,
                      it happens. We moved on. </p>
                    <p>So, we pull Bert. We are killing, tanks are dying (fucking
                      clerics), but we switch, we are rocking, soon Bert hits
                      0%, Annattek tanks it, we win. Go us. Not 15 seconds later,
                      3/4 of the zone crashes. Apparently, Sony decides that
                      it doesn't like it's want everyone online right now. Now,
                      being the guild we are, we are used to getting ass raped
                      by Sony. Server crashes on Emp, AHR, RZtWL, we are used
                      to it. Whatever, we move on. </p>
                    <p>So we get rezzed and whatnot, only to find out that those
                      that got booted can't get back into the raid. So they are
                      stuck outside of PoTimeB. This, of course, was AFTER we
                      awarded our loot. So, we had 2 people that deserved items
                      that couldn't get to them because Sony locked them out.
                      This blows, but shit happens. We award to secondary people,
                      and petiton. Amazingly, a GM responds. I know, we didn't
                      believe it either. However, they told us there was nothing
                      they could do. Nothing they could do? How about give the
                      loot to the people who SHOULD and WOULD have won it, had
                      your piece of shit game not crashed? This wasn't an error
                      on our part. We didn't AE TL out or some shit. The zone
                      crashed on US. WE were the ones that got the shaft, and
                      now because of THIER mistake, two people couldn't get what
                      they deserved. Way to fucking go Sony. I mean seriously,
                      you expect people to WANT to play EQ and EQII when THIS
                      shit is what you &quot;customer service&quot;? You might
                      as well give everyone a free month to Worlds of Warcraft
                      when it comes out. I think you guys need to focus less
                      on the all mighty dollar, and more on the people that give
                      them to you. Happy customers = more customers = MORE MONEY!
                      I hope I didn't lose you all. Anways, that's it for this
                      edition of my rant.</p>
                    <p>Phase 5:</p>
                    <p>BERTOXXULOUS:</p>
                    <p>Grats to Mr. AFK Hideto<br>
                    Grats to Kronas the lucky non-LDer<br>
                    Grats to New Focus Man
                    Lewsh<br>
                    Belt of Temporal Bindings (Sorry for no pic, couldn't
                    find one)</p>
                    <p>Some people got some Phase 1 shit, but now I'm too pissed
                      at Sony to list it. Anyways, that's the end of this update.
                      Remember kids, don't drop the soap, or Sony will call you
                      IoA and treat you like such. So until next time, keep those
                      assholes tight, and good luck.<br>

  <br>
  Well ladies and gentlemen, here is another lovely update. IoA finally got their
  first shot in the Plane of Time on Wednesday. All I can say is... Wow. Such
  a great concept and experience. Now, I know alot of you are saying &quot;Well,
  there are alot of guilds in Time, why are you supprised at any of this?&quot; Well,
  that's simple. Because until Wednesday, WE weren't in Time. You can tell someone
  how yummy some food is, but until the taste it, they won't fully understand.</p>
                    <p>Well, our first night in Time was... an experience. We
                      had a couple snags on the first trials, but we retuned
                      out strats, and we pwned them hard. It was alot of fun
                      learning something NEW for a change. Well, we managed to
                      clear all the way to Phase 4, and took a shot at Terris
                      Thule. 48 people, plus a handful of bots, at 2 A.M., never
                      having done this bitch before got her to 32%. Was definatly
                      a fun encounter.</p>

              Grats Vipx</p>
                    <p>Day 2 in Time found us in a MUCH better situation that
                      our first day. We had new knowledge and experience and
                      MUCH more people. Wendnesday we had around 50. Thursday
                      we have 64. Well, we breezed through Phase 1 like it wasn't
                      even there. Phase 4 was our next goal. We came, we saw,
                      we pwned. Just that simple. <br>
                      <br>
                      Vallon Zek managed to evade us, but not for long. His ass
                        is our's next time, you can bet on it. AND NOW FOR LOOT

            <p><br>
                      Day Three didn't happen. Nuff said.</p>
            <p>Well, that's it for out first PoTime rotation. 3 gods
                      dead, almost to Phase 5 on our first shot. Not too bad.
                      Could have been much worse. Well, stay tuned for more updates
                      and until then, remember, don't pull it out unless she
            asks. Or until she's asleep.<br>

              promotion to officer.<br>
              <br>
              Also a Woot goes out to Clerissa, Kathyanna, and Bufn on their
              recent epics. The Chardok raid for cleric epic peices went over
              really well. We got 2 cleric epic drops, 1 warrior epic drop and
              also got 2 BP's from the King. Although it is a small raid we made
              a huge step with epics and 2 people now have clicky invs.. Recruiting
              has been going very
              well and we are now up to 60+ members. We are also recruiting all
              races and all classes level 65+ with an exception on clerics and
              enchanters who we will accept at level 60+. The only requirements
              at this time is to be online 2 or 3 times a week and attend 1 raid
              a week. We hope to see you as part of our guild. PoJ trials have
              started and moving along we are trying to get those needing the
              flags for PoJ done and hope to get everyone in the guild flagged
              for PoJ by the end of November.<br>
              <br>
              The Sub guild is close to opening Knights of chaos will be level
              1 to 64 and will be the proving grounds for the KoTCo guild. More
              news will be posted as we get it in.<br>

                Welcome to the family! SotP and their GL Kirjana's search for

                fit and everyone is settling in. Many members of SotP have already
                had an impact on our raids and groups. I may have missed some

                      And so it begins another chapter of &quot;Mines bigger
                      than yours is&quot;.....</p>
                    <p>Your friendly neighborhood heroes have been focused on
                      getting those pesky epics out of the way, and have been
                      doing quite well. </p>
                    <p>Between adventures, jet-setting around the globe finding
                      some reason to visit long forgotten zones, we did manage
                      to squeeze in a raid or 2. </p>
                    <p>Have you see this face?</p>
                    <p><img src="relentless1.jpg" width="512" height="410"></p>
                    <p>Why its Queen Pyrilonis! This took a few attempts because
                      we were one monk short but in the end there was much rejoicing.
                      My spies tell me the King is kinda pissed, but don't worry... </p>
                    <p>He'll get his...</p>
                    <p>Why do we bother breaking up the family like this? Well
                      the only answer can be Monk Loot! Of course, since I was
                      too busy not getting level 69 in pick-up-group-hell it
                      was dispersed among some other people. Enjoy the spoils!</p>

                    <p>With all the glorious loots we bring in you'd think we
                      would have a guild full of happy shiny people. Judge for
                      yourself in a little segment we call...</p>
