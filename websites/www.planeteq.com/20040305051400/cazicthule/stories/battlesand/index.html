<b class="heading">Battle in the Sand</b><br>
<i>by</i> Grymspeak Goblinsbane

<br><br>
Hot, sticky heat. It was high summer and for some insane reason I found myself deep in the Oasis. I had discharged my duties to my last employer, a young enchantress seeking knowledge of the spectral denizens of the Blue Flame tower on Oasis Isle. My purse was once again full of beautiful silver and I could almost taste the sweet mead in the Jade Jaguar. Chuckling, I pushed myself up from my resting place beneath a huge palm and shielding my eyes took one last look at the haunted island. Shimmering waves of heat rose from the waters and gave the tower an ephemeral appearance. I shuddered with the memory of the last pull. Three of the undead bastards had almost been too much. Were it not for the healing touch of a passing healer I wouldn't have been considering the cool taste of wonderous beer.
<br><br>
Shifting the weight of my packs and gripping the soiled hilt of my sword, I set off to the north and the promise of a good meal and soft bedding. Presently I made my way to the sea and followed along the beach. The sound of the crashing waves was somehow soothing and I found my mind wandering among old friends and battles shared. Suddenly I drew up short and strained to pick up the sound I thought I had heard. There! Barely audible above the sound of the sea it came again, a cry for help. I wiped the sweat out of my eyes and squinted against the bright sun for some movement, some sign of the owner of that plaintive wail. Suddenly a young barbarian maid burst over a sand dune to my left, gasping with the effort of her flight. She was badly wounded and her strength seemed almost at it's end. My first instinct was to run towards her but my old soldier's training took control and I dropped into a crouch waiting, scanning the desert behind her.
<br><br>
Presently the cause of her distress came bounding over the dune and shouted in triumph at the sight of her. I felt a shiver of fear run down my back as I suddenly found myself faced with a Sand Giant. A warrior's instinct took over and my mind began racing, looking for any weakness I could possibly exploit. Dropping my packs, I hefted my blade once more and moved to meet the behemoth.
<br><br>
The giant saw me and pulled up short, scowling at me ready to attack. All at once he bellowed " Humans like you are better off dead than alive!"
<br><br>
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://ads.gamespyid.com/ad.aspx?S=PE&A1=NONE&G1=RPG&T=3&P2=0&A2=0&A3=IAB_MEDIUM_RECTANGLE?unique"></script>
 
His huge fist came crashing down so swiftly I had no time to dodge, my head swam with dizziness from the blow. Bellowing in rage I slashed at his ankle and felt the jar of impact run up my arm. The giant growled in anger and lashed down at me once more. This time, ready for his assault I nimbly jumped away and thrust my blade into his hand. With a cry the mighty one jerked his hand away. We circled one another looking for an opening, the giant had stopped his idle chatter and breathed heavily, as did I. Words only get you killed when it's killin time.
<br><br>
I don't know how long we battled there on the beach, nor do I know how many times I felt as if I would be pounded into the sand when he struck. My arm burned with fatigue and my breath came in short gasping sobs. Blood streamed from my mouth and I was certain I was going to die. The irony of it all was that I wasn't even getting paid for my services. Who the hell did I think I was? Some kind of avenging knight come out of legend to save the maid in distress? I'm just a mercenary, always looking for the next job so I can make enough coin to drink myself to oblivion in some flesh den in the the nearest city or town. Yet, here I was, battling for my life for some barbarian wench I'd never laid eyes on with a purse full of coin that I'd never get to enjoy.
<br><br>
Anger began to well up from deep within my breast. A beserker strength filled my limbs fueled by my rage. Shouting my battle cry "Goblinsbane!" I charged in once more, a final desparate attempt to slay my oversized adversary before I fell to his bludgeoning. I think I must have surprised the brute, for my sudden lunge had carried me between his legs. Thrusting up with all my remaining strength I plunged my mithral blade into his groin and twisted savagely. The giant shuddered as his blood washed down my arm and drenched my face.
<br><br>
With a final groan he toppled to the sand. The tremor from the impact threw me violently from my feet to the sand where I lay gasping for air and futily wiping at the blood in my eyes. Slowly my head cleared and I could once again hear the whisper of the tide. The sun was beginning to set, our battle had taken most of the day. Something touched my arm and I jerked to my feet in a crouch, blade half raised once more. My body screamed in protest as I forced it to do my bidding. A snarl died on my lips as I realized it was only the barbarian girl I had saved.
<br><br>
She looked at me worriedly. I could tell I must have been a horrid sight. My finely crafted armor was dented and rent in a hundred places, I was covered in the blood of my enemy and my own. I relaxed my posture and chuckled at the girl to which she responded with a shy smile.
<br><br>
"My thanks warrior," she said in a heavy northern accent."The giant one would surely have taken my life."
<br><br>  
I chuckled again and started moving towards my packs. "No worries me lass," I drawled,"T'was me pleasure ta be assistin ya on this lovely day! Besides, it were a good fight don't ya think?"
<br><br>
She smiled and nodded her head. As I bent and retrieved my belongings with a mind to find shelter as soon as possible, I suddenly felt the wash of healing magic run over my battered form. Surprised I looked up. It was then that I noticed she held a staff in her hand and wore several herb pouches at her belt. I had rescued a shaman of the norhtfolk and in return she owed me a life debt. I groaned with the recollection. The barbarians of Halas were notorious for their odd notions of honor. Now this girl would follow me around until she had repaid me the life she felt she owed me.
<br><br>
Grumbling, I hefted my sword over my shoulder and started down the beach. I didn't have to look back, I knew she was there, following a few paces behind, hounding my steps like an obedient servant. How would I ever be able to satisfy my mansized urges in the fleshpots of Freeport with a stripling girl watching my every move?
<br><br>
As the sun set I pitched my bedroll just outside the Gypsy camp. The wench, as I now considered her, just beyond the glow of my dwindling fire. With a curse I shifted in my armor trying to unload the sand filling my cod piece. A giggle made me cast a glare at the girl, but she feigned sleep, an innocent cast to her face. I scratched my head with a rueful expression and chuckled in bewilderment as my dreams stole over me.
