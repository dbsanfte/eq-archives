            <p>First we did Rhag1 with the small team, flawless kill, grats Grimbar

              on spells too. </p>
            <p>After that PE joined for Rhag2 - nothing much to tell bout kill, 
              easy as usual - grats Caledax on Bone Golem Greaves and Ramoen from 
              PE on Gloves of Control.<br>

              The Care and Feeding of Clerics <br>
              Posted by: Druss on Tuesday, May 28th, 2002 @ 7:46 PM<br>
              So, the week in review. </p>
            <p>CC/Talons hit the Avatar of War Wednesday. An encounter that has 
              been joyously described as simply &quot;have enough button pushing 
              monkeys hitting Complete Heal, and you'll win&quot;. So, not wanting 
              to miss out on an AoW &quot;Hat Trick&quot;, we started looking 
              for this key component. Though we searched far and wide, the only 
              trace of a button pushing monkey that we could find, was this: </p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>The AoW kill was in jeopardy. People began to panic as his spawn 
              date approached. For God's sake...Monk loot was at stake. Somebody 
              had to do something! </p>
            <p>And somebody did. Our fearless leader Kenji, never to be rattled, 
              came up with a brilliant solution. All Clerics in CC were given 
              an X-Box and the following game. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>After days and days of cross training, we felt we were ready to 
              engage him again. All the hard work paid off, because he dropped 
              like a rock. It would have been a flawless kill, other than a little 
              issue with him turning around while enraged.... </p>
            <p>Anyway...Grats to Bukow on his Flayed Barbarian Skin Mask, and 
              Gristle on his War Bow of Rallos Zek, Talons on their Flayed Barbarian 
              skin leggings and Flayed Barbarian skin mask. Also that evening. 
            </p>
            <p>In other news: </p>
            <p>Did another Ring war this week, congrats Whopper on his Ring of 
              Dain Frostreaver, and once again, all 5 heros survived. </p>
            <p>Also killed by the alliance:Statue of Rallos Zek, Vindi, and Lord 
              Yeli. </p>
            <p>And finally - CC got bored on Memorial day, and killed the Dain 
              and King Tormax in house. Weeeeeee. </p>
            <p>Oh, yeah..and welcome to Areia. Cleric, heal thyself of your illness! 
              More news soon.<br>

              While it may seem quiet on the newsfront, the guild has actually 
              been very busy of late with some major raiding in many new zones.<br>

              Sorry for the lag in news but Ive been out of town for abit. We 
              did our weekly raid in kael this past monday and again it was succesful 
              in terms of drops and no real deaths. Jonzer picked up a new bracer 
              so grats to him. We hit Chardok late last week and scooped up a 
              Sarnak Battle Shield that is now in the hands of Houfter.<br>
              <br>
              Special grats to Badexposure, Xxeene, Kalander, and Uldarian who 
              have put up some nice level advances in the last week. Ladorna is 
              doing well in her quest for grand master taylor and Kalander has 
              made great strides in Blacksmithing.<br>

              Tuesday - May 28, 2002 - Demana Azulene </p>
            <p>Well, folks, it's been a slow week or so. Between the school year 
              ending, Star Wars, and a holiday weekend, we've been lucky to get 
              enough on to raid Crushbone, let alone something really cool. Meanwhile, 
              the trade skill bonanza is slowly drawing to a close--because those 
              of us who have been working on them non-stop are slowing going insane 
              and are being forced to stop due to doctor's orders. Some of us 
              went all out:</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Anyway, sometime last night, our very own Tarrath completed his 
              8th shawl. Grats, it's very well deserved.</p>
            <p>Between protecting dwarves and tailoring new clothing, we went 
              into Veeshan's Peak to kill Silverwing. Screenshot ninjas stole 
              the picture I took, so I have no proof of our leet kill. We also 
              killed this guy:</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Ok, I lied. Cinno soloed him while we watched. Cinno's brave efforts 
              got us a Donal's for the High Priest Stumpyman, and a shadowknight 
              bp for EC tunnel :p What can I say? We were REALLY, REALLY bored.</p>
            <p>It's not been entirely dull since our last update though:</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Loots were particularly phat--some monkeys got some new red pants, 
              a certain shadowknight is wielding a flamberge, a pasty wizard got 
              a new robe, and some of our clerics got decked out in some new jewelry 
              and sweaters. </p>
            <p>Anyway, that's all for now. Hopefully, stuff will spawn, we'll 
              kill it, and Chadd will continue to send me tells to load up my 
              hard drive.</p>

              Heh, apparently we are. I logged in today for a little in guild 
              raiding action. Nothing exciting figured we would kill some gimpy 
              mobs just for fun. So I ran over to join the guild in Velks. Here 
              is what I found at the zone in.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Needless to say we pulled him a couple minutes later and with my 
              stunning leadership abilities suprisingly managed to kill him with 
              no casualties. </p>
            <p>We really wanted to do something else. Bloods Guard was in Sky, 
              Grieg wasn't up, only Gozzrem was up in West Wing, HOT was camped, 
              everything else was dead. After searching high and low we found 
              one mob still alive.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Couple whack jobs were babbling something about VP as I logged 
              out to go sniff glue. <br>

              Many moons ago the Queen in Chardok was our arch nemesis. For no 
              real apparent reason she killed us most times ever. AOW has since 
              filled that role. A fairly basic encounter that should be easy for 
              us but proves to be our continous downfall. For whatever reason 
              the planets aligned and our zerg army of almost 80 people dropped 
              his ass. Wasn't that clean of a kill but you don't get extra loot 
              for perfection. Just happy to not waste the spawn. </p>

              F00ked up Burrower Beast, THO, and Creator tonight. Most boring 
              ever. Decent drops though so their was much rejoicing.<br>
            </p>

              Tuesday to Sunday : </p>
            <p>Umm, I think I should be taking actual notes for these updates. 
            </p>
            <p>The normal First Broods died, though I don't think we got Zlandicar 
              or Lendi the Keeper cause I know we missed Zland, but someone must 
              have killed Lendi in the middle of one of those nights, because 
              she never spawned for us at the expected time. Kind of sucks when 
              the server gets so crowded that dragons that most guilds don't normally 
              kill do it out of boredom ;( </p>
            <p>Anyway, we killed Vindi a bunch of times! Though, we did get a 
              chance at the Statue, so thats probably the high point of the 6 
              days. In a 20 Second tanking flurry of epic proportions, I kept 
              the statue busy with weaponshield while the chanters/shaman did 
              their work tashing/malo/slowing him all before he ground me up into 
              paste. Sure I didn't get heals, but I was supposed to die. 1100 
              points of damage he hit me for during his final round. HEHE! Anyway, 
              he fell, some stuff dropped and all were happy and rejoiceful. </p>
            <p>We were supposed to go to VP this weekend, but like I said, the 
              server was REALLY REALLY bored and all the dragons were killed before 
              we had a chance, so there was no use in going. </p>
            <p>Most of the weekend was made up of people exping, doing trade skills 
              to quest things or doing little quests around the place. I made 
              some more avalanche ale, 2 for 2. *glee* I also found my new triple 
              boxing spot, fungus grove. Which is fine if you don't get blasted 
              by an AE's overpulling train right over top of you. Nothing like 
              seeing 10 to 15 blue mobs come flying at your little party of 3, 
              where the cleric/chanter are dead before you can switch to them 
              to gate. Anyway, 4 points to Veteran. Then its only 9 (cry) short 
              points to Endless Quiver, then 18 (double cry) to Archery Mastery 
              3. </p>
            <p>Oh, we did some sleepers again, I think we got down to the FA once, 
              but again more guilds came in and picked off the MoTG cause he was 
              up. We got some stuff, but it wasn't that bountiful. </p>
            <p>Oh! I guess the 2nd Big news of the past 6 days was a little North 
              ToV Exploration Run on Friday night. Since like every dragon was 
              dead, we made it all the way to the PoM junction that leads to the 
              3 dragons that are splittasticly difficult. Well, not the splitting, 
              just getting the one you wanted. Everyone was afraid of Zlexak for 
              some reason, so what if he had a 1250 disease AE with slow, we'd 
              have killed him good! Anyway, we played around with the flurry drakes 
              and rampaging wyrens and lots of other drakes and a few wurms, but 
              kind of just learned the lay of the land, so to speak. Anyway, we 
              then went to PoM, and fooled around for a while, got lost, got more 
              lost, then I got 10k'd down a trap that has no bottom, well it looked 
              like it did, but it made you fall into the floor, then 10k out of 
              the floor. Nice GM rez and I gate out! At least I can say I've been 
              to every zone but Vex Thal now, whee. </p>
            <p>All I can say is thank goodness for the patch this week. The spawns 
              are all over the place, everything is super staggered and every 
              guild is all over the place instead of the places they should be. 
              So hopefully a nice patch day maddness will cool everyone's jets 
              for a bit.<br>

            <p> </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Did not suck. Not at all.</p>
            <p>Tonight, we decided to put a hurt on some snakes just for bein 
              scaly bastages. The targets? Arch Lich and High Priest. Arch lich 
              we have taken before since hes been buffed, it's not an easy fight, 
              but we knew the score and expected to see him dead. Evidently he 
              knew the score as well, since he rolled over and played dead nicely. 
              From there, we were lookin for a little challenge, so we set our 
              sights on a mob we hadn't killed yet, oh wait, I already told you....yah, 
              the High Priest. In fact, since they buffed him, I don't believe 
              anyone has killed him on CT and doing him with 55 was damn fun.</p>
            <p>The fight certainly does get your blood pumpin right from the initial 
              'break' of his room (I used the word 'break' advisedly, ever since 
              we figured out the Druid/Wizzy solo pulls outa there, it got a lot 
              easier). Then you step into the room and lay into a mob with more 
              hits than a dealer on friday afternoon. And then you fight. Then 
              you fight some more. Keep fightin, and fighting, and fighting....27 
              minutes for us this time. At one point his cronies spawned and caught 
              us off guard. Before we could react they decided to heal him from 
              20% to 40% and visions of a mass CR from the zoneline started floating 
              about the room. Anyway the HP fight is a very different fight from 
              AoW, but it brings a high level of difficulty and a large intolerance 
              for screwups. I can dance to it, I give it a 9.</p>
            <p>That's all for now, time to kill more snakes. <br>
