Talk to Nivold Predd and ask him about the summoning of dread. He needs you to fetch some components essential to the summoning of the avatar of dread.
<p>
He requires the eye of a griffon (from griffons and GrimFeather in the Karanas)[no drop] the brain of the Ishva Mal (in Splitpaw) [no drop] the toes of an ice giant (from Everfrost or Permafrost) [NOT no drop - woot!] powder of reanimation (For the powder of reanimation, he further tells you that there is a gnome necromancer that has been experimenting with a powder used in the reanimating long dead organic tissue who is known to frequent places populated by undead in order to pursue his research. If you talk to the gnome necromancer in Unrest (found on second floor) whose first name is Khrix and ask about the powder he will ask for a greater lightstone (note this has changed - it used to be a fire beetle eye) to see his way out. He then tells you you must defeat his abomination in order to get the powder.
<p>
The abomination is a ghoul that spawns in the room directly behind Khrix's closet. It is very powerful maybe 35-40. Killing the abomination gets you the reanimation powder) [no drop] When you hand him the items, he will give you a mundane shield and the chanters nearby will summon the avatar of Dread. Give Dread the mundane shield to receive the Dread Forged Shield.
