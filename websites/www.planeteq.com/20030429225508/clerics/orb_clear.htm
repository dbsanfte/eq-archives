<i>Natasha Whitewater says 'Thank you, Yumanea, for your services thus far. The Triumvirate missionaries are, so far, impressed. However, there is yet another threat rising from the Plasmatic Priesthood that may have dire effects on all of Norrath if it is not stopped. An Iksar member of the Triumvirate missionaries has discovered that the Plasmatic Priesthood has somehow convinced the sarnak summoners of Chardok to assist them in summoning Ixiblat Fer to Norrath. Take this shell to Naxot Deepwater in the Burning Woods so that she knows I have sent you. We ask that you return with the Sceptre of Ixiblat Fer as well as evidence to show that the Plasmatic Priesthood is dealing with the sarnaks. High Priest Omat will await your return. I must depart for now.  I pray for your success. '</i>
<p>
In Burning Woods at positive 3400, negative 2150 you will find Naxot Deepwater, she spawns at 6pm game time, and despawns at 6am game time. Hand her the Ornate Sea Shell you received from Natasha. In return you will receive 'Message to Natasha' and Ixiblat Fer will spawn.
<p>
<i>You say, 'Hail, Naxot Deepwater'<br>
Naxot Deepwater says 'Beware these woods! The sarnaks claim this land as their own and wicked creatures walk beneath the burning foliage.'</i>

<i>Naxot Deepwater says 'Praise the Triumvirate!  Natasha sent you just in time!  Those twisted sarnak summoners are summoning Ixiblat Fer as we speak!  We must stop Ixiblat while he is still weak or all of Norrath may be set aflame!  Please do me one favor, should I perish to this beast of fire. Give this note to Natasha when next you see her, and if you should perish and I survive, I will make sure the waters never forget the reflections of your deeds this day.'</i>

Ixiblat Fer is a level 62 Fire Elemental, he hits for a max of 575 and is immune to fire based spells. The most successful way to fight him includes, an enchanter to land tash on him, a shaman or enchanter to slow him, and mages with fire pets (the level 49 pet seems best). One Main Tank, over 55 for defensive discipline and as many healers and back up melee as you can muster. All melee except the main tank should attack from behind Ixiblat to avoid being hit by his riposte.

Loot from him "The Sceptre of Ixiblat Fer"

Once Ixiblat is taken care of you need to head into Chardok to kill Overking Bathezid Di'Zok. This will require a full raid.

<p>
Head back to Timorous Deep, finding Omat Vastsea right where you left him the other times. Hand him 'Sceptre of Ixiblat Fer' and 'Singed Scroll'. In return, he will give you 'Orb of Clear Water'.
<p>
<i>
Omat Vastsea says 'I commend you on your success over the fire elemental lord, Ixiblat Fer. The fact that the Plasmatic Priesthood has mustered up the power to summon such a being means drastic actions must be taken to stop the fanatic cult of Fennin Ro. I wonder what kind of favor Zordak Ragefire performed for the sarnak summoners to convince them to assist in the ritual that brought forth Ixiblat Fer. The dragon Iksar hybrid abominations are not beings who ally with others easily. All I have seen in my divinations of the High Plasmatic Priest are riddles, and signs that the one who slays him may be awarded an Orb of the Triumvirate. Seek Zordak Ragefire, cut out his heart, place within it the swirling pearl and return the heart to me.'
