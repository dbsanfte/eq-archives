Gameplay and User Interface</b><p>
Note:  Some folks have had trouble getting the elves' beard colors to work properly.  In order to get them to show up, you may need to set DoProperTinting=TRUE in your Eqclient.ini file.  You can do that by typing /dopropertinting in game.
<p>
ALSO NOTE:  We have changed a lot of UI Files.  Here's the list:<p>

<b>UI File Changes</b>

<ul type="disc">
<li>EQUI.xml			 
<li>EQUI_Animations.xml		 
<li>EQUI_CharacterCreate.xml
<li>EQUI_FacePick.xml
<li>EQUI_NoteWindow.xml
<li>EQUI_OptionsWindow.xml 
<li>window_pieces04.tga	
<li>EQUI_JournalCatWnd.xml - NEW FILE
<li>EQUI_JournalTextWnd.xml - NEW FILE
<li>EQUI_JournalNPCWnd.xml - NEW FILE
<li>EQUI_BigBankWnd.xml	- NEW FILE 
</ul>

<b>Interface and Gameplay</b>

<ul type="disc">
<li>The melee button for Ulaks, Martial weapons and Two-Handed Piercing weapons should appear to be depressed when attacking.
<li>Increased the size of the Notes window in the new UI.
<li>/viewport fixed.
<li>Fixed bug where action and hot-buttons for innate abilities would revert to numbers (1-6) instead of their name when a skin was loaded using /loadskin. It now reloads the names too.
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause a client crash if too many full containers were open and the ALT key was pressed.
</ul>

<b>Spells</b>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Lowered the mana cost of Yaulp I, Yaulp II, Yaulp III, and Yaulp IV to increase the value of these spells
<li>Theft of Thought works properly now, it was draining all of the caster's mana, no matter who the target was.
<li>Damage over Time type Area of Effect spells will no longer do damage when player character resists the spell.
<li>All pet spells will now get focused from any pet focusing spell/item.  This means, for example, that summoning haste will work on Beastlord and Necromancer pets.
<li>Fixed a bug that caused pet health bar to disappear if when trying to charm when a pet already exists.
<li>Divine Barrier now does all of its healing in a single burst instead of as regeneration.
<li>Removed the erroneous message "Returning to your own perspective" that occurred when a character was changed into something using an illusion.
</ul>

<b>Quests</b>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Dillon the Drowned should now respond properly when hailed.
<li>Corrected a problem with a 'quest' for the hermit in South Karana.
<li>Animist Poren now gives the correct recipe for his Handwraps Quest (shadeling silk instead of shade silk).
<li>Noirin Khalen now gives out the proper jewelry book.
<li>Supreme Loachsmith Psorin now returns items that he does not need or want.
</ul>

<b>Items</b>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Removed Rogues from the list of classes on the Elegant Darkwood Katana, since it is a two-handed slashing weapon.
<li>Removed the "secondary" tag from the Flametongue, as this item is for Int. casters only and they can't equip this item in their secondary slot.
<li>The Nathsar Greatsword and Fester now have the proper inventory icon.
</ul>

<b>Tradeskills</b>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Added new potions for Vah Shir Shaman (and all other Shaman): Shadeweaver Portal.
<li>Renamed one of two items called Figwort.  The Figwort sold in Shar Vahl has been renamed Ground Figwort to reduce confusion.
<li>Renamed one of two items called Drachling Silk.  The Drachling Silk that was once no drop is now tradable and named Drachnid Silk.
<li>Adventurers have learned new techniques for fighting Cyclopes.  These great beasts are now much more likely to have their eye intact when killed.
<li>Fixed the recipe for the potion "Soul of Incorporeal" to use a "feather".
<li>Fixed the recipe for the potion "Troll's Essence".
<li>Fixed the cast time on any 5 and 10 dose potions that were inconsistent with their single dose versions.
<li>General Bragmur in Iceclad should now avoid ice flows that he was having a problem crossing in the past.
<li>Terrorantula Silk, Feather, branch of sylvan oak, branch of planar oak, Drachnid Silk, and Drachling Silk are now stackable.
<li>Silicorrosive Grease is now tradable and stackable.
<li>Potions Aquatic Haunt and Serpents Drink no longer require reagents.
<li>Grandmaster Alchemist will now have a way to prove their ability.
</ul>

<b>Alternate Advancement</b>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Extended Notes now works on area of Effect songs as well as group songs.
</ul>

<b>PvP</b>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Fixed a bug with Root and Snare spells that prevented the target player character from being affected until they zoned.
<li>Fixed a bug with mesmerization spells being unbreakable by normal means.
</ul>

<b>Zones</b>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Fixed some text and grammar errors in Skyshrine.
<li>Ikurenm the Sly should no longer disappear when trying to chase his enemies.
<li>Repaired some "safe spots" in Echo Caverns, Paludal Caverns and Grieg's End.
<li>Fixed a pathing issue in Kurn's Tower that was causing some NPCs to disappear.
<li>The Golem Master in Charasis now looks like a golem.
<li>The Orc Arsonist will no longer have his torch disappear when looted (as long as he had it to begin with).
<li>The Sands of Fire event will now be restricted to the intended four groups.  Alternate methods of getting characters into the event have been removed.
<li>Corrected doors in Kaladim, Blackburrow and Erudin that opened the wrong way and one door in Kaesora that was way off its hinges.  Also, the Dwarves have installed a door in one of their guard huts to prevent drafts.
<li>Moved an oven in North Freeport that was poking through a ceiling.
<li>Wraith of a Shissar should no longer attack its compatriots, so they should no longer be killing it in retaliation.
<li>Corrected some respawn issues in the Plane of Air.
<li>Rallos Zek is much less likely to need to leave the arena in order to deal with his enemies...
</ul>

<b>Miscellaneous</b>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Changed "wode" to "woad" in the face picker.
<li>Corrected a spelling error in the text of the Purify Body ability (affect to effect).
<li>PCs under illusions should appear with hair if the race can have hair, even if the PC's race can't have hair.  Fixed a few other bugs with illusions and their effect on hair and eyes.
<li>Vah Shir will now see "punches" when punching instead of "hits".

Gameplay and User Interface</b>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Further optimizations to reduce bandwidth and 'lag'.  It is difficult to describe the value of this change, but it should show a noticeable improvement for many.  We've also resolved many of the hit point update and movement issues that occurred recently.
<li>Made an improvement to the animation code that may reduce the slight delays that can occur when a new player enters a zone.
<li>Spells on spell book pages 33 to 50 can now be deleted for those who were having troubles.
<li>Corrected a bug that could cause a crash if a character tried to purchase an item or close the merchant window just as he was leaving the trading range of that merchant.
<li>Players should no longer get out of range message when trying to target a player on a horse just because the horse has moved a little (but is still in range).
<li>Corrected an issue in Fungus Grove that was allowing some ranged attacks to land unnoticed by NPCs.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Spells</b>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Lull, Soothe, Calm, Pacify, Harmony, Calm Animal, and Rest the Dead should no longer give the: "Your spell did not take hold," message.
<li>Bard Songs with a "Rune" component should be working properly.
<li>Sha's Advantage and Savagery are now available on vendors in the Plane of Knowledge.
<li>Illusion spells used with Luclin models should now show the appropriate hair.
<li>Infusion of spirit should no longer overwrite Speed of Vallon.
<li>Sense Summoned will now sense elementals of most types.
<li>Eye of Zomm and Stalking Probe cast from a horse will now be able to look up and down.
<li>Call of Rizlona now has casting text for the person that procs this spell.
</ul>

<b>Alternate Advancement</b>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Monk discipline Resistance should increase resistances properly now.
<li>The Shaman AA ability Spirit Call should now finish casting if you regain concentration after interruption.
<li>Corrected a problem where right-clicking on an AA hotkey would highlight the wrong ability on the list in the window.
<li>There will now be a confirmation window available when spending AA points.  There is a new selection in the Options menu called Fast AA Purchase for toggling this confirmation.
</ul>

<b>Items</b>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Spirit of Snow and Spirit of Flame will be dropping more frequently now.
<li>Merchant's Crate of Supplies will now fit into containers that can hold giant-sized items.
<li>Removed Paladin and Ranger from the list of characters that could use the Hateful Balanced Zweihander.  It is only usable by worshippers of Innoruuk, and was never meant to be used by these classes.
<li>The Resplendent War Maul now has a more appropriate inventory icon.
<li>Crypt Master's Conjuring Stone is now more valuable to NPC vendors, and they will not sell it as cheaply as they did in the past.
</ul>

<b>Quests</b>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Killing Kazen Fecae is no longer a viable path to the completion of the Necromancer Epic quest.
<li>Tibrinn Ember now gives a faction modifier for the completion of his quest.
<li>Hanns Krieghor will no longer grant faction increases just by talking to him.
<li>There are now a few Iksar in the Plane of Knowledge that are interested in your Iksar racial armor.
</ul>

<b>Bazaar</b>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Corrected a bug in the Bazaar that caused price changes made by traders to only affect one stack of the same item.
<li>Target Group Buff and the AA ability Mass Group Buff can no longer be used with levitate spells to push traders out of their stalls in the Bazaar.
</ul>

<b>NPCs</b>

<ul type="disc">
<li>The specters and shades in Velketor should no longer be dropping cloth armor.
<li>Centi Dators should no longer spawn inside walls.
<li>Oozing Flesh in the Tower of Frozen Shadow should no longer drop Sabretooth hides.  It was determined that these creatures are too slow to catch a Sabretooth, and that they do not have the ability to skin them nor the desire to wear (or eat) their hides.
<li>Elder Spiritualist Grawleh will now respond properly to hails.
<li>Fittorin Bladespur will now respond properly to hails.
<li>A Frost Giant Sentry will now respond properly to hails.

<li>The River Source in the Warrens can no longer be attacked.

<li>Peras Glickon will now tell you that he sells food and drink (which he does) instead of spell components (which he does not).
<li>Fantoal Geabaran should now offer the inventory for sale that he claims to have.
<li>Old Gourdhead should no longer be disliked by the other natives of Misty Thicket (fixed a faction bug).
<li>The Muglwump will show up less frequently now.
<li>Dark Huntress in Mistmoore will now use the correct model and is on the correct faction.
<li>Corrected the models for elementals in the Plane of Earth.
<li>NPCs in the "pit" area of Plane of Tactics will now respawn properly.
<li>Removed Sarnak Slaves from Nurga, since they had no models there to use and looked like the base model human (Doug).
</ul>

<b>Character Appearance</b>

<ul type="disc">
<li>The bald head can now be selected during character creation by clicking the left arrow button (was only available by clicking the right arrow).
<li>Beard color selection now works for dark elf male, high elf male, half elf male, and dwarf female during the creation of new characters.  Note:  Dwarf female only has one style of beard.
<li>The ability to pick a wode is now available at character creation for Barbarians.
<li>Choosing the "random" button at character creation will now randomly choose a face rather than always using the initial selection.
<li>Changing from a male to a female character or from a bald character (such as Iksar) to one that should have hair will no longer make the new character appear to be bald.
</ul>

<b>Miscellaneous</b>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Intelligence and Wisdom should now update properly after character becomes drunk/consumes alcohol.
<li>Fixed a number of doors in Freeport that were opening incorrectly.

<b>Patch Information</b>
<p>
<b>Gameplay/Features</b>

<ul type="disc">
<li>With our last patch and the patch today, we've significantly reduced the amount of bandwidth that EverQuest needs to use, even in large raid or extremely-crowded-zone situations.
<li>Fixed a problem with tints not properly updating when armor is removed.
<li>Fixed a bug with character faces displaying incorrectly to other players when you zone in after them.
<li>Fixed resurrection timer that was counting down against the 3 hour limit when player was not logged in.
<li>Corrected a problem with health and movement updates being delayed.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Spells</b>

<ul type="disc">
<li>NPCs will now notice Druid and Shaman Percentage Heal spells in a manner similar to traditional healing spells.
<li>Removed the chance for slow spells to be reversed from the 17 NPCs that had this ability.
<li>Fixed a bug that was preventing Curses, Diseases, and Poisons from being removed.
<li>Raised all recast times below 2.25 seconds up to 2.25 seconds.  This is a change in the spell data as the first part of a two-part change needed to correct the "Recast time not met" problem.  More information is available at the Developer's Corner at www.everquest.com.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Alternate Advancement/Special Abilities</b>

<ul type="disc">
<li>The range on the Bard Ability "Boastful Bellow" has been increased slightly.
<li>Fixed a bug with Harm Touch that was not allowing it to increase the standard amount per level over level 60.
</ul>
<p>
<b>User Interface</b>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Fixed a bug with effects in the Songs window.  They were not getting removed on the client when the bard was dispelled.
<li>Introduced new Story window.  The purpose of this window is to provide story updates in a readily available location.  ALT-N toggles the window.  You can select to have the window pop up when new story elements are added if you wish.
<li>Item Links are once again creatable from Items and from other Item Links.  Please do not attempt to "mine" the servers for undiscovered items.  Links now have a built-in mechanism to prevent those who would go on fishing expeditions by sending up many bad links in an attempt to discover new items.  These invalid links are logged, as are the accounts of those who create them.
<li>Added an optional confirmation box before spending AA points.  To turn on this confirmation box, please check the Options window.
</ul>
<p>

<b>Miscellaneous</b>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Sage Quests in Plane of Knowledge have been fixed.
<li>The event to fight Bertoxxulous in the Crypt of Decay will reset 4 to 6 hours after the event is failed.  It will respawn normally if the event is won.
</ul>
<p>
<b> New/Changed Interface Files</b>
<ul type="disc">
<li>EQUI_StoryWnd.xml (actually added with the Jan. 9th patch)
<li>EQUI_OptionsWnd.xml

<b>Demise of the Classic/Velious Interface</b>
<p>
Over the last six months we have been keeping the Classic EverQuest interface as well as the Velious interface working through all of the features that we have added (built-in MP3 player, item links, compass, enhanced /bug reporting tool, and others).  However, with the release of some of the new features in this patch, such as running EQ in a window, we must now say goodbye to the older interfaces.  They have been disabled as of today.
<p>
They served us well.
<p>


<b>EQ in a Window</b>
<p>
EverQuest can now be run in a window.  To place EverQuest in a window, simply press Alt-Enter.  You can also switch out of EverQuest to another program by using the familiar Alt-Tab.  It is important that you do not do this until you are in-game, do not do this during the login process.
<p>
It is important to note a few things.  Running the game in a window may reduce game performance a bit.  And, as always, the more programs you have running at the same time the more resources they use.
<p>
At this time, due to some changes that need to be made on the front end, it is not possible to run two instances of EverQuest.  We will be working to make the necessary changes over the next few weeks.
<p>


<b>Songs Window</b>
<p>
We have added a new window to the interface along with new game functionality.  The Songs window is a new buff window that holds up to 6 bard song buffs.  This increases the potential maximum effects that a character can have to 21 (15 standard and the 6 new ones).  The new window only holds certain bard songs (generally the 3-tick songs).  Only beneficial songs will qualify for the new buff box, and not all of those.  Any buff in the new Songs window is considered temporary and will not be saved when you zone.
<p>
Songs that qualify to go into the new window will go into that window first.  Any qualifying songs over six will be rerouted to the main Effects window.  Cancel Magic effects will see these new buff slots as buff slots #16-21.
<p>
Note for User Interface skin creators:  The Label EQTypes 80-85 are the Songs window song names.
<p>


<ul type="disc">
<li>Some magical effects on Planar class armor have been altered.  In most cases the effects were upgraded, but a few items were given weaker effects that were more in line with the difficulty of obtaining them.
<li>Fixed a bug that was causing a few Planes of Power NPCs to take too long to respawn.
<li>Wu's Attack should now work correctly.
<li>Incoming damage now interacts with Wrath of the Wild and other rune-type spells in their proper order.
<li>Pact of Shadow and Shadow Compact will once again heal player characters.
<li> Charmed Pets will no longer remain charmed after the owner dies.
<li> Sending special characters (such as < and ") via EQIM will no longer freeze the game.
<li>Hitting Autoattack when in explore mode at Character Select will no longer cause the game to crash.
<li> The Loadskin window will now load skins other than the default properly.
<li> Fixed and issue that caused some NPC's text to be cut short.
<li> Fixed (but did not rename) the Broken Golem.  He should no longer be hated in Fear, just feared...
<li>Lowered the duration of calm-type spells that effect creatures level 50 and over.

<b>Zones</b>
<ul type="disc">
<li> Updated the sage quests in the Plane of Knowledge.

<b>Spells</b>
<ul type="disc">
<li> Fixed a bug with lull and harmony type spells that could cause zone-wide agro.
<li> Reduced the fizzle rate on Beastlord spells to match that of all other hybrid classes.
<li> Fixed a bug that was allowing some charmed NPCs to break mez.
<li> Blinding spells will now affect characters on horseback.
<li> Spells that automatically target your pet will now work (on your regular pet) when you have a Servant of Ro.
<li> You should be able to heal and buff your regular pet when using Host of Elements or Wake the Dead.
<li> Eldritch rune should now absorb more damage
<li> The last patch changes to Mental Corruption made it too powerful for a level 52 spell.  The damage has been toned down, and the mana recourse has been changed to scale from level 52 to 60
</ul>

<b>Music Player</b>
<ul type="disc">
<li> Typing /mp3 with no arguments will now bring up the Music Player.
<li>- When saving play lists, the player will automatically remove any extension on the filename entered and replace it with .m3u.  Since only files with the .m3u extension can be loaded as playlists by the Music Player, this should remove some "can't load a list I just saved" issues.
</ul>

<b>Miscellaneous</b>
<ul type="disc">
<li>If you are working to explore Planes of Power without progressing through the storyline, you may find that the alternate methods to enter some zones now goes a little bit faster.
