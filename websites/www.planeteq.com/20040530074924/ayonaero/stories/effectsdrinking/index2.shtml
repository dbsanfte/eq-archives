              of Drinking</span><br>
              <i>by</i> Jargmachel Axensword<br>
              <br>
              Jarg scratched his head, turning it this way and that, in search 
              of the loud irritated voice shouting, “HABBARAH SULARN HABBA JARALLLALA 
              KURNALA BALLLAAARAAA!!!!!” He knew it was Indian but could not smell 
              the tell-tale aroma of curry or coconut oil that usually accompanied 
              such outbursts.<br>
              <br>
              His mind wandered momentarily to fond memories of ancient ports 
              in lands only reached through planar teleportation. Yes, the smell 
              could be overpowering, but in his 52 seasons of living, loving, 
              and libations, he had never felt an all consuming headiness, in 
              the lands of Norrath, that could compare to the cinnamon mead of 
              India. Ahh...India, where the females of that race fawned over his 
              short, sturdy stature and Jarg's body and mind had been awash with 
              the sensations of dark sultry women heavy in scent and desire.<br>
              <br>
              He snapped back to reality as the familiar clatter of plate armor 
              grew louder and opening his eyes beheld a ghostly vision approaching 
              him. He knew the form that coalesced as it approached as Rankur, 
              but what were the strange creatures and devices he saw darting past 
              his friend and guildmate in the distance? They were strange multi-colored 
              creatures that spewed smoke from their tails and the ground they 
              charged over was strangely uniform and almost metallic in color 
              as dulled steel would seem.<br>
              <br>
			  <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ads.gamespyid.com/ad.aspx?S=planeteverquest&A1=NONE&G1=RPG&T=3&P2=0&A2=0&A3=300x250?unique"></script>
 
              Jarg quickly recalled an experience from some years back when his 
              hunting party had found a strange well deep within a dungeon on 
              Kunark. There too he had seen strange visions within the depths 
              of the black waters filling the well and a wizard amongst his party 
              had told him of parallel planes and the such. Jarg had thought the 
              gnome touched but could not doubt the truth now before him as the 
              apparition of Rankur jogged and jumped in his direction.<br>
              <br>
              Just as Jarg prepared to yell out to his friend, the apparition 
              began to fade - Rankur's face heavy with sweat and an odd smile 
              pasted to his lips. Jarg had never seen such a deranged look in 
              the man and shivered at the thought of its cause. He shook his head 
              one last time and the vision was gone.<br>
              <br>
              Jarg swore, brushing the experience off to bad Gnome ale, promising 
              himself no such drink would ever touch his lips again. The thought 
              of sugar and cinnamon against the soft, dark skin of Indian lasses 
              warming his groin. He sighed deeply and tugged at his belt, taking 
              a long soulful drink of some concoction he had purchased in Thurgardin. 
              The taste was foul but his mind numbed appreciatively. <br>
              <br>
              Stumbling toward his tent, Jarg began to sing in a longing whisper, 
              " Hari Krishna Hari Hari...." <br>
              <br>
              Jarg awoke with a start and he was not a happy dwarf. The scent 
              of cinnamon and lustful women still lingering from his dream. His 
              blanket peaked at an odd angle from his waist.<br>
              <br>
              "In all the names of the Gods and demons of Norrath, whoever hast 
              awoke me from my fruitful slumber shall pay with their life!!!!" 
              he shouted. His head pounding with each inflection.<br>
              <br>
              Rubbing his eyes in irritation, he noticed a strange glow filtering 
              through the flaps of his tent as his sight cleared. Quickly grabbing 
              his sword, Jarg lept and rolled out of his tent, hoping to dart 
              into the darkness surrounding his camp. Planning to investigate 
              the strange light further once in the shade of night, Jarg was surprised 
              as his body began to spin uncontrollably. He had been done in by 
              his own actions, having leapt into the very light he was trying 
              to avoid. Jarg realized now that whoever had laid the trap had intended 
              it so from the beginning.<br>
              <br>
              Feeling his blood rush out to his limbs, as he spun erratically, 
              Jarg felt the darkness of forced slumber creep into his mind. His 
              last thoughts of the Elven wine he was leaving behind.<br>
              <br>
              Jarg was standing. He awoke to this stance fully aware and ready 
              to fight. Strange folk surrounded him, staring down with a mixture 
              of fear and curiosity. Jarg growled a battle cry not really knowing 
              why, since these humans wore no armor and bore no arms. Yet, the 
              effect was gratifying as the soft skinned strangers screamed and 
              fled in all directions.<br>
              <br>
              There in front of him stood a structure such as he had never before 
              seen. It was a mixture of brick and metal and shiny, magical lamps 
              illuminated the front of this building in an eerie light. Above 
              the entrance gleamed a sign. Jarg was not an educated man, as his 
              education had been found amongst the battle field and tavern brawls. 
              Yet, he could decipher words sparingly well when needed and the 
              sign before him read, "D-d-d-a-ai-r-r-y-M-a-rt ?" <br>
              <br>
              He walked slowly forward, drawn to the sign as if by magic. Sudden 
              movement inside the building caught his eye and Jarg recognized 
              a fight when he saw one. He also recognized the large shiny sign 
              plastered to the clear crystal walls that marked the entrance to 
              the D-a-i-r-y-M-a-r-t. Its bottle filled with a caramel liquid that 
              no dwarf could mistake for anything else but alcohol!!<br>
              <br>
              Leaping forward in a dead run, Jarg burst through the entrance of 
              the tavern ready to aid the owner in his struggles, his mouth already 
              watering at the thought of his reward.<br>
              <br>
              He just as suddenly froze once through the entrance, as the sight 
              of Jaraxle pilfering through a corpse's pockets and the body of 
              Rankur laying alongside caught him by total surprise. He groaned. 
              Realizing his chances of tasting caramel gold had slipped through 
              his fingers, Jaraxle's silly grin brought him no pleasure. <br>
