                days ago, entered Plane of Tactics last night and killed <br>

              <p>Very fun fights and somewhat unique. </p>
              <p>Before engaging Tallon Zek a few people got Gfluxed into his

              <p></p>
              <p>So this time our adventures brought us to Drunder, The Fortress 
                of Zek, where we met Vallon Zek and Tallon Zek. The only noteworthy 
                loot was some neck slot item that they both dropped along with 
                some spell parchmentss.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Being a ranger myself, I particularly enjoyed meeting Tallon 
                Zek as he is the only evil mob in the game that could be considered 
                a member of my class. While I'm sure that the warriors didn't 
                enjoy being shot by Tallon's arrows as I heard that some are still 
                extracting them from themselves, it was definitely a fun fight 
                for me. Tallon's special item drop was very lackluster: Blessed 
                Mithril Arrows????? Those wood elf fletchers sure do get around 
                a lot. I definitely look forward to future encounters with this 
                one.&quot; <br>

              <p>Just finished watching Mr. Deeds.. What can I say? Its another 
                Adam Sandler flick, and his very first one is still my favorite. 
                Oh yeah, watched Spider Man for the first time(yeah I didn't see 
                it in theatre) and it was decent. Can you say Sequel? The movie 
                woulda been 10X better with a few nice skin shots of my favoritist 
                girly Kirsten! Ever watched the Suicide Diaries? That movie shows 
                some SKIN!</p>
              <p><br>
                Ok, on to something related to lame Everquack.. We killed a few 
                mobs since the last update, though I'm sure I can't remember the 
                difference between when we killed AOW &amp; Emp Ssra and raiding 
                lord Crushbone, its all so easy!</p>

                Can't forget to add that Zlexak the biotch mother of Wuoshit assraped 
                us again! I think we will win next time, but for now this bastard 
                evades us. And did I mention that KALATARAIN(our old GL supreme) 
                did the nice pull job(head job?) on Zlexak? Anyways, we camped 
                clerics 1 minute into fight, and there was till 7 XA fighting 
                Zlexak 2 minutes after that and we got the biotch to 65% with 
                basically no heals and Darkvision tanking(ubah). Next time you 
                going DOWN fugly dragon! And when Zlexak goes down, his asspirate 
                buddies Sevalak and Cekenar better head for the hills 'cause we 
                gonna fuggemup.</p>

                1. Verant has suspended me.<br>
                --------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                lain of mischief. I never knew that GMs were allowed to go into 
                plain zones. Hmm maybe I should check my Emails more oftenMy account 
                has been suspended today for violating Verant's naming policy. 
                My account will not be active for 4 days (according to those mindless 
                sheep running the customer service phones). Here is what happened: 
                <br>
                About 4 months ago I made a toon and named him Bootie. When he 
                got to 20 I gave him the surname of TheHoFish. Bootie theHoFish. 
                Verant automatically changed my name to Boefmur (comp generated 
                name). It was funny the NPCs and mobs referred to me as boefmur 
                and the name above my head was still Bootie. I got an Email from 
                Verant warning me and listing the complete rules to their naming 
                policy. I did not reply back.<br>
                Yesterday I made a toon and named him Rumpledforeskin. I was able 
                to log on and play him for a while. Then when I dinged lvl 5 I 
                was instantly kicked from the server. I tried to log back on and 
                I got the message: Account suspended. <br>
                I called customer service. I was eventually connected to a live 
                person. She tried to explain why my account was suspended, but 
                used very vague terms. Like, &quot;You must read the naming policy 
                to find out why you were suspended&quot;. Finally I was able to 
                get her to rationalize to me why Rumpledforeskin was an unacceptable 
                name. (I basically played dumb and used the excuse that if it 
                were an unacceptable name why wasn't it rejected when I first 
                made it. You can't expect customers to adhere to a rule that is 
                purely based on a judgment call) It was very comedic to listen 
                to this woman try to explain that rumpledforeskin had sexual content.<br>
                Anyway in the end, I was unable to get my account reactivated 
                so I will not be on for 4 days.</p>
              <p>See you all in a few days.</p>

                Just some pictures to enjoy from the last few raids... and no, 
                they are not sorted.</p>
              <p>This is how you end up when some Flurries are incomming the first 
                time before you even fought any other mobs.</p>

              <p>Oh hit me babe! <br>
                And no, its wasnt me that was casting Resolution during I fought 
                him. He charmed me :(<br>
                The good thing was that I killed Haloface.</p>
              <p><br>
                Chuckles. I missed taking a pic from his older brother, chuckles 
                the great.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Its also a good feeling to see your gorup and 4/5 of the raid 
                dead and you keep tanking those 3 AE Wurms in WToV. That was the 
                ego booster of the week. Yes as Paladin you get your boosts out 
                of small things.</p>

              <p>Erollisi. My goddess! This is the only place all over Norrath

                And you run to PoM from the ToV Zone in :)</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>And here's... sigh.. half the Guild in PoM. Once again we had 
                a train just at the very sercond we all wanted to zone to PoM. 
                This time we gave the command to zone in but unfortunately half 
                the guild wasn't aware where the hell that 'zone in' was. We will 
                take revenge and at one point we WILL all zone into PoM and go 
                kill Bristlebane.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Yeah, nothing too great but hey, beat that first.</p>

              <p></p>
              <p>And look, here's Tunny! She smiled, she was friendly, she looked 
                good as usual (nothing compared to Erollisi tho), we were all 
                about to make friends with her... and then she punched me for 
                4dmg!!!! <br>
                She died the next 30 secs. Sigh... </p>
              <p></p>
              <p>And another group shot of the Guild in NToV. This time in front 
                of the Vulak Bridge. Just as we were about to get a train.. er.. 
                I mean, where we were about to zone to PoM.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Oh oh.. and I almost forgot Vyemm! <br>
                We prepared well. We knew our target. We had our tactic and we 
                were ready to rip off his nuts and roast them on our next BBQ. 
                SO we attacked and hit him. Hard. We owned him, we we invincible, 
                we were strong, we were mighty and we were so good....<br>
                And THEN he saw us.... </p>

                After killing Kelorek Dar, we had a nostalgic trip to Hall of 
                Testing. We cleared entire HoT, killed all 4 nameds. Concerning 
                patterns, we were either extremely unlucky, or the drop rates 
                were nerfed. <br>

              <p>Join me in welcoming Adrikan back to the scene. He has been missed! 
                Also, reports are spreading that Tharak has been once again spotted 
                in Norrath, and will be returning to the fold. This is great good 
                news for the Untamed Dreamers.</p>

                Well, seems one of our Druids has fought well and has brought 
                home a new leaf blower. Grats Heruu, sorry the movie got messed 
                up though.</p>
              <p>As for news around here, been kinda dry of late, other than taking 
                out Sev when he pops and some other targets of opportunity most 
                of our crew has been trying to pass those @#)&amp;)^&amp;)@#*$)_#*%_@^_*^)(&amp;$)(*&amp;@#$(*&amp;$(*&amp;@#(&amp;@%#@^ 
                Trials. Sorry for that spat of profanity..</p>
              <p>Seems to actually pass these bloody things you need to be faster 
                than speedy gonzolas and hit harder than superman. Guess I'm just 
                a little frustrated<br>
