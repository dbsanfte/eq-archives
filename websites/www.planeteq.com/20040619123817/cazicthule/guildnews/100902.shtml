              cold.. Regor [ Archive ] <br>
              This particular snake has caused us some grief... In fact, alot 
              of grief. 
            <p>So, we make our third attempt on mister Arch Lich Rhag'Zadune. 
            </p>
            <p>True to form, he still caused us much grief, but through some amazing 
              work keeping our assling alive for 45 mins, we managed to kill him 
              for the first time. Good to know we can still zerg it with the best 
              of them, but I really cant say it was fun to do so. At the end of 
              the day there was so much hate for the damn scaly worm that we kinda 
              willed him to die. Yeah, we got a kick outta taking it close to 
              the wire, but heres to a better kill next time :) </p>
            <p>Third times the charm.. </p>

            <p>Funny how both of these are on asslings hmm ? must be something 
              about rattles that attracts them. <br>

            </p>
            <p>Tonight, CC decided to check out the newly revamped ST. Unfortunately, 
              the MTOG and Progenitor weren't up for us to play with, so we decided 
              to go exploring a little deeper.</p>
            <p>Well, one thing led to another, and we found ourselves at the Final 
              arbiter. He tried to persuade us not to go any further...but alas, 
              his words fell on deaf ears. What need does a zergling have for 
              arbitration?</p>
            <p>Moving on, we met and challenged the new warders, the first guild 
              on CT to do so. And because a picture's worth a thousand words, 
              here's a picture. I guess if you add in captions, titles, etc...the 
              value goes over 1000, though...</p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Thats right, for the first time on CT, the new ST was cleared. 
              And for the record...killed 3 out of the 4 first try, one on the 
              2nd try. 4 warder was flawless, 2 others saw us lose 2 people or 
              so. </p>
            <p>Loot?</p>
            <p>Congrats to Tanarra on the Server's first and only Dwarf Mask, 
              Murf on his SMR..err...Lungi of the Forbidden, Dinuvian and Kaylynne 
              on their Despondant shrouds, Tikana on her Heritage of Secundae,

              The Captain Makes It Happen! <br>

            <p>The guild alcoholics came up with a revolutinary strat to take 
              our friend the Emp down. We would invoke a the aid of a powerful, 
              mystical pirate ally to help take him down...the infamous &quot;Captain 
              Morgan&quot;.</p>
            <p>The summoning ritual consisted of every member of CC downing a 
              5th of Captain Morgan's spiced rum prior to the emperor fight. Low 
              and behold, he appeared...</p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Other than the nifty goatee and moustache, though...he didn't seem 
              to do a whole hell of a lot, and the emp ended up kicking our asses 
              again. Sigh.</p>
            <p>Yes, each time, we get closer, learn more, etc. We know many guilds 
              took 10-15 attempts to get him down, and due to the crowds on our 
              server, we're sitting on attempt 7...but its still frustrating as 
              hell to be stuck at this point. </p>
            <p>And yes, its been a long time since the last update, so here's 
              the rollcall.</p>
            <p>CC/Talons killed:<br>
              2 Bloods (one of which happened on that &quot;Hi, our patch broke 
              aggro&quot; night), King tormax twice, The Avatar of War (and his 
              buddies Vindi and Statue), Vyzd'rha the Cursed and his asshole sidekicks 
              the Glyphed and Exiled, and Xerkizh the Creator.</p>
            <p>CC In house Killed:</p>
            <p>King Tormax, Statue of Rallos Zek, Zlandicar, Most of TOVN, Doomshade, 
              Rhag 1&amp;2, 2 Ragefires, Yet another late night Trakanon (at nearly 
              2am PST), 2 sucessful Ringwars (grats Shaofung and Tanarra), the 
              Restless Burrower, the Ring of Slime, and a whole bunch of minor 
              things for epics and such. </p>

              corps: Feochadan, Taraddar, and Evincar. <br>

              a wandering we will go, hi ho a mery go a wandering we will go... 
              course we wandered to UP last night and smacked down a few mobs

              easy to kill Telk now.. Grats to BG on the BP, the SK wep for an 
              alt.. and the SK wep to the ROT gods</p>

              CoG led by Engress goes to Plane of Sky and goes away with some 
              much needed epic pieces for Barbed, Adus, a necro (Morgath?), and 
              our guest, Siacay from BG. Lotsa random drops too which many rejoiced. 
              Varner also completed the uber pally quest haste belt! Upon a lengthy 
              meeting concerning Varner's uberness, CoG officers have decided 
              he must not get more uber than The Tog (aka Tautog). To facilitate 
              such a decision, he is now the guild waterboy.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>In other news, Kerafyrm's Lair (aka Sleeper's Tomb) key holders 
              went to this revamped dungeon with one purpose in mind...to make 
              mountain dust out of the new Master of the Gaurds. With much patience, 
              CoG and BG killed this giant golem on steroids last night. He droped 
              a 14/19 MNK/BST h2h weapon (Feller from BG), a ancient prismatic 
              claimore (havasee), some uber booties that had 10ac 5int/wis 35hp 
              75mana and other stats(bregga), and a quest robe (Milennia). Pretty 
              good for 11-12 people.<br>

              ...but we just keep on comin!</p>
            <p>Grats to the alliance (CoG/BG) once again on a successful Klandicar 
              slaying. A few monents before attack the chats went down, yet we 
              hardly even noticed and took up the old school channels (shouts/ooc). 
              Lots had some casting bug as well. Kland got down to less than 10% 
              before the last hero died. Second attempt a success; grats to Heartilly 
              of BG on the ST key and Falcoun on Dragon Breetches.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Imediately afterward, those that could stay up (and even some that 
              couldn't, but did anyway) took down Rage for Avaalons epic. Mareck 
              got some fancy orange legs, Lohengrin got some fancy orange arms, 
              and Briyn got a shiny new orange BP courtesy of Ragefire. A second 
              Rage kill for another guild got Adus some fancy new orange greeves. 
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>BOOYAH! </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Everyone keep their eyes open for any dragons trying to poke their 
              heads up.<br>

            <p>Congrats to Celtin and Duffil for completing their Cleric Click 
              Sticks. Duffil gets major props for sticking it out in Solb. Celtin 
              came in for a some relief duty and together they completed this 
              very rough quest. Again Congrats to both of you.</p>
            <p>Grats to Malom for scoring a cloak of flames off Ixy as we dropped 
              this punk again in route to setting up Celtins epic run.</p>
            <p>Ragefire dropped a few nice pieces of resist gear. Grats to Fadari 
              and Fezik for picking up some new items.</p>
            <p>Yodi and Arriak both grabbed some new Thurg armor pieces this week, 
              boots and gloves respectfully. Houfter is in line for some new arms. 
            </p>
            <p>Dropped Vindicator again last week with YMM and BDA. Grats to YMM 
              on teh BP. A number of DoKR peeps scored some more armor drops and 
              Yodi was given a Defiance that dropped. Grats to all. After Vindi 
              fell we decided to go to ToV Hot late after the Kael rumble. Teamed 
              up with a group from Talons and proceeded to kick some dragon tails. 
              Dropped Dozer for the nights climax. Shirmar and Meimei pickes up 
              some loots so grats are in order for them scoring some nice ToV 
              gear.</p>
            <p>Submitted Sept 29th by Fairsong</p>
            <p>Congrats to Me (Fairsong) on completing my epic. Was a true guild 
              effort and unattainable without everyones help.</p>
            <p>Id like to take this opprotunity to say thank you to everyone in 
              our guild for sacreficing so much time and effort in helping the 
              clerics get their Rage Shards in skyfire. Its not the best zone 
              for loots or to exp grind in, so I fully understand your effort 
              in helping so many of clerics get into a position to finish their 
              epics. Congrats to Duffil, Andorean, Celtin,and Pitterpatter for 
              loading up on those shards. Rezz sticks are inc.</p>
            <p>Massed up and dropped Ixleblat Fer for another step in the cleric 
              epic. Grats to Pitterpatter, Andorean, &amp; Mindaarie for getting 
              their Ixy wand. Blitzer walked away with a play toy or 2 and I believe 
              Jackum found himself a new pair of shoulder.</p>
            <p>Speaking of Jackum with some help from Fadari, Fellkin, and Jonzer, 
              he was able to take down Renux for another step in his epic.</p>
            <p>We hooked up with our buds from legion of Nox and mauled our way 
              into Fear on Wednesday. After some slow cautious pulls we did take 
              out 2 of the Mini Bosses before it got to late. Grats to Billpal 
              for some new pally legs, Garyn pocketed a new sword, Kalley a new 
              belt,and Jackum picked up some Bazaar fodder. Houfter did managed 
              to beat up some little kiddy iksar for a piece of his epic. Grats 
              to all.</p>
            <p>Teamed up with Yoricks Merry Men and Bregan D'Aerth and pounded 
              our way into Chardok and roughed up the Royals a bit. Grats to Pitterpatter 
              on some nice gloves as well as her epic piece. Celtin and Duffil 
              also got their Epic notes from the King as well. It was a great 
              3 guild effort as many peeps stayed on for long time to ensure a 
              successful King looting for all the clerics there.</p>

              It twas a rather boresome day I assure you. We had been doing tedious 
              camps, raiding french castles, rounding up knights, building shrubberies, 
              disposing of plague victims, doling out punishment to Castle Anthrax 
              (I myself punished at least 3 evil-doers), camping shards, and oh 
              yeah, Scene 24, when we saw this!</p>

            <p></p>
            <p>VT Loot, hovering in the sky, beckoning us! We set out immediately

              Since someone foolishly made me an officer, and I thusly used my 
              powers of persuasion <br>
              on Rauk, I now can do the news! </p>
            <p><br>
              Our first kill of the day was the THO. The best part of the fight 
              was watching Deedit run in and out and out and hearing her say &quot;OMG 
              I'm charmed! I need a bard! 300 MR not enough!&quot; THO died eventually 
              (Note: I will volunteer to change the code to lower his hit point 
              by 3/4ths so you can keep working on PoP and those of us farming 
              Orbs can keep our sanity).</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>IV is up! What oh what should we do?! Kill him?! Sure!! What can 
              we do to make this fight just as enjoyable as THO?! Lets have a 
              shadowknight tank! Go Halon! Grats Giladriel on your neck. Maybe 
              if we didn't kill Seru every few days we could stay non-KoS to his 
              guards by killing IV and Grieg. Too bad we're loot whores.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>After that we set out looking for a real challenge and that inevitably 
              led us to Kael. The mighty leader of the giants, King Tormax, was 
              up. If you want to make the encounter more enjoyable don't kill 
              King Tormax solo he's 2x <br>
              as much fun with his guards. Also refuse to use a CH order. Grats 
              Drackmor, Cilorian, Rufio, Faeadien, and Sorste.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Someone mentioned that we spent a lot of time farming for these 
              Vex Thal keys? I don't know what they're talking about but there 
              was stuff to kill somewhere. So we went and killed it. I would like 
              to say, that i personally, find no more greater meaning in life, 
              than clearing Vex Thal for hours on end. In the classic Jerry McGuire 
              style, &quot;You (vex thal yard trash) complete me!&quot; In the 
              end we got some new toys. Grats Pied and Wulf and Naeen and Tenchi.</p>

              Sleepers, Cursed, Seru, HP - Stormhaven (9/29/2002 2:50 AM) <br>
              <br>
              Well, I haven't posted anything up here for a few days because we've 
              been slacking off a little bit. </p>
            <p>On patch day, we didn't get to do our normal rampage on the various 
              mobs because... well because the game was pretty much broken. We 
              took out King Tormax and walked away from everything else with our 
              tails tucked between our legs.</p>
            <p>On emergency patch day, we found that aggro was again working correctly 
              so we took out the rhags early in the day. Unfortunately there was 
              some issues with 250ac 300hp/mana items dropping from level 10-30ish 
              zones. Apparently this is a problem. So they repopped all the zones 
              across the servers, and therefore all the normal patch day spawns 
              went afk until Friday. We decided to check out the new Sleepers 
              2.0 (now with 100 free hours!) for grins. Same zone. Lots of mobs. 
              Other than that, same zone.</p>
            <p>So today, things finally started to respawn, so we took out Cursed, 
              Lord Seru (3 for 3 now), and the High Priest. I'd show you screenshots, 
              but it was all pretty routine.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Here are the only loots worth mentioning:<br>

            <p>Well, apparently there were some &quot;issues&quot; with Sanctus 
              Seru so to our surprise we found Seru had spawned for us again. 
              Well, we couldn't pass up another chance to gank'em, so...</p>
            <p>Anyhow, LOOT:<br>

            <p>Oh, and I know some of you are keeping track, so for those of you 
              who are curious about our &quot;leet manaburn abilities&quot; we 
              had about eight wizards at this most recent attempt. Assuming they 
              all crit'd for a full 12-15k worth of damage (they didn't), that'd 
              be approximately 4% of his total hitpoints. So needless to say, 
              you figured out our ultimate sekret Seru strategy. We estimate that 
              if we just used manaburn on Seru, he'd be dead in about 23hrs. Give 
              or take a few hours.<br>

              -Nothing Whatsoever!- <br>
              We did absolutely nothing since the last update...</p>
            <p>What? I'm not kidding...</p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>What do you want!? Leave me alone!<br>
              <br>
              Okay! Okay! Jesus! Bug a man to death! Let me see what all we've 
              been up to. We've mostly been experiencing and going after several 
              epics. We took down the King in Chardok with just over one groups 
              worth of people. There were three adds during the fight and I ran 
              out of mana, so some of us died after King was down, but luckily 
              a cleric looted the head before that happened. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>We pulled the mantrain into Kael one night for Tormax area, but 
              we had very crappy drops all night. Those giants must be hiding 
              their armor when they see the Juggernauts' mantrain pulling into 
              station. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>We got a couple of more Scouts for Bracer of Benevolances, and 
              also smacked Lodizal around a few times with 2 and 3 people. Sithray 
              is very proud of himself for that and made sure I mentioned it. 
            </p>
            <p>We tore through the Hole the other night for my epic, and followed 
              that up by AoE'ing City of Mist. Never let anyone tell you that 
              a ranger isn't an uber addition to an AoE group. Without my damage 
              output I don't think we'd have made it to the Reavers. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>We've done a lot of epic stuff this past week: Hole, CoM, Ixiblat, 
              Chardok, Plane of Fear, etc. We now have about 4 or 5 members within 
              a couple of pieces of their epics. Hopefully we can finish those 
              soon before we get bored. Here is Ixiblat dying to the Mantrain: 
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>With epic camps come lots of boredom, especially camping shards 
              in Skyfire. Or waiting for crap to spawn. We pass the time in many 
              different ways. It's pretty sad when the most fun you had playing 
              EQ in a long time is swimming in lava: </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>While we were bored waiting on shards, or other crap that we have 
              to wait on. We decided we needed a guildname to truly reflect the 
              sentiments of our members. While we tried many different options, 
              we feel these are where we want to go with our guild surname. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>When a group member goes linkdead, don't get smart too quickly, 
              for the Linkdeath gods will smite you hard. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Nikalos is the philosopher of our guild. This man is a modern day 
              Socrates. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>That's it for this week, more boredom on the way soon! </p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>We've had a very busy weekend. Firstly, want to welcome Tiliu and 
              Tyrell as our newest members. Welcome you two. Also have a couple 
              of more recruits that we're looking forward to getting to know. 
              As always you can check our bio section to see who they are. We 
              hit up Skyfire a bit camping some shards, one cleric now has all 
              four. Did some other epic camps and moving along quite nicely on 
              our cleric epics. </p>
            <p>While on the topic of Tyrell, the GM's made him their personal 
              bitch the other night. We had some bugged corpses and the GM's were 
              being pretty unhelpful about it. Tyrell decided to get smart. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>At the very bottom you can see the top of the linkdead message, 
              but I suck at taking screenshots apparently. </p>
            <p>We've been camping the Scout in West Wastes for about a week now. 
              Grats to Klopo, Lilouden, Nikalos, and Sithray on this nice little 
              item:</p>
            <p>Bracer of Benevolence<br>

              Class: WAR PAL RNG SHD MNK BRD ROG <br>
              Race: ALL<br>
              Friday night we went to Kael and killed the Tormax area dead. Don't 
              remember the loot we got, but wasn't that much. But had fun, had 
              a couple of near wipe outs, but we're getting very good at recovering 
              from close calls. Cause we're all sexy. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Saturday night we loaded up the ol' Man Train and headed to West 
              Wastes for some dragon action. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>We tore the place down, downing about 5 dragons in about an hour. 
              It was obvious our man train tactic had them off balance. We'll 
              have to use this top secret strategy more often. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Dannie apparently thought we were playing Resident Evil instead 
              of killing dragons. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Since our l33t Mantrain tactic worked so well against the dragons 
              to the point that we didn't have anymore to kill, we loaded up the 
              mantrain and moved to Kael. Got a few drops, grats to Tiliu on chain 
              legs and of course having a sexy butt in general. Not any major 
              wipeouts all night, so that's always a good thing. Here is the mantrain 
              pulling into Kael: </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>It's been two very long days of killing as you can probably tell 
              from the bajillions of screenshots I just posted, but one of the 
              better weekends we've had for fun. On the way heading back I ran 
              into someone quad kiting my buddies the Wyverns. I decided I'd help 
              them, because obviously they weren't very good at tactics, but I'll 
              be damned if I didn't follow right along. Those quad kiters really 
              have their strategy down, it can't even be undone by human intelligence. 
              I'm plotting out my strategy now with my wyvern buddies, we're thinking 
              black ninja style is the way to go.</p>

              Rolling Ownage!<br>
              10/7/02<br>
              Fantastik Weekend of Rolling Ownage!! Friday ~ Grieg's End. We put 
              a stop to the breathing patterns of the Servitor of Luclin, as well 
              as a few other Named in the zone. After nearly succeding on the 
              Servitor our very first try, we went back for Revenge, which was 
              quick, severe, and most assuredly very painful for him. Saturday 
              ~ Woke up pretty early for those on the West Coast, and headded 
              to Fear. Flawless break of the plane, followed by an efficent clearing 
              of most of the plane (when we realized there was nothing else up 
              worth killing, we left ;p). Fright, Dread, and Terror all sent to 
              their graves. Upon leaving, our next target for the day was the 
              City of Mist. More epic peices out of the way, and more things falling 
              at the hands of the Legacy. Our last stop of the day was Velks, 
              where Lord Bob, as well, met a swift and untimely death. Sunday 
              ~ Once again, dropped in on the Plane of Fear, this it was the Dracoliche's 
              turn to fall under the veil of Darkness. Continuing on, we spawned, 
              and promptly dispatched of Ragefire. We had 3 clerics close to epic 
              completion... one down, two to go! Onward and upward, we rolled 
              on to Wakening Lands, where we promptly turned on someone that many 
              of us are Allied with, and promptly dispatched of the dragon Wuoshi. 
              Poor guy never knew what hit him. There was still, however, light 
              in the skies, so on we headed to the Temple of Veeshan. Roaming 
              the Halls of Testing, we took down everything that crossed our path. 
              Pray for whomever whe choose as our next victim... that their death 
              be relatively swift and painless. The Legacy lives on!</p>

              Xly! Best showing of skill we've had in a long time, I was most 
              impressed. Somewhere in here Nizzaa hit 60.. Oh ya, while the guild 
              was on much deserved downtime, some of us ventured over to Arcyila 
              Caverns and tried out the Ring of the High Priest. Took 2 attempts 
              to really get it down (Note, you really have a hard time doing this 
              ring with 6 people ;x) Second Day/Attempt we owned it - and... got 
              junk loot ;x Not quite sure where the spells where, but obviously, 
              they wheren't on the body. Its k tho, we owned it anyway - something 
              totally new to everyone there. Good job! Erm, los of new App people

            <p>Well, last night we killed Aten Ha Ra for the second time. It was 
              just as fun as the first time.</p>
            <p>On the way to Aten we took out Thall Va Xakra(x2), the blob aka 
              Kaas Thox Xi Ans Dyek, Diabo Xi Va, Diabo Xi Xin Thall, Thall Va 
              Kelun, Diabo Xi Va Temerial, Va Xi Aten Ha Ra and finally the big 
              drag queen herself. All within the span of 3 or 4 nights. Not bad 
              being the working Joe's we are.</p>
            <p>Loot on Aten was the baby Jesus necklace (Zaero), Mask of Judgement 
              (Faen), Tomb of Secrets (Stiffler), Leg Guards of Shadows (Mintern) 
              and Ancient High Priest's Bulwark (Lildaanie). <br>

              Ya ya, I am late with some pics, sue me.</p>
            <p>Here is the obligatory guild pic owning the throne the tall chick 
              with the b00bs was camping on. </p>
            <p>We are proud of this solo clear of VT, a mere (/cough) 53 days 
              after our first Emp kill.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>And of course, a pic of the inventory of the mob. Of which I couldn't 
              figure out how to use ALT and take a screenshot at the same time. 
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Any other guilds have their entire melee crew /assist enchanter01 
              in VT just for fun? Not only do we do that to Mesmer, we also train 
              him repeatedly.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Expect Seru dead soon so we can call this expansion a wrap.<br>

              Saturday September 28, 2002 - Stupid Pet Tricks <br>

            <p></p>
            <p>Yup. This is what happens when you spend entirely too much time 
              with your pet. Am I the only one that thinks an Iksar Beastlord 
              and it's pet look like a large suitcase and a carryon?</p>
            <p>So it's patch day, right? People running around giggling at Ice 
              Comet, Druids and Shamans healing everything they can find and, 
              most importantly, Vex Thal in full bloom. We wander on over and 
              immediately discover that Verant has attached the aggro system to 
              a roulette table. Round and round she goes, where she stops, nobody 
              knows! Despite that we managed to take down Kaos Thox Xi Ans Dyek 
              (You call him Blob 1, I call him Kaos Thox Xi Ans Dyek, Apoc calls 
              him his &quot;Lil Puddin&quot;. I try not to pry).</p>
            <p>Of course we here in Luclin land (Mental image snapshot: four asslings 
              dancing in unison around a house that just landed on a dark elf 
              sorceress. they're all singing &quot;we wish to welcome you to Luclin 
              land&quot;. We apologize for the interruption) know that you can't 
              patch just once so Friday we went after lil Puddin a second time 
              then took down Diabo Xi Xin before finally losing to a VT boss mob. 
              Don't worry, Diabo Xi Xin Thall, we know you now. Enjoy your rest 
              while you can.</p>
            <p>That brings us to today. what did we do today? Oh yeah, we killed 
              emperor...63 folks this time, and the numbers we need to kill him 
              start to plummet.</p>
            <p>That's it for now. See you all soon. and, as always...</p>
            <p>Thank you for Playing.</p>
            <p>Oh yeah. quotes. Thank you Chionia for the smorgasbord to choose 
              from...<br>
