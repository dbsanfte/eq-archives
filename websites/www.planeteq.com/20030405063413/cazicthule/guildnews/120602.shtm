              Thanksgiving <br>
              <br>
              Posted by: Druss on Thursday, November 28th, 2002 @ 1:34 AM<br>
            </p>
            <p>Now I've never been a big fan of Woodrow Wilson, but in reading 
              this, I found myself strangely moved.</p>
            <p>&quot;THANKSGIVING 1917<br>
              By the President of the United States : a Proclamation</p>
            <p>It has long been the honored custom of our people to turn in the 
              fruitful autumn of the year in praise and thanksgiving to Almighty 
              God for His many blessings and mercies to us as a nation. That custom 
              we can follow now even in the midst of the tragedy of a world shaken 
              by war and immeasurable disaster, in the midst of sorrow and great 
              peril, because even amidst the darkness that has gathered about 
              us we can see the great blessings God has bestowed upon us, blessings 
              that are better than mere peace of mind and prosperity of enterprise.&quot;<p>
              And, how timely this seems today. Thankfulness in times of tragedy, 
              danger, and uncertaintly, and a reminder that we here in the USA 
              have MUCH to be thankful for, despite all the problems we see nightly 
              on the news.</p>
            <p>We in CC also have much to be thankful for. Some members offered 
              to share the things that they were most thankful for, and I submit 
              them for your viewing pleasure, below.</p>
            <p>Lrogg is thankful for good things to eat, like:</p>
            <p><br>
              Jozz is thankful for helpful things that pick him up, when he's 
              down:</p>
            <p><br>
              Dinuvian is thankful for...a soulmate?</p>
            <p><br>
              Aladriel is thankful for her...ahem:</p>
            <p><br>
              Ronoldo is thankful for his soulmate, as well:</p>
            <p><br>
              Angturil is thankful for nice clothes and a zippy fashion sense:</p>
            <p><br>
              Flareon is thankful for a certain company:</p>
            <p><br>
              Tanarra is thankful for the freedom to uh...uh...well, do whatever 
              the hell this is:</p>
            <p><br>
              As for me, I'm thankful I get to be a part of this lunatic family. 
              <br>

              Turkey day roasted Klandicar! <br>
              Posted by Battleskar On Nov 28 2002 At 4:28:58 PM <br>
              In an impromptu raid today the forces of CoG and BG once again rousted 
              the dragon known as Klandicar. In honor of Thanksgiving, we roasted 
              his remains over a nice spitfire that Grisnalg made for the troup. 
              After that we killed the necro Morgath for &quot;raising the dead&quot; 
              on the fallen body of Klandicar and giving half the party heart 
              attacks. Fun was had by one and all, and congrats on a new ST key 
              to Hildar =) 
            <p>Happy Thanksgiving everyone!</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Rut here.. on a side note we kicked the crap outa zlandicar later 
              that evening to get BGs key to Craszs, drops were cowl of mortality 
              for bg, frelks talisman to dalmerre for cloak quest, massive shard 
              to BG, zlandicars heart to glif and bunchs of spells.<br>

              Trakanon dies once again in a near perfect fight, only one death 
              due to shroom port. This time he was very generous and dropped 6 
              teeth, Cobalt and Tolan's Chestplates.

              As we make our push to have enough people in VP to clear the zone, 
              Trakanon died once again and dropped us more teeth. This time he 
              died without a single death on the pull or the fight.</p>

            <p>Grats to Chaser and Houfter who both completed their epics. Great 
              job both of ya.</p>
            <p>A group of us camped lodi for a weekend and thus were rewarded 
              with the shells and many other goodies.</p>
            <p>PoP has been the stomping grounds for many of us and has been quite 
              the place for exp. Many many peeps have achieved some nice levels 
              lately so keep up the good work.</p>
            <p>Dropped the prince of Chardok and helped Celois take a good step 
              in his epic hunt. Rylog picked up a nice upgrade from that encounter.</p>
            <p>Lots of upgrades lately from Tov and Thurg Armor. Stomping Dragons 
              and Giants seems to be the norm lately. Umbral has been kind to 
              us as well with many good armor drops.<br>

              The Editors Have Asked Me To... - Trucari (12/1/2002 3:21 AM) <br>
              <br>
              Well apparently there is in fact no Diseased Turkey of Bertoxxulous, 
              and the screenshot given to me, upon review is a blatant forgery. 
              So for anyone who might have spent time searching PoDisease for 
              a large man eating turkey, sorry about that.</p>
            <p>In other news, we killed the Zek brothers, more than you would 
              expect since zones have a bad habit of crashing on us at some of 
              the most inopportune times. Loot was gained, flags were received, 
              and there was great rejoicing.<br>

            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Using our l33t corpse rushing strategies, we finally took down 
              the Diseased Turkey of Bertoxxulus(DToB for short.) It took weeks 
              of strategy and we figured it was fitting to take him down on Thanksgiving 
              in America.</p>
            <p>Actual loot was pathetic, but our guild cooks were able to make 
              a badass meal out of the remains of the carcass and the guild was 
              suitably bloated afterwards <br>

              To my guildmates: Some days you just own.
            <p>Time and time again we've proven the addage wrong that a group 
              of friends and semi-casual players can't hack it in the high game 
              of Everquest. Never have I been more amazed than I was last night 
              though. </p>
            <p>A full clearing of VT is impressive, it takes alot of focus and 
              determination on the part of everyone. But to do it two nights in 
              a row?? Nobody could pull that off...could they?</p>
            <p>You're damn right we could. </p>

              Aten Ha Ra (2 times) and Aten Ha Ra all got owned and owned hard. 
              Not to mention the mind numbing hours of clearing Pli Van Who and 
              Eom Thou When, Zun Wee Why and lord knows what else is in there. 
              (Anyone else think a print shop exploded somewhere and the just 
              named the VT mobs after it).</p>
            <p>The pullers (or scragglers....or a mix of both) decided to liven 
              things up by playing games of &quot;Lets see how many mobs we can 
              have in camp at the same time&quot;. I can't remember but I think 
              the winning number was somewhere just above 15. I swear next time 
              we're just gonna AE clear. I'll post some pics of it when I get 
              home.</p>
            <p>Two nights of full clearance of VT (and all the loot that comes 
              with it) makes baby Jesus a very happy prenatal diety. More patches

              Every patch day seems like an adventure. It's a big world and that 
              means there are big mobs out there. We as players sometimes take 
              the wide scape of the world for granted. With the ability to move 
              from zone to zone at will, even more so expanded with SoL and PoP 
              we sometimes forget the mobs that are less fortunant and are stuck 
              in the same zone, day after day.</p>
            <p>It is with that thought that we began our day with a service project 
              in mind. Vacations for some of the overworked mobs in Norrath.</p>
            <p>Our first group came from that lovely timesink...ermm temple...Ssra! 
              Glyphed, Exiled and our friend the Cursed all got selected!</p>
            <p>Even though they are still new we decided a few giants from PoS 
              could use a cruise!</p>
            <p>After that it was off to marvelous Vex Thal, giving that giant 
              stone ninny Rumblecrush a free tour on the way. Once inside the 
              Cut-n-Paste temple we gave free vacations to 10 lucky winners!!!

              NToV falls to SA/LoD!!<br>
              First NTOV foray is an incredible and enjoyable success.<p>
              Last weekend the combined force of Second Age and Legacy of Darkness 
              decided to show our dragon friends how powerful we have become. 
              We gathered our forces in the temple of their god and began our 
              task.
            <p>The dragons proved their cowardice by placing their poor baby hatchlings 
              at the front of their sanctum. As such they were the first to die. 
              We called all of our forces to a hallway just a little ways in to 
              the northern wing of the temple, and we stood at opposite ends of 
              that hall from the mighty Aaryonar. He stood proud and strong, ready 
              to defend the inner sanctum of his master's temple. But we stood 
              just as powerful, in opposition to that goal. We began the slaying 
              of our once friends, their hatchlings' corpses strewn about on the 
              floor. We cleared to Aaryonar and set up for battle. Aaryonar, and 
              1 of his guards, pounced, and he did it before we were ready. The 
              force fought boldly and we lasted longer than I'm sure even Aaryonar 
              himself expected. But, alas, he bested us.</p>
            <p>Vigilant and holding plenty of time and patience in our hands, 
              we mustered ourselves and began the task again. These dragons you 
              see, they must breed a good bit, for there seems to always be a 
              supply of hatchlings on hand. We again wiped the lot of them and 
              got set for Aaryonar. In we lured the dragon to our camp. Our blades 
              swung, but they swung shallow, as the mighty beast had some effect 
              over us all. We stayed at our task, tirelessly wailing away. Slowly 
              he was to be ours, when suddenly the dragons brought forth a new 
              wave of hatchlings to our midst. We did our best to deal with the 
              lot, and did well, even charming two of the hatchlings against their 
              creators. Alas, one of them became lost during the battle and when 
              he came back, his former allies rode his tail. The additional foes 
              were too much for our raid to bear, and again we fell.</p>
            <p>Determined, and perhaps a bit obsessed, we began to ressurect our 
              fallen. We knew Aaryonar was ours, if we could only keeps his friends 
              out of the fight. We pulled, and again we fought, slowly. And again 
              we wiped, his friends had come to help yet again.</p>
            <p>Before we could get ready to attempt Aaryonar again, his ally, 
              Eashen of the Sky, returned from his trip. Having had trouble with 
              adds in the last two fights with Aaryonar, we decided we had better 
              down Eashen first, lest he join the fray. We pulled him in and began 
              to battle, and again the drakes from that room decided to help. 
              We camped out our force and began yet again. We pulled the large 
              drake into our trap, having fooled his friends to stay away, he 
              was any easy fight, and offered little defense to his master's temple. 
              Veeshan, you should be ashamed of him. And we thank you for his 
              items.</p>

              Gratz Cyrz and Fynepisa one your: Onyx Chain Sleeves</p>
            <p>Hours already spent, sure of our strength, and armed with a new 
              plan, we regathered, for a fourth go at Aaryonar. We slaughtered 
              the hatchlings, as fast as possible, and immediately brought Aaryonar 
              to our trap. Our lessons from past deaths had proven invaluable, 
              as we pierced deeper than ever toward the heart of the temple's 
              guardian. Our weapons seemed greased as they dug deep into his flesh. 
              Perhaps he was tired, perhaps we were simply better.... we shall 
              soon find out. But on this night, on our 4th attempt, we slew the 
              mighty beast. We had the temple all but at our disposal for one 
              of it's mightiest defender, the one guarding the main hall, now 
              laid lifeless at our feet, his spoils ready for the taking.</p>

              There was much wine, and much celebration, for we had accomplished 
              what so few before us had. And the spirit of victory forced us to 
              kill a few more before we slept. The drakes behind Aaryonar proved 
              a mighty foe as well, but not too much for us to handle.</p>

              We camped in our beds that night, dreaming of the battles we had 
              one, and of the ones we'd yet to fight. We woke the next day ready 
              for more.</p>
            <p>We cleared the drakes behind Aaryonar's lair. They proved mighty 
              in their own right, and there were many to slay, but they were laid 
              to rest, for Lord Feshlak was in our sites. We do thank them for 
              their rewards.</p>

              We buffed our force and began the trek to Feshlak's lair. We snuck 
              to the side and down to the back, but Feshlak was not to be fooled, 
              and we lost a few friends. We back our force out and set back up. 
              Insulted and perhaps a bit impatient, we charged the beast and began 
              our assault. Swords blazing with the energy of freshly rested bodies, 
              we downed him in minutes, and divided the loot.</p>

              Next was the one they call The Destroyer, Dagarn. We cleared our 
              way to him and lured him in. I'm sure he wondered where his friend 
              Feshlak had gone. But we answered that question in but a few minutes 
              time, and sent the wurm to meet his friend. His loot was a sight 
              for sore casters' eyes.</p>

            <p><br>
              We journeyed on to meet the next Lord of the temple, Kreizenn. We 
              hesitated little at this foe, perhaps full of confidence, but perhap 
              rightfully so. Nonetheless the charge was called, and we slid down 
              into his lair and began our attack. He too offered little resistance 
              and was vanquished in a matter of minutes. His bounty too became 
              ours.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Gratz Budwie and Graytalon on your: Shiny Metallic Gloves</p>
            <p><br>
              Ready for more, we pushed on. It was decided that the watery Lord 
              Koi'Doken would be our next victim. We lured him from his pool, 
              but a bit before we meant to and he downed half of us fast. We started 
              again and got him where we wanted him. Alas, he had brought a friend. 
              We set to slaying his drake friend, and eventually killed him, only 
              to turn around and see that Koi'Doken had exploited the rules of 
              the game, and climbed into the ceiling out of our reach. He slung 
              his claws down and killed us 1 by 1. Running around up there, he 
              managed to coax a few more of his friends into helping him cheat. 
              They wiped us out, to the last man. At the end of it we had to summon 
              our corpses back to the entry of the temple. Beaten, but only by 
              cheating, we left it at that and decided that revenge was a dish 
              better served cold. </p>
            <p>We shall see you again Veeshan, you and your pitiful temple guardians.<br>

              December 2nd - With our chanter away on RL business, we decided 
              to defy logic and see just how far we could make it into the Hole 
              with no crowd control, one cleric and players as low as 42. It was 
              an amazingly sucessful raid, with only 2 deaths in over 3 hours. 
              We made it nearly all the way to the Jaeil the Insane area.</p>
            <p>December 3rd - Another night in the Hole, this time our low player 
              was 35. We made it nearly as far as the previous night, with only 
              3 deaths all night. Grats to Natonorad on the Earhten Blade, and 
              Halof and Slitherfist on Mudman Enforcers. We also had some Loam 
              Encrusted gear drop, and lots of Smoldering Brands.</p>
