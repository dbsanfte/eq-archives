Yeolarn Bronzeleaf says 'Hail, Yumanea! <br>
We of Tunare are charged with protecting the Great Mother from the forces of Innoruuk. Even now, the evil minions of this foul deity are despoiling our great forest. Will you help us [protect the Mother]?
<p>
You say, 'I will protect the Mother'
<p>
Yeolarn Bronzeleaf says 'Just outside the gates of Felwithe, the forces of Innoruuk gather in the guise of decaying skeletons. Bring me four sets of bone chips as proof of your vigilance. I assure you, your faith shall not go unrewarded.
<p>
Give him the bone chips
<p>
Yeolarn Bronzeleaf says 'Praise Tunare! I knew you would be victorious. I reward you with this spell, and pray that it will help you in your fight against the unholy forces of Innoruk. When you are ready you will make a fine [Initiate of Tunare].
<p>
Your faction standing with ClericsofTunare, KingTearisthex and Anti-Mage got better.
<p>
You say, 'What Initiate of Tunare?'
<p>
Yeolarn Bronzeleaf says 'The Teir'Dal behind the undead plague in our forest have discovered a means of creating a terrible undead called a Ghast. These Ghasts have been sighted in the Lesser Faydark and must be destroyed. Bring me four of the vile creatures hearts.
<p>
Give him four Ghast hearts!
<p>
Yeolarn Bronzeleaf says 'I requested four Ghast hearts!
<p>
Yeolarn Bronzeleaf says 'Praise Tunare!! You have done well young Initiate. Here the symbol of your station within our faith. Return to me when you are ready to [slay the necromancer] that has been creating the undead.

<p>
Yeolarn Bronzeleaf says 'The Fier'Dal rangers that inhabit the Lesser Faydark have spotted a courier making deliveries to the Teir'Dal camp near Castle Mistmoore and to a necromancer that lingers near the ancient obelisk. We believe that the crates he carries are supplies needed for the creation of more Ghasts. Another shipment should be arriving soon. Seek out the necromancer at the obelisk and take his head then take the head of the courier and return them to me with the crate that the courier carries and your Initiate Symbol of Tunare.

Bring the two heads and the crate back to Yeolarn.

This is the third Tunare quest. You must do the first two before you can do this one.
<p>
You say 'I am ready to become a Warden of Tunare.
<p>
Yeolarn Bronzeleaf says 'The crate that the you recovered from the Courier contained this black candlestick that radiates an aura of great magical power. I request that you deliver the candlestick to Lady Trilani who is studying with the High Men in Erudin. Perhaps she can divine the nature of the candlestick and offer aid in defeating its power. The remaining contents of the crate have been given to Crusader Swiftmoon to be delivered to a gnome in steamfont that is purchasing them on behalf of the Eldrich Collective. When you return be sure to present your Disciple Symbol to me with anything that Tilani may ask you to deliver.
<p>
Taking the Candlestick to Tilani in the Erudin Palace gives you this...
<p>
Tilani Palrone says 'I sense a great evil power in this candlestick. I will need you to concoct a divinatory aid for me before I can discern more. Take this suspension and brew it in a brew barrel with one white hellebore (dropped by Gnolls in Split Paw or SK), a pouch of the red dust created by the Fire Peak Goblin Wizards, and the caustic substance used by the Dark Offerers in Mayong Mistmoores wicked castle.
<p>
Get the ingredients and brew them and take the result back to Tilani. She will give you Un-animation Powder. Take this powder and your Disciple symbol back to Yeolarn:
<p>
Yeolarn Bronzeleaf says 'Praise Tunare!! I will have our sorcerers examine this power immediately to see if we can reproduce it in quantites enough to eliminate the undead plague. I award you the rank of Warden of Tunare, the All Mother smiles upon you Yumanea !'
<p>
You receive your Warden Symbol.
