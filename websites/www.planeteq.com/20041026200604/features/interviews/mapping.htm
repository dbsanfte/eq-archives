            <p><font size="3">Brewall Rainsinger, a member of the Crimson Talon
                guild on the Cazic Thule server, has been playing his Bard since
                July, 1999,
              and is now level 67+. He
              has
              been making
              in-game
              maps
              longer than that, and started making maps of Norrath at level one!
              I was curious on exactly how those maps get made, so I asked Brewall
              about 
              art of mapping.</font></p>
            <p><em>Kwill</em>:  How did you get started? </p>
            <p><em>Brewall</em>: I&#8217;ve been doing maps in games as long
              as I&#8217;ve
              been playing them. My first computer game was Scott Adam&#8217;s
              Adventure (on cassette) on an Atari 800, and I drew a map of it
              using graph
              paper so I wouldn&#8217;t get lost. Since then, I&#8217;ve done
              dozens of other games from Bard&#8217;s Tale to Wasteland. When
              I was level 1 in EverQuest, someone told me that leaving the city
              was very deadly, so I stayed within the city walls -- literally.
              Foolishly, I leveled from 1 to 8 in the Qeynos Aqueducts, and did
              my first map there using the seams in the walls to make
              the grid. It&#8217;s funny when I think back upon it: no compass,
              pathetic sense<br>
              heading, and no knowledge of locs, but it wasn&#8217;t out of line
            from other games at the time.</p>
            <p><em>Kwill: How do you go about mapping an area or zone? How long
              does it take? What tools do you use? </em></p>
            <p>Brewall: The methods by which I map a zone have changed considerably
              over the years! The Kunark and Luclin era maps I did were all hand
              drawn onto graph paper and then drawn on the computer. To give
              an idea of what this is like, a zone like Katta might span 8-10
              pieces of 8x10 paper just to get the level of detail for which
              you could draw a map on the computer. Outdoor maps were fairly
              easy to map, perhaps an hour (make one run around the zone to get
              max coordinates, make graph sheets up, then start the mapping at
              detail), indoor maps took considerably more time, perhaps five
              or more hours. Once it was drawn out on graph paper, I would spend
              an hour or two on the computer drawing it up using simple graphics
              programs. Jagged Pine forest was the last of the graph paper maps,
              and it spanned over 20 pieces of paper to get that level of detail!              </p>
            <p>With LoY [Legacy of Ykesha expansion], I wrote an Excel macro
              that would translate /locs, /say startline, /say stopline, and
              /say
              note to
              create a
              grid and
              draw
              a map for me. It is actually pretty sophisticated and I can give
              it a lot of setup information on how I want the map drawn, such
              as line widths, color, grid dimensions,
              etc. I used this to create Nedaria&#8217;s Landing and all of the
              LoY maps. When the mapping system was introduced, I rewrote the
              code to use the EQ map files. I take the output of the macro, clean,
              color, add other information, and then save it as a GIF for size.
              Generally, if the map file is clean, creating a final map takes
              about an hour. </p>
            <p><em>Kwill: Do you go to all the zones yourself to make the maps?</em></p>
            <p>Brewall: I make it a point to map all the zones myself
              and I love to explore every corner of every zone. I feel sorry
              for the people that level their way up as quickly as possible
              and miss out on the vastness of<br>
              the game. Some of the best zones are ones where there is a real
              atmosphere, like Mistmoore, where there are living quarters, kitchens,
              piano rooms, alchemy areas, gardens, and libraries. I love zones
              where you are wondering what lies ahead; versus LDoN [Lost Dungeons
              of Norrath expansion], where everything looked pretty much the
              same and unrealistic from
              what
              an army of
              monsters would need on a day-to-day basis. Some of the new GoD
              zones are pretty neat looking, but my favorites are the ones in
            true castle or dungeon motif.</p>
            <p><em>Kwill: How does your character class help you? </em></p>
            <p>Brewall: Bards definitely have an arsenal of tools at their disposal
              for mapping, and I certainly take advantage of them. Bard speed
              is probably the most obvious advantage, but other basic ones are
              invisibility, levitation (boots), eye of zomm (helmet), and bind
              sight (song). In difficult areas, I usually have to dig deeper
              and use faction (song), illusions, sneak/hide, mez/charm, gate
              a mob,
              and fading memories (lose all agro). With red con mobs,
              I&#8217;ve used bard divine
              aura song to map the room, exited the room, and then used fading
              memories. Many times, just when I think I am stuck, I figure out
              a way to map it. I keep a stack of invis undead potions, sow potions,
              and a few other things at the ready. Perhaps the only disappointing
              bardic tool is picklock, because bards are capped so low and I
              get stuck in some green-con mob dungeon.</p>
            <p><em>Kwill: Does anyone else go out and explore zones for you or
              help you with your maps? </em></p>
            <p>Brewall: Virtually all of my maps are done solo, if anyone was
              to accompany me, they would probably find it pretty boring watching
              me crawl
              the highest points on the walls around the edge of a zone. Or,
              when I was doing it the paper method, waiting while I labeled the
              grids on new sheets of paper. Occasionally, on raids to more difficult
              zones I will
              wander off to the walls and clean up maps that I think
              are too sloppy or are missing something, but as long as everyone
              gets their fix of AE mana song, no one seems to mind.</p>
            <p><em>Kwill: How many maps have you made? </em></p>
            <p>Brewall: I&#8217;ve published 19 maps to the internet, another
              10 unreleased (guild-only) maps, and another 20-30 partial maps
              prior
              to finding
              a better one on the internet. Today, it seems that as soon as an
              expansion comes out you can find zone maps the next day, versus
              the weeks or months as was the case with Kunark and Luclin.</p>
            <p><em>Kwill: Do you look at other people's maps?</em></p>
            <p>Brewall: There are a lot of great map makers out there. I have
              an enormous amount of respect for the maps on EQAtlas, the detail,
              accuracy, and artistry are fantastic. I also consult a number of
              other map makers including Saeny Rangerheart and Draelon Stormsong.
              The one thing I will say for myself is that I have been doing them
              for a long time and a lot of other mapmakers have come and gone.
              For my maps, I always focus on the things I feel are critical for
              people to have: gridlines, coordinates (especially the 0 lines),
              easy printability, and all key features labeled (zi/zo/mobs/etc).
              I&#8217;ve looked at the official SOE map book at the store, but
              it paled in comparison to the three-ring binder of &#8220;best-of&#8221; maps
              that I keep.</p>
            <p><em>An example of Brewall's mapping skills -- map of Plane of Knowledge</em></p>
            <p><img src="PoK.jpg" width="650" height="721"></p>            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><em>Kwill: How much time do you spend mapping, say in a week or
            month?</em> </p>            <p>Brewall: I tend to do most mapping when expansions come
              out. But with the new mapping tool, the need for mapping has really
              dwindled.
              With
              the immediate availability on the internet, I now tend to explore
              and label versus the actual mapping and drawing. There are a lot
              of electronic maps of GoD [Gates of Discord expansion] out there,
              but I haven&#8217;t
              seen any drawings yet; there is just something about a real map
              versus
              an
              electronic one.
              If some don&#8217;t come out soon, I&#8217;ll probably break down
            and do some.</p>
            <p><em>Kwill: What is your best map, in your opinion?</em></p>
            <p>Brewall: The EverQuest World map is probably the best one I&#8217;ve
              done so far. It took an enormous amount of time just trying to
              lay out
              all the zones, accurately determine all the connections, and ports.
              Then to do the small thumbs of all the outdoor zones (and redo
              the layout). Personally, I print this map out on a plotter 4x4
              and post it on the wall near
              my computer. Not that I need it, but it is just fun to see how
              big and complex the world of EverQuest really is! It will be a
              long time before another game has this much real estate.</p>
            <p>An actual
                zone map that I consider my best would likely be the Temple of
              Veeshan. Now that Crimson<br>
              Talon is allied with the dragons since we killed the Shade and
              are working on Veeshan Peak quests, I will release this map to
              the
              general public. It is a single map of the entire zone that shows
              all mobs, named mobs with resist needed, and other information.
              It took a lot of time to develop, compile, and accurately draw.</p>
            <p><em>Kwill: Is this just a hobby, or are you a map-maker in
              real life as well? </em></p>
            <p>Brewall: Just a hobby, although I would probably be doing it in
              any game I was playing. The closest thing in real life is that
              I am
              the
              person everyone hands the maps to when I get in the car.</p>
            <p><em>Kwill: What do you enjoy about making maps? </em></p>
            <p>Brewall: I think it is helping other people that do not have an
              innate sense of direction or is new to the game and do not know
              where
              a zone is.</p>
            <p><em>Kwill: What is most difficult about making maps? Were any
              areas or zones particularly hard? </em></p>
            <p><em>Brewall</em>: It has gotten much easier than it used to be! When Kunark
              was released, I remember making maps of the Mines of Nurga and
              the Temple of Droga. The Mines were a snap, but I really got burned
              on ToD. Typically when I map, I do a rule where I put my right
              hand on right wall and follow it until, eventually, I find the
              exit. Well, let&#8217;s just say that was a bad rule in this dungeon
              because after I fell down the in entrance area, it took me over
              20 pieces of graph paper and over 20 hours to find my way out,
              and by then, I had mapped the entire dungeon! It was a very harrowing
              and exhilarating time when I finally emerged. </p>
            <p><em>Kwill: Do you have any funny or interesting stories aboutmap
            making? </em></p>
            <p>Brewall: When I was finally level 8 I went to Qeynos Hills to
              hunt. I was amazed at the outdoors and decided to see how big the
              world was. I was afraid of things attacking me, so I stayed to
              the sides, and ran up the west wall, ran to Jagged
              Pine, ran back out, fell through the world, and landed safely on
              the road on the south side of the zone. I thought is was odd, and
              ran all the way back north and accidentally fell through the world
              twice more! Years later, with the Direct X patch, I found myself
              back in the zone and realized I had an incomplete map of the zone.
              No problem, I thought, I&#8217;ll fill in the missing parts, I
              started the map tools, and promptly fell through the same hole
              in the world
              I fell through 57 levels earlier. Worse yet, I mistakenly fell
              through the hole twice more trying to find the exact loc of it!
              This time,
              I knew how to /bug
              and reported it.</p>
            <p><em>Kwill: What is the URL for people to get your maps? Are they
              free to the public? </em></p>
            <p>Brewall: All the maps I issue to the public are free and can be
              found on the Crimson Talon guild website at <a href="http://www.crimsontalon.org" target="_top">www.crimsontalon.org</a>.
              There is a menu option on the left side called &#8220;Brewall&#8217;s
                Maps&#8221;. Typically, I release maps to the guild for a few
                weeks prior to releasing them to the general public. The guild
                also has access to some special maps the general public does
                not have access to.</p>
