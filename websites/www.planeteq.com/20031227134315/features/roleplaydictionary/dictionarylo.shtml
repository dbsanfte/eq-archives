            <p>My friends, I write to you with earnest hand of the information 
              I have collected from scholars scattered over the four corners of 
              the land. Much work by many wise and brave souls has gone into the 
              gathering of lore and artifacts to uncover the history of Norrath 
              and the peoples who live there. I hope my humble effort will advance 
              the knowledge of all peoples, to bring peace and prosperity to all 
              the races that must live together in our fair world. <br>

            <b>Lake of Ill Omen</b><br>
            The Lake of Ill Omen on the continet of Kunark is the ancient site 
            of the city of Varnek, which was cursed ages ago and has since sank 
            beneath the waters, giving the local area its name. The reptilian 
            sarnak have moved into the area and have secured an ancient fortress 
            to the southwest. The goblins have established a mine in the hills 
            in north of the lake. The Brood of Kotiz has taken it upon themselves 
            to eradicate the sarnak from the area, and have directed their trainees 
            to do so. Bloodgill goblins, sabretooth cats, Iksar brigands, barracudas, 
            and undead can be found in and around the lake's shores. 
            <p><b>Lake Rathetear</b><br>
              Lake Rathetear, a huge lake with many islands, is home to aviaks, 
              goblins, ogres, bandits, barbarians, gypsies, gnolls, and the occasional 
              hermit. The strange blue flame can be found on one of the islands 
              guarded by aviaks. Sometimes Princess Lenya Thex, who has been turned 
              into a royal fish, and the froglock prince Kyrmt Keroppi can be 
              found here. (EQ Atlas)</p>

			<b>Lanys T`Vyl </b><br>
              A Dark Elf avatar of Innoruk and arch enemy of Firiona Vie. She 
              is known as the &quot;Child of Hate.&quot; She has instigated many 
              wars and evil deeds.</p>
            <p>The Moon of Blood is the most holy night for Innoruuk's followers, 
              and occurs once every twenty-seven months. On this heinous night 
              every follower of Innoruuk must murder a good being to honor his 
              or her god. The dark elves have their own tradition on this night 
              as well. The nobles choose a commoner to mate with and then sacrifice 
              to their dark god.</p>
            <p>Nearly three score years ago, Vendela G`Kal, a high priestess of 
              Innoruuk, attended the Festival of the Moon of Blood in the Neriak 
              commons. As the festival progressed, she noticed an exceptionally 
              fine looking common male in the throng. The high priestess bade 
              him be her sacrifice to Innoruuk. She led him to her inner sanctum, 
              where they copulated throughout the night. Spent, she fell into 
              a deep sleep. When she awoke, the dark elf was gone. One year later, 
              she gave birth. </p>
            <p>The child born from this encounter showed remarkable abilities 
              beyond that which any ordinary Teir`Dal possessed. Many saw this 
              and tried to end her life, fearing her power and abilities. On the 
              first such attempt, an ancient shadow knight saw the three would-be 
              assassins and slew them as they made their attempt upon the Child 
              of Innoruuk. After the battle, Innoruuk appeared before the Shadow 
              Knight and assigned the Shadow Knight as teacher and protector of 
              the Child, giving him a new and younger body as well. Under his 
              tutelage, the child grew strong in both the art of combat and in 
              the dark magics of Necromancy. She is now stands ready to bring 
              hate across all of Norrath.</p>
            <p>Lanys T`Vyl is the Child of Hate. She is the embodiment of Hate, 
              and carries herself with a deadly grace. Any who oppose her are 
              subject to her unforgiving wrath, and those that follow her are 
              promised glory. She is very loyal to those that follow her, as she 
              cherishes her father's creations and looks upon them as her own, 
              but mercy be felt for those Teir`Dal who would betray her, for their 
              torments shall be everlasting. The Crimson Teir</p>
            <p>Innoruuk, God of Hate, created the dark elves by kidnapping the 
              king and queen of the elves, who were created by Tunare, and twisting 
              them to his own image. The result was a cruel subterranean dark-skinned 
              race. The dark elves are the means through which Innoruuk plots 
              to destroy the races of Tunare, Prexus, and Brell Serilis who made 
              a pact to populate Norrath wit h the races they created. Innoruuk 
              especially despises the elves and dwarves.</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><i>The Crimson Tier</i><br>
                It is said that in the past, Innoruuk had a group of chosen Teir'Dal 
                followers he employed to spread hate across the face of Norrath. 
                These chosen were known as The Crimson Teir. Only the highest 
                and most decorated followers of Innoruuk were chose to hold these 
                positions. To each he entrusted a piece of armor that they were 
                bound to, in life and in unlife. These relics allowed them to 
                channel some of Innoruuk's power, and with their aid they sowed 
                suffering and hate across the world. Though this pleased the Prince 
                of Hate, he had ulterior motives, for he was already planning 
                the coming of his Child.</p>
              <p>This armor, though it granted the owner incredible power, that 
                power came at a terrible price. Each piece was bound to the soul 
                of the owner, and slowly drained away the life essence of the 
                possessor. These spiritually desiccated creatures would eventually 
                serve as the tests he would pit his child against. The now physically 
                ruined and mentally corrupted Crimson Teir can no longer comprehend 
                their roles in the glory of their wicked master, Innoruuk. They 
                know only bedlam in a hollow and endless existence of unlife.</p>
              <p>Acting on the advice of her teacher, Laarthik K'Shin, Lanys T'Vyl 
                sets forth to reclaim the pieces of armor from the Crimson Teir, 
                now scattered across the world. Her first test brings her to the 
                old Teir'Dal city of Befallen to obtain the Abhorrent Bracers 
                of Darkness. The following is a missive sent to Neriak by Laarthik 
                K'Shin:</p>
              <p>The night began with a gathering of the Teir'Dal outside Neriak. 
                They knew Lanys would appear, as it was her custom to do so at 
                that hour. She was expected. I, however, was not. My arrival helped 
                to unite the servants of Hate and defeat the heathens, which had 
                dared to venture into Nektulos. I was allowed to speak from the 
                Great Rock, what we now call the Pulpit; I addressed those assembled 
                with the following words:</p>
              <p>&quot;From the time of my birth, in the age of the lost, I have 
                seen our people divided by what has created us. I am an old, old 
                man, given life anew by our Prince of Hate, and I was bade to 
                teach young Lanys, the Daughter. This is now the time we join 
                to change the face of Tunaria, what you know as Antonica. The 
                children of the weaker gods have been catered to and protected 
                long enough! It is time for us to show our unified power! United, 
                we shall make our name known that its merest utterance shall inspire 
                unbridled terror. We shall stain the lands with heathen blood 
                as a tribute to our Prince. Tonight begins the ascension of Lanys 
                T'vyl!&quot;</p>
              <p>Throughout my speech, many of the enraptured slashed themselves, 
                spilling their blood upon the ground as personal offerings. With 
                the arrival of Lanys T'Vyl, war chants and songs of praise rose 
                throughout the crowd. A palpable energy seemed to flow from them, 
                prickling my skin. What a joyous time for the Teir'Dal, one that 
                shall not soon be forgotten. Now was the time to harness the rising 
                tide of passion and hate, and direct it toward our goal. &quot;We 
                shall march on the Commonlands,&quot; I shouted, &quot;and greet 
                the first of the Crimson Teir. Young Lanys has determined their 
                weakest link through her deep meditations, and tonight, we sever 
                that link! Who will join in escorting the Child of Innoruuk to 
                our common destiny?&quot;</p>
              <p>We began our march on the Commonlands. There was one dissenter 
                who decided to declare his own war at this time, trying to divide 
                us. &quot;The Crimson Teir have aligned themselves with the Freeport 
                Shadowknights, and they are amassing a force outside the city!&quot; 
                We continued on to the Commonlands, however, not to be diverted 
                from our goal. Upon entering the Commonlands, Lanys pointed, and 
                spoke in dark-speech so all could hear, &quot;We go to the western 
                portion of the Commonlands.&quot;</p>
              <p>Defending the Daughter became a task, as many Kodiaks patrolled 
                where we walked, but my sword arm never faltered. At last we reached 
                the entrance to the lost city Befallen. The futile attempts on 
                the life of the Daughter by paladins, druids and bards there grew 
                tiresome. A druid in wolf-form brought a group of hill giants 
                to attack, but knowing Innoruuk guided me that night, we were 
                victorious over them. While we awaited the last of our army to 
                reassemble, I shared a tale of our first encounter with the barbarians 
                in their frigid land. Soon, it was time to mount our offensive. 
              </p>
              <p>Within Befallen, many light-dwellers employed the Guise of the 
                Deceiver against us, but we saw through the glamour easily. The 
                offending bard, enchanter and wizard were set upon by the throng 
                and quickly dispatched. We raged through the lost city to the 
                third level, where we finally engaged Jerak T'Shir. </p>
              <p>The battle lasted nearly twenty minutes. Many of the undead in 
                that place joined in the fray, assisting their own against us. 
                Lanys was badly injured, and I was unable to heal my student. 
                However, there in the midst of the chaos, one of our own brave 
                clerics healed the Daughter, pledging to protect her. It was an 
                inspiring sight! The knight fell, and his Bracer latched onto 
                Lanys as the new owner. She smiled grimly, then bowed her head 
                in prayer. I took this opportunity to reward the fallen knight's 
                barbed leg plates to the young cleric, promising that in time, 
                she, too, would have a teacher, one that would show her just what 
                her fate as a Daughter would be. Lanys saw fit to take the coin 
                from me and give it to a young dark one. Methinks she fancied 
                him, but perhaps I will see him on the sacrificial table before 
                her work is done. I leave you with this tale of the battle, and 
                return to my duties as Teacher. --Laarthik K'Shin</p>
              <p>Several days after recovering the bracers of darkness, Laarthik 
                K'Shin again appears in Nektulos Forest. He tells those of the 
                faithful that the time of Lanys T'Vyl's second trial is at hand. 
                This one he feels will be especially hard, there's no telling 
                what is in store when you enter the lair of Najena.</p>
              <p>Laarthik gathers a group of those faithful to Innoruuk. Lanys 
                appears, speaking to her followers in a cold, heartless manner. 
                The party, afraid of the power that she possesses, remains quiet 
                in a bowing stance before the Child of Hate. Lanys, Laarthik and 
                the faithful dark elves journeyed to Najena to face yet another 
                of the Crimson Teir'Dal.</p>
              <p>After passing through Lavastorm Mountains, they make their way 
                to the Najena's dungeon. In the depths of this dark fortress, 
                Lanys and her followers find Tovin D`Rin, the second Crimson Teir`Dal. 
                This skeletal magician is protected by Agony and Strife; his roguish 
                imp pets that Najena helped him create long ago. They are probably 
                the most powerful creations the twisted Najena has ever created. 
                Agony and Strife are linked to Tovin in such a way that he cannot 
                be harmed while these pets remain alive. Lanys and her party fiercely 
                slay Agony and Strife, leaving Tovin D`Rin open for attack. Tovin 
                begins to panic and shouts &quot;Mortal... NO! Agony and Strife 
                have departed me. I am mortal again!&quot; Lanys and her followers 
                begin their attack on him weakening him with each hit. Once Tovin 
                has been defeated, Lanys finds herself in possession of the Abhorrent 
                Boots of Darkness. For his assistance with the battle, Laarthik 
                rewards the most devout warrior of the party with his blackened 
                iron bastard sword. Lanys and Laarthik then return to Neriak. 
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Through magic, The Crimson Teir is bound. Through hate, 
                The Crimson Teir is strong. Through age, The Crimson Teir is wise. 
                Feeling the connection sever between their members, they flee 
                to the far corners of the lands, in futile hope that they will 
                be forgotten. If it were only so simple...&quot; In his dreams, 
                Laarthik sees visions in pairs: fire and stone, primitives and 
                gnomes, and two faces marked in red. He awakes with a start, immediately 
                knowing where next his path leads. Laarthik K`Shin quickly confronts 
                the dwellers of Neriak, the children of Innoruuk. He warns them 
                of the difficult tasks that awaits Innoruuk's chosen child. As 
                he explains to them the journey they must take, Lanys T`Vyl appears 
                before them in her usual powerful and threatening fashion.</p>
              <p>The adventurers make haste to Solusek's Eye where the last of 
                the Crimson Teir awaits. Upon entering Lavastorm Mountains, Lanys 
                is attacked by a high elven assassin. He fears her power over 
                the dark elven nation and what she might bring upon Norrath. He 
                is no match for Lanys and her followers, however.</p>
              <p>Deep in the tunnels of Solusek's Eye, Enchantress Mydraa K`syk 
                and the thief Talia K`syk make a hopeless effort to flee the coming 
                of Innoruuk's chosen child, for they know that with each member 
                of the Crimson Teir that falls, Lanys grows in power. Realizing 
                that they will not be able to escape quickly enough, they charm 
                four inhabitants of the caverns to defend them. These Stolen Clockwork 
                XDCV units are formidable warriors, but provide only a small amount 
                of protection against the Child of Hate.</p>
              <p>Upon reaching the Crimson Teir, Lanys's followers engage the 
                guardians. Many of them perish. &quot;Defeat them!&quot; Laarthik 
                K`Shin shouts. &quot;We must defeat them for the Child of Hate!&quot; 
                As the last of the Crimson Teir falls, the last pieces of the 
                Abhorrent Armor of Darkness affix themselves to Lanys. At that 
                moment, a circle of flame surrounds her, and she is rocked by 
                waves of violent power. Lanys T`Vyl becomes the true child of 
                darkness and hate. </p>
              <p><i>The Search for Lanys T'Vyl</i><br>
                After the events of Bloody Kithicor, the Teir`Dal were left without 
                answers as to what happened to Lanys T`Vyl. The King and Queen 
                of the dark elves charged Vizier D`Kalz, a priest of great power, 
                with the task of finding the answers to their many questions.</p>
              <p>Vizier D`Kalz calls a gathering at the skeleton stone in Nektulos 
                Forest for all to witness the summoning of Laarthik K`Shin's spirit. 
                The summoning is successful and Laarthik comes forward in a ghostly 
                form. He tells them the story of Bloody Kithicor from his perspective, 
                how his invocation to the mysterious stone opened a portal to 
                the plane of Hate, through which Innoruuk snatched Lanys to save 
                her. Tunare used the opening of the portal to her advantage as 
                well, banishing Lanys's corporeal form from Norrath. </p>
              <p>Laarthik also explains to them about the act of shifting spirits. 
                Being an elder Shadowknight and a practitioner of the dark magics, 
                he knows that spirit shifting is indeed possible. He speaks of 
                a Gnome necromancer named Falrazim Zaftamor that has done this. 
                He tells them the story of this powerful gnome.</p>
              <p>&quot;Falrazim has successfully spirit shifted into the body 
                of a drake to prolong his fading physical life. In the form of 
                a drake, Falrazim's has found that the dragon magic is completely 
                different from the arts of necromancy, and only those born a dragon 
                can comprehend its usage. Unfortunately for Falrazim, the gestures 
                and incantations necessary to the practice of necromancy are impossible 
                in drake form. He struck a deal with Meldrath, where Meldrath 
                would help change Falrazim back into a Gnome if Falrazim first 
                helps him complete several tasks. However, Meldrath's tasks have 
                lasted for over 300 years, and Falrazim is growing very restless. 
                He now seeks an alternative to Meldrath's help.&quot;</p>
              <p>Laarthik informs them that they can find Falrazim within the 
                Steamfont Mountains. He is needed for his knowledge to bring Lanys 
                back to Norrath, and should not be harmed. Vizier D`Kalz sends 
                a party accompanied by Dolis Sha`vlal, a revered Shadowknight 
                and survivor of the Battle of Bloody Kithicor, to Steamfont to 
                speak with Falrazim. </p>
              <p>In Steamfont Mountains, Falrazim Zaftamor is approached by Dolis 
                Sha`vlal and the others. After hearing of what happened, Falrazim 
                agrees to help them under one condition. They are to find him 
                a new host as well, and use the stone to transfer his spirit into 
                it. Falrazim would never be so eager to help anyone or admit to 
                such weaknesses, however he is in quite an odd situation and has 
                been for the past 300 years.</p>
              <p>Falrazim gives a note with the spell needed to seize the spirit 
                and place it within the stone, and gives the stone itself to the 
                highest-powered necromancer in the party. Dolis Sha`vlal and the 
                party return to Neriak to get further orders from Vizier D`Kalz. 
                Falrazim waits in Steamfont for their return.</p>
              <p>Back in Neriak, they tell Vizier D`Kalz of what they have learned 
                and inform him that they need two hosts. Vizier D`Kalz sends them 
                to the Plane of Hate to capture the soul of Lanys T`Vyl and bring 
                it back to Norrath.</p>
              <p>Upon entering the Plane of Hate, they search for Lanys. Once 
                they find her, a brief interaction ensues and the necromancer 
                mutters the words. &quot;Vethau N`Vac Reithos&quot; he chants 
                repeatedly as the other members of the party join in&#133;.&quot;Vethau 
                N`Vac Reithos&quot; &#133;&quot;Vethau N`Vac Reithos&quot; &#133;&quot;Vethau 
                N`Vac Reithos&quot; &#133;Lanys's form collapses and her soul 
                flows in a blood red stream of light, shot through with bolts 
                of blue, into Falrazim's stone. Dolis Sha`vlal kneels next to 
                Lanys's inert body and removes the pieces of her Abhorrent Armor 
                of Darkness.</p>
              <p>After returning to Steamfont, the party sees that Vizier D`Kalz 
                and Falrazim Zaftamor are awaiting their arrival. The two hosts, 
                stripped of their souls, lie upon the ground with blank faces. 
                Falrazim gives the necromancer a note containing more text that 
                must be read for the ritual to take place. The necromancer begins 
                to chant, &quot;Ver mitra tec piof... Ver ir ostryl... Ver N'Vac.... 
                Ver tev'Ve.&quot; The others begin to chant as well. &#133; &quot;Ver 
                mitra tec piof... Ver ir ostryl... Ver N'Vac.... Ver tev'Ve&quot;&#133;&quot;Ver 
                mitra tec piof... Ver ir ostryl... Ver N'Vac.... Ver tev'Ve&quot; 
                &#133;&quot;Ver mitra tec piof... Ver ir ostryl... Ver N'Vac.... 
                Ver tev'Ve&quot; &#133; Dolis Sha`vlal lays the Abhorrent Armor 
                of Darkness onto the ground next to the bodies. As the Child of 
                Hate's soul seeps from the stone, traveling to the host, the pieces 
                of armor attach themselves to the body. Falrazim's soul, in turn, 
                is pulled into the stone and is transferred to the gnome body. 
                Thus, the Child of Hate returns to Norrath.</p>

              <p>Firiona Vie, Thubr Axebringer, and Sionachie reunited with their 
                friend from long ago, Lorisyn Oakwynd. They also received the 
                wonderful news of Lorisyn's twin sister, Lyirae Oakwynd. They 
                all took in the celebration of the Faydark, rejoicing in their 
                reunion.</p>
              <p>As the afternoon became the evening and the sun began to set 
                in the purple silvan sky, long shadows were cast by the mammoth 
                trees of the forest. The King took his leave for the evening. 
                Raising his glass into the air and he nodded solemnly to the crowd. 
                In a loud, regal voice, he said, &quot;To you, I raise my glass. 
                May your blades prove strong, your bows aim true, your hearts 
                remain pure and The Mother, may she bless you with every year 
                being twice as good as the past. To old friends&#133;&quot; </p>
              <p>The King smiled to Firiona, raising his glass to her and her 
                comrades. &quot;And to old ones, may they remain true to their 
                worth, and sharp with their tongues.&quot; Tipping his head back 
                the King raised the glass to his lips and in one swift gulp finished 
                the wine, his elegant stature remaining unchanged. The regal elf 
                tossed the glass, shattering it on the ground at his feet. As 
                the glass broke, the crowd did the same. The sound of shattering 
                glass echoed under a blanket of cheers. The revelry continued 
                long after the king made his exit. </p>
              <p>Suddenly, lightning split the sky and struck the grass-carpeted 
                floor of the forest. Two shadowy figures appeared between the 
                four spires in the center of the ancient ruins from the Combine 
                era and made their way quickly and silently through the forest, 
                toward the sounds of the celebration.</p>
              <p>A large pasty-skinned ogre with square, chiseled features rose 
                up from his hiding place, a crevasse between the gates of Felwithe 
                and the hill the city is built upon. Firiona, her companions and 
                the throngs of revelers took no notice of the Orc as he hefted 
                an enormous boulder above his head. Ghargin Bumblok's face twisted 
                with disgust as he hurled the boulder toward Lorisyn shouting, 
                &quot;Small elf, you die today under the rocks of Ghargin!&quot; 
                Lorisyn Oakwynd was knocked forward as the boulder struck him, 
                his shoulder dislocating as he fell to the ground. The music of 
                the bards squeaked to a halt as a piercing scream echoed throughout 
                the Faydark. The sounds of merriment ended abruptly as all stared 
                upon Lorisyn in dismay.</p>
              <p>A female dark elven woman stepped forth from behind the crowd, 
                her deep blue skin obscuring her from plain view in the twilight. 
                Her ornate cape of blue and red flowed behind, and her hands began 
                to glow with an eerie, pale light. A troll towered behind her. 
                Unlike most of his race, this troll's eyes shone with a wicked 
                sort of intelligence that stood in stark contrast to the usual 
                Trollish stereotype. The woman was Vahlai Ka`Izal. She bellowed, 
                &quot;Lorisyn Oakwynd! Your day has come. Rogkasth, Ghargin&#133; 
                kill him&#133; And his friends should they interfere.&quot; Turning 
                her hate filled eyes toward Firiona, she added, &quot;If the wench 
                assists, leave her to me.&quot;</p>
              <p>&quot;Aaaaaaaarrrrrgh!&quot; The troll Rogkasth let loose a ferocious 
                battle cry. The enormous green skinned brute darted from the Teir`Dal's 
                side. Charging into the crowd of people near the fallen elf, his 
                weapons held high, he waded easily through the throng, toppling 
                any whom would stand in his way. Pushing aside everything in his 
                path, he plowed and bashed his way through the crowd ignoring 
                the blows and small cuts he received in the process. Those strikes 
                true enough to pierce his dingy plate armor and wound him were 
                quickly healed, leaving nothing more then a hard wart-like growth 
                and scar tissue behind thanks to natural regenerative properties 
                of the Trollish race. It was clear that Rogkasth wanted to make 
                his way to the critically wounded Lorisyn Oakwynd. His twin sister 
                Lyirae cried out, &quot;Nooo! Somebody stop them!&quot; Her voice 
                shook with fear, &quot;Lorisyn!&quot;</p>
              <p>Vahlai raised her hands slowly as they pulsed with blinding light 
                blue energy. Facing the palms of her hands toward each other and 
                then moving as quickly as a viper, she swung both hands downward, 
                crouching as she did, releasing the energy toward Firiona.</p>
              <p>Firiona was struck with the force of a thousand blizzards. Her 
                whole body numbed and stinging, she dropped to one knee under 
                the force of the blow. The now frozen grass shattered like crystal 
                under her knee. Rising to her feet again, she ran toward Vahlai. 
                Her legs were so numb, she could scarcely tell if they were still 
                attached. She shot a quick glance at her sword to be sure it was 
                still in her hand, as her arms had little feeling as well. As 
                she ran, she noticed the Teir`Dal's hand held out, palm down, 
                at her side. Energy of an orange-yellow color rose from the ground.</p>
              <p>A crowd surrounded Ghargin Bumblok, the Ogre who scored the first 
                crippling blow to Lorisyn. Despite his enormous strength, the 
                Ogre was unable to get any closer to Lorisyn. Rogkasth, on the 
                other hand, was making headway through the throngs. Breaking through 
                the final line of resistance, he looked Lorisyn directly in the 
                eye. Lorisyn stared back bravely despite the weight of the malevolent 
                gaze of the troll. Pulling forth another boulder, the troll raised 
                it above his head.</p>
              <p>Firiona closed the distance between she and the Teir`Dal quickly 
                but before she was able to get within swords reach of her, Vahlai 
                swept her glowing orange hands forward toward Tunare's chosen. 
                This time, Firiona was engulfed in flame. Her extremities, which 
                had only a moment ago had begun to regain feeling, felt as if 
                they were pierced with glowing hot needles. Fighting back against 
                the pain, she raised her sword high and brought it down onto the 
                body of the Dark Elf. The sword bounced back off the Vahlai's 
                skin, the vibration causing the tormented nerves in Firiona's 
                hands to scream out at her in protest. Ignoring their cries, she 
                continued her attack against the dark elf determined to break 
                her way through the wizard's magical protection.</p>
              <p>The final stone fell from the murderous hands of the troll Rogkasth 
                onto the body of Lorisyn with a sickening crunch. A death cry 
                issued forth from Lorisyn's lips, his head turning awkwardly to 
                one side and blood streaming from his mouth. Rogkasth stood, his 
                arms hanging limply toward the ground from the throw of his final 
                boulder. The sea of angry festival attendees grew silent for just 
                a moment.</p>
              <p>Noticing Rogkasth's success, Vahlai Ka`Izal shouted, &quot;It 
                is done! Rogkasth, Ghargin, come now! Firiona Vie, do not think 
                this is the last you will see of us.&quot; With amazing speed, 
                the three broke loose of the crowds each running in a different 
                direction. Some folks ran in pursuit but despite their best efforts, 
                the three were quickly lost in the darkened forest.</p>
              <p>Lyirae Oakwynd, her face paled, her mouth agape and eyes dull 
                with shock said, &quot;Lorisyn?&quot; Shaking herself, she moved 
                quickly through the crowd to her fallen brother's side.</p>
              <p>Turning her head toward the sky, she cried out, &quot;No! Oh 
                please&#133; no no no!&quot; Cradling the head of her brother 
                in her arms she whispered, &quot;Lorisyn&#133; please don't&#133; 
                Please&#133; dear dear Tunare, please do not let this&#133; Lorisyn?&quot;</p>
              <p>Firiona Vie walked somberly over to the elf, hunched over the 
                body of Lorisyn. Seeing the elf gently cradling the body in her 
                arms, Firiona stopped, her expression growing grim as she realized 
                the truth. Lyirae lowered her head as she turned the body over 
                in her lap, cradling his head in her arms. &quot;Lorisyn&#133; 
                please. They are gone now&#133; you can stop pretending. They 
                have left. Lorisyn&#133; you can stop pretending&#133; please&#133;&quot; 
                She began to tremble as she ran her fingers through Lorisyn's 
                sweat-drenched hair. Closing her eyes, she clenched her fist in 
                his hair. She screamed, &quot;LORISYN! No, please&#133; Dear sweet 
                Mother, no&#133; Lorisyn,&quot; her voice trailed off into a whisper 
                again. Firiona Vie raised her hand to her eyes and wiping the 
                tears away she went to Lyirae's side, placing her hand upon her 
                shoulder. &quot;I am sorry, Lyirae&#133;&quot;</p>
              <p>Lyirae Oakwynd turned swiftly, throwing Firiona's hand away from 
                her shoulder. &quot;You? YOU are sorry? He died for you&#133; 
                he DIED for you, Firiona Vie, and all you can say is that you 
                are sorry?&quot; </p>
              <p>Regaining some composure, Lyirae Oakwynd turned her glare from 
                Firiona, lowering her head to the twisted corpse of her brother. 
                &quot;Forgive me, milady. I have not the right to blame you,&quot; 
                she said as she wiped the tears from her eyes. &quot;Why? What 
                reason did they have? That is all I wish to know. They called 
                your name, milady. Why did they target him?&quot;</p>
              <p>Firiona Vie raised her hand to her face and wiping the tears 
                away once more said, &quot;I am sorry, Lyirae, but I have not 
                the answer for the question you ask me. I know that you need an 
                answer and the truth is that I can not provide that to you. I 
                am sorry for this, Lyirae. I am sorry for his death&#133;&quot;</p>
              <p>Looking up at Firiona once again, Lyirae asked, &quot;Who were 
                they, Firiona?&quot;</p>
              <p>&quot;They have been enemies of ours for&#133; How long, I can 
                not say.&quot;</p>
              <p>A gentle breeze swept through the forest. The leaves of the trees 
                danced softly on the wind. Rushing quickly through the crowd, 
                the strange zephyr slowed as it found the circle around the corpse 
                of the elf. Softly washing over the elven woman kneeling at its 
                side, the wind then faded leaving the forest deathly quiet once 
                more. </p>
              <p>It has been said that the wind carried the spirit of Lorisyn. 
                That the wind spoke to Lyirae, strengthening her and urging her 
                to take her his place at Firiona's side. Whatever was the case, 
                the young and frail Wood Elf was never the same from that moment 
                forward and indeed began to become strong and brave, as was her 
                brother.</p>
              <p>Lyirae Oakwynd, reached over and gently took the bow from her 
                brother's hand. Holding Rain Caller in her now steadied grip, 
                she raised her head to Firiona. &quot;I will accompany you to 
                wherever it is you go, milady. It is his wish.&quot;</p>
              <p>Firiona Vie closed her eyes, tilting her head to the side as 
                if straining to hear a voice. She lowered her head, slowly opening 
                her eyes and locked them with those of Lyirae. &quot;Are you sure 
                you are ready to venture with us, Lyirae?&quot;</p>
              <p>Resolved, Lyirae answered, &quot;Yes, Firiona. I know nothing 
                of your future, but I am ready to face that with you nonetheless. 
                My brother's efforts will not go wasted&#133; not like this.&quot;</p>
              <p>Nodding, Firiona said, &quot;Very well, Lyirae.&quot;</p>
              <p>Firiona and the others then made their way to Freeport, in search 
                of the wizard Al`Kabor. Lyirae stayed behind in Faydwer in order 
                to observe the appropriate period of mourning and to pay her final 
                respects to her fallen sibling. While the others made their way 
                back to their lodgings at that late hour to rest for the trip 
                they would take the following morning, Lyirae stayed behind.</p>
              <p>Lyirae's voice boomed strong throughout the forest, a new tone 
                of strength in her voice that was not present until now. &quot;Tunare, 
                we return to you your child. Shelter him well, as he has sheltered 
                you.&quot; Lowering her head to the corpse once more, raising 
                the bow to the air, she declared, &quot;Lorisyn Oakwynd, your 
                legacy shall live on. In the hands of your sister, I take upon 
                myself the weight you carried for so many years. Rest now, my 
                brother, your time has passed.&quot;</p>

                his human brothers on the mainland to the east, but he also grew 
                to hate his fellow Erudites. To him they were both short sighted 
                and narrow. Miragul found this limiting and thoroughly resented 
                the thought of being restricted to one school of thought or another. 
              </p>
              <p>He soon found others who felt similarly. They were a small but 
                growing group of outcasts who often studied forbidden texts and 
                other knowledge generally kept secret from the majority of students. 
                The council was morally and ethically opposed to much of the information 
                gathered afar by their spies. Miragul found that these outcasts 
                not only studied the three schools of magic, but also a fourth. 
                It was called Necromancy and a few lucky spies had returned from 
                a distant underground city (Neriak, it was called, home of the 
                dark elves) with both their lives and also ancient texts describing 
                this art. Miragul was intrigued, and, by using powerful magic, 
                created for himself four identities, four separate countenances 
                and names, and joined all four schools without the knowledge of 
                the council, nor anyone else for that matter. </p>
              <p>It came to pass some years later that the council, in its ever 
                growing desire to know all there was to know, both in distant 
                lands and also in its own city, discovered the group of Necromancers. 
                They were branded heretics and great conflict arose. For the first 
                time in several hundred years, the Erudites fought. They engaged 
                in a civil war not entirely dissimilar to that which they had 
                loathed and fled from back on the mainland. But there was one 
                very significant difference - they did not use swords and bows, 
                but rather magic, and the result was terrible. Lives by the hundreds 
                were lost, great buildings and structures destroyed, and eventually 
                the heretics were forced to flee Erudin, to hide and regroup in 
                the southern regions of Odus. </p>
              <p>Miragul, being a member of all four schools, was not blind to 
                the implications when the conflict began. He left the heretics 
                before they fled the city, abandoning his fourth identity and 
                siding apparently with the council. But this was only a ruse in 
                order to buy time. He soon gathered every artifact and tome he 
                could discreetly steal and then left Odus entirely, taking a ship 
                back to Antonica and to the city of Qeynos. The lands of men, 
                however, were not only to his dislike, but also filled with Erudite 
                spies. Miragul grew afraid, even paranoid, and soon fled again. 
                He headed far to the north and then to the east, wishing to avoid 
                the barbarians of Halas. After many weeks he found himself near 
                the great lake called Winter's Deep and he hid there for some 
                time.<br>
                <br>
                While Miragul waited in secret his mind was not idle. He schemed 
                and planned, and looked over every letter of every scroll and 
                tome he had taken from Erudin. Time passed and his understanding 
                and power grew. But he was unsatisfied and a deep hunger for even 
                more arcane knowledge ate away at him. He soon left his hiding 
                place and began to travel long distances in search of more ancient 
                texts and artifacts. His power had grown and confidence overcame 
                his fear of Erudite spies. Once again he cloaked himself in false 
                identity and countenance and traveled the lands of men. </p>
              <p>Not far to the south of where his cache of artifacts lay, Miragul 
                soon found another of the new races, the Halflings, and their 
                town Rivervale. The mage feared these small people and their propensity 
                to sneak and to steal, and as his treasures grew in both size 
                and value, he eventually made the decision to move even farther 
                north, and away from all intelligent life. He traveled leagues 
                and leagues, far beyond the range of both Erudite spy and curious 
                Halfling, and eventually came to a vast tundra. This land had 
                no name, and was not until centuries later referred to as merely 
                the Frigid Plain. This frosty and remote environment appealed 
                to Miragul's heart, for it had grown cold, obsessed with only 
                knowledge and the abstract, and filled with only hatred for others. 
                Creatures with intelligence forced him to be discreet and slowed 
                his acquisition of knowledge and items. He had as little to do 
                with them as he could, only hiding amongst them when absolutely 
                necessary. </p>
              <p>Under the icy ground of the Frigid Plains, Miragul created a 
                large network of tunnels and rooms in which to hide and study 
                his collection. He used no labor, but rather deep magic to remove 
                the earth from his way. Room after room, passage after passage, 
                he did create to house his store of artifacts. He split his years, 
                spending one score out in the world, exploring and amassing knowledge 
                and items, returning them to his cache, and then the next dabbling 
                with them, experimenting in one of several laboratories he had 
                created. </p>
              <p>Many years passed, even centuries. Miragul grew old, even though 
                he did his best to extend his life using magical meansightenment 
                when it came to aging, and he soon acknowledged that one day even 
                he would die. Only one aspect of death did he fear, and being 
                no longer able to learn and collect wrought him with terror. As 
                his skin grew wrinkled, and his breath short, Miragul's time was 
                spent less exploring the world of Norrath and more studying the 
                existential. He soon discovered the various hidden dimensions 
                that neighbored his own, the Planes of Power and<br>
                Discord. He discovered means by which he could traverse these 
                planes, making portals that led between them. But his strength 
                was leaving him, and his journeys into these realities were short 
                and often unprofitable. More and more, his own mortality limited 
                his reason for living, and the specter of death haunted him daily. 
              </p>
              <p>The mage's research into life and death was built upon a foundation 
                he had learned from his fellow outcasts centuries before in Erudin. 
                Necromancy, more than any other art, became Miragul's obsession. 
                Eventually he discovered a means by which to create portals within 
                his own plane and made them to travel great distances in mere 
                seconds. He traveled back to Odus, to its southern regions, in 
                search of the other Necromancers. Perhaps, he mused, they had 
                unearthed by now a way to cheat death. <br>
                <br>
                The mage soon found that the heretics of Erudin had built a city 
                into a great hole that led to unknown depths beneath the earth. 
                This chasm was apparently the result of that huge civil war from 
                which Miragul had fled centuries earlier. The city, called Paineel, 
                though somewhat suspicious, allowed Miragul to enter and after 
                a time he earned its inhabitant's trust. Many humored the old 
                man and his claims, while a select few respected him and were 
                willing to trade knowledge for knowledge, power for power. They 
                revealed to him the true power of necromancy, the ability to raise 
                the dead, creating zombies and wraiths obedient in every way to 
                their master. Many of the heretics planned to assault Erudin with 
                vast armies of undead, to wreak revenege upon the council that 
                had exiled and made war upon them in centuries past. </p>
              <p>One important aspect of their necromancy interested Miragul, 
                the fact that the undead ceased to age. Their lives appeared endless 
                and the elderly mage knew that he must discover a way to be like 
                them. He feigned interest in the heretic's goals, learning spells 
                to raise the dead, helping them raise their undead army. All the 
                while, however, he was experimenting himself, hiding much of his 
                research in the small home he was given in Paineel. After some<br>
                time he discovered that which he had sought, a way to transform 
                a living being, as opposed to a corpse, into the undead. Unfortunately, 
                time was scarce, for he was tired and almost dead himself, his 
                body deteriorating with age, and the heretics were almost ready 
                to make war once again. </p>
              <p>Miragul then left Paineel, using a small portion of his dwindling 
                life energies to make a portal back to his cache hundreds of leagues 
                to the north. Upon arrival, he withdrew silently to his most secret 
                laboratory and prepared his final spell. Dreaming all the while 
                of endless exploration and discovery, he slowly made ready his 
                ultimate experiment. The enchantment laced with necromancy was 
                finally made, and Miragul hid his remaining and fragile life within 
                the phylactery, a small device he had pilfered from the other 
                necromancers. Clouds of mystical energy gathered and then dispersed, 
                revealing a shell of the man Miragul once was, an undead mage, 
                what ancient scripts and legends called a lich. </p>
              <p>In his haste, however, Miragul had made a miscalculation. The 
                lich, while retaining all the mystical power of his formal self, 
                lacked a spirit. Only the mage's soul, now locked within the phylactery 
                hidden deep in the cache, retained the ambition and desire to 
                amass knowledge and power. The spiritless lich possessed none 
                of these human traits, and Miragul's soul screamed in silence 
                as the undead creature began to aimlessly wander his menagerie 
                of wisdom and enlightenment, his rooms filled with artifacts of 
                power.</p>

            <p><b>Mordavin Telase</b><br>
              An evil follower of Bertoxxulous, he plotted to take over Qeynos. 
            <blockquote> Mordavin Telase, the mastermind behind a grand conspiracy 
              to overthrow Antonius Bayle and take control of Qeynos, was apprehended 
              today. A grand trial took place but alas, Mordavin managed to escape. 
              Details of the trial are below. 
              <p></p>
              <p>Mordavin was tried and charged with Conspiracy to Commit Genocide, 
                Treason, Destruction of Sacred Natural Resources, Grand Larceny 
                and Murder. After lively testimony from Earron Huntlan, Al`Kabor, 
                Athrin Tashir, Rykonis Sw`Vaye and a host of other citizens, Mordavin's 
                plan was exposed. He unabashedly admitted to each of these charges, 
                thumbing his nose at the jurors and prosecutor. </p>
              <p>The Bloodsabres sought to destroy all life in Qeynos and the 
                surrounding areas in an effort to take control of the city. Mordavin 
                and the Bloodsabres sought to summon the Avatar of Bertoxxulous 
                and use his power to unleash a powerful and virulent plague that 
                would extinguish all life as far as the Karanas. </p>
              <p>Athrin Tashir testified concerning the thieves that were ransacking 
                the Temple of Life and attempting to steal their sacred scrolls 
                a daily basis. Ironically, the Bloodsabres needed the research 
                of their mortal enemies in order to find a way to become immune 
                to the very plague they were to unleash. Though most of the scrolls 
                were returned, a great number nevertheless fell into the hands 
                of the Bloodsabres. The research was completed and a way devised 
                to protect them from the plague found. </p>
              <p>Al`Kabor revealed that the Runed Branding Irons would have been 
                used to brand all those friendly to the Bloodsabres and their 
                causes with a certain sigil. This sigil would have rendered them 
                immune to the effects of the plague. The strange, obsolete words 
                people were finding, when combined with the hidden runes found 
                on the prime numbered diary pages found blowing around the city 
                produced one of several incantations. These incantations are part 
                of the spell that would have been used to summon the Avatar of 
                Bertoxxulous. With the power of the Bertoxxulous, a powerful spell 
                would have been cast that would have released a deadly and virulent 
                plague, the likes of which almost no one would survive. Finally, 
                the strange building materials were to be used to construct a 
                rather large shrine to Bertoxxulous, that would be necessary for 
                the summoning. </p>
              <p>Holly Windstalker took the stand. She told that the waters in 
                Surefall glade became tainted one day. She and Cros Treewind noticed 
                the taint after drinking from it one morning and immediately alerted 
                everyone in the glade. Though the rangers and druids caught it 
                quickly and were able to purify the waters again, the mate of 
                Mammoth too, drank the water. He became mad with sickness and 
                ran away. In order to prevent spreading the disease, she and Cros 
                both went into the wilderness until they recovered. The bear, 
                perhaps sensing the familiar smell of Cros, found him and in its 
                madness, killed him. In his weakened state, Cros was unable to 
                defend himself and died by one of the creatures he swore to protect. 
                Mordavin admitted that tainting the waters of Surefall Glade was 
                but a simple experiment to test the virulence of the plague that 
                was to be unleashed. It was also a way to settle some old scores 
                with a long standing enemy. </p>
              <p>Rykonis Sw`Vaye, in order to clear his good name as a legitimate 
                business man, took the stand. Rykonis said that he was contracted 
                by Mordavin to supply the man-power to mine and deliver supplies 
                to the Bloodsabres. Rykonis used his connections (it is rumored 
                that Rykonis works for Donovan, the leader of the bandits) to 
                obtain the manpower necessary to complete the contract. The men 
                mined the high quality granite from the mountainous areas of the 
                Karana near Coldwind Shore and also delivered large supplies of 
                paints. </p>
              <p>Rykonis admitted to even using gnolls to accomplish this goal, 
                saying that the job was so large, he was unable to get the men 
                needed to complete the contract. So he appealed to his gnollish 
                contacts for more labor. Gnolls tend to work cheaply and are good 
                laborers when properly motivated. He provided his very own stylish 
                Brooch to those that worked for him as a form of identification 
                so he knew who should be paid and who shouldn't. </p>
              <p>Mordavin became angry at Rykonis for double crossing him and 
                vowed revenge. It was shortly thereafter that several zombies, 
                Rotting Sentries, crawled up from the sewers and began to assault 
                the citizens. In the confusion, one of the zombies managed to 
                free the bonds on Mordavin's hands and he gated away to an unknown 
                location. </p>
              <p>Lord Vegalys Keldrane, Magistrate and advisor to King Antonius 
                Bayle was charged with the duty of apprehending Mordavin. </p>
              <p>Calling for assistance from the local populace and relying upon 
                the reports given him by the Rangers of Surefall Glade, Vegalys 
                and the group set out into the Karanas in search of Mordavin. 
                With the help of the tracking skills of the rangers and druids 
                in attendance, Mordavin's hiding place was eventually found. </p>
              <p>Vegalys demanded that Mordavin give himself up and was instructed 
                to come along peacefully. Mordavin had nothing but insults for 
                the Magistrate. After heated words were exchanged, the Arch Priest 
                of the Bloodsabres became enraged and attacked Vegalys. </p>
              <p>A battle ensued between the Arch Priest and those that were to 
                be his captors. After several minutes of fighting, Mordavin was 
                seriously wounded. Realizing that he was out matched and out numbered, 
                he gave himself up. However, the words he spoke upon his surrender 
                were eerie. He stated that though he may be captured, he was not 
                defeated, saying that they were too late to stop the events that 
                had been set in motion. Vegalys took the foul priest into custody 
                and he was taken to Qeynos, where he currently languishes in prison 
                awaiting his sentencing. </p>
              <p>Antonius Bayle was so impressed by the successful and efficient 
                capture of what was surely the most wanted and reviled criminal 
                in the history of Qeynos, that he offered a title and his very 
                own shield to the leader of those that assisted Magistrate Vegalys 
                Keldrane in the capture of this fiend. With Mordavin captured 
                and behind bars, Qeynos citizens and the residents of Karana may 
                now sleep peacefully.

            <blockquote> After the dwarven-ogre wars, Barely more then three hundred 
              ogres had survived from a host of thousands and, saying their prays 
              of forgiveness to their god Rallos Zek for loosing the war, the 
              survivors hastily retreated to the south-west. For two weeks the 
              ogres fled and the dwarven forces of king Grimmly hounded them at 
              every step, killing all those they could catch up with. The ogres 
              plundered every small city they came to, even the shattered ruins 
              of the elven capital of Caerthiel where they found ships and supplies 
              they could use. Finally fleeing all the way across the Loping Plains, 
              they set sail across the eastern oceans and away from the closing 
              dwarves. The first Ogre-Dwarven war had officially ended. 
              <p> The ogres, beaten, wounded, and without a leader, reached the 
                then barren continent of Antonica a month after setting sail from 
                Faedwer. Day and night the forces of a once great Rakthokian Kingdom

                the empty mountain range of what is now known as the serpent's 
                spine. Wanting some time to rebuild and recuperate, the ogres 
                found the mountain's natural geography a good advantage over any 
                invasion force. Here they started the foundations of a new ogre 
                capital, guarded on all sides by two rivers, a desert, a lake, 
                jagged mountains, and a thick jungle, where they could start to 
                assemble again and build a new army for the second ogre-dwarven 
                war. They called their new kingdom &quot;Oggok&quot; which in

            <b>Ogre</b><br>
            Created in the elder age by the god Rallos-Zek, Ogres are incredibly 
            massive beings, with their average height being about 10', and weight 
            well over four hundred pounds, they are truly immovable objects. Due 
            to their size, they are the strongest of all the races and are tied 
            with trolls in pure stamina. Conversely, they are the least intelligent 
            race, whose lives consist mostly of smashing things and eating them. 
            <p>An ogre's strength is its strength. With the ability to use heavy 
              weapons, ogres become either warriors or shadowknights. Whether 
              they truly understand their vocations, the smarter races have not 
              yet been able to decide. But, with the mystery of evolution, an 
              ogre is sometimes born with a bit more smarts and may decide, or 
              fall into by mistake, the profession of shaman.</p>
            <p>Never let the ogre's dull personality and lack of intelligence 
              mislead you into thinking they are harmless. Ogres are ruthless 
              killers, and like trolls, will eat what they kill. The best way 
              to make friends with an ogre is to feed him your left hand. He'll 
              stay with you until he gets the rest.</p>
            <p>They were not always so stupid. In the Elder Age, several of the 
              races became bent on expansion and warfare became part of their 
              developing cultures. And of all the races, it was the Ogres who 
              quickly proved the most interested in battle and plunder, and their 
              empire grew outward from their mountain home until it eventually 
              encompassed a large portion of Tunaria, largest of the known continents. 
              Their knowledge of magic grew as did their greed, until they became 
              weary of only Norrath, and when they learned of other planes and 
              dimensions, invaded the Plane of Earth itself. Rallos Zek watched 
              with pride as his creations challenged the gods of that realm, and 
              when they eventually knew defeat, the Warlord himself led a second 
              invasion. The war that ensued shook the heavens and angered the 
              greater gods. Through their combined might, Rallos Zek was finally 
              thwarted and forced back to his domain. In reprisal, the gods cursed 
              the Warlord's creations. Thousands of Ogres were slain and their 
              empire collapsed around them. (The History of Norrath, Verant International)</p>
            <p><b>Ognit Eznertob</b><br>
              Ognit is most happy in a warm, well-furnished study with tomes and 
              papers and tools surrounding him. He is actually known to smile 
              when a formula he has been working with is finally completed. Other 
              than that, he is a grump. His hobby is tinkering with devices and 
              contraptions. Remarkably intelligent, Ognit is cursed with a lust 
              for knowledge that draws him out of his study into the futile world 
              of the mundane everyman.</p>
            <p>He met his travelling companion Dabner, when a Clockwork Scrubber 
              he was working upon went rogue and attacked him. Dabner heard the 
              commotion and healed Ognit as Ognit blasted the crazed beast. Ognit 
              was most grateful and they spoke for some time over dinner.</p>
            <p>Ognit could not get rid of Dabner from that point on. As the noon 
              sun warmed the underground caverns of Ak`Anon the temperature rises 
              a scant 0.7 degrees or so. Ognit could predict the arrival of Dabner 
              based on the thermometer on the wall of his study. At noontime, 
              Dabner would finish his morning devotions and check in with Ognit. 
              He would prattle on endlessly about anything that had sparked his 
              interest that morning. At first Ognit viewed the intrusions as a 
              nuisance, but later Ognit began to tolerate the visits, even looked 
              forward to them.</p>
            <p>He began to count on Dabner's visits. Beyond his taste for rational 
              reasoning, he found himself asking for Dabner's &quot;insight&quot; 
              on certain things, whether they be mechanical, magical, or spiritual. 
              Occasionally his responses were just plain silly in Ognit's eyes. 
              But once in a while he was truly, dead-on accurate about things. 
              Dabner's occasional insights into the nature of the universe were 
              invaluable. From that nebulous point forward, they were the best 
              of friends.</p>
            <p>Ognit enjoys the stories and jokes that Dabner tells. Occasionally 
              he even laughs. As much as he hates to admit it (and he never will 
              publicly), Dabner is a source of inspiration for him, as well as 
              good company. He also looks on Dabner as a student--albeit a poor 
              one--but he is more than willing to at least try to teach him. Dabner 
              ranks as one of the few people in the world that can actually make 
              him laugh. That being said, Ognit's attitude towards Dabner alternates 
              between one who is a trusted friend and one who is a troublesome 
              nuisance.</p>
            <p> Ognit's attitude towards Dagda is one of grudging respect on the 
              surface, but true friendship underneath. She is a savage in his 
              eyes and has vowed to protect him because he is &quot;weak&quot;, 
              something he takes great exception to. At the same time, he sees 
              her devotion to Dabner and himself as something both noble and worthy 
              of great respect. As one who has spent his life immersed in books 
              and spurning contact with actual people, he has found it a rare 
              thing that others would take a shine to one such as he. Furthermore, 
              it makes him happy to see that his friend Dabner has such a powerful 
              ally, given his inherent weakness in mind and naivete. If you really 
              pressed him, he would admit that Dagda is his friend and with a 
              bit of prodding, she would do the same. They share an intense, almost 
              sibling-like, rivalry and he and Dagda argue often about anything 
              and everything. However, their conversations are the most lively 
              and indeed even friendly when they are discussing something he is 
              tinkering. </p>

                happy to see that you've brought some friends along.&quot;</p>
              <p>The crowd began to gather and surround Ognit. The barbarians 
                towered over the strange gnome, who turned and climbed atop the 
                Igloo. Waving his arms, he called for quiet. &quot;Quit your yammering 
                already and listen!&quot; He tapped his feet for a few moments 
                as the crowd quieted.</p>
              <p>Making himself as tall as he could, he puffed out his chest and

                We have heard in our conversations with the residents of Halas, 
                that some of the young Wolves of the North have succumbed to the 
                cold of this region.&quot;</p>
              <p>Gesturing broadly, he continued, &quot;As a favor to our close 
                friend Dagda and indeed as a favor to all of you and your kin 
                who reside in these lands of persistent inclemency, I have developed 
                the blueprints for a device that will make an end to the wretched 
                misery you poor folks face.&quot;</p>
              <p>With excitement in his voice, he said, &quot;But before we get 
                to that, more about me! I have, as a master tinker, made it my 
                goal to design and build life-enhancing tools to make Norrath 
                a better place.&quot;</p>
              <p>&quot;Some devices just treat the symptom and ignore the cause, 
                such as my automatic, self-applicating, single use, disposable 
                tissues for cold climates such as these.&quot; Ognit sneezed and 
                a thin cloth sprang out from somewhere beneath his robes and stuck 
                to his face.</p>
              <p>The gnome let loose a muffled cry of surprise. Removing the cloth 
                from his face he said, &quot;Pardon me,&quot; and continued his 
                pitch. &quot;As I was saying this device does more than simply 
                treat the symptom. This device eliminates the cause of the problem 
                altogether! With no further ado, I would like to introduce my 
                close friend and understudy in all things mechanical, Dabner Drednever,&quot; 
                he then gestured down to the gnome in light chain armor waiting 
                below next to the igloo.</p>
              <p>Dabner sat there, staring in fear at the crowd of giants all 
                around him. Ognit bends down and whispers loudly, &quot;Get up 
                on this igloo and talk to these people, you cretin!&quot;</p>
              <p>&quot;Though I designed the blueprints for this device, Dabner 
                here is the one solely responsible for its assembly. This is his 
                first work as a tinker and he's very excited to tell you about 
                what he did,&quot; Ognit added, buying himself some more time.</p>
              <p>Dabner climbed on top of the igloo, while Ognit slid down the 
                other side. Being above all of these people didn't make things 
                any easier for Dabner. He suddenly realized how many there were. 
                He cleared his throat uncomfortably.</p>
              <p>Ognit pointed at Dabner and mouths the words, &quot;Get on with 
                it all ready!&quot;</p>
              <p>Seeing her little friend's distress, Dagda said, &quot;Tell them 
                about what you made Dabner! You know I'm proud of you!&quot;</p>
              <p>Visibly blushing, Dabner spoke, his voice cracking nervously, 
                &quot;Yeah... So this is the first thing that I made&#133; With 
                tinkering that is&#133;&quot;</p>
              <p>Dabner looked down and shuffled his feet nervously. &quot;I think 
                you're all gonna like it. It'll keep you all warm and it fits 
                in a small backpack and stuff&#133; So that's good...&quot;</p>
              <p>Ognit looked up at Dabner and then covering his eyes and shaking 
                his head says, &quot;You're dying up there Dabner! Flare, think 
                flare! Like you're giving a sermon or some fool thing like that.&quot;</p>
              <p>At those harsh words, Dagda turned a dangerous glare upon Ognit. 
                Ognit ignored the look.</p>
              <p>Building some steam Dabner continued, &quot;Ognit here designed 
                it and stuff but I put it together myself! So now, here it is, 
                I guess!&quot; He smiled nervously as he rifled through a backpack. 
                Finding what he was searching for, he pulled out a small device. 
                It was a cylindrical shape that appeared to be made out of interlaced 
                metal wire. The top of the device had what looked to be a weather 
                vein that seemed to spin on its own regardless of the wind's direction. 
                The center of the object seemed to glow a light orange color.</p>
              <p>Sliding gleefully off the igloo, he placed the object on the 
                ground. Dabner then reached into his pocket and pulled out another 
                device, this one a small box- rectangular, thin and long. Taking 
                several steps back, he pointed the device at the cylinder and 
                clicked a small red button on the box.</p>
              <p>Upon hitting the button, huge flames shot out in all directions 
                from the cylinder. The shock wave from the mighty explosion rolled 
                across the tundra. Animals stopped dead in their tracks in fear 
                as the sound echoed throughout the hills. The crowd gasped and 
                took several steps back. Some people began to draw weapons.</p>
              <p>Smiling broadly at the shocked crowd, Dabner continued, &quot;So&#133; 
                Here I am standing down here and I'm all cold and what have you. 
                But, I have this nice Portable Heater I set up over by this igloo 
                here.&quot;</p>
              <p>&quot;Now,&quot; Dabner eyes gleamed with confidence. I want 
                to get all nice and warm so I guess I'll go over by my heater 
                I got set up over here.&quot; Dabner smiled once again at the 
                crowd as he strode up to the portable heater and said, &quot;Heh.&quot; 
                As he approached the heater, the spinning object atop the device 
                stopped spinning and began to point directly toward him.</p>
              <p>As Dabner stood next to the heater, a wave of flame shot forth 
                from between the wires of the cylinder, and enveloped Dabner briefly 
                before dying down. &quot;Oh yeah. That's nice and warm all right,&quot; 
                he said with confidence.</p>
              <p>The spinner began to spin once again and once again it stopped, 
                pointing at Dabner. Another burst of flame shot forth and enveloped 
                the gnome. &quot;Yup, that's heating my armor up good now.&quot;</p>
              <p>Dabner looked apprehensively at the heater, which shot yet another 
                wave of fire at the gnome. Finally he jumped back shouting, &quot;Sweet 
                Brell's pajamas that's hot!&quot;</p>
              <p>Ognit's face was screwed into a scowl of rage; &quot;You used 
                the Size 6 Gizmo didn't you? Please tell me you didn't use Size 
                6 Gizmos in this contraption when I told you specifically to use 
                the Size 4 Gizmos!&quot; He poked Dabner several times with his 
                bony finger.</p>
              <p>Dabner looked down at the snow, &quot;Well&#133; I thought that 
                the Size 6 Gizmo would be better so I used those. You know. The 
                Size 4 Gizmos are so small and hard to work with, after all.&quot; 
                Looking up sheepishly, he added, &quot;It was like&#133; artistic 
                license, you know?&quot;</p>
              <p>&quot;Impetuous dolt! You didn't make a heater! You've laid a 
                land mine!&quot; Ognit clenched his fist as his whole body shook, 
                his face twisting with rage. </p>
              <p>Dagda stepped forward, separating the two gnomes. Turning to 
                Ognit she said, &quot;Calm down, you old grump! And don't yell 
                at Dabner like that!&quot; Walking toward the portable heater 
                she looked behind to the gnomes and said smugly, &quot;It can't 
                be all that bad! You are so small after all. It makes sense that 
                it would be too hot for you. Let me try it out. It may still prove 
                useful for us more hearty folk.&quot; Several in the crowd nodded 
                in agreement and looked on with continuing interest.</p>
              <p>As Dagda approached the heater, the spinner once again stopped 
                spinning and began to point toward Dagda. The heater once again 
                erupted into a virtual inferno and Dagda's upper body disappeared 
                into the flames and smoke.</p>
              <p>She remained in the flames for a few seconds but then backed 
                away. The flames subsided and the spinner spun once again. &quot;Wow,&quot; 
                she said, as she ducked to brush snow onto her armor. The snow 
                hissed as steam rose into the air. &quot;That's really far too 
                hot.&quot;</p>
              <p>Dagda looked sadly at Dabner and then with anger at Ognit. Shaking 
                her head, she drew forth her bow, &quot;That device is dangerous 
                and must be destroyed.&quot;</p>
              <p>Ognit was indignant, &quot;Dagda! What are you doing?&quot;</p>
              <p>&quot;Not a word from you wizard. This thing must be destroyed. 
                It is a danger to us all,&quot; she said as she began to launch 
                arrow after arrow into the device. Others joined in and soon arrows, 
                rocks, throwing stars and spells were flying through the air and 
                striking the heater. Wringing his hands Dabner said, &quot;I'm 
                so sorry Ognit. I should have followed your blueprint,&quot; as 
                their invention was slowly reduced to a smoldering hunk of metal 
                bits. &quot;Size 6!&quot; Ognit yelled at the sky. &quot;I tell 
                him use Size 4. So what does he do? He uses Size 6.&quot; &quot;I'm 
                really sorry, Ognit,&quot; Dabner was truly penitent.</p>
              <p>The heater fully destroyed and rendered inactive, Dagda put her 
                bow away and said, &quot;I'm sorry I had to destroy your heater 
                Dabner. Ognit should have been watching you more carefully.&quot;</p>
              <p>Shuffling his feet and smiling, Dabner said, &quot;That's ok, 
                Dagda, it was my fault after all.&quot; Her face changed from 
                sadness at having to disappoint Dabner to anger at the other gnome 
                as she says, &quot;What kind of rotten teacher are you to allow 
                YOUR student to do such a thing, Ognit?&quot; Standing on his 
                tiptoes, he pointed a wrinkled finger at himself and says, &quot;Me? 
                You're blaming me for this monstrosity! My designs are rock-solid 
                and based on extensive research!&quot;</p>
              <p>&quot;Maybe you should stick to research then and leave instruction 
                to those who know more about that kind of thing,&quot; she said 
                in a mocking tone, her head tilting back and forth with each syllable. 
              </p>
              <p>Stamping his feet Ognit bellowed, &quot;I can train a common 
                cur to follow basic instructions! Why can't he follow them?&quot; 
                &quot;I can live with your failings Ognit. That is why I have 
                vowed to protect you after all,&quot; she said crossing her arms, 
                a slight smile beginning to cross her face. &quot;Yeah! Well the 
                last thing I need is protection from the likes of you,&quot; Ognit 
                growled, his fists forced down by his sides, shaking violently.</p>
              <p>This time, Dabner stepped between the two of them, &quot;C'mon 
                guys! Stop fighting! You know I hate that! See now! No one got 
                hurt&#133;&quot; He paused for a second and then added, &quot;Well, 
                except for that guy lying on the ground over there. But we are 
                all friends and stuff here, right? Relax already! I'm not mad 
                or upset or anything. No reason for you guys to be!&quot; </p>
              <p>Ognit and Dagda muttered a few one-line insults to themselves 
                but eventually ceased their arguing. It was then that Dagda's 
                keen and well-trained eyes caught a glimpse of several figures 
                walking slowly across the snowy wastes. She turned and looked 
                at the approaching figures, her eyes flashing in startled recognition. 
                Curious she made her way toward the figures, the two gnomes flanking 
                her on either side.</p>
              <p>As her eyes meet those of the beautiful golden haired high elf 
                before her, Dagda was sure she was seeing a friend but could not 
                remember who she was or how she knew her. The high elf was accompanied 
                by what must have been half elven bard, judging from the lute 
                slung across her back. The bard also seemed eerily familiar to 
                her. In fact, the erudite in robes, the human resplendent in shining 
                armor, the young scruffy looking halfling and the scowling dwarf 
                all seemed familiar to her for some reason. But the shy wood elf 
                carrying the exquisitely crafted and ornately decorated bow, she 
                did not recognize. [for more of this story, see the Chronicals

            <p><b>Orc </b><br>
              Orcs are a brutal yet prolific humanoid race that can be found in 
              nearly every corner of Norrath. Brutish and feudal in nature, several 
              Orc clans have reached rather sophisticated levels of society, most 
              notably, Clan Crushbone of the Greater Faydark. They were originally 
              slaves of the ogres. 
            <blockquote> 
              <p> Little more then three months after their betrayal of Dagnor 
                and their march to the east, the newly freed orcan slaves were 
                left stranded with no place to call home. None of the orcs had 
                ever lived without the watchful eye of an ogre master looking 
                over their shoulder, so now they were like children: wandering 
                without knowing exactly what they were to do. The dwarves had 
                made it clear in their pact that, while the kingdom of Kaladim 
                was responsible for freeing the orcs, they were still very much 
                enemies. It was not an option for any of the orcs to return west, 
                so they eached began plotting for a new place to live. </p>
              <p>The decision was split three ways and the orcs began to revert 
                back to the methods of their ancestors: splitting into three differing 
                clans. One clan marched north, taking residence in the familiar 
                northern peaks of Rakthok's ridge and away from the careful eyes 
                of the dwarves. The second clan decided to make the grassy fields 
                of the loping plains their home. Even today this clan remains 
                there, looting and plundering any caravans who happen to pass 
                by. The third, and the largest clan, was lead by a young orc named 
                Gharol. He convinced the majority of the orcs that true riches 
                lied to the fertile lands of the east. There, he said, the orcs 
                would find their new home and the crushbone clan, as he called 
                his followers, would grow strong. </p>
              <p>It was at this time, as the crushbone clan started making their 
                way further east around the wayunder lake and straight for the 
                greater Faydark, that the elven lord of Kelethin began to take 
                notice of their advancement. </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><i>Kelethin Orcs:</i> Of the border struggles and the great burning: 
            </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>The elves of Kelethin were tentative at first and the lord of 
                Kelethin, an old elf by the name of Carandril, sent many messages 
                to Gharol to ask what his plans were in moving his clan eastward. 
                To this day no scholar can really be sure if Gharol was able to 
                decipher the letters or not, as it is general knowledge that most 
                orcs can't read a word of any written language, but it is certain 
                the orcan lord was angry to find that another race had already 
                taken residence in the eastern lands. Carandril never saw any 
                messengers he sent out again, as they were all killed by Gharol 
                immediately as the letters were exchanged. Acting purely on his 
                instincts, the leader of the crushbone clan told his followers 
                of this &quot;new&quot; race and how they had &quot;stolen&quot; 
                the east from the orcs. Gharol then started to plot a new plan 
                which would entail the complete destruction of Kelethin and the 
                enslavement of the elven race, as he thought kelethin was the 
                only city of elves and the center for the entire elven empire. 
              </p>
              <p>Both assumptions were false and the forces of Gharol were met 
                with bitter, however surprised, resistance on the borders of the 
                greater faydark. Most of the orcs leading this first attack were 
                killed and the rest were turned quickly away. Angry at this new 
                defeat and jealous of the elven strength, Gharol started to plot 
                a new system of attack. He understood that most of his soldiers 
                had been slaughtered from elves high in the treetops who would 
                rain showers of arrows down on his forces. So for the second attack, 
                Gharol put his orcs into a long line of attackers, gave each soldier 
                his own makeshift torch, and then ordered the entire host to run 
                into the borders of the greater Faydark and burn whatever they 
                could touch. The Crushbone orcs set fire from everything to the 
                tops of the trees to the grasses on the forest paths. Nothing 
                but ash was left in their wake. The elven archers high in the 
                trees were burned to death and the remaining elven soldiers, horrified 
                and shocked at the tactics of their strange enemy, began to make 
                a hasty retreat. The wood elves would later call the incident 
                &quot;the great burning.&quot; Gharol, seeing how effective his 
                new methods were, gathered his clan into many small camps around 
                the greater Faydark and ordered the construction of hundreds of 
                torches for a second assault. The lord of Kelethin, desperate 
                for help, sent word of his plight to the heart of the empire: 
                Felwithe. </p>
              <p>The first elf to take interest in Kelethin's request was a young 
                soldier named Edril. Edril had lived his entire life in Felwithe, 
                schooled by the best teachers and raised in a wealthy family. 
                Around his 30th birthday, young by elven standards, he admitted 
                himself into the imperial school of soldiery where he impressed 
                his teachers with both his knowledge of military science and his 
                deadly accurate fighting skills. After graduating and performing 
                many deeds of merit in the imperial army of the elves, he was 
                chosen as a personal guard of the emperor at the unprecedented 
                age of 50. What brought him everlasting fame among the elves, 
                however, was not how he excelled in schooling but what he chose 
                to do for Kelethin. Going straight to the emperor himself, Edril 
                asked that he be allowed to lead the attack against the orcs. 
                When the emperor granted his wish, Edril hand picked 100 of the 
                best elven warriors and the best horses, and rode quickly to the 
                woodland kingdom of Kelethin. </p>
              <p>He was met at Kelethin with a large reception, but decided to 
                ride through quickly. He was there for only one purpose: to make 
                a name for himself by destroying the orcs. Little more then two 
                days after arriving in the city, Edril and his men rode outside 
                the greater Faydark and headed directly for the first orcan encampment. 
                It was the middle of the night when Edril made his first strike, 
                and the orcs were completely caught off guard. Edril's men rode 
                straight over the orcs, slaughtering every clansmen they saw with 
                little casualties of their own. Edril is said to have fought like 
                a madman, tallying over 20 kills himself. Without even stopping 
                to catch their breath, Edril's soldiers rode for the next camp 
                so as to keep the element of surprise. </p>
              <p>One by one the camps of the crushbone orcs were destroyed quickly 
                and brutally. The orcs, still preparing for their second assault 
                on Kelethin, were always caught by surprise. Edril and his men 
                moved from one battle to the next so quickly, the elves called 
                them the legion of wind. The strategy worked perfectly: Gharol 
                was never able to get word of the new attackers in time to plan 
                a defense and so most of the orcs were slaughtered. The final 
                battle, lasting longer then the rest, was against Gharol's own 
                camp. Many of Edril's warriors were killed in this fight but all 
                of the orcs, including Gharol, were driven away to the deep growth 
                of the wild Greater Faydark. Here they have made their makeshift 
                kingdom. When Edril returned to his kingdom, he was proclaimed 
                high protector of Kelethin with over 150 kills to his name alone. 
                This would not be the last time Edril's name was written into 
                elven history, however. It is believed that only weeks later after 
                their retreat, Gharol was killed by his own followers. (The History
