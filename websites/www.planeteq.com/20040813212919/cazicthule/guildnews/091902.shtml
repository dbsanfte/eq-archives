              Sep 19 2002 9:23AM - Excuse me sir, but... Deacis <br>
              Thank you very much for VT, we like it! 
            <p>Two more nameds down and about 250 monks, but luckily we got very 
              masochistic monks, and they kinda like the beating :) </p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Downed a few of those along with everything, and got much loot 
              and many smiles. :) </p>
            <p>Notice he isnt in a corner this time? We getting better :p </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>/cough <br>
              New stuff to us:<br>
              Cap of the Silent Star <br>
              Cloak of Icy Shadows <br>
              Ring of Rage <br>
              Great Sword of Slaughter <br>
              Sep 17 2002 10:18AM - And onward Regor <br>
              Another new VT named falls to the might of Anavon.. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Diabo Xi Xin, put up a good fight (if by good you mean he lasted 
              20 mins). Pretty flawless fight. Couple of deaths from rampage, 
              but our assling managed to keep his attention for the duration.<br>
              Veil of Flames <br>
              Amulet of Xuzl <br>
              Pendant of Malosini </p>
            <p>Grats Hanna on Veil, Rexus on Amulet, Gardaor on Pendant </p>
            <p>Slowly and surely we are making our way through this zone. 4 have 
              fallen, mostly without problem. The rest will follow in time. <br>
              Sep 16 2002 1:11PM - Back to the start... Blackbadger <br>
              Server went down so had to go and clear from start of VT again and 
              killed where we had got to before, but in half the time. </p>
            <p>Va Xakra tried his best and trained 4 adds on us, but failed to 
              kill anyone, not even the rogue who fancied himself as a rampage 
              tank and took rampage the whole fight... he gave us one of his bugged 
              bracers for Pepi and also one of these for Baldrith<br>
              Boots of Silent Dreams<br>
              <br>
              Had fun flying around Kaas Thox Xi Ans Dyek (aka blob) room, end 
              result... dead vt boss, no dead Anavon. <br>
              Sangreal got an amulet... Andreas grabbed the mantle/arms thing...<br>
              Darkened Claw Amulet <br>
              Seething Mantle<br>
              Bad day for Diabo Xi Va, who should have just /q when he heard us 
              coming, there was no way he was going to stop us getting... <br>
              2 mod rods... for Infestalia and Snorfen, plus some arms that make 
              Hazh look like a ranger.<br>
              Scepter of Calekor <br>
              Thorny Chain Sleeves<br>
              <br>
              If servers stay up we should get to some new mobs soon </p>
            <p>Was going to post some pics, but my pc being mean today ;/ <br>
              Sep 14 2002 12:38PM - more.. Blackbadger <br>
              killed a couple more things in VT and got the following... <br>
              two of these..<br>
              Cord of Midnight </p>
            <p>and one each of these... effect on bracer is a combat proc, now 
              just have to work out how to hit stuff with a bracer to get it to 
              proc... gg VI<br>
              Steel Skin Armplates <br>
              Umbracite Bracer </p>
            <p>also got our first ancient spell, grats necro alt ;p </p>
            <p> Ancient: Master of Death <br>
              <br>
              Sep 13 2002 12:22AM - This other time... Deacis <br>
              In band camp... </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Wand of Turning <br>
              Staff of Lost Rituals <br>
              Grimore of Enchantment <br>
              Sandals of Contemplation <br>
              Orb of Evasion </p>
            <p>We stuck something up VTs .... </p>
            <p>So, as you can see, we tried to position mob for nice kill shot.. 
              but what is it with these things ? there is some kind of magnetic 
              attraction to corners and walls, they always fall that way.. Ah 
              well </p>
            <p>Grats Hanna, the boobalicious female Barbarian on her new shoes, 
              our assling meatshieldwannabe on dodgemadness, our local focus dealer 
              Torut on a staff that makes him look like a fiddleplayer, our MB 
              crit recordholder Vesuv on yet another fiddleplayer thingie and 
              our friendly neighbourhood wizard Nenad on a staff, with an effect 
              he will be using endlessly from now on... :p</p>

              Well, well, well... I've been slacking on the updates, so let's 
              get started...</p>
            <p>In the past week we've made two trips to ToV N, Obtained Cleric 
              Epics x3 (grats Airyka, Kellithe and Oscarr!) &amp; one Shaman Epic 
              (grats Bombai!), killed Tunare, killed AoW, killed Tormax, killed 
              Dain, completed a 8th shawl war (grats Anachronox!) and sat back 
              gracefully while two of the alliances on the server waltzed into 
              Ssra and killed the Big Meanie because, for some reason, VI allowed 
              him to be slowable for all of two days (oh, and graciously supplied 
              a patch in between the kills so not one, not three, but two alliances 
              could kill him thus). Hooray for Verant Interactive and their highly 
              evolved ability to count the number of end-game capable guilds on 
              our server! /rude<br>

              Grats to Khandrahcir for reaching 60!
            <p>SEP 11, 2002<br>
              Dozekar perished to our hands for the first time this evening. Having 
              never fought him before, we devised a strategy and then attacked. 
              In our first attempt, we had him down to 70, but decided to camp 
              out in an organized fashion and reattempt with a different strategy 
              and groups. The second attempt was significantly smoother and we 
              were able to kill him with only a stray death. Drops were a Poison 
              Tear [Klaminar] and White Tear [Machedor].</p>
            <p>SEP 10, 2002<br>
              Returned to the halls of testing and cleared the east wing several 
              times for armour drops and symbols.</p>
            <p>SEP 09, 2002<br>
              More cleric epics. This time for Ceeni and Bormer. Now that the 
              Ragefire camp-a-thon has been removed guilds that can't be on 24x7 
              have been taking advantage of this welcome change. Nice to see all 
              the different guilds finishing off shards and working with one another 
              to line up spawn order.</p>
            <p>SEP 07, 2002<br>
              Finished off Ixibalt so more clerics are ready for Ragefire. A lot 
              of shard camping the last couple nights.<br>

              Monday - September 16, 2002 - Demana Azulene </p>
            <p>Sometimes I wonder what the secret of our success is. We don't 
              have enough clerics, we don't have enough enchanters, and Garthebe 
              and Hidemi are some overworked mages. I thought about this for a 
              long time, and I finally came up with the answer. I could give you 
              the quality over quantity bit, and that's partly the truth, because 
              the players in the DA/SS alliance just plainly own. However, there's 
              more to our success than just plain old l33t skillz. I present to 
              you the true secret to our success:</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Yes, we're lemmings. We blindly follow our brave pullers into whatever 
              spawn infested areas they happen to wander into, and somehow, things 
              just die. We also follow the pinkness that is our fair leader, because, 
              honestly, ya really can't miss a dude in bright pink robe. </p>
            <p>On to the news...</p>
            <p>Indulge me, if you will, in a bit of time travel. We're not going 
              back too far, only 8 days or so, to last Sunday morning. Once again, 
              the lemmings were sleepy, but they came, they followed, they even 
              made all the correct turns and at last, the lemmings arrived at 
              the feet of the King of the Snakes. And, as usual, the lemmings 
              performed well, in spite of some seriously laggy conditions that 
              resulted when they brought the zone down to &quot;fix&quot; certain 
              encounters.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>OK, let's now travel to the very recent past, this weekend to be 
              specific. Two emperor kills netted us a significant amount of rifts, 
              which meant VT was on the horizon. Saturday night's server crash 
              meant we had some stuff to kill, and that stuff happened to be in 
              VT.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>First named in VT for DA and SS down, grats to Wildaan and Kaisi 
              on their items of ownage. </p>
            <p>Sunday was just something amazing. The pictures don't tell the 
              whole story.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>I know Itraer isn't uber, but shit, it died to the steamroller 
              we were yesterday. There's some other stuff we killed (stuff that 
              makes Cursed spawn, High Priest, Insanity Crawler. Yes, the Insanity 
              Crawler. I've taken enough pictures of things that look like the 
              stuff I clean out of my cat's litterbox to last me a lifetime, so 
              no more pictures of nasty looking worms for joo. I think some Rhags 
              died too, but they are poosae and really don't count).</p>
            <p>Anyway, we came, we saw, we conquered, blah blah blah. And of course, 
              people said funny stuff that I'll be posting right about...now.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Oh yes, Chadd is back, which explains why I now know about the 
              Left Nut Award.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>And this is the shit you get when you fall asleep in Vex Thal.</p>

              Saturday - September 7, 2002 - Demana Azulene </p>
            <p>TWO DAYS AND TWO CHERRIES POPPED</p>
            <p>There are not words to describe how much this hurts:</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>However, pain makes you beautiful, and it makes you want to try 
              again.</p>
            <p>This morning, a groggy crew, complete with coffee and bagels, stumbled 
              into Ssra with one thing in mind--this fucking snake is going to 
              die. Weeks of practice for this encounter, and the years that the 
              Divine Alliance and Shadowed Soul have worked together like a well-oiled 
              machine have once again paid off:</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Vex Thall, here we come!</p>
            <p>We've really been on a roll lately--we warmed up for our Emperor 
              deflowering with yet another alliance first on Friday night:</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>So, in addition to our usual killing sprees, we've added two more 
              notches to our virtual bedpost in two days. Not too shabby for our 
              comparatively small alliance. Judge us by our size, do you? That 
              would be a mistake, eh?</p>
            <p>Of course, I have some quotations for you. Unfortunately, resident 
              sexy ranger Chadd has been off in the land of the real the past 
              few weeks, so you will have to make do with DA's resident perverts, 
              Vermithraxx and Sanuvin.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>

              most uber level 59 bard in EQ!!!!</p>

            <p>We ran off to the Deep today to see exactly how some of these mobs 
              were affected by the resist change patch. The burrower beast, being 
              straight melee, we didn't notice any change. However, our melee 
              decided to play &quot;ring around the rosy&quot; with the giant 
              worm. Three laps around the lair, then as a final climax, they decided 
              to tree him on the center spire. It was a proud moment.</p>

              Day 177 &amp; 178 - Knife Edge<br>
              Monday was another exp,shard,key,ore love fest. So I'll say no more.</p>
            <p>Tuesday was a scheduled attempt at the Emperor now that he was 
              &quot;fixed&quot; and spawned again. Since blood was killed earlier 
              for some reason, we got to wait around a little while (ok, a bloody 
              long while) until the Place Holder blood spawned. That was around 
              11:30 I think, and we had already spent 3 1/2 hours up on the 3rd 
              floor waiting around killing stuff just to pass the time and get 
              some insignia's. Well, suffice it to say, Blood spawns, we get buffed 
              and move and kill and slaughter and hold and kill and slaughter 
              and Blood dies pretty much like he always dies. Then the sekret 
              tactics of sacraficing a ranger failed! Because I lived through 
              the weaponshield, lived to get off the rampage list, and then proceeded 
              to go LD everytime I tried to log back in. I think the no death 
              made the Gods unhappy and they saw fit to keep me out of the fight 
              one way or the other ;(</p>
            <p>Anyway, it was a very bloody kill for us, but those are the most 
              exciting, and you balance on a knife edge, death on one side, victory 
              on the other and we kept falling to deaths side, but somehow through 
              sheer willpower and determination, we did our balancing act well 
              until the final percent where we tipped to victory. If you think 
              fights in everquest are ever boring, you missed a great one last 
              night, I think its why people play the game, to get to witness a 
              momment like that, sure there are other momments you want, flawless 
              kills, perfect execution, but sometimes its refreshing to know that 
              you might not win. Most of the fights we do other then Emp are fights 
              that we pretty much walk through, even cursed now.</p>
            <p>Anyway, great fight, great victory and a few more lovely vex thal 
              pieces for all, soon you'll see us in Vex Thal, I'm still willing 
              to give my soul or 10k (which ever is deemed to be worth more) for 
              a Maidens Eye Shard, send me tells if they drop, I'll come running!<br>

              Day 172 to 176 - Hungry like the wolf</p>
            <p>Lets see, where to start. Spent Wednesday, Thursday camping shards, 
              key pieces, ore or exping I think, I can't remember that far back, 
              but I'm sure we did something interesting to someone. I like that 
              description, for it gets me out of having to think about what we 
              really did, as I'm sure someone found something done those days 
              interesting, so its not like I'm lieing! Then we killed the Arch 
              lich on Satruday and did a little romp through North ToV since most 
              of the hard dragons were dead, we did kill a paladin dragon so thats 
              always a plus.</p>
            <p>We were going to attempt the Emp in Ssra this weekend, but just 
              before we were going to up top, the zone comes a crashing down and 
              when it came back up, we were told the Emp (and apparently Lord 
              Seru is like this now too) was going to be perma killed till they 
              fix something, probably something about him being slowalbe with 
              70% I guess. Oh well, when he comes back up we'll go kill him anyway.</p>

            <p>Sunday night was spent in the Deep doing the Burrower Beast Ring 
              and THO, both somewhat ahh, snoreable but some stuff dropped and 
              I'm sure someone had fun! We didn't wipe out so thats a plus :) 
              Only hate for the deep.</p>

              Day 171 - Woke up this Morning...</p>
            <p>You'd think Verant would say, &quot;Hmm, they spent 2 months camping 
              Emperor key pieces, maybe we shouldn't make the Vex Thal Key so 
              tough?&quot; but instead they go, &quot;Hmm, they only spent 2 months 
              camping Emperor key pieces, I think we have to make this Vex Thal 
              Key alot tougher&quot;. And thus begins the crusade for little toothpick 
              sizes pieces of wood scattered all about the land, and now I wish 
              I'd had started camping these things when Luclin first came out, 
              wait wait sorry, when they first fixed the key quest about a few 
              months into luclin.</p>
            <p>Some of the camps can actually be interesting, you get a little 
              bit of the exp while wasting away minutes, then hours of the day 
              hopeing more then 1 shard will drop because you usually have 5 other 
              people with you that all have better dice them you. But at least 
              its done in the company of good people. I'm sure you'll hear me 
              keep on bitching about the shard camps until I get my remaining 
              5, then I'll suddenly get all happy about the situation and probably 
              never speak of it again, but until then : </p>

              Saturday, September 14th, 2002 - Kyrthor Can't Come to the update 
              right now... <br>
              Posted by: [Thund] on September 15th, 2002 @ 07:14 AM</p>
            <p>&#133;but if you leave your name and phone number he&#146;ll get 
              back to you as soon as possible.</p>
            <p>Ok, I admit it. I&#146;m nervous. This is my first time updating 
              the web page. Will I get the facts right? Can I spell better than 
              Jenka, the paladin of love and random typing? Will I get edited 
              by our fearless leader because I sound like Darious after he stubs 
              his toe? Will Kyrthor escape the handcuffs I have him in and update 
              before me? These questions and more will be answered below, fearless 
              readers&#133;</p>
            <p>Today we went into Vex Thal with a raid and went after named for 
              the first time. Let me say I am still full of afterglow here. It 
              was FUN not knowing what is around the next corner. It was FUN wondering 
              where Kaacee wandered off to this time and what was he gonna bring 
              back. But most of all, it was FUN to do this on the first try&#133;<br>
              To the other bosses in Vex Thal count this as a warning. Your days 
              are numbered. Make your reservations at the Freeport Holiday Inn 
              Express now. </p>
            <p>(&#147;Did you survive fighting Shadowed Soul and Divine Alliance?&#148; 
              <br>
              &#147;No, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night.&#148;)</p>
            <p>We&#146;re coming, we have a cannon, we have ammo, but most importantly&#133;</p>
            <p>We have style.</p>
            <p>These just in... (Yeah, yeah, I know they're late)</p>

            <p> Sunday, September 8th, 2002 - 2 Days, 2 Guilds, 2 Emporers, 1 
              Result <br>
              Posted by: [Kyrthor] on September 8th, 2002 @ 06:53 PM<br>
              There he is, take a good look.</p>
            <p>That is the body of the 'non-gimped' emporer. VI pooched the patch 
              this week and made him way easier to kill than he should have been. 
              So, amid the screaming cries of all the guilds that had entered 
              Vex Thal across the game, they took the zone down last night and 
              fixed their mistake. Fixed it fairly well, too.</p>
            <p>Of course, that left pansy snake up for us this morning and we 
              just couldn't let that go by. So again, we got up earlier than human 
              beins should on a Sunday morning and went and paid a visit. Again 
              we had 70 folks, and again it was overkill, for which we feel a 
              bit guilty. But as I said before, how you gonna tell someone they 
              can't go? So we went and made a party of it.</p>
            <p>To correct for their previous errors, VI gave the emporer a nice 
              new flurry lag attack that chased others out of the zone, but we 
              weren't havin it. We took the emporer, continuous lag spikes and 
              all. Another proud moment, now on to some more....</p>
