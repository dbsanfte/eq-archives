              Congratulations are in order to all of us yet again as we cut
              the giants of the Great Divide down to bite size pieces.</p>
            <p>CoG and VdV triumphed once again adding one more to the ranks
              of the ring bearers.</p>
            <p>Gratz to Jaxis (me) on the Ring of Dain Frostweaver. Thank you

            <p>Sorry....I was wiped after the war and logged before I found out
              what happened to the Eye of Narandi. There was bad news about the
              Faceguard as you'll read about in the Coldain Rings thread under

              Since some guild that shall remain nameless gimped out on their
              turn in NTOV we went ahead and jumped in there. One night of flawless
              dragon slaying yielded the following loots. I swear a guild raid
              on Crushbone would have been harder.</p>
            <p>Devabriel got: Vyemm's Fang &amp; Amulet of Storm</p>

            <p>Missycat got: Shiny Metallic
              Pantaloons</p>            <p>Hijinks got: Circlet of Summer</p>

              Posted by: Chantress on Friday, October 24, 2003<br>
              <br>
              For those of you who dont know, there has been a long time war
              between those people who like to think they are good pullers (what
              i actually mean here is anyone other than a proficeint enchanter)
              and Enchanters. You see, for some reason these &quot;pullers&quot; continually
              try to &quot;challenge&quot; Enchanters. Take for our example tonite,
              the one and only Proetus. While he has pulled nice trains before
              that have wiped raids, nothing he could do could match the crowd
              controlling force of the Crimson Talon Enchanters! Proetus, being
              the clown that he is decides that since he is a monk he will pull
              half of PoI on top of us. No problem. As a matter of fact we were
              so involved in this unsung duo of Enchanters and &quot;pullers&quot; we
              ended up having to change targets. Skip ahead to BoT. Loot was
              had, bosses were killed. Grats Alone and Drakefyre on yer new shoulder
              items. Links below. Major props to Awll, this is truely one of
              the servers great clerics. He had the tireless duty of keeping
              me alive tonite, and as always he was up to the task. If you have
              never had the pleasure of grouping with Awll, you are truely missing
              out.</p>

              Once again the brave forces of the Crimson Talon charged into the
              lair of the goddess of nightmares herself. This time there were
              some new travelers that decided to tag along. For those who dont
              know we often welcome visitors to join our raids, and this night
              was no exception. While it took quite a bit more effort and a TON
              more patience we not only got a few more of our members flagged,
              but some lucky visitors as well. On top of this, we had the pleasure
              of getting upgraded rings for Hattrick and Denor. Grats!</p>

              <br>It seems the foces of Crimson Talon can not be stopped when they
              put their mind to something. Take the hedge for example. Tonite
              was a night where we back flagged some new mmebers and even a few
              guests. First time up, we all port in every thing is great.....but
              Poxbourne decides not to show up for the party. Blasted SoE and
              its buggy content. So we try again. Whaddya know. Same thing. Not
              wanting to let the whole night go to waste we give it one last
              shot, and lo and behold Poxbourne decides to go through his nightmare
              with us. Twas a night of fun and adventure once it finally got
              going. Nothing stood in our way, and only the drunken cleric Dragu
              got run over to the point of death. Grats to Drakefyre onyour
              sword and Grats Guildbank on another dagger with which to slay
            that hottie in the nightie!</p>

              Having hastily dropped off the corpse of Grummus, our good friend
              Earl rushed away from the Crimson Talon Farm Department. Being
              in such a hurry for fear of what the gnomes might do to him, he
              made a wrong turn and stumbled upon nothing other than the forces
              of Crimson Talon Escorting the Gnome! Slamming on the breaks, with
              his tires screaching he raced in the opposite direction only to
              have the gnome and Crimson Talon following him. In his state of
              panic he didnt even notice what was in front of him until he had
              already run into it. Needsless to say the first snack of our favorite
              mechanical dragon was none other than Earl. God rest his soul.
              Well the good forces of Crimson Talon could not stand for this
              and immediately slayed the foul beast with all haste. Poor Earl.
              Xanamech was kind with the loots, Grats to Khallin and a big thank
              you to Denor for showing what Crimson Talon is all about. For those
              of you not familiar with us, we divide up all loot on a /random
              based system. Denor won the roll on the ring and graciously passed
            it off to Khallin.</p>
            <p>Truely an admirable act. Grats to Alone on his
              well deserved 41% haste neck item! </p>            <p><a href="http://defenderskerraridge.tripod.com/dokr/index.html"><b>Defenders

                The Lady Vox raid today went extremely well. We had some issues
                clearing the extras out of her lair beforehand, leading to a
                few corpse recoveries, and corpse recovery-recoveries. Once we
                got everything cleaned out though, the &quot;twink brigade&quot; went
                into action, doing what they do best. We lost a few near the
                end, but Vox went down hard, on our first attempt. Unfortunately
                she didn't drop any epic pieces, but we did get a couple nice
                drops, as well as hides which have already been turned into ID3
            cloaks.</p>  
            <p>Here's a shot of Triste using her new heal spell over the dragon's

                The Plane of Hate raid today went pretty well. We had two full

                in turn let us see just how well a 52 wizard can melee, thanks

                Last weekend we spent some time working on the Beastlord epic
                  for Norleef and Demitus. Here's most of the gang before we
                  killed Frosty the Snowbear. You can see we even busted out
                  Mcdizzor
                  for this, and Mewzak (the new guy (but not like the movie))

    Plane of Justice; Trials of the Executioner.<br>

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
    Tonight, Leyl, Averys Nox, Mistofelees, Marvpur, Arkinon and myself lead
    the fight to the Plane of Justice. Here we were tested on our team skills
    and cordination. We attempted the trials four times. In the end we made it
    to the final stage of the Trial. In the end we failed four times, but the
    experence and the rewards out weighted the loss. We hope to continue next
    friday. Our first alternate in the trials is Alleey. She waited several hours
    for her abilites to be used, but since we never succeed her patiance was
    never tested. Once we pass the test we will begin changing the members of
    the group, so all of us have a chance to experence the Trial. thank you Alleey
    for being so patient with us.</p>

              Mortalist looked over the halls of the Legion. Many of the beds
                were empty these nights, many had fled or been slain in the last
                few months. The Legion was growing lean. Those that remained
                were the strongest.A small teirdal child rushed to the side of
              Mortalist. Mortalist signaled the boy to speak.<br>
              <br>
              Master, the Shadow
              Knight and Wizard approach as ordered. They will be here shortly,
              the boy choked on the words as
              he witnessed the dark erudite enter the room. Followed by the infamous
              Executioner of Nox.</p>
            <p>Mortalist turned to address the two soldiers.<br>
              <br>
              Shamrior, it has been rumored you have spread the word
              you wish my demise, quickly raised his hand as the wizard
            tried to object.</p>
            <p>I find that...Interesting. Mortalist turned
              to face the teirdal.<br>
              <br>
              &quot;Averys, our problems are well know amongst the Legion.
                  Your desire to see me dead has never been stronger then in
              the last few months.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Mortalist stopped to watch the shadow
              knight nod in agreement.</p>            <p>Amongst all of the Legion currently you two want my death
              more then most. For that reason, I am adding you two to my Tribunal
              Militia.&quot;</p>
                  <p> Mortalist stopped as he watched both individuals
                stare at him in amazement.<br>
                <br>
                    &quot;The way I see things, if you want me to fail then
                  you will prove to all the others how much better at being officers
                  then I am. You will lead better hunts, and kill greater foes.
                  Your enthusiasm to see me fail will drive you and the Legion
                  to greater
                heights.&quot; Mortalist turned his back on the two.</p>
              <p>&quot;Before you try and tell me neither of you will accept this
              role, remember it is not your place to accept. This is not a reward
                its a curse.&quot;</p>
              <p> With a wave of the hand 
          Mortalist excused both
                  of the new officers.</p>              <p>Now, go forth and tell your soldiers we are moving soon.
              Tonight will be one of the last nights the Legion remains behind
            the safe walls of this castle.<br>

              Like it says there in the title.....the Cazic-Thule server moon
                race is over (what, is it too soon?). We have landed on Quarm,
                planted our flag, declared him verdant farmland and are now masters
                of all we survey.</p>
            <p>As you'll recall when we last left our intrepid heroes, they were
              powering through phase 5 like all get out. We had 3 of the gods
              down with just Inny to go. Unfortunately, with the way timing works
              on these phases we just got ourselves in a hole on him and couldn't
              beat him before our rotation ended. Knowing you'll get it next
              time isn't much solace when you end up having to wait almost two
              weeks to get to Quarm for want of engaging Innoruuk 30 seconds
              late. However, it was our lot and we knew what our next pass at
              the zone would bring.</p>
            <p>We arrived in Time on Monday alongside our allies The Divine Alliance
              and pulled our quad-fecta again, first four phases all in one pass
              without hiccup. We came back on Tuesday and dropped all of phase
              5 in one shot. including Mr Hate Miser....</p>
            <p><img src="innycorpse.jpg" width="309" height="85"></p>
            <p>So there we were, facing Quarm and about to find out what we were
              made of. How did that process of discovery go? 73%, 18%, 23%, dead.
              It's a wild fight, but we blasted it down nearly straight off like
              so much else we've found here. Which of course means that we freed
              Zebuchanezzar, reset the matrix and let Tangor play his favorite
              game....Alien Anal Probe.</p>
            <p><img src="Zeb.jpg" width="300" height="562"></p>
            <p><br>
              So there you have it, Mr and Mrs America (and all the ships at
                sea). The war is over, victory has been claimed, and we now return
                to our rural farm life secure in the knowledge that we are the
                biggest, baddest, meanest mothers in the valley. Now, were are
                those buxom milk maids?</p>
            <p>Happy VEQ day!</p>

            <p>Poor Tierra, once Tuxy departed for adventures in other lands,
              she had no gnomes to keep her company. Wanting our guildmate to
              be happy, we searched Norrath for someone to keep her company.
              After much searching, we could not find another gnome (personally,
              I don&#8217;t think the paladins really took this quest seriously)&#8230;but
            we were able to find another necromancer</p>
            <p>Please welcome our newest
                Full Member, Kithov. <br>

              Like last time, we took him down in 1 flawless try (well a ranger
                bit it but who cares). Hes is officially farm status.</p>
            <p>These shields look quite nice with our new orange trend I might
