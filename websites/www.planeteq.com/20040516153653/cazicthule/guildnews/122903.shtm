            An Evening of Relaxation...  <br>
            Posted by Naezariit On Dec 10 2003 At 06:03:20 AM <br>
CoG swept into Torden, the Bastion of Thunder, with murder in their eyes and
ice in their veins. Auliffe Chaoswind had been plotting the destruction of CoG,
and we'd overheard. We moved swiftly, and demonstrated the error of his ways
to him in short order. Gratz to Draconal on the Wind Wand or what'sit. and to
Cyke on his first loot as a CoG, a somewhat humble little lance, Great Staff
of the Four Winds, hehehe. Then we joined VdV to lay the Avatar of War low. Weak
drops, but gratz to Golil on his Sleeper's Key part. Don't recall who won the
HoRZ, but our evening wasn't over yet. We moved to Dragon Necropolis to avenge
the Spawn of Harla Dar, alas poor Frakadar, I knew him well....Zlandicar the
Cannibal was laid low in short order by crack assault teams from CoG, and delivered
some very nice drops. Gratz to Khalimari on her Sleeper Key part, Bladestrike
on a new wpn, Landarsdorfer on a very nice First Brood Talisman, which upon receiving,
passed his old neck to Bladestrike, gratz again Blade. Tokun was awarded the
Very Heart of the beast, while I delivered Frakadar's talisman back to his progenitor,
Harla Dar, for which I was awarded the Shroud of the Dar Brood.
            <p>Great Night CoG...Looking forward to more like it!</p>
            <p>forgive me if I left loots out, was a lot to cover....</p>

  Killed a couple of BOT tower bosses last night, lots of loot, lots of fun,
  after a slow and deadly start (just getting up there proved more challenging
  than the actual boss slaying ;/)</p>

            HoH trial part 2 <br>
            Posted by: Chantress on Tuesday, December 23, 2003 - 01:30 AM (4
            Reads) <br>
            <br>
            So with daily patches, we of course found the HoH trial triggers
            up, and gave it a go. First trial went off almost flawlessly. The
            second was a bit more of an adventure. None the less, grats to Wynndy
            on the shoulders and grats to Romell on the mask, and grats to everyone
            who got spectrals and that windblade. Nice loots and a fun time had.
            More importantly we learned our strategies were sound, and just needed
            one minor tweak for an easy win.  
            <p><br>
              If you follow the exploits of Crimson Talon often, we are glad
                to have you, and want to wish you a very happy holiday season.
                As you are aware we are a casual guild, and will likely be taking
                this week off to be with our families. RL before EQ always and
            Merry Christmas to all!<br>

            <p>Cursed NTOV <br>
              Posted by: Chantress on Saturday, December 20, 2003<br>
              <br>
              So, you thought the news from yesterday was grim. HA! Nothing
                  compared with what I'm about to share with you now. Lets all
                  give a special thanks to Sony
    for screwing up yet another patch and the server having to come down for
                  a fix. This basically put us in the same scenario as the previous
                  night, having
    to kill the crappy dragons at the front of NTOV so that we get to the good
    ones farther in. So we tackle this hurdle tonight with greater ease and get
    yet more craptacular loot (grats to the winners). Then just as we are hitting
    our stride and about to OWN Lord Vyemm....the zone crashes. As if this werent
    bad enough, when it finally came back online we were all back in Roy's lair
    and Roy was up. Needless to say the only two people who got out were the
                  two wizards who banged their instant nexus gate AA button as
                  soon as they logged
    in. GM rezzes....yeah right! No thanks, we dont need to wait 6 hours so we
    can get what we deserve for sony screwing over our raid. Thanks to our dedicated
    friends for getting our corpses summoned and hanging around until everyone
    was rezzed and out. Your work is greatly appreciated. </p>
            <p>NTOV Patch day <br>
              Posted by: Chantress on Friday, December 19, 2003 - 06:01 AM<br>
              <br>
  Hi, and welcome to patch day. I will be your tour guide for today. Today Sony
  decided to implement a nice new discipline system. This new system requires
  all melees go buy books and read them. Now we all know that melees are not
  casters for a reason (they dont read so good). Not only did sony decide to
  make this complicated system (for melees) they did it during the holidays when
  casual guilds typically have lower attendance. That coupled with the timely
  release of LOTR3....well you get the picture, practically no one was online
  tonite. Fortunately those who were, were outstanding players that are very
  capable of executing without panicking in dire situations. So we took our meager
  25, or was it 24 or 23 due to excessive patch day LDs, to NToV to honor our
  first day of our rotation. Thanks to flawless execution (even though most of
  our melees had not read their books so we didnt have disciplines) we still
  held our ground and killed Roy and his kinsmen. Grats rot and alts and allternate
  use items. We got a bunch of crap tonite, the good stuff will come tomorrow. </p>

              Showing its customary tenacity, the forces of the Crimson Talon
              successfully completed the guild's first Halls of Honor trial.
              Led by the intelligent leadership of Chantress, the raid force
              hung in there to lay low the foes that stood before us. Grats to
              Devabriel on Platoon Leaders Pauldrons &amp; grats to Altus (steered
              in to loot by Khallin as there were no monks / beast there, hehe)
            on Hand of Honor.</p>

              <br>
  The combined talents of Crimson Talon beat down wave after wave of wurms in
  the Deep and even the boss wurm died with only a couple of deaths. We did all
  this with 30 people rather than the usual 50 needed for this event. </p>

              SSubmitted by Fairsong on 12/18/03... Again we extend a warm welcome
              to all our newest members. Gwendan, Celtin, Feni, Aarlorn, Azziz,
              Bakson, Arhok, Drego, and Letais. Sorry but I know I misssed some
              of ya.</p>
            <p>Huge Grats to Quiinn who finished his epic last night. We teamed
              up with Servants of the Void and moved to City of Mist to wrap
              this up for Quiinn. The castle was bit crowded as Children of Tunare
              was there farming JR's. We finally moved into position only to
              find another group had raced in and killed our target mob just
              minutes before we were ready for turn in. Well we left CoM to go
              farm some pieces in PoS while we waited on the respawn. After a
              2 hour wait Quiinn and 3 groups of us began moving back to CoM
              only to find it camped again. This time the group that was there
              invited Quiinn to stick around while they waited for the respawn
              and gave him help finishing up his last pieces of his epic. So
              grats to Quiinn and his new pig sticker.</p>
            <p>We have been camping in PoS quite abit as we gear up to get everyone
              flagged for many of the PoP zones. Named giants have been dropping
              faster than empty beer bottles lately, and many packs smell from
              the rotted flesh of heads,bones,beards and the bloody sashes. </p>
            <p>The attitude has changed quite a bit and I think its due to the
              spiffy new guild colors. More and more of us are sporting the official
            DoKR attire in the new winter color collection.</p>

            <p>The breakfast club has been farming HoH for windblades, exp, and
              parchments. Its been very successfull this month and its usually
              not to crowded.</p>

              Submitted by Fairsong on 12/09/03... Welcome aboard to Shimmor,
                Meeshan and Reftnel. All 3 are great people and have adopted
                our home as theirs.</p>
            <p>We decided to do some PoJ trials last night and I must say it
              went extremely smooth. With the help of Develish, we managed to
              get 7 people flagged in only 3 attempts. Congrats to Rylog, Syklopz,
              Gaarbage, Dizok, Seudian, and Katslayer for completing thier trials.
              A combo of 4 melee, 1 chanter and 1 shaman proved to be the smoothest
              combo Ive seen yet.</p>
            <p>ToV called again so we responded to the urge and put a proper
              beat down on da Dragons. It was raining plate parts till Quiinn
              spoke up and put in a his order for chain, funny how it seemed
              to work.</p>
            <p>Andorean scored a BP.<br>
              Katslayer picked up boots.<br>
              Zbar went home with a Chain Tunic<br>
              Quiinn a chain bracer.<br>
              Shimmor silk gloves.<br>
              The bank got silk gloves.<br>
              Androcet got Plate helm. </p>
            <p>Submitted by Fairsong on 12/05/03... Welcome aboard Quiinn, Androcet,
              and Gwendan. Glad to have you guys join us on our merry adventures.
              BTW your guild dues are late, plz put the check in the mail if
              you havent.</p>
            <p>Stormed into ToV with Mortalist in tow. PoV arrived around the
              same time so we decided to punch into the zone a bit deeper. Androcet
              did a good job pulling for us, this was his first time pulling
              and it went pretty well. After we settled into a camp the loots
              started dropping at a good rate. Plate Bracers were falling like
              candy as we walked away with 6 of them.<br>
              Grokster - Silk Helm and Poison Symbol<br>
              Gaarbage - Leather arms, leather bracer, leather gloves<br>
              Katslayer - Plate Arms, plate gloves, plate bracer<br>
              Swadi - Plate bracer,<br>
              Androcet - Plate bracer, plate gloves<br>
              Fairsong - Leather legs.</p>
            <p>The clan gathered up for an assault on Chardok B. After a rough
              start with a few deaths and link deaths we began to roll. Quiinn
              did some good pulling for us while we were setting up and it continued
              through out the night as we pulled in batches of 2,3 and 4 sometimes.
              Picked up a few upgrades for some peeps, grats to Beninayi.</p>
            <p>Small groups of us have been wrecking Velks for shawl items, Kael
              arena for faction, Hate just because, Pos for diaku and BoT parts,
              Bot for hella experience, as well as PoV, and HoH for girdles and
              windblades.</p>
            <p>More and more of us have adopted the new guild colors. Keep on
            looking stylish guys and gals.</p>

                  the WR bag again,
                  a bard horn (which went to the guild bank because the only
                  bard on the raid already had one), and two (yes, two!) RBBs. </p>            <p>Here's a shot of Vox's corpse. Renegade, our lone non-guild raid

            News: Final post for the year <br>
posted on 12-17-2003 03:33 PM by Larry <br>
<br>
              Well this will be my final News post of the year, and probably
                the last one on this site until January unless someone goes renegade
            like Thornsong again and posts something.</p>
            <p>Looking back across the year many wonderful things have happened
              in game for our little guild. We beat Planes of Power, we survived
              the summer exodus and we did it all with respect for each other.
              But you know what? That means nothing to me right now. This is
              a game and we need to put it in perspective. So if you would grant
              me this opportunity I would like to talk about what really matters
              in the real world.</p>
            <p>What matters is we have many members of our roster that are currently
              serving in the armed forces. I am so thankful for all of them.
              But I am gonna focus on one in particular right now.</p>
            <p> Almost a year ago we lost one of our most beloved Paladins in
              the guild to the military. He left our little fantasy world to
              pack up his gear and gun and head to Iraq. His name is Venid. Venid
              has done more for each of us than most of us can ever repay in
              a lifetime. As we play this game and run in and out of AE spells,
              he is over in the deserts of Iraq running in and out of bullets
              and grenades. As we trek through LDON dungeons dodging traps, he
            is driving vehicles across Iraq dodging roadside bombs and ambushes.</p>
            <p>Put in perspective what we do in our fantasy world means nothing.
              Venid and every other soldier fighting for this country, so we
              can play some cheesy game and complain about it, are the heros
              that I want my kids to look up to.</p>
            <p>Venid is coming home to us soon. So as you walk your avatar across
              this fantasy world called Everquest and you see this great paladin
              Venid strolling along, I hope you would pause and think about the
              sacrifices he made in real life, the bullets he dodged, the bombs
              he avoided all so we can sit at home for 8 hours a day in front
              of a stupid computer game and have fun.</p>
            <p>Our prayers for your safety are with you Venid every day. Thank
              you for what you and every other soldier does for this country.</p>
            <p>Lee Greenwood says it best:<br>
              quote:<br>
              --------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
              And I gladly stand up,<br>
              next to you and defend her still today.<br>
&#8216;
              Cause there ain&#8217;t no doubt I love this land,<br>
            God bless the USA.</p>
            <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
            <p>Happy Holdidays Venid, and Thank you! </p>

              Congratulations go out to the Final Four. The Relentless has ran
                a fantasy football league of 16 teams and it comes down to Dorrin
            vs Ghoat and Thornsong vs Assassin in round 2 of the playoffs.</p>
            <p>All four of these people did remarkably well considering how slim
              the pickings were in this league with the widespread talent pool.
              Assassin actually had a week where he started Arlen Harris and
              Stacey Mack at RB, that's how thin it got sometimes.</p>
            <p>I am also impressed how every team stuck in there and was managed
              so well. No one &quot;gave up&quot; in the league as happens so
              often in other leagues.</p>
            <p>Grats to all four, they all finish &quot;in the money.&quot; We
              shall see if I can defend my title successly, although Assassin's
              team is coming on strong and it will be tough. </p>
            <p>For those football fans, here is the rundown:</p>
            <p>Ghoat's Girls (9-6) PManning, EGeorge, KBarlow, MMuhammad, KRobinson,
              JReed, FJones, DAkers, and Panthers DST</p>
            <p>vs.</p>
            <p>Dorrin aka Ranger Rules (8-7) DMcNabb, TDuckett, JLewis, DDriver,
              DBranch, ABoldin, TGonzalez, RLongwell and Eagles DST</p>
            <p>and</p>
            <p>Assassin aka St Louis Sheep (9-6) MBulger, MFaulk, SDavis, RWayne,
              CJohnson, JHorn, EKinney, JWilkins, and Vikings DST Can we say
              Rams fan</p>
            <p>vs.</p>
            <p>Thornsong aka Adana Freedom Fighters (12-3) TGreen, LTomlinson,
              KFaulk, MHarrison, HWard, MBooker, BWilliams, MVanderjaqt and the
              greatest football team in the land Raiders DST </p>
            <p>Good luck to all except Assassin </p>

            <p>We will be shutting down the SS recruitment system for the holidays
              as we expect things to be pretty slow until after the new year.
              Thats not exactly fair to our applicants nor is it a real reflection
              of what life as an SS recruit would really be like either. I encourage
              all interested parties of all classes to continue to use the lead
              form during this time to submit your name for consideration after
              the new year. We should have a cleared applicant queue at that
              point and will likely start a sizable class through the system
              again depending on our needs and available leads. We'll see you
              then!</p>

            <p> Sunday, December 14th, 2003 - Evil Lurks (F Dominos!) <br>
              Posted by: [Pirotess] on December 15th, 2003 @ 05:14 AM </p>
            <p>Some of you may know that I recently purchased a new PC from Alienware.
              If you didnt now you do. The PC arrived a week ago Friday but I've
              been too busy to reconfigure my entire deskspace till this weekend.
              With our rotation in Time starting Friday, it wasnt easy finding
              time to do it this weekend either but finally on Sunday night I
              did. I figured while I was moving everything around I would order
              a quick dinner from Dominos so I didnt have to mess up any dishes
              or cook. Within minutes my chicken kickers, cheesy bread and a
              2 liter of coke was on its way. Yah yah, some healthy food you
              say? I say stick it in yer ear since I've lost quite a few pounds
              in the last month so can afford to splurge.</p>
            <p>Anyway where were we? Ahh yes setting up the PC. So I take the
              time to actually run the wires through the channel grooves in my
              desk and keep the excess wire tiewrapped so it doesnt all get tangled
              up. I get everything setup just perfect and start to wonder where
              my food is when the doorbell finally rings. I swear to you I felt
              the air grow colder as I approached the door and thought I heard
              a faint evil chuckle as I turned the doorknob. Since it was blizzarding
              outside and windy as hell I just chalked it up to a draft and my
              stomach growling. I quickly collected my loot from the delivery
              man, tipped him handsomely (25%) for braving the elements on this
              evil night and trotted back over to my desk area. I had a good
              deal of clear space on the one half of my desk that I had not setup
              yet so I deposited my dinner loot there. I pulled up a chair so
              I could browse the net while I ate and cracked open the bottle
              of coke. After a couple swigs I placed it on the desk and moved
              it far into the corner so I wouldnt knock it over.</p>
            <p>Eventually I finished up my dinner and decided it was time to
              move my firewall over to the new deskspace. Unfortunately the wires
              were tangled up something fierce from all the adjustments I had
              done over the course of the last 12 months and it took some effort
              to get it unwound and finally in position under the wireless access
              point. At this point horror movie goers watching the B-flick unfolding
              behind me would have been screaming at me not to turn around. Of
              course like any good B-flick actor in a horror film you always
              turn around when you shouldnt and so up came the curtain on our
              show. If you are at all faint of heart or hate seeing bad things
              happen to good hardware, I suggest you stop reading now.</p>
            <p>I turned to reach for my bottle of coke across the table which
              should have been 4 feet behind me only to bump into something on
              the way over. Unbeknownst to me the bottle of coke had creeped
              up behind me while I was struggling with the firewall cables and
              planted itself squarely in my hands path. Suddenly the world slowed
              as I entered bullet time. As my hand rotated through its arc, synapses
              in my brain fired wildly causing my eyes to widen as I realized
              what was happening. Millions of years of instinct took over my
              reflexes as my brain screamed out in a long drawn out cry of agony.
              I lunged for the falling bottle and caught up with it as it hit
              the seat of my chair. In a millisecond the cold brown liquid began
              flowing out across the leather seat and into the crevices and over
              the edge onto the wood floor. As my hand finally found the neck
              of the bottle to throttle the ever living piss out of it I reversed
              my lunge and quickly righted the bottle.</p>
            <p><br>
              Big Mistake </p>
            <p>Im sure everyone has seen what happens when you shake up a newly
              opened bottle of coke. Im equally sure you've only seen what happens
              when you shake up a Level 1 bottle of coke. Unfortunately for me
              my bottle of coke was a L65 Arch Squirter and had opened a dimensional
              gateway to the local coke distributer because he had far more firepower
              and material to spend than any NORMAL BOTTLE OF COKE!! As the bottle
              was righted a column of foam shot 5 feet in the air I shit you
              not. The look on my face must have been classic because I can recall
              the shock I felt when I saw that. So what do you do impulsively
              when you see a bottle shooting off like that? Of course you cover
              it as best you can.</p>
            <p>Streams of coke started shooting everywhere around my fingers
              now covering the top of the coke. I saw a stream headed toward
              my new speakers and quickly spun myself and the bottle around. </p>
            <p>Not fast enough. $%#$!</p>
            <p>I think I heard the bottle on its radio back to base calling that
              mission objective number one had been accomplished. I started to
              move away from the desk area but stubbed my toe on the filing cabinet
              in front of me. As pain blossomed in my mind my hand jarred loose
              and a sizable stream of coke flew up my nose. If any of you have
              ever belched after drinking a coke and had it come out your nose
              instead of your mouth you know how coke shot up your nose feels.
              Dazed from the critical strike the coke bottle had just landed
              I half turned back the way I had come and that was when the coke
              bottle launched its final ... <br>

            <p>Part II</p>
            <p>When we last left off my flight had just been delayed. Now I suppose
              I should clue you all in that on this particular trip I was flying
              Hooters Air. Yes I was expecting a great flight chock full of interesting
              sights and good food. Of course as you know by now I never really
              get what I want so why should my flight be any different? Perhaps
              I had built the flight up a bit in my mind and was expecting too
              much. Either way lets just say flying Hooters Air wasnt as entertaining
              as I thought it would be. First of all my fellow clientel was NOT
              what I expected at all. I had been expecting a largely middle aged
              male clientel with a few wives traveling with their husbands thrown
              in. What actually boarded the plane was mostly families with kids/babies
              and retired people. My age group was actually in the minority by
              a long shot. I puzzled over this for quite a long time as I read
              my Hooters Air magazine and learned more than I ever wanted to
              know about the history of Hooters and its corporate machine. I
              finally settled on the fact that my fellow travelers must have
              found their tickets bargain hunting on one of the many travel websites
              instead of by just seeing the plane on the runway like I had and
              thinking that would be an interesting way to fly. I guess it probably
              didnt help that Hooters rates were half the price of the big name
              carriers since they only fly to a small number of cities at preset
              times thus allowing them to keep costs down. Ah well so I was just
              going to have to deal with a disapproving grandma sitting next
              to me while I oggled the flight attendants. No biggie right?</p>
            <p>Wrong. I couldnt oogle them at all really. The flight attendants
              werent dressed in the typical Hooters uniforms which I suppose
              I should be greatful for. The attendants werent that great looking
              and were in their 40's and 50's. Luckily there were Hooters girls
              in full uniform on the plane but they were more like cheerleaders
              than flight attendants. They did some Hooters trivia questions
              and gave out Hooters Air pins to the people who answered correctly.
              They also passed out drinks and such but I had a hard time (pardon
              the pun) appreciating their uniforms since they looked like they
              were barely legal. Anyway besides a few bouts of babies crying
              the flight down once we got going was fairly uneventful. Since
              the flight had been delayed I didnt get to my destination until
              1:30am but Im used to staying up late anyway.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately the cold weather followed me down like it has on
              EVERY other trip I have been on recently which is pretty annoying.
              Normally its in the 60's and 70's in SC around this time and I
              got it down into the 40's. The good news is it warmed back up the
              day I was heading home. Murphy's law eh? December 1st was the day
              I headed home. I had a nice relaxing morning since I had a late
              flight. I had flown into Myrtle Beach and rented a car for the
              week in Charleston. I decided to leave at 1:30pm for a 4:20 flight
              since its normally a 2 hour drive from Charleston to Myrtle Beach.
              Wouldnt you know it, traffic was horrible and I had to have hit
              every red light between the two cities. I parked the rental car
              at 3:45pm and waited for the Hertz guy to check me in. Naturally
              the battery in the little waist computer they use to do that died
              just as I pulled in so I had to watch him fumble around and put
              in a charged one which took him a good 10 minutes. I should have
              seen the signs right there and extended my vacation right then
              but I didnt. I rushed into the terminal and checked my bag to Newark.
              The lady at the ticket counter told me my seat and then apologized
              for having to give me a middle seat since the flight was very full.</p>
            <p>WARNING! WARNING! Her comment had put me on guard but there wasnt
              much I could do about it so I headed over to my gate. Again I skated
              through security since I take off my belt, shoes and watch and
              never set off the detectors. When I got to the gate a much older
              looking and well endowed Hooters girl was standing there. I walked
              up and asked her if the flight had started boarding yet since I
              was cutting it kind of close. Plus I wanted to see if she would
              give me a vacant no ones home look or maybe have a spark of intelligence.
              Apparently company regulations prevent a Hooters girl from talking
              since the gate attendant who was male answered for her. Mildly
              annoyed I considered telling him I hadnt been talking to him but
              I didnt want to get on the Hooters girls difficult customer list
              so I just thanked them both and took a seat. Twenty minutes later
              when we should have been taking off we finally started boarding.
              They boarded from the rear of the plane as usual and my seat was
              6E. It took them 20 more minutes before they called seats 1-8 and
              I was wondering just how decrepit some of the passengers must have
              been to take that long to get settled in. I mean for christ sake
              if you are that old just book a flight on a coffin and save the
              rest of us some ... <br>

            <p>Part I</p>
            <p>Well sports fans, another vacation, another distaster. Long time
              readers might remember my last debacle on July 4th weekend where
              I came home to my wood floor playing lets build tee pees after
              my air conditioner froze up and flooded my apartment. This thanksgiving
              trip was far less damaging to my apartment but far more destructive
              to the good relaxed mood I was in before I headed home.</p>
            <p>The 24th of November dawned innocently enough but I knew I was
              in for a harsh day of work. We'd just moved our offices to a new
              space and were still ironing out the kinks so I figured once I
              mentioned to the general office populace that I would be gone for
              a week, all hell would break loose. Of course work didnt disappoint.
              Between PBX programming, user profile rebuilding, laptop password
              recovering and generally putting out fires left and right I ended
              up leaving work a full half hour later than I had intended. This
              could easily have spelled trouble if I had not factored in 60 minutes
              of extra time from the get go due to my past travel experiences.
              Of course, sometimes even the best layed plans go awry. </p>
            <p>I quickly walked the 3 blocks up the street to the subway and
              rushed down the escalator only to be roadblocked by large Marge
              and her baby carriage halfway down. Now apparently Marge couldnt
              read a godamn sign if I had bludgeoned her to death with it since
              its plastered all over that you're not supposed to take baby carriages
              on the escalators. I decided to keep my exasperation to myself
              though lest I be gobbled up like an early evening snack. Naturally
              while I was fuming behind Marge, I could hear a train leaving the
              station which I could have caught had it not been for the blubber
              bubble. I ground my teeth a bit but tried to keep telling myself
              that every other train was the train I needed so it wouldnt be
              more than 6 or 7 minutes until I could catch my train. Satans work
              number 1 incoming.</p>
            <p>The next train into the station was the E train. No biggie, I
              had a 50% shot of it being the V train I needed. What a surprise
              I got a bad roll. I couldnt help thinking Marge really had kept
              me from catching my train perfectly. Oh well. The E train left
              and 5 minutes later I see what should have been my train. What's
              this? Another E train. $#$%! Since the E and V trains dont split
              until after the next stop I decided to ride that E up a station
              and wait there since it had a larger platform. I boarded the train
              and stood next to a lady who was sitting down staring off into
              space. A good 30 seconds went by before the door bell went off
              signifying that the doors were about to close. Apparently the bell
              cleaved through what must have been a pot encrusted haze and the
              woman suddenly jumped to her feet and threw her purse and foot
              between the closing doors. Amazed I waited for the conductor to
              open the doors and let the female brainiac out but he seemed to
              have taken offense to the interruption and took a good minute before
              he reopened the doors. The wench finally slipped the rest of the
              way out with my mental foot scant inches from her ass. </p>
            <p>At last we started moving. The E train got to the halfway mark
              between the two stations and stopped. I then was treated to an
              ebonics lesson from the conductor which I finally deciphered into &quot;Ladies
              and Gentlemen, due to police business we are being held until further
              notice, thank you for your patience.&quot; Christ almighty! I felt
              like walking up a few cars and really showing him some of my patience
              but figured that would just delay things more. Guess he got a stroke
              of luck there since I was really starting to steam. Ten minutes
              later we pulled into the next station which should have taken all
              of 60 seconds to get into. I got off the E to wait on the third
              train that had to be a V. Naturally all the commuters headed home
              make the conductor open and close the doors no LESS THAN TWENTY
              GODAMN TIMES before he could get them all closed at the same time
              and get the train moving. If I had an uzi right then I would have
              hosed that platform down regardless of the cops 10 feet away conducting
              their police &quot;business&quot; with some loser.</p>
            <p>Finally train number three screamed into the station and whats
              this? A third E train in a row! Mother @#$@! I was seriously hurting
              on time at that point. At last a V train came in and I hurried
              onto it hoping I could make a good transfer to the NJ path which
              would take me under the Hudson river and home. Of course the subway
              wasnt done with me yet. All the stations around the area were snarled
              up and running late because of the police business crap and we
              got halfway between stations and again stopped. Luckily this time
              though Eminem's protege was on the train AND came from the car
              behind us into my car and started &quot;rapping&quot; for us while
              he walked back and forth holding his hat out for cash. Now I dont
              mind rap, I really dont but that was just not the time or place.
            Not only that but I really hate being solicted and the guy ...<br>
