              The arena bash was a huge blast! I was only there for a short while, 
              but I got to show off my Uber wizard skills (uhhh yeah). Everyone 
              had a good time and Lottoman showed up and gave out a few items. 
              Here's the list of who won what:<br>
              Peas - Bloodstained Tunic <br>
              Kasmira - Mistmoore Battle Drums <br>
              Phlite - Bronze Statue of Bathezid <br>

              Sonelron has stepped up to take his place. Remember if you can't

              Posted by: Mirax on Sunday, August 18th, 2002 @ 1:07 PM<br>
            </p>
            <p>Ever have one of those nights when nothing goes right? Chamberlain 
              didn't trust us not to kill Dain, the guards had to keep sticking 
              their noses in to find out what was going on, but finally, he died.</p>
            <p>Of course, our pullers REALLY blew their faction:</p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Then, off to NToV to finish off some dragons.</p>
            <p>Koi dropped a couple bard weapons, grats Pava.</p>
            <p>Getting late, Lady Mir next. Even the raid leader is feeling the 
              lateness of the hour:</p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>3 Frostwraths, WTF?</p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>grats Kulraith on the Sprinkler of Spirits.</p>
            <p>Nev dropped a cloak of thorns for Warlor, her eye for Lrogg and 
              a horn for Rono.<br>

            <p>Thanks Sabvlik. </p>
            <p>Another Emp attempt, figured out quite a bit despite the fact that 
              he rolled over us like Oprah at a Norr's Chuckwagon.</p>
            <p>Someone was talking crazy about some wacky sort of &quot;bane&quot; 
              weapons needed to actually hit the emporor? Whoever heard of such 
              nonsense. </p>
            <p>Nice try, loser...bane weapons, hahaha. Whats next? You gonna sell 
              me some Florida Timeshare?<br>
              <br>
              Why VI Patches... <br>

            </p>
            <p>Because of crap like this...</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>To be honest, the biggest gripe I have with the new UI is the way 
              files are &quot;patched&quot;. As nice as it is to get a free desktop 
              compass, I shouldn't have to open up a XML file and add code by 
              hand simply to keep a previously functional UI from crashing me 
              to the desktop. And if I do crash to desktop...I should remain Linkdead 
              in game, unable to log on, for 30 minutes at a time.</p>
            <p>And guess what, VI...I wasn't the only one dealing with this tonight...</p>
            <p>So...what we killed this week:</p>
            <p>ToV north run with our friends in talons, followed by the IV, Dain, 
              zlandicar, Lendinara, the ever-popular Vyzh'dra the cursed, and 
              some more late night screwing around in ToV North. </p>
            <p>Late night? Why yes it is. Which is why I'm going to bed now. <br>

              This was a sweet kill. MA went LD and we virtually danced into switch 
              to the SA and didn't miss a beat. Telks best drops so far. Gratz 
              to Engress on necklace of nightstalking. /jelous and BG got a BP 
              and uber pally/sk lance. we clubed that guy like Fred Flintstone. 
              yabadaba doo!!! sorry, no pics. we've killed him lots so you ain't 
              missin anything, hehe.
            <p> </p>
            <p>then we thought we'd give Lendi a try. tuff pulls with adds makes 
              for a short night. he lives for another day, but we always get them 
              in the end. gratz to the weiners!<br>

              this was CoG's first 1st brood kill. took 3 tries, but we got his 
              nappy azz. impossible to control agro on this guy and we even got 
              so desperate that we let Varner MT him. anyway, gratz to BG on talisman. 
              he didn't drop anything else except for like 7 spells, hehe.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>i left after this but CoG and BG decided to wack Gozzrem. i heard 
              from the grapevine that Gozz dropped 2 bracers and 1 box. Nenu got 
              a bracer and Hackattack got the box and BG got a bracer. sweetness.<br>

              Ssra had 300 ppl and no Rhags so Telks dies <br>
              Posted by Pheign On Aug 14 2002 At 11:54:48 PM <br>
              Telks is getting pretty trivial now, 32 ppl in house no deaths. 
              Drops BP again that went to Maulder. Maulder passed down a Thurg 
              Plate BP he won earlier in the day not knowing what was in store 
              for him later on to someone i don't remember. I think he also passed 
              down the Cobalt BP he's been wearing for a while now too. So gratz 
              to like 3 ppl on that deal. Grisnalg got SK only hammer.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>We had some time left so we decided to clear to Gozzrem to poke 
              him. During the clear we got plate gaunts i think Barbed won. Gozzrem 
              was around 15% before he wiped us *sigh*. MT died at around 20% 
              and we couldn't recover. we only had around 28 or 29 ppl left after 
              killing telks and 1 less cleric so wasn't that bad considering he 
              maybe tuffer due to CH and position. Anyway, we get him next time. 
              Good job on a good night.<br>

            <p>Jonzer also completed his helm of the tracker quest so grats to

            <p>Well tonight, myself and the gang</p>
            <p>decide that we wanted to do something new.</p>
            <p>Well, we heard that no one had done the Avatar of Fear ring on 
              our server, so we decided to check it out. <br>
              Once we finished the ring, we figured out why no one does it...<br>

              Once we finished off the Avatar of Fear, well we decided we needed 
              a bigger mob to kill. I'm happy to report that although he was pretty 
              tough, the kill of Bonecrusha went flawlessly! When asked to comment 
              on killing one of their tanks, most of our friends over in Schism 
              seemed ok with the whole situation, and requested that we take pictures 
              (now available in wallet size!) to mark the occasion.<p>

              Lessons Learned - Stormhaven (8/16/2002 2:27 AM) <br>
            </p>
            <p>As you spend time in Everquest you learn many things - most centering 
              around what to do, and what not to do in mob encounters. I thought 
              that I would share some of the hard lessons we learned with through 
              our many combined years of experience within the game. These are 
              just random examples taken throughout our day today, and I hope 
              that you may all benefit from some of the wisdom contained therein.</p>
            <p>If you're an app, it's always good to show off your raw power, 
              and what you can bring to the table to make the guild better.<br>

              A snake, a god, and some... stuff... - Stormhaven (8/15/2002 2:34 
              AM) <br>
              <br>
              It was a pretty slow patch day today. The Avatar of War took it's 
              sweet time spawning, so hopefully we'll have a kill shot of that 
              for tomorrow's news. Since Ssra had a &quot;hiccup&quot; earlier 
              after the patch, not much had spawned there either. So we did a 
              quick jaunt over to Cazic Thule to finish off the Ring of Slime, 
              then to the High Priest who finally spawned for us, then we capped 
              it off by killing our server's namesake, Mr Cazic Thule.</p>
            <p>More killing tomorrow.

              We've basically been living in VT lately, steadily clearing through 
              every chance we get. Old fashioned dungeoncrawl-style has been a 
              blessing and a curse; the grind, seeing all the new sights, the 
              blood, the sweat, the death, the booty. It's what this game is all 
              about.
            <p>Ran into a few new bosses, which were no match for The Relentless.

              Day 151 - The 4th Dimension</p>
            <p>What started off as just a romp on the 3rd floor of Ssssssnake 
              town to get those precious insignia's turned out to end up being 
              a shot at the Blood of Ssraeshzaen with our friends in EoD. An interesting 
              fight, one I liked very much due to the strategy involved, which 
              I'm going to spoil for everyone with a little hint. It involves 
              halflings, butter and seaseme seeds. Thats all I'll say, but dammed 
              if it didn't work! No blood cord this time, but I'm sure we'll be 
              back to kill this guys lots more times until we get the rest of 
              the guild key'd up for an Emperor Shot (whee). Then it was back 
              to more 2nd floor farming, the evil rings of that commander make 
              me want to cry :(</p>
            <p>Whats this? Blood is doing commercials now? For his own products 
              no less, ripped off versions of real life products and commercials, 
              no wonder everyone wants to kill him.</p>

              Day 150 - This is the Remix<br>
              A nice way to cap the 150th day of the guilds existance, then to 
              complete with our friends at EoD a server first (I think) with the 
              completion of the Ring of Fear in the newly revamped Cazic Thule. 
              Wave after wave of the mobs we grew up with in Fear, all the while 
              little cazic running around puzzling everyone! Then the Mini sized, 
              but no less deadly, dread,fright and terror and then the little 
              but bigger Cazic himself. Fun time had by all, loot was ok I guess, 
              I think we got the lesser end of the spectrum on what could drop, 
              but hey, thats the name of the game.</p>

              fun of that experience, then come up with a clever little image 
              and then post it. Hmm, sounds like my style : </p>
            <p>Also, since I just can't get enough of making images about paladins 
              that brell, I present to you, based on the ever popular &quot;God 
              kills a kitten&quot; image that was out oh I'm sure last year or 
              whatever, this public service announcement that should be posted 
              on every post office in Norrath. I'm sure the paladins don't mind 
              though, after all, they're only cute little fuzzy kittens.</p>
            <p></p>

            <p>Went to visit Emporer again, tonight. He didn't die. Normally I 
              would say a lot more and be a lot funnier about it, but right now 
              the Emporer has cut off my Cheeto supply, so I am a bit cranky.</p>
            <p>More stuff popped up and was killed, and there were Cheetos all 
              over for that, but I haven't gotten to chow down on my specially 
              engraved Emporer snacky-treats yet, so I am going to keep it short.</p>
            <p><br>
              Oh, by the way, if you have an &quot;in&quot; at Fannie Mae, Mrs 
              Field, Nabisco, or Dolly Madison....shoot me a tell in game, I am 
              working on some sketches for a new reward device. <br>
