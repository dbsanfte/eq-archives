              Thanks to everyone who participated in the Permafrost raid on Saturday 
              and the Kael/Karnor raid on Sunday. We had a few mishaps, but otherwise, 
              I feel that it went pretty well. Great job, everyone!</p>
            <p> 
            <p> 
            <p> <b><a href="http://cohort.cc/" target="_top">Cohort Chalybeius</a></b><br>
              Saturday was a busy day for CC and Talons. First up, we met Zlandicar 
              in DN and showed him who was boss. Grats Serenity on her First Brood 
              Talisman and Draggin on his Frakadar's Talisman. Grats to Talons 
              on the Heart and the Sleeper's Key. </p>
            <p>Next up, we decided Dain must die and made good on our promise 
              to kill him. Grats Shaofung on his Frostweaver's Velium Crown and 
              Banandar on his Frostreaver. Grats Talons on the Dain head and the 
              Ring of Winter.</p>
            <p>Wednesday, CC and Talons took down our first Lendi together. Grats 
              to Tarisk on his Boots of Superiority and Talons on the Talisman, 
              Ring of Relkententinar, and Gloves of Stability. </p>
            <p>So, Thursday they take the servers down and we do it again! <br>
              Grats to Valorath on his Truesight Helm and on getting the Lendi 
              kill shot! Grats to Taraddar on his Talisman, chalking up another 
              CC Sleeper's Key! Talons pick of the loot was a Ring of Relkenteninar 
              and a Velium Maul of Superiority. </p>
            <p>The night was young, we were still in the mood to KEEEEEL stuff 
              so off to Fear we went. Cazic Thule proved to be a worthy opponent, 
              but we prevailed and he ended up eating dirt. Grats to Valorath 
              again (what a good day for this lucky paladin yesterday!) on his 
              Pauldrons of Ferocity and Talons on their Halo of Enlightment. Sadly, 
              this was not a day with a happy ending after all for CC and Talons. 
              Kegas, a ranger that sat in the zone and watched us slay the god, 
              decided this made him worthy enough of a Cloak of the Fearsome, 
              which he snagged off the corpse when it was unlocked for a moment. 
              He then gated and destroyed the item. GMs are looking into the incident, 
              but is truly sad when a hard kill is marred by a greedy individual.</p>

              We started off our day with Tormax. As you can see he died. Grats 
              to Merwyn on a Horn of Hoshgra and Soiel on a White Dragonscale 
              Sash.
            <p>Next up was Yelinak. He went down too. Grats to me on Gauntlets 
              of Dragon Slaying, Teleri on his robe, and Soel (we all knew he 
              was femme) on his coin PURSE.</p>
            <p>Back to Kael for some Vindicator beatings. Grats Fflewdeur on boots.</p>
            <p>Statue dropped a Cloak of the Falling Stars for Magnuss, who passed 
              his Lozidal Shell Shield to Ephron, who passed his Heirophants Cloak 
              to Comidaaryaa. A circle of lovins for everyone.</p>
            <p>Welcome Comidaaryaa and Merwyn, our two newest members. More damage 
              = good.</p>

              We've been talking about going to NToV for quite some time. Always 
              something else came up, but no longer. We marched into NToV and 
              laid waste to the place leaving nothing, but old dragon bones and 
              an old discarded assling cannon. 
            <p>The first day was a tad annoying as half our alliance couldn't 
              log on due to patch server problems. We did manage to take out Ikatiar 
              and Aaryonar before they announced the patch.</p>
            <p></p>
            Knowing how to work into NToV a bit faster and having no patch server 
            to deal with this time we got to work killing dragons. Eashen of the 
            Sky, Ikatiar, Aaryonar, Lord Feshlak and Dargarn the Destroyer were 
            handily dipatched using the Assling Cannon. We had more deaths on 
            a bad flurry drake pull then we did on all these dragons combined. 
            <p></p>
            Day two of the March on NToV began with a quick kill of Lord Kreizenn. 
            Little did we know he would be our only kill of the day. We moved 
            up to take down Zlexak completely oblivious to the carnage that would 
            insue. Zlexak spanked us hard, not once, but twice. We lost quite 
            a few due to ninja logging so we moved on to Jorlleag, but that bastard 
            gated on us somehow and we ended up with a Lady Nevederia add. Nothing 
            like two dragons to make you feel like you've just been sold for a 
            pack of menthals and a few postage stamps. Some times its just not 
            your day and its best to get some sleep and get back at it with a 
            fresh outlook.
            <p></p>
            On the Third Day, there was much ownage. To warm up while we waited 
            for the troops to arrive we set up a little show for Lady Nev and 
            Jarjar. Our little Homie G Necro, Tierra, busted some rhymes for them 
            and while they sang and clapped along - wack, wack, wack and they 
            were dead.
            <p></p>
            Now that we were warmed up we decided to tackle our badass friend 
            from the night before - Zlexak. When people say he's Hoshakar hyped 
            up on a speed ball, they ain't kidding. We tried the old fashioned 
            beatdown on him but too many tanks dropped too early. So we changed 
            our tactics and made another go at him. Everything was going good, 
            I had him slowed right off, then I decided to go back to the casters 
            and change some spells and Zlexak decided that instead of summoning 
            me he'd waltz right over and eat me for a snack. Once he was loose 
            in the healers it was all over. Sorry guys, that ones on me. 
            <p>So we're all rezzed up and ready to go for our fifth try. Just 
              as he's engaged and slowed, someone strafes into some backspawn. 
              We panic for a moment, but luckily they die without agroing the 
              adds. Then that mishap isn't enough, yet another person agros the 
              two drakes behind us and we're not so lucky and they join the battle. 
              There were a few moments when we thought all was lost, at one point, 
              I was so busy with the drake adds I forget to reslow Zlexak and 
              he ate a few tanks. Somehow, we rally and kill both the two adds 
              and Zlexak at the same time. Truely one of the best fights we've 
              ever had in the game. Zlexak only dropped one piece of loot, but 
              at that point we were just happy to have the mofo dead and move 
              onto other things.</p>
            <p>We also found out why Zlexak is so hard, because the two dragons 
              he guards are such poosea. Sevelak and Cekenar fell without much 
              ado.</p>
            <p></p>
            We're rolling now, next on the hitlist was Lady Mirenella who we dispatched 
            with no less than three adds. Quickly after that Lord Koi'Doken joined 
            her.
            <p></p>
            With thirteen dragons dead, that can mean only one thing - Lord Vyemm. 
            Someone told me before the fight that Vyemm was a &quot;crazy, mad 
            fight unlike Zlexak, but harder&quot;. They weren't kidding. We even 
            had our fair share of mishaps on Vyemm. We lost our first main tank 
            when a mage mistakenly gave Saelvian a modrod which made her lose 
            targetting. Being that Saelvian is in the same room as me, I can only 
            say that I haven't heard that much profanity out of her mouth in a 
            long time. She needs to clean that dirty mouth . However, we were 
            able to pull together and stay on track until one of the casters was 
            thrown just far enough down the hall to agro a drake. Zamdramas ran 
            back to the caster area and tanked the drake while the beatdown on 
            Vyemm continued. We prevailed over Lord Vyemm in the end losing about 
            ten during the fight. 
            <p></p>
            Lastly was Vulak, the prize of NToV in both loot and battle. Our fight 
            lasted around twenty minutes and I can say it was a lot of fun. But 
            just like all the others, he was soon dead and NToV was CONQUERED!!!
