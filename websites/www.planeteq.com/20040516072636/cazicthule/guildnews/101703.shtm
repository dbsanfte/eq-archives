              Nothing else was up so to prove that our first Xegony kill wasn't
              a fluke we killed her again. Congrats Ligma on your shiny new Vest

                Now that we've killed half the gods needed for time we thought
                we'd jump right in on the harder of the two remaining. We made
                it to The Rathe Council tonight with ease and got in some test
            runs. We'll come back later and try for real. </p>

            Well, actually, we did a good job trimmin the hedges in PoN last
               night, and safely escorted Thelin Poxbourne thru his nightmare.
            Now we have a few more folks flagged for PoNB!!                        <p>Grats to all that participated in the event!!<br>

  After a long hiatus from Raiding CoG has begun relearning tactics and starting
  a new season of death.It might not be Rallos Zek or Bertoxxulas,but everyone
  starts somewhere.</p>
            <p>After Friday nights humbling of Derekor the Vindicator we decided
              someone needed a new Breastplate.</p>
            <p>Grats Jaxis on his shiny blood splattered Chestplate of Vindication.<br>
              Grats Lunarnia on Head of Vindicator.<br>
              Grats our newest member Athen on his upgraded Windworn Breastplate
              gladly donated by Jaxis.<br>
              Since we did so well in Kael,the Machine rumbled off to Plane of
              Storms for some BoT keys.Dropped two forgetable PoS mini's while
              our trackers were looking for new victims.</p>
            <p>Grats Enlightenment on his new Crashing Wave Earring.<br>
              Our beloved Weeser stumbled upon our old friends Doomshade,Rumblecrush
                and the Zelniwhatever in the Umbral Planes.Again the call to
                arms was sounded and three new victims were to be had.</p>
            <p>Grats to Wolfz on his new arms and Bow of Doom.<br>
              Grats to Silini on her new FT book Tome of Self Reflection.<br>
              Grats to Ganador on Rod of Virtue.<br>
              Grats to Naydar on his Shawl of Ice.<br>
              Grats to Hewbert on Ancient Medallion of Faith.<br>
              Big grats to our two time winners of the evening Athen on Shadow
            Heart and Enlightenment on his new purple robe Calamity's End.</p>
            <p>We also banked a couple of bracers for possible fundage or mains
              who were not there who could use.</p>
            <p>If I missed someone my apologies.Grats again to all who made profit
              from the evenings adventures.CoG seems to be on the upswing again
              and I for one am glad.Some people are rusty,some people are new
              and the machine's workings will become tighter and freshly oiled
              with use.CoG is a leaner machine then it was before,so tremble
              Norrath before the War Machine.<br>
              <br>
                Bye bye Derakator the Vindicator <br>

            It was a nice evening when Earl walked in the front door hurriedly. &quot;Marla!&quot; he
            said in great haste, &quot; Look what's new on the farm!&quot; As
            Marla got up out of her knitting chair she looked out the door to
            see the fat bulbous putrid rotting corpse of none other than Grummus
            himself. This was no ordinary Grummus though. He had some strange
            markings. As she moved closer, she noticed the huge red stamp on
            the forehead. &quot;Earl!&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;That says 'Property
            of Crimson Talon Farm Department' You better return it before they
            find it missing and come and get you!&quot; Earl, looking worriedly
            at his new found prize immediately threw it back in the old beat
            up 82 Chevy and we have now placed him in a protection program so
            that the gnomes dont hunt him down. Rumor has it he also took all
            of Grummus crappy loot annd left Romell and Zypheal with a nice pair
            of rings! Grats CT on the newly added MOB to the farming list.

  Terris Thule Falls <br>
  She summoned her greatest minions...it didnt help!</p>
            <p>She asked her gargoyle guardians to save her...to no avail!</p>
            <p>She
              even removed all buffs....but it didnt help her cause!</p>            <p>Thanks to capable planning and strategy, Terris Thule was killed
              with only one death, by a casual guild with no Vex Thal loot that
              never requires players to attend raids and with less than 50 people.

              The forces of Crimson Talon killed Grummus this evening on our
              second-ever attempt at this rotting scumbag. Instead of a zerg-fest,
              we killed him with under 50 people (all non-VT equiped). The planar
              projection was rather quick and vanished in under 2 minutes. We
            will be killing him and other PoP bosses in the very near future.</p>

            <p>We've been tearing through some zones this month in wholesale
              fashion. Fear recently took a major beating from the combined forces
              of Hellions and DoKR. Grats to Kalander on his tear loot. Cazic
              was spared our wraith simply due to the fact that it was late and
              the troops were beginging to tire. Maybe next time ). Zbar showed
              up sporting his new pink tights. Woot.<br>

            <p>After the party ended a few of us went over to Karnors to drop
              Venril Sather. Eadric was hoping for his epic piece to drop but
              it didnt happen this time. </p>
            <p><img src="VShellions.jpg" width="450" height="338"></p>
            <p>Congrats to Kalander on finishing up his epic this past week.
              Its been a long time coming and he deserved it for sure. Quechang
              also finished off a few quests he has been working toward. He finally
              worked his ToV faction to the allied side and was promptly rewarded
              with a Talisman of Benevolnce and his SS helm.</p>
            <p><img src="quechanghelm.jpg" width="450" height="338"><br>
              Many of us have been really working the Chardok faction in Droga,
                Nurga and Chardok B. Its been a struggle for sure especially
                after a few outings like this Chardok Royals attempt.</p>

              Congrats to Gaarbage,Katslayer and Deadlee for picking up their
                Golem rings. No these are not &quot;The One Ring&quot; but still
                they are pretty decent and something Gandolph would love to have.
                As part of the evenings festivities Deadlee tried to school Gaarb
                in the art of kicking and Katslayer could sympathize with David.<br>

    The Ogres Question. (submitted by Catabrie Fatewielder)</p>
            <p>Following a jaunt around the Plane of Torment and dealing with
              some rather unexpected twists and turns (SoE you naughty bastages),
              we came upon Saryrns bed chamber. As she lay there stretched out
              in front of Dhur in a revealing pose he pondered the ultimate ogre
              question. Should he or shouldnt he? Like most of his previous women
              she was wearing a mask as is traditional, in fact pretty much essential
              for most ogre women. She was also not looking very lively either
              so was less likely to escape! As just about everyone else turned
              their backs, Shavedman looked on in disgust, this truly was a thing
              of nightmares.</p>

              Zarrina shows her anger by giving Aten the good ole one finger

              comprehend her downright cheekiness...</p>

              a particular aggresive Zit Monster. This just goes to show that

              snap this picture of the back of her head. Thankfully she was able
              to give our photographer and the rest of the raid a lift so we
              could take this shot from an airial view.</p>

            <p>We'd been invited to play cards over at Terris's place and after
              tracking through desolate wastelands for what seemed like forever
              and dealing with all sorts of nasties we finally got to her house.
              OMG! What a dump! Seriously, she needs to get in some sort of emergency
              decorater. Anyway after all that she had like 30 friends crash
              the game half way through and try and read our cards. After dealing
              with them we carried the game on only to find out that Terris and
              her 4 gargoyle buddies had cards up their sleeves!!! Honestly if
              you cant trust a god, who can you trust? Anyway, so we had to kill
              them all...</p>

              it totally ruins my woad paint. Still never mind. We stopped by
              Agnarr on the way and gave him a good telling off for being such
              a grumpy goose. And here he is the Lord of Storms himself with

            <p>Tonight saw our first guild party in Drunder, the fortress of
              Zek. As usual the layabout Vallon Zek tried to crash the party
              with his four mates... After turning him away from the doors 4
              times we finally tired of him and bashed his face in. Once again
              our Necros show just how funny they can be! /sigh</p>

              PoP by any means. With a bit of a jig around in tactics he went

              Monday Night was an excellent night to watch Giants Fall. The
                night started off with a single group and then spread into two
                groups
                before nights end. </p>
            <p>Marvpur lead the charge valiantly and was successfull in acquiring
              some nice drops and lots of healthy faction.</p>
            <p>One of the Legions goals is to Return to the Halls of Testing,
              to accomplish this everyone that attends must be maxed out in Claws
              of Veeshan faction and of substancal level and gear. </p>
            <p>The hunt on the Giants fills three missions. First the CoV faction
              is greatly increases in Kael, second the Kael armor is excellent
              for Resists and Ac, and third all Expereneced earned in Kael go
              to the goal of levels.</p>
            <p>Thank you, Marvpur for creating a fun and rewarding night in Kael.</p>

                night I heard we had 50 Clerics in the raid, sure our DPS took
            a hit but heck I bet I never had to wait for a res!</p>
            <p>I love it when Phase 3 drops 4 pairs of elemental pants on one
            clearing. Grats Fellene, Naldar, Aegile and Kamzan. </p>

              Guest News spot! Brought to you by Ghoat, Malibu Rum and the Letter
            Q.</p>
            <p><br>
              Know Your Role!</p>
            <p>In a guild this size, everyone has a role, some small, some large.
              It takes a team to be a successful raiding guild, and everyone
              must do thier job and understand it.</p>
            <p>In addition to raiding you have the people who do the other roles
              as well. Keeping up with tradeskill items, flags, recruiting, keeping
              stats up to date, managing the boards, doing our news postings,
              selling surplus gear to fund our peridot habit, and the list goes
              on and on. When things go south, we have raid leaders to rally
              us, make changes on the fly, and keep the team pushing forward
              and keep morale up. Sometimes you need a morale boost, and at times
              like that it is handy to have a weak link to attack, someone to
              blame and remind you that no matter how bad you are, you could
            be worse!</p>

Wednesday, October 15th, 2003 - What Do You Say What Do You Do When It All Comes
Down <br>
Posted by: [Kyrthor] on October 16th, 2003 @ 10:04 AM</p>
            <p>Hello Nurse!</p>
            <p>Wait, wrong update.</p>            <p>Where are we, what are we doing.....ah, that's right, Time! Some
              say Time is the fire in which we burn. Wait, dammit, that's the
              wrong update, too. Where'd I leave my notes....</p>
            <p>Oh yah, bitchslap
                the gods week.....THERE we go.</p>
            <p>So, all you little kiddies read the nice update about how we got
              back to phase 5 in one day, right? If you didn't jump back and
              read it, I'll wait.</p>
            <p>Are you back? Good.</p>
            <p>So, we got back online yesterday to see how we measured up to
              phase 5 when we have more than a quick glance to scope it out.
              First thing we did was repeat our previous glory in one try. No
              hiccup, no nothing, Poop Dogg just fall down, go boom. And of course,
              as y'all can tell from the pretty pictures, congratulations are
              in order for Kestel, who was awarded the very first Time chest
              piece ever to fall on this server.</p>
            <p>With the demon log out of the way, we decided to pay a visit to
              our good buddy Bert, he of the &quot;last week he stopped us cold&quot; fame.
              How did we do? Welp, I would put up a fancy picture to let you
              know, but honestly, all he left me with was the most boring image
              in the world, and I really can't be bothered with it, so here it
              is for your enjoyment....</p>
            <p><img src="Bert3FS.jpg" width="199" height="57"><br>
              We went on to engage on Bubba and Captain Forehead to see how the
                fights worked and then called it a day. We hadn't made it to
                Qball yet, but we hadn't gottem stymied...and any day that you
                drop a mob that hasn't been killed yet is a good day. So, with
                the bar shoved up one more notch, we all got some sleep and got
                set for today.</p>
            <p>Of course, today, I wasn't on, so I will have to make some educated
              guesses in parts. You'll forgive me if I get it a little wrong
              in spots, I am sure I will get the gist of it right.</p>
            <p>According to my tarot deck, we cleared phase 1 in a remarkable
              13 minutes, however everyone died at least 3 times. Next time we
              hope to do a little better....but it was enough to get us to our
              goal, the last two mobs in phase 5. Using my magic 8 ball, I can
              see that we got Captain Forehead down to....is that 38%....63%....damn
              bubbles. Welp, all I know for sure is that it wasn't 0, so he lives
              another day. Bubba however, is a different story. We had our UberSecretStrat
              ready for him.</p>
            <p><img src="RZFS.jpg" width="520" height="422"><br>
              My sources tell me that he went down without too much trouble and
                was best prepared broiled with a light butter sauce. Unfortunately
                we lost 2 players to heart attacks, so keep your eye on the recruiting
                page, as we'll be looking to replace them (and a necro) soon,
                I would bet.</p>
            <p>So yet again, we raise the bar a notch and leave ourselves with
              only 2 mobs left in the game. If anyone is confused about what
              is left before Quarm, here's yer hint....</p>

              Check back here later to see what happened, Buckaroos.</p>

              &quot;
              The Spirits have done it all in one night. Of course they can...they
              can do anything they like!&quot;<br>
              - E. Scrooge</p>
            <p><br>
              Heh, I know just how he feels!</p>
            <p><br>
              Hot damn, we tore it up today. After moving the bar in Time up
                to 'ol Poop Dogg last time, we decided that we wanted to see
                how well we could do on the straight push to him, and we even
                surprised ourselves.</p>
            <p><img src="PrimaNocteFS.jpg" width="520" height="130"></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>There they all are. All our hard work in learning these mobs executed
              on demand, on time, and on the spot. From full zone to phase 5
              just over 5 hours. We lined them up and put them down all in straight
              order. Was it easy? Heh, I wish....Cletus is still a cast iron
              bitch and took us a few false starts to get down, but down he and
              his fellows went, all in the allotted time.</p>
            <p>Feels damn good.</p>
            <p>So now we eye the entirety of phase 5 that we have before us and
              and wonder how far we gonna move the bar this time....I won't say
              for sure, but I swear to god I hear Rosie Perez somewhere out there
              saying &quot;I will take mobs that begin with the letter Q for
              800, Alex!&quot;.</p>

            <p> Monday, October 6, 2003 - It's Not The End Of My World, Just
              A Slight Change Of Plans <br>
              Posted by: [Kyrthor] on October 7th, 2003</p>
            <p><img src="VZFS.jpg" width="520" height="334"></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Welp, just like I told you yesterday, there is 'ol Cletus fresh
              for his BigPineBox(TM). It was quite a bit of work gettin him down,
              more than we anticipated to start, I think. We started off the
              week just awesome, clearing to phase 4 and dropping Cooter all
              in one shot. We even took a swing at Cletus and got him to like
              28%, not bad for try #2...we figured he was in the bag.</p>
            <p>We were right, just a bit....hrm....premature. All week we came
              back and refined our strategy...learning what worked and what didn't
              and that lime geen pants really don't go with anything, no matter
              what the nice sales lady tells you. Some attempts went awesome,
              others not so much, but we figured we had a solid plan, we just
              needed to run until we got it right.</p>
            <p>So Sunday we came back to time, whipped through the repsawned
              front of zone and dropped right into phase 4 to have Cooter and
              Cletus there waitin for us. Could they stop us this time? Nope.
              Now to spill the beans.....how do we take down Cletus? Welp...basically,
              Kalorn grabs one leg, Carrot grabs the other, they shout &quot;Make
              a wish!&quot; and start pullin in opposite directions. We then
              let Darious know he has 5 minute for all the Bad Touching he wants
              with Cletus and the rest of us have it easy. It was a bitch to
              get the strat down....first Darious kept touching the wrong folks....then
              for one attempt he just sat in the corner and made strange noises
              (all of us were too afraid to interrupt him), but finally he got
              pointed in the right direction and now we are playing in Phase
              5!</p>
            <p>First thing we saw was our old buddy Bert!</p>
            <p><img src="BertFS.jpg" width="520" height="401"></p>
            <p><br>
              We had a good run at him and locked down our strat and then decided
                to take a look at what else was waiting for us in this phase
                so we looked at an even older friend....</p>
            <p><img src="CTFS.jpg" width="520" height="260"></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>And for those too lazy to click the picture, let me clue ya....VZ
              aint the front line on this server anymore..... 'ol poop dog sleeps
              with the fishes! It was awesome to see our crew show up in the
              phase and put a hurt on those two boys the way they did. As always,
              more woulda been better, wish I could tell ya we dropped half the
              phase on first view (and if we had an extra hour, we might've),
              but I will settle for tellin ya that we logged ourselves on yesterday
              and proceeded to kill two mobs never before dropped on this server.
              That's a good day's work for anyone.</p>

            <p>Even in the midst of our week in Time, we took the time to expand
              our shaman ranks. Now we don't just allow any ol' Shaman to join
              our guild ... they have to be skilled in buffing, debuffing and
              dying. Once again we found a shaman that excels at these skills
              (and we hear the female ogres actually think he's handsome too!!)</p>
