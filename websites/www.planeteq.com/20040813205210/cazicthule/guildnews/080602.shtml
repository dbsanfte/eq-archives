              Freeport - Where dragons go when they get sick of BG killing them...<br>
              Posted by: Siacay on Thursday, August 01, 2002 - 09:51 AM CST <br>
              Well, Freeport seems to be fairly empty lately, since they patched 
              last night. We fixed that problem right up, by populating Freeport 
              with:</p>
            <p>Talendor<br>
              Severlious<br>
              Gorenaire<br>
              Zlandicar</p>
            <p>This was our first time doing Zlandicar, and we did actually wipe 
              out on the first attempt. Ooops. We set up and killed the trakanon 
              wannabe with no problem on the second run. Gee... I thought Zlandicar 
              was supposed to be even mildly hard? Oh well.. GRATS WYEN on being 
              BG's first sleeperz capable member!</p>
            <p>In other news, grats to Panolan and Cyke, who both got frosty books 
              for their epics, and Pano also getting his burnt book. Woot, more 
              flaming butterknives in guild, shortly! <br>
              <br>
              Goodnight, Mr. Dozikar<br>
              Posted by: Swiftwolf on Monday, July 29, 2002 - 11:48 PM CST <br>
              Tonight BG headed for ToV, but instead of just passing through the 
              'just visiting' lane, we decided to give Dozikar the Cursed an all 
              out run for the money. It wasn't much of a race, Bloodguard owned 
              him.</p>
            <p>We checked his dropped tears, and checked our symbols in the bank, 
              and as luck would have it, were able to complete a quest on our 
              first killing. Grats Craszs on Cloak of the Firestorm! Woot!<br>
            </p>
            <p> <br>
              Sometimes Vacations Just Ain't Long Enough!<br>
              Posted by: Siacay on Sunday, July 28, 2002 - 11:29 PM CST <br>
              Well, after meeting eachother in freeport, the Va'dynn, Zelnithak, 
              Rumblecrush, and Doomshade all decided that they were sick of vacation 
              and they just HAD to get back to work.</p>
            <p>Now we in Bloods Guard are caring individuals, and we wanted to 
              make sure that they came back from their vacations unstressed, relaxed, 
              and better emotionally adjusted. Well, they weren't, so we were 
              forced to send them all back again. Then we figgured that since 
              radir had been working hard, we shuld send him off to freeport too.</p>
            <p>Now, i know that they are all having very wonderful times in freeport.. 
              but we miss them! Come back soon guys! </p>
            <p> late night kill squad strikes.....<br>
              Posted by: Siacay on Sunday, July 28, 2002 - 09:47 AM CST <br>
              So, Talendor made the big mistake of spawning this evening. Now, 
              just because we thought that there might be some kind of vacancy 
              at the freeport hotel, we thought we'd send him there to check it 
              out for us... turns out that there was a vacancy, so we just told 
              him to stay!</p>
            <p>Grats to Varsavia and Savlorne, on a couple of Torbin's Mystical 
              Eyepatchs.</p>
            <p>Unawarded loots include: </p>
            <p>A burnt, torn book. Yep, thats right, pally epic peice of rarity.</p>
            <p>The freeport inn is open all hours, ready to except all the chopped, 
              burnt, de-scaled, crushed, and otherwise killed mobs that BG sends 
              em. <p>
              at the freeport hotel...<br>
              Posted by: Siacay on Saturday, July 27, 2002 - 05:38 PM CST <br>
              At the freeport hotel this evening, you can find The Va'dynn, Rumblecrush, 
              Doomshade, and Zelnithak. They will be whining and moaning about 
              how Bloods Guard walked in and kicked their asses up and down the 
              wall.</p>
            <p>We woulda hit radir and tawro as well, but verant decided to bring 
              the servers down for an afternoon emergency patch...</p>
            <p>Grats to all the loot gaining folks from so far today. Lets keep 
              it up! <br>
            </p>
            <p> <br>
              Doomshade and Rumblecrush --&gt; Freeport<br>
              Posted by: Swiftwolf on Friday, July 26, 2002 - 11:15 PM CST <br>
              Friday we kicked our night of killing off by taking down Talendor 
              in Skyfire. Unfortunately he decided to be a bit stingy with his 
              drops. Grats Terrik on shield, Dolechi on bracer, Kontai on spell. 
              Tal also dropped a RDS and 2 other spells.</p>
            <p>Well that didn't satisfy our killing urge, so we targeted Rumblecrush 
              in the Umbral Plains. We had a few casualties but pulled out the 
              victory. Grats Feller on Tunic of Kinship, grats Milennia on Belt 
              of Scintillation, and grats Egwyne on her new belt.</p>
            <p>Now that we were warmed up, we concentrated our efforts on Doomshade. 
              We got the overgrown spectre into camp alone thanks to our skilled 
              monks, and after a long fight came out the victors! Grats Kiram 
              on Earring of Endless speed, Elricky on Flaming Dirk, Varsavia on 
              Pebble crusher, Thomdar on CoCW, Baytor on RBG, and Prom on Blessing 
              of Ageolism.</p>
            <p>Grats guys on a nice Friday night, woot! <br>

              Posted by: Mirax on Thursday, August 1st, 2002 @ 1:31 AM<br>
            </p>
            <p>Yesterday after the surprise crash of Ssra, we went down to the 
              basement and did the Cursed Cycle. Grats Kulraith and Gristle on 
              some Shiny new Necklaces, Sylverblade on his Ranger Claw, Katraena 
              on her FT 4 range book and Whoa on his Cloak of Dark Shadows.</p>
            <p>Then we're killing the endless stream of PHs to try and get some 
              more rings on the dreaded second floor, when the Systemwide Message 
              announces....YES!! ANOTHER PATCH!!!! </p>
            <p>This morning was a nice killing of Rhag 2, grats Lorraine on the 
              range item...then, the second floor again!! WOOT!!! MORE COMMANDER 
              PH SPAWNS!!</p>
            <p>Then tonight, among the 289 online in ssra (they moved the trader 
              feature to ssra in the patch, right..since no one ever leaves!) 
              CC/Talons took down our first Blood! Grats to Talons and Karri on 
              their new belts, missed the name of them while I was running nekkid 
              to get my corpse summoned.</p>
            <p>Tormax made a rare late night appearance, and he was taken down 
              with ease. Grats Sabvlik on his ST shard, Ronolo on his Axe of the 
              Kromzek Kings, Pava on his boots of the Storm, Rounlin on his Gem 
              Encrusted Gauntlets and someone in Talons on the Tormax head.</p>
            <p>The bloodlust wasn't satisfied, so we did an in house raid on Vindicator. 
              Grats Ronolo on the Breastplate of Eradication and Draklinthor on 
              the Vindi head (F Tunare, still bitter there's no Karana equivilent 
              for those gloves!).</p>

              UI Madness <br>
              Posted by: Druss on Monday, July 29th, 2002 @ 1:56 AM<br>
            </p>
            <p>With the release of the new UI, we've seen our Cohorts scrambling 
              to cobble together their own personalized interfaces. Some creative 
              motivation has been provided by the promise of good old pp, for 
              the guild member who puts together the all-around nifties UI.</p>
            <p>Here's a sneak peak at the current frontrunner, our very own DangerRanger, 
              Dinuvian:</p>
            <p><br>
              Oh, yeah, we killed Tormax, and had The Deep crash on us Ye-Olde-Burrower-Parasite 
              at 10%. Yay...<br>
              <br>
              Stop bringing the server down, already!!! <br>

            </p>
            <p>We all know what happens after the servers go down in EQ - The 
              inevitable post-patch feeding frenzy by every guild on the server. 
              Within hours of the server coming back up, pretty much everything 
              worth killing is already dead to the hands of the usual suspects. 
              Lord knows, we got caught up in it.</p>
            <p>After the patch, we spent our Friday killing the High Priest of 
              Ssra (is it me, or is he like the most overrated &quot;tier 8&quot; 
              mob ever made?) Lord Yelinak, A quick sweep of the Sleeper's crew, 
              and a Zlandicar kill. CC's share of loot for the day came to a Halo 
              of Enlightening Barriers for Grakus, a Sporecaller for Sehria, a 
              Primal Velium Warsword for Druss (yay me!), Gauntlets of Dragonslaying 
              for Parris, A sleeper's key for Whoa, and some assorted crap noone 
              wanted.</p>
            <p>Remember...Reduce (the crappy drops on mobs), Reuse (the same tried 
              and true Zerg-o-licious tactics), and recycle (those craptastic 
              drops into peridots whenever possible). Thank god for the new /trader 
              interface, the next best thing to VI implementing 12 slot backpacks. 
              I managed to clear out so much crap that had been rotting in the 
              bank for months, that I can actually stop carrying around those 
              $%&amp;*($&amp;#* Lucid Shards around.</p>
            <p>So, anyway, back on topic - we all felt pretty good at the close 
              of last night. We figured tonight might be a relaxing night off, 
              a night where I could blow the dust off that Warcraft 3 jewel case 
              sitting on my desk, or get around to finishing Soldier of Fortune 
              2 (Fantastic shooter, btw - good level design, plot is so-so, but 
              the weapons are just flat-out the best I've seen in a shooter, ever 
              - GG OICW!). Then we log out, only to see another patch that evening...so 
              tonight...the madness begins again.</p>
            <p>BTW - Ragefire spawning 5 minutes before the server going down 
              = Not Funny!</p>

            </p>
            <p>You ever have one of those nights where everything just comes together 
              perfectly? The heals are right on, the main tanks stay up, everyone 
              controls aggro, and every mob you fight basically rolls over and 
              dies?</p>
            <p>Well, tonight wasn't that kind of night.</p>
            <p>I think we had the most half assed attempt at Vyzd'rha the Cursed 
              tonight I've ever seen...thank god we got our act together halfway 
              through the fight, and finished him off.</p>
            <p>Congrats to Parr on his Bloodfrenzy, Brendayan on his Opalline 
              Charm, and Ulthumbra of Talons on his new BP of the void! <br>

              Epic For Silini <br>
              Posted by Tariff On Jul 29 2002 At 10:57:09 AM <br>
              Congratulations to Silini with her epic. With only two pieces left, 
              Ulump and Faydedar didn't stand a chance against three heavily armed 
              CoG parties, one Sunday morning before ToV and the second one after 
              ToV. Add another leaf-blower to the guild. My personal thanks to 
              everyone who came out to help her achieve this and rest assured 
              that the assistance will be returned in kind. <br>

              This was CoG's last ToV run in the halls of testing before switching 
              factions. We scheduled 4 days but only made it to 3 due to overcrowding 
              on Friday (one of the reasons we are switching). We made attempts 
              at Velketor that day instead, but just couldn't keep the clerics 
              alive for some reason. He'll get his one day, hehe.

              Grats to Kilwean for reaching 60!
            <p>Raided Chardok this evening to kill the royalty. We easily slayed 
              the prince, king, and queen. Congrats to Machedor for finishing 
              the warrior epic!</p>

            <p>Found Venril up and cobbled together a minimal crew with what we 
              had on to kill him. Grats to Goratrix for getting wizard staff, 
              just a broken golem away from epic.</p>
            <p>JUL 31, 2002<br>
              Another clearing or two of the Halls of Testing. Loots: 2 Plate 
              Legs [Kilwean, Brewall], Plate Helm [Lilsong], Plate Bracer [Machedor], 
              Leather Gloves [Windarii], Plate Boots [Tarrask], Poison Symbol 
              [Zypheal], and a Silk Wrist.</p>
            <p>JUL 30, 2002<br>
              Returned to ToV and the Halls of Testing. A very odd night, very 
              few armour drops, but we killed an enormous number of named mobs. 
              Loots were: Silk Legs [Immolar], Flame Kissed Symbol [Lisner], White 
              Symbol [Machedor], Serrated Symbol [Maxist], Black Symbol [Polyneices], 
              Chain Tunic [Yakkai], Leather Legs [Proeteus], Runed Symbol [Altus], 
              Silk Arms[Jheball], and Emerald Symbol [Gilthanus].</p>
            <p>JUL 29, 2002<br>
              Trakanon perished again to the forces of the Crimson Talon. Flawless 
              killing with only 1 death due to the shroom port. Drops were: Wildlord 
              Tunic [Kuriosity], SK BP [banked], Undead Dragon Sinew [Proetus], 
              4 Teeth [Polynecies, Chadmoe, Khandrahcir, and Zoranna]. </p>
            <p>JUL 27, 2002<br>
              Sev was roaming around in Emerald Jungle and we decided to quickly 
              take him down. Killed him again so that another one of our warriors 
              could get a coveted green scale. Loots were: Green Dragon Scale 
              [Machedor], Shield of the Green Dragon [Azenyth], Mask of the Hunter 
              [Dunskye], and Spirit of Oak [Windarii].</p>
            <p>GM event in the Swamp of No Hope in the tunnel to Trakanon's Teeth. 
              A dragon was in the caves where the frogloks used to be and was 
              red to level 60's. Although we were able to assemble 3+ full groups 
              with 3 MB wizards, we didn't have any clerics on. Simply bad timing 
              as several got on later that night. Another guild played around 
              with the mob for a few hours before finally killing him; loot was 
              a ranger belt.</p>
            <p>JUL 25, 2002<br>
              Trakanon was up this evening and we decided to cut down his minions 
              and slay the undead dragon himself. We decided to fight Trak on 
              the bridge and even though he ported on us at 0.001 percent health, 
              we still killed him losing only 1 person (from the shroom port). 
              Excellent fighting and heads-up thinking by everyone dealing with 
              Trak's escape. Drops were 5 teeth [Minmin, Immolar, Barelil, Chantress, 
              and Kestel], Cleric BP [Skylynn], and a Cloak of Piety [Khandrahcir]. 
              Grats to all.</p>
            <p>JUL 24, 2002<br>
              Grats to Kestel for reaching 60!<br>

              Blew up Hate last night in house. Had the usual deaths upon entry 
              but man did things get rolling. The highlights of the night were, 
              Xmortis getting a piece of her epic, Vidardo grabbing his book for 
              his epic, and Vallain getting a piece for a quest for a nice weapon.<br>

              <br>
              Groups of us have been putting a Motor City style beat down on giants

              That's what happens when you camp shards for so long it makes you

            <p>As Thorn stated in his previous post, we took a little time off 
              here and there to gather luclinite and take out a few boss mobs 
              to help people avoid going completely insane. It worked, almost 
              everyone was happy, but he forgot this lil gem which we snagged

              thankfully we talked him out of that. Instead, he deleted his character, 
              ran off with 10 pounds of marijuana + 6 strippers, and is planning 
              to open up the worlds first fully nude laundry mat/ gentleman's

              Been pulling our hairs out this past week in a mad scramble to finish 
              off key parts before entering Vex Thal. Over 400 shards have been 
              looted by our guild this week alone.</p>
            <p>With the patch yesterday we decided to grab some key glowing orbs 
              of luclinite to finish some people off so we headed to Ssra.</p>
            <p>Zoning in, I do a quick /w. 283 people in the zone!?! Where do 
              I buy my trader bag? This is prime selling real estate -- especially 
              since the zone is bugged and mobs aren't respawning when you kill 
              them.</p>
            <p>Anyway, we are formed up in the basement and pull the triggers 
              - well the zone is so lagged the mobs aren't fighting back so the 
              monks can't pull the triggers -- so we go to them and kill them 
              in place for once.</p>
            <p>Glyphed spawns, glyphed goes down flawless. Grats Malheur on the 
              Bow and score 1 Luclinite, the real loot of the night.</p>
            <p>Exiled up and down quickly as well. Grats Almir on the shoulders 
              and Tronsmang on the luclinite. That's 2.</p>
            <p>Cursed was a tough fight with the lag. He was lagging himself as 
              his AE didn't stay at a pat 24 seconds - would bounce up and down. 
              But people need keys so he had to die. Grats Korkrest on the melee 
              cloak, Lildaanie on the ft4 one, Furly on Goldenrod and Iuvas on 
              Luclinite #3.</p>
            <p>Well, we leave Ssra and head to Akheva as we hear luclinite is 
              up there too.</p>
            <p>Va Dyn pulled and dead. Grats Coldar on your amulet and Solknar 
              on Luclinite #4.</p>
            <p>Itraer who? Went down just as quick as Va Dyn and for once we pulled 
              to Itraer without a train. Grats someone on FT2 neck (I missed the 
              call) and Thundre on Luclinite #5 and the Akheva shard that dropped 
              right after to finish his key.</p>
            <p>We checked our numbers and were still strong so we headed to Shei. 
              One of our smoothest fights yet on him and he went down in record 
              time. Grats Manolas and Mirrorpond on Boon of Recovery Spheres, 
              Kaeln on finding harmony with a cloak, and Hierl on Luclinite #6.</p>
            <p>Six orbs in a day was enough, we still needed those shards so people 
              headed back out into Norrath to look for more. My favorite quote 
              of the week comes from Grizumpy who said, &quot;I want to lock all 
              the bathrooms in Verant and sprinkle the keys all over North America 
              and make them feel our pain.&quot;</p>

              Day 132 to 134 - We rock the Body!</p>
            <p>Friday was Ssra Key Camp day .. and boy oh boy do we enjoy camping 
              key pieces, its probably the most fun thing in the entire world 
              to do, hours upon hours spent killing snakes to pray one spawn is 
              a named that has items! But but we did complete more rings and we're 
              kicking along, soon there will be light at the end of this key camp 
              tunnel. Then we went to Velks and played around with old velk himself, 
              I say play because he killed us the first time when we pull him 
              and his 2 guards when no one was ready, but hey, thats what we get 
              for temp monk thats really a chanter! Anyway, he fell like the chump 
              that he is the 2nd time around and everyone rejoiced.</p>
            <p>Saturday was more of the same, not doing much, exping here and 
              there, not much to do when no mobs are up to kill, did a little 
              key camping, did a little armor farming for our new members in west 
              tov. Got a bucket full of BP drops which is always nice to see. 
              Umm, what more can I say, thats a day full of stuff, I myself went 
              to see Minority Report (finally) and had a real enjoyable 2 1/2 
              hours, great movie even though by the time I went to see it, it 
              was moved to the smallest theatre I've ever seen, the screen was 
              like my laptop! (ok, so it was much bigger then anything I could 
              have downloaded it too, but it wasn't a nice huge ass giganto screen!)</p>
            <p>Ok ok, so Sunday finally arrives and Joy! all the snakes are up 
              in Ssra. Whee! If only the Rhags and the Creator were left we'd 
              have killed everything except blood and the emp (gotta get those 
              keys! gotta catch em all!). Glyphed, Exiled, Cursed, Arch Lich and 
              the High Priest (who didn't want to die and pulled every trick known 
              to snakekind to keep us from killing him,but he died in the end). 
              Lots and lots of stuff dropped, most importantly (to me :)) was 
              the Vengful Mail of the void that I got to loot (glee). Oh, and 
              we were handed these on zoning out of Ssra. Seems that the ministry 
              of tourism and customer affairs in the fine city of Freeport is 
              doing some promotion and these brochures are their latest print 
              material. <b>(please click on the link above to see the graphics 
              on their news site! --Ed.)<br>
              </b><br>
              I know I'd go! Freeport sounds like a party town, forget New Orleans, 
              forget Disney World, and screw Kelethin! I'm going to FreePort!<p>

              a tell in game to Bonecrusha, Palan or Effix and make a post in

              Moles And Trolls, Moles And Trolls, Work, Work, Work, Work, Work!<br>
              Hot damn! We have been incredibly busy.</p>
            <p>Friday we decided to take the grand tour of NToV and minus the 
              triplets (which weren't up) we cleared it in a day, probably our 
              fastest performance there to date. We should have seen it comin 
              from this, but we were dense. Our vision was limited, we dreamed 
              too small and we didn't grok what was comin until after the smoke 
              cleared.</p>
            <p>This was our &quot;This raid goes to 11!&quot; weekend (if you 
              can't hear Nigel Tufnel when you read that, you need to get out 
              more).</p>
            <p>We got ourselves out and about on saturday and saw Burrower Parasite 
              sittin there tauntin us, so we brought it some hurt. Killed it on 
              a schedule, thanks to the &quot;oh, by the way, the server is goin 
              down in 10 minutes, er 5 minutes, er screw it!&quot; operations 
              staff for VI. So we whacked it dead and for a reward got a freshly 
              spawned server, for which VI usually makes you pay the penalty of 
              el lag death supremo patch downloads. But there was to be none this 
              time.</p>
            <p>So what did we do?</p>
            <p>We killed every freakin thing in Ssra that moved with the (temporary) 
              exception of Emporer. We started with Glyphed / Exiled / Cursed. 
              We then moved upstairs with a late night crew and took down Blood, 
              with the massive 15 minutes warning on a saturday we had that Emporer 
              would be up, we weren't quite prepared for him and hadda let him 
              pass (seeya next time, bub). We then called it a night for saturday 
              and went to bed not realizing Emeril was gonna lead the raid the 
              next day.</p>
            <p>So Sunday happened and we whacked Creator. We then stepped it up 
              a notch and hit the High Priest - *BAM*! We then added the zest 
              by punking Rhag1, Rhag2, and Arch Lich. Were we done? Nay Nay! The 
              Thought Horror Overfiend was up. *BAM*! Had enough? Well, Luclin 
              had, so we moved to Velious in desperate need of anything to kill 
              and took down Velketor and Darth BoBo. Hell, we were *so* out of 
              things to do we had the whole alliance standing there watching Piro 
              go down on a giant SHOE, fer chrissakes....<p>
              It was all dead. There was NO more. Now, as soon as VI figures out 
              that the new interserver chat feature is allowing us to trade nodrop 
              items, expect a patch with 10 minutes notice and we will get a fresh 
              server to try it on again. Until then, remember to drop 5 or 10 
              corpses each time you visit the bazaar, there just isn't enough 
              happening in that ghost town anymore.<br>
