            with the most recent news. Guild news must be from mid-September to 
            the present to show up here). If your guild has a website and doesn't 
            have news here, it's because I could not find any to report, or it 
            was more than one month old.
            <P>If you would like to have news of what your guild is doing around 
              Norrath posted here, please email kwill@planeteq.com. And,

              featured in this report, let me know that too!

              on their teeth ;p we like trak so much we killed him tuesday as 
              well for the bard epic, grats nexroth&quot;
            <p>RAtskellar writes: &quot;Sunday we took down our trak (24.4 seconds). 
              Thats about average for us. However Trakanon finally ran out of 
              Shaman Bp's to throw at us (5 so far) and put out big time. 2 Cobalt 
              BP's and 3 teeth. Grats to Aeria and Remusnoc on your new spiffy 
              BPs. Sorry Aeria no more strip teasing Krusha.
            <p>On Tuesday we got together for Bard Spawn Trakanon for Nexroth 
              (winner of Gore white scale) got down there in less than 45 minutes 
              starting with 2 groups heading down for CoH. Raxinie decided to 
              make enchanter's lives difficult. With multiple LD problems we still 
              go down there and pull protector. The 2 adds that came with protector 
              decided it was time for Ratskeller to die and thus used him as toilet 
              paper resisting 6 spells a piece. The Guild cheered. Protector dropped 
              Hardened clay bracer (as always) and Aegis. Thats Aegis(Cleric)... 
              not Aegis of Ro(Mage).<p>
              We spawned Trakanon and owned him exceptionally easy. And for once 
              I survived hehe. He dropped a Manna Robe, Nex's epic piece and Nexroth. 
              After ressing Nexroth he looted and quickly completed his epic. 
              (or better have). Good couple days.&quot; </p>

              time crawling through this empty dungeon in search of adventure 
              and loot. We managed to fight our way deep into the caverns slaying 
              many beasts. Among the loot drops were: 2 Phase Spider Carapace 
              [Lisner, Aorthin], Light Velium Claidmore [Valoria], an axe [Silvercaster], 
              numerous junk weapons, and quest gems &amp; spells. I'm sure we 
              will return to this dungeon soon.</p>

              The Qeynos badge quest is perhaps the most interesting and complex 
              quests I've ever seen in the game. For the first badge, you control 
              an NPC pet, have him give you items, summon guards, and watch him 
              interact with other NPCs. The second (get confession document before 
              you leave Qeynos) is even better, you get to interrogate an NPC 
              with a little fist-persuasion. Third step blew me away: you turn 
              in item to spawn a gameboard and you then play othello using rats, 
              diseased rats, and items you looted from an evil necro (see screenshot). 
              Absolutely the most different quest you will ever do and I encourage 
              people to try it out. Only problem with the quest is if you mess 
              up, you have to start all over.</p>

              We did some cool things this week, like a Sontalak, a Dozekar the 
              Cursed, and Zlandicar (ok, Zlandicar isn't cool, especially when 
              he drops 2 guantlets of complete crap, but he dropped a key thingie 
              for us, so its all good). </p>
            <p>We also went to Sleepers last night. It was a good night for us, 
              but a hellish night to be a warder<br>
            </p>
            October 14: I had to give an exam this week. I don't know what it 
            is about exams, but somehow sitting in a room for two hours while 
            150 people sweat over an organic chemistry exam just kind messes up 
            my week. I was so out of sorts I even forgot to take pictures of some 
            stuff we killed. Ah well, you know what Lendiniara and Sontalak look 
            like (grats to Hidemi and Marisa on ST keys, by the way). 
            <p>I think we tried a ring war somewhere, but due to some ABSOLUTELY 
              WONDERFUL programming on behalf of Verant, wave three didn't just 
              spawn, it spawned twice, and there is nothing like 20+ level 51+ 
              giants charging you to put an end to a party. So not only did we 
              get to hear about how we ruined the Great Divide for 3 hours, we 
              heard about screwing up Thurgadin for however long it stays butchered 
              (by the way, there are other places to hunt besides GD, thx). But, 
              the whole incident inspired some artwork by our very own Pfalnyeri.</p>

              So far only talks have occured and nothing is in stone. They are 
              both good guilds by experience and reputation. If successfull this

              Kael tonights was a blast. We ended up with almost three full groups 
              and Sader moved us down to the Arena with no problems. We managed 
              to spend a few hours there and both Gaeanorn and Chanity scored 
              loot. Corroded leather glovces, and torn silk bracers respectively. 
              Aside from some gems, that was about all we got. Lame ass no dropping

              This weekend, we plan on raiding Hate. This will be a Saturday morning 
              raid, you know, early bird gets the worm and what have ya. I will 
              confirm the start time before Friday to make sure that everyone 
              has enough time to schedual and plan. I am hoping for a clean sweep 
              of the first floor, and if we have enough maybe venture into the 
              second floor. 
            <p>
              If you are planning on coming, please make sure you have pleanty 
              of food and water. I will but all regents, and all gems for spells, 
              so post a list of what you need on the boards In turn, I will then 
              loot all trinkets, and all diamonds will be rolled on for resist 
              gear. Be sure you are prompt. I would like to move in quickly and 
              take the place by storm. If you have any questions, email me, or 
              post them on the boards. 
            <p>
              What I am looking at for the future is knocking out some of the 
              epics for some of the people who are close to completing them. If 
              you are close, I would appreciate it if you would post what we need 
              to do, along with spawn times and how we need to make them spawn, 
              or what we need to do. This should be a big help in planning on 
              how we will get this done.<p>
              Remember, we are still looking for tanks to support our ever growing 
              cleric population. If you know anyone or run across anyone who you 
              feel would be a good candidate for KoT, please direct them to an 
              officer or myself, or even the CHARTER/RECRUITMENT page on this 
              very site. We are getting closer to where we want to be, but having 
              some true damage dealers/takers will only get us a step closer.

              First off id like to welcome all our new members into the LoD family. 
              Welcome Halmir, Metaleze, Eamane, Longdale, Feni, Celtin, Apogee, 
              Starlight, Cienya, and Oryanna.
            <p>I would also like to congratulate some of our member on making 
              the long dreadful journey to level 60. Its been a hard road but 
              one that is well deserved. Well done Taroith, Karksus, Khrystania, 
              and Salerien.</p>
            <p>We have had some more epic completions as of late and Id like to 
              congratulate our members that has received their new toys. First 
              we have Malory &quot;Cleric Epic&quot; Wow this was a test of our 
              endurance. Camped Ragefire for close to 90 hours. This took some 
              serious dedication and commitment from all our members and our Alliance 
              BDA. When I say &quot;thank you&quot; I know I speak for many and 
              everyone that helped achieve this for Malory and LoD. This was one 
              of our toughest feats yet. We also previous to this and during this 
              time had some more epics completed. Congrats Pikaroofy on her Monk 
              epic, Leneril on his Ranger epic, Lluvien on his Rogue epic, as 
              well was Lobol on his Rogue epic.</p>
            <p>LoD then decided to journey back to Hate with our Alliance BDA, 
              and many new friends. We planned on outfitting some of our newly 
              46+ members with some equipment and to seek out the dreaded minibosses 
              for more epic work. This week went along very well and had very 
              nice drops. We ventured to the 2nd floor and also many members were 
              able to get some serious upgrades in equipment. I'd like to congratulate 
              everyone that had received new toys and a new look while we overthrew 
              this plane. Unfortunately we were only able to obtain one epic piece, 
              which was the hate crystal for the Ranger epic. Congrats to Gallerien.</p>
            <p>Looking forward we plan to hit more challenging zones that include 
              Kael, and ToV. We have a lot of work ahead of us and we soon will 
              be a force felt in these zones.</p>
            <p>Keep up the good work, everyone. Until next time. </p>

            <p>The Relentless<br>
              Over the past few weeks we've lost maybe a member here, or a member 
              there to DAOC, or real life. Oh hell, who am we kidding, our private 
              forum sounds like a home for elderly and tired retirees. So what 
              does your neighborhood ub4r guild do when presented with frail and 
              retiring members? Well, we look to stock our ranks with some of 
              the finest of the server....<br>
              ...Upon discovering that the finest have left for other games, we 
              decided to look other places, and thus, we have two new members 
              to welcome this week, one of them a returning a member of long forgotten 
              yester-year. And so with no further a due, we welcome Magnuss Surestab 
              and Burgers Jackson to the guild.
            <p>ToV North started spawning so we decided we'd pay a little visit. 
              Aary went down without a hitch (like 3 deaths), grats Teufle on 
              your Hand of the Master. Next up was Fesh, who brought his guards 
              as usual. All 3, dragon included, were slaughtered in typcial fashion, 
              grats Etiena on your b00bjob. Dagarn and Kriezzen came next, special 
              grats to Tyrani the &quot;Toe&quot;, the only alliance monk more 
              feminine than Soel, on your Wurmy hot pants. Soel also got some 
              boots. Mad props to Kriezzen for the worst drops ever in any life. 
              Thx for the Rogue dagger and the Bard horn. No idea who got this 
              stuff, grats I guess?
            <p>Since the resident gimps were busy freeporting to Mirenella after 
              riding our coattails to SafeSpot, we decided to cap Lord Fish`Freeloot, 
              who kicked down an uber Net of the Deep Seas for EoD and something 
              slightly less owny than that for us (no, I can't remember what). 
              Mir was next, who was dispatched in about 10 seconds as usual and 
              kicked down Gloves and 2 Hats, grats Ephron on a hat.</p>
            <p>Jorll and Nev were owned the next day. Unfortunately Jorlleag gated 
              on the first attempt, I think Eti was busy cybering me at the time 
              though so I forgive her for not sieving. Jor dropped a Crown of 
              Resiliance, grats Shalastar on that, and some Onyx Chain Legs that 
              were awarded to Laan and promptly transformed him into the sauciest 
              ranger on the server.</p>
            <p>The triplets died next and aren't worth mentioning, except for 
              Cekenar who was kind enough to kick down two uber Blackstars. Grats 
              Malstorme on a truly owny item!</p>
            <p>Vyemm died so fast he's hardly worth mentioning. However, what 
              IS worth mentioning is Ephron's new phatty hammer. Grats on that 
              27/25 bad boy, now go bash in some heads. </p>
            <p>Finally.. Vulak. Every time we kill this loser he dies faster, 
              and even with his new Flurry proc he's no match for the BFA. Now 
              his loot table is pretty good, but he made us all vomit in terror 
              this time by dropping THREE monk loots. Our monk loot quota had 
              already been generously fulfilled by Dagarn, so you can imagine 
              how surprised we were to see Gharn's Rock, Xave's Headband AND Abashi's 
              slimy rod off of ONE Vulak. Grats Hamishh on your rock, Soel on 
              his sexy new rod, and Tyrani on her Headband. And please never drop 
              any of this crap again.</p>

              Well, I would regail you with tales of vast and mighty conquest, 
              but it's been a tough week for me, and honestly there is more to 
              write up than I could cover. Suffice to say we went places, and 
              did stuff, and afterwards......things were different.
            <p>While the goings and the doings are a blast, the things that make 
              it consistantly fun are the folks you do it with, so I will merely 
              include some of the stuff that has tickled me over the past week, 
              hope you enjoy. [see the screenshots on the website].<br>

            <p>This week it's all about tactics, strategy and raids. We had a 
              shakedown raid to Dragon Necropolis that went very well. After that 
              we stepped up to the plate in the Plane of Hate, to insure and refine 
              our raiding ability in a zone with plenty of pulls and a few large 
              mobs.
            <p>We've down well, we've got the pulling rhythm down, main assist 
              grabbing and holding aggro fast - tanks circling and nuke teams 
              beyond aggro. Overall, we're ready to look forword to some major 
              fights. After a few weeks of members leveling we've got our average 
              guild level up to 58 and rising. Our calendar has an extensive schedule 
              to finish quite a few epics in October. Once done, we expect to 
              start farming the Temple of Veeshan again in November. We've got 
              the plan, we've got the people and we've got the talent.</p>
            <p>Shahmat is recruiting 54+ people. Mostly Clerics, Enchanters, Mages 
              and Warriors but we will consider all other classes. Please stop 
              by and check us out. <a href="http://www.shagya.com">http://www.shagya.com

              Black Circle of Fear with the help of Tuatha, took down Faydadar. 
              Congratulations to all involved. Tuatha hope to make a second attempt 
              on Faydadar for Futts epic on Thursday. Please support this raid 
              if possible!</p>
            <p>10/20 Well done to everyone who attended our first solo hate raid. 
              A few sticky situations were handled with skill and good humour. 
              Loot was pretty good and will be listed later. Well done all, Im 
              proud of each and every member! </p>
            <p>10/12/2001<br>
              Yes we are moving to another level now, Tuatha has been around in 
              some form or another for more than 2 years now. However not until 
              recently has it really came of age and began to venture into the 
              higher level game. Dragon raids, epic mobs, planes, its all coming 
              to fruitition now, and things can only get more exciting.</p>
            <p>Just last night Ullump was taken out by 16 Tuathans, with the help 
              of Analiea and Stilletto who kindly came along to assist! For those 
              that dont know he is Froglok with some 32'000 hitpoints. The fact 
              that we even attempted this is a sign of our growing strength but 
              the fact we did this with just one loss is a testament to our increase 
              in experience.</p>
            <p>Futt has also returned to us, from his time with a bigger guild. 
              He returns to us level 59, and with a wealth of experience that 
              will be of value to us in the coming challenges. Welcome home Futt, 
              its good to have you back.<br>
