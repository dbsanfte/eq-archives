Runethar Hamest in the Temple of Thunder is investigating corruption among the guards of Qeynos. He asks you to go to Surefall Glade, find Frenway Marthank in the Druids' Guildtree, and ask him for "The Bayle List." He also tells you that if you bring him this list and the Thunder Staff, he will give you a special reward. Go first to talk to Frenway in Surefall. When you do, Frenway is in a state of depression. His son -- who happened to be carrying the very list you're looking for -- was killed and devoured by the great grizzly bear Mammoth, who lives deep in the caves of Surefall Glade. As a Druid, Frenway is forbidden to harm the bears of the Glade, but he wants vengeance. If you can find and slay Mammoth, you will get the list. (or give mammoth the regurgatonic and he will cough it up for you). Return it and the Mammoth's hide to Frenway and he will in turn give you the Bayle List II. There are more than a few people in Surefall Glade who will strike you down for attacking the bears, so be very careful. Once you have the Bayle list II, you need to get the thunderstaff. You can get this by doing the good version of the Drosco the Zombie quest. He will give you the thunderstaff. Take that and the Bayle list II back to Runethar, and he will reward you with your very own Bonethunder Staff.

Droscoe the Zombie (good)
<p>
Wolten will tell you about a zombie that wanders the sewers. He wants you to kill it for him. The zombie (it used to be named Droscoe, but now may just be called a zombie) drops and amulet and a letter. The amulet and letter that Drosco carries can be taken to the Temple of Karana (Temple of Thunder) in South Qeynos. The amulet can be given to Wolten Grafe, the Keeper of the Medallions of the Order of Thunder, for xp, faction adjustments and sometimes a Thunder Staff. (There is a female in the temple who also will reward you for the amulet with a few coppers). It could also lead to another quest. These factions change when you kill Droscoe: BloodSabers and Corrupt Guards of Queynos go down and Order of Thunder goes up.
<p>
The Regurgitonic
<p>
The zoo keeper, Kimble Nogflop will give you a regurgatonic if you bring him a flask of nitrates. You can get the nitrates from Gerael Woodone in Surefall Glades.
<p>
Give Kimble the flask and you get you get experience and faction;<br> +GemChoppers<br> +MerchantsofAkAnon<br> +KingAkAnon<br> -DarkReflection<br>
<p>
He then gives you the regurgatonic, and says to give it to "who may need it and they will surely cough up whatever may be inside them with no harm to them whatsoever."
<p>
One known use for this is to give it to frostbite the dog to get him to cough up the koalindl fish, which is needed in several quests (most notably the stein of mogguk quest).
<p>
You can also use it on the Mammoth in Surefall to get the bayle list II.
