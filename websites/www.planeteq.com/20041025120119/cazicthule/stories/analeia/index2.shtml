<b class="heading">Analeia, Part II</b><br>
<i>by</i> Penya Dreamlight

<br><br>
There were times Analiea hated her half-sister in a mindless, sibling rivalry sort of way. Now was one of those times. Loralie had just gotten off of the boat from Butcherblock, yet she could walk into Tassles Tavern with her dress still sparkling white, her hair perfectly in place and draw every man’s eyes. Analiea knew she had drawn everyone’s attention, but simply waved at gestured at her pet, who was carrying a heavy trunk, then took another drink of her ale. Worlik grunted and whispered, “Same old Loralie, I see.”
<br><br>
At seeing her half-sister, Loralie smiled and crossed the room. She sat at the chair they had pulled up for her, leaving her pet standing, or rather floating, behind her. With a quick gesture, Loralie ordered to the pet to put the trunk down and guard her. It muttered “Guarding you Master,” in voice that sounded like the wind. With her high-elf good looks and high-bred bearing, she seemed out of place in the tavern filled with the adventurers of Norrath. Although some of the people wore their armor, most of them – including Worlik and Analiea – were wearing comfortable leathers and plain cotton materials in attempt to relax. Around the trio conversations about an influx of orcs in the area, and a new undead presence in Kithicor could be overheard. These people spoke of battles and war in a casual air, not aware that these events were as far from most people as the sky.
<br><br>
“I’m glad you could come, Lor,” Analiea said.
<br><br>
“Now how could I pass up such a nicely worded invitation?” Loralie laughed, “How did it go? Oh yes, ‘Loralie, bring your father’s trunk to Freeport. We need it.’ A ‘please’ would have been nice.”
<br><br>
Analiea shrugged, “Worlik wrote the note. I was doing other things.”
<br><br>
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://ads.gamespyid.com/ad.aspx?S=planeteverquest&A1=NONE&G1=RPG&T=3&P2=0&A2=0&A3=300x250?unique"></script>
 
Loralie grinned, but let the subject drop. Analiea noted that her sister was wearing more jewelry than she used to, and it seemed to be a more expensive quality. She must have been practicing the craft more than she had when Analiea still lived in Felwith.
<br><br>
“Well, you’re here,” Worlik grumbled, “Let’s see the trunk.” He stood, picked up the trunk with a surprising strength, and placed it on the table with a thunk.
<br><br>
As the dwarf opened the trunk and started going through it, Loralie asked, “What is going on?”
<br><br>
Quickly Analiea gave her the summation of the dream. Once the story was over, and she was sure she had her sister’s attention, she pulled the medallion out to show the jeweler. Loralie took it with interest, looking carefully at the myriad of symbols on it. “This is masterfully done,” she commented, “I count 56 symbols on both sides.”
<br><br>
“But it lacks beauty with no stones,” a voice commented from behind her. They all looked up to see a wood elf peering over Loralie’s shoulder, “Interesting piece.”
<br><br>
“Hail, Jimmu, teller of tales.” Analiea responded warmly. “How are you these days.”
<br><br>
Jimmu dragged a chair to the table and pronounced, “Bored. However, that little bauble of yours perks my interest.”
<br><br>
“Why?” Analiea asked sharply, “What does it mean to you?”
<br><br>
“Nothing really, except it seems to have the crest of most the evil clans in the known realms.” The trio could only stare at the wood elf as he continued, “The one big symbol is the crest of Innoruuk, but I don’t recognize the other. My guess would be a family crest.”
<br><br>
“You wouldn’t know which one?” Worlik asked abuptly.
<br><br>
Jimmu shook his head with a wry smile, “I am not familiar with the families of Neriak, which is where I would guess this is from. If its important to you, I can take you to someone who might know.”
<br><br>
As Worlik and Analiea began to question Jimmu sharply about where and when they could meet the informant, Loralie began to sort though the contents of chest. As she did so, a colorful swatch of painted silk caught her eye that she did not remember seeing before. She picked it up, but when the conversation turned to leaving the Tavern to meet the informant, she slipped it into the pockets of her robe to examine later.
<br><br>
Without a word, Worlik picked up the chest and announced, “I am going to put this in Lor’s room at the Tiger. Where do we want to meet?”
<br><br>
“We can’t meet at the Temple,” Jimmu said, “How about at the docks?” They all nodded in agreement.
<br><br>
About an hour later, the group re-assembled on the docks. Jimmu came out of the dockhouse first and carefully looked around. Without saying a word, he passed the group that was assembled by one of the piers watching people coming off of the boat from Butcherblock and descended the stairs to the area underneath the pier where people sometimes fished. Loralie watched him go by and began to smile at the strangers, offering to weave her magic to bind them in that place should something bad happen to them on their journeys. Several people were taking her up on her kind offer and were beginning to huddle around her. Worlik simply tapped his foot impatiently, muttering something about rude wood elves. They waited a fewmoments, then Jimmu re-emmerged from the pier with a short elf. His black skin caused all of the elves on the pier to look at him with hatred in their eyes. One woman upon seeing him abruptly pulled her child to her skirts and hurried away from the man. The child protested at the rough handling and looked up with curiosity at the silver-haired man that had caused such reaction. Worlik scowled fiercely but waited for Jimmu to get within earshot before he said, “You could have told us your ‘informant’ is an inkie.”
<br><br>
Jimmu looked at Worlik with a wry smile, “I wanted to make sure you would talk to him.”
<br><br>
Analiea looked at the dark elf carefully. His black robe marked him as a magic user of some sort.  Loralie, who was finally finished binding the travelers, turned and also measured up the stranger. “What discipline do you practice, sir, and what might we call you?”
<br><br>
The dark elf turned to her, meeting her blue eyes and said, “You may call me many things,” looking pointedly at Worik “but my name is Anarchy.”
<br><br>
Loralie rewarded the comment with a warm smile and asked, “And your discipline?”
<br><br>
“I am an enchanter.”
<br><br>
“Oh good, I work with jewelry, but have no way to enchant the metal. I am always looking for someone who can do it for me.” She once again met the dark elf’s eyes. Anarchy seemed taken aback at the openness with which the high elf dealt with him. 
<br><br>
As Loralie spoke, Worlik crossed his arms and grumbled to Analiea, “You should control your sister.” Analiea laid a soothing hand on Worlik’s tense shoulder but made no reply. Abruptly Worlik shoved the medallion at the dark elf, pulling Anarchy’s attention away from Loralie. “Have you seen any of this. That’s why you are here.”
<br><br>
Anarchy took the piece with interest, ignoring the dwarf’s hostility. “I don’t recognize most of it, but this,” he pointed to the second circle besides the Innuruk symbol, ”is the crest of the D’Irinik family.”
<br><br>
“And who are they?” Analiea asked softly.
“It’s an old Neriak family. They were one of the most powerful families for centuries.” Anarchy shook his head, “They began to decline when they began to try to gain control of all Neriak. The last one in the line disappeared a generation ago.”
<br><br>
“Then how do you recognize the symbol?” Worlik asked.
<br><br>
Anarchy looked at him levelly and said, “This symbol can still be seen carved on the walls of the caverns of the city. The symbols have just lately been painted there, but no one knows by who or why.”
<br><br>
Analiea and Worlik pondered the information, and Jimmu and Anarchy began looking at the other symbols on the medallion. Distracted, Loralie pulled out the silk she had found in the chest. She held it up to the sun, only to gasp in shock and drop it.  The delicate material fluttered to the wooden surface of the pier as the others turned to look at her in alarm. “Look” she said breathlessly.
<br><br>
Worlik crossed over to pick up the cloth, his face draining of color. It was nearly identical to the tapestry that hung in the stone room of their dream. The horrors of war were displayed there, with the armies of evil over-running the good. Analiea frowned and said, “Let me see that.” When Worlik handed it to her, Analiea held it up to the light only at a different angle than her sister had done. “Look at this,” she ordered sharply. The group all peered at the cloth as she moved in the light. Depending on how the light hit the silk, the scene changed. In one direction it appeared as if the dark side was winning, in the other, it was the armies of light that over-ran the darkness. Near the top of the scene was a smaller battle involving two groups of people. One group was composed of Trolls, Ogres and Dark elves, the other members of the light being fought with a dragon behind the battle. .The artistry was perfect enough, that even though the figures were small they could still be recognized. . The two groups seemed to be competing for the possession of a sword. If the cloth was held where the light was winning the battle, Analiea stood with the sword in her hands with the group of the light delivering the final blow to the evil ones. If the dark had won the battle, the dark elf from their dream held the sword triuphantly over his head, and the band were delivering the final blows to the fighters for the light. Loralie, Analiea, and Worlik could clearly see their features there. Surprisingly though, one of the figures fighting for the light could be recognized as Anarchy. 
<br><br>
At seeing his figure being gutted by an orc on the silk, the dark elf said, “Ok, you have my attention.” The party could do nothing but stare at each other in amazement in the bright Freeport sunlight.
