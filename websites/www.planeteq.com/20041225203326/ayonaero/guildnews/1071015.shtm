                <br>
                Posted By: Gandien on 10-14-02 @ 09:10:38 <br>
                The first thing that comes to mind when I think of this last Sunday 
                is... Holy Shit! Let me break down the list of kills. Vindi in 
                early AM, Rhag 1, Rhag 2, Arch Lich, Ragefire, Vindicator, Statue, 
                Idol of Rallos Zek, Avatar of War, Burrower Parasite, and the 
                THO. ELEVEN FLAWLESS RAIDS!!! or.. in the words of Melciah.. &quot;WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT!&quot; 
                Of course if you include each of the seven waves to the Burrower 
                its more like eighteen! Then again thats like going to the express 
                checkout isle and they count each egg as 1 item.</p>
              <p>The Arch Lich went down quickly and with little difficulty to 
                our raid force in Ssra for some very nice items. At the AoW raid, 
                despite Idol poofing on camp when the Statue was killed we got 
                him under control quickly and with little difficulty and proceeded 
                to finish him off. The Avatar fight went very quickly and we were 
                out of KD in record time. Next we did a quick target check and 
                found the Burrower Beast up in The Deep. We moved in quickly and 
                everyone exectuted precisely and from start to finish that was 
                our fastest Burrower kill ever. Finally, and just because he was 
                up, the THO had to die. We moved in and cleared out the room and 
                took him down with plenty of time to spare. Grats to everyone 
                on EXCELLENT mobilization and kills. Grats to the winners on their 
                new toys.</p>
              <p>Oh, and you Euros wont understand the news topic, but Im flattered 
                that you take the time to read our news. Whats the URL to yours 
                again? <br>

              <p>Added another NToV dragon to the list conquered by XA tonight.. 
                ole Lord Kreizenn. Knock on wood, he actually had decent drops 
                too. Graivus sucks at using computers, so the screenshot of dead 
                Kreizenn will have to wait a day or two. Korl kindly pointed out 
                what we had killed today, after I asked &quot;time&quot;. That 
                and Lord Kreiz was it!</p>

              <p>Don't have enough clerics or chanters or any key class? Bot it 
                up! So, we started today in WToV. Holy boring and way oldschool! 
                To liven things up the main tank somehow lost his Aego, so he 
                died at one point, and Grulok stepped up and tanked the rest of 
                Telkorenar. Then over to Gozzrem we went, but not a single person 
                died.. WTF? Not even a ranger, we were sad. Mother weeped. Kala 
                cried. The worled held still for a few moments. Fear not, we will 
                kill a ranger or 20 next time!</p>
              <p>After that, we took a little break, then went to kill Dozekar 
                the Cursed.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>We sure do kill alot of dragons..</p>
              <p><br>
                For a night cap(for some of us at least) we went to the Umbral 
                Plains for our buddy Rumblecrush. What a annoyingly dumb, boring, 
                easy, stupid mob. So easy in fact I got Graivus killed, Terhas 
                got killed as well, and uhm, yeah!</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Looks like Izin really enjoys that big foot up his ass!</p>

              <p>Our new guildname, of course! I for one am voting yes on this 
                name, it sums up the guild like nothing else. When you have monks 
                who run around just to KS the guild bard-slut all day, what else 
                can you be but a moron? A bard hater? Nah, everyone loves bards 
                and hates rangers! So yeah, the nice screenshot of XA gang-banging 
                the Itraer Poo is not working; GFY! We smoked dat ass and thats 
                all you need to know.</p>
              <p><br>
                Toady some more mobs got offed, more lame, boring, old, worn-out, 
                tiresome, annoying, crap-loot dropping mobs. Doomshade? Klandicar? 
                a_crystalline_watcher1934? Yeap, more shittastic loot as well:</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Skyjulin - Crystal Enervated Armband</p>
              <p>Lancelet - Longsword of Free Sucky Sucky</p>
              <p>Almadar - Bracelet of Sexual Stamina</p>
              <p>Cenbus - Pebble Crusher of Balls</p>
              <p>Muza - Key to Sleeper's Tomb(now he can STFU about ST key)</p>
              <p>Guildbank(my twinking account) - Lotsa crap loot</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                On a special note, a big thanks to Thana for making the trivial 
                encounter with Klandicar a bit more... boring? Bringing trains 
                of 2 mobs at a time every time we tried to engage was... annoying? 
                Next time, remember to train at least 6 mobs at a time and hopefully 
                at minimum a ranger will get dead. And remember, what goes around, 
                comes around.</p>

                amazingly lame skills with html, ftp, and other computer related 
                sciences finally paid off! So, having this new found feature, 
                I bring you the screenshot of the day(notice its a bid oldschool)!<br>

                Xping in Akheva we found this bad boy up time as DL did. So we 
                double teamed up knowing the amount of HP it has would help to

                going out of style, including getting another last night and dropping 
                Ragefire w/ 16 ppl, fun fight to say the least. That brings us 
                up to 6 epiced clerics in about 2 weeks. good work guys. In that 
                time also dropped the guy in Cabilis for Reyden. No pics of kill 
                a rather amusing text pic and a pic of Beska from CODH getting 
                the moon show from Fury, for trying to steal the Zordak camp in 
                Sol B from us. Didn't happen and Arizen got her epic that night.</p>

                .. Well after 3 bad breaks we finally managed to settle ourselves

                say we did a great job. Thanks all for making this try out a success

                After a few weeks of camping shards and listening to Ala gripe 
                about the Sol B camp, we were finally ready to whoop on Ragefires 
                ass again. Early sunday evening we set up in Skyfire, Ala does 
                his little trigger thing and bam there be a Dragon here captain! 
                Of course we descale the red bitch and sent him packing, Grats 
                to Alagrone on the rez noodle!!! Details and pictures at 6.. </p>
              <p> <br>

              <p> <br>
                Also got a pair of the fire red leggings which went to Sonia, 
                and two pairs of boots, one to Elenril for resist gear and another 
                to Erkose's alt Pally. Grats everyone and Great work! </p>

                Well gotta love ISP's.. They take access away to do some upgrades, 
                then when they bring everything back up.. opps we forgot to tell 
                you, we changed your PW to get into your webhosting space.. grrrrr... 
                Anyways, sorry for the lack of updates lately, so this gonna be 
                a decent sized one. So.. what have we been up to? First lets start 
                off with sunday afternoon, we join up with IO once again, and 
                whoop Vindi's ass. Congrats to Kowai on the BP! </p>
              <p> <br>
                Then we headed off to CoM, killed some reavers to get this guy 
                to spawn. kicked his ass, and Finished Xectors Epic!! WHoot! Another 
                one down, more to go .. </p>

                Also been kicking the snot out of the General Blasbitch in Echo 
                Caverns to upgrade some of our melee's weapons, Pretty nice sword 
                10/18 + stats. Grats to those who have gotten so far! more slaughters 
                of him to come.. </p>
              <p> <br>
                Also last week we were in HoT with IO, Grats to all who got drops!. 
                Overall havent been that busy, but slowly getting some things

              <p>Helloooooo Shadows! Well our first guild wedding went off without 
                a hitch (if you don't count people casting AoE spells at the close 
                of the ceremony &amp; killing several guests a hitch), and we'd 
                like to welcome Bexie to the guild. Here's to a happy virtual

              <p>Because of a smaller than expected turnout for the Kael raid 
                last week, the score ended up being Giants=8, RoS=0. Still, a 
                good time was had by all, and thank all who came for participating 
                (you know who you are). We'll get 'em next time. More raids will 
                be announced soon, so stay tuned.</p>

                <b>ANNOUNCEMENT TO ALL NEW MEMBERS</b> (and some old)</p>
              <p>RoS has grown quite a bit in the last 2 weeks, and we are still 
                trying to compile a complete list of our members. All members, 
                please go to the CONTACT page and send us a message listing your 
                characters &amp; alts, along with class/race/level, so we can 
                put a complete roster together. There was a thread on the message 
                board for this, but I know our message board is filled with annoying 
                pop-ups, so maybe this will work better. Also, anyone who wants 
                their picture on the members page, take a screenshot &amp; send 
                it to the e-mail listed on the above page, or ask an officer in-game 
                &amp; we can take one for you.</p>

              <p><b>GUILD TAG BUGS IN GAME</b></p>
              <p>There was a bug in the game last week where people were being 
                dropped from their guild when entering certain zones. If this 
                happened to you, you have NOT been kicked out; just find an officer 
                online &amp; he will be glad to re-tag you. If any officers happened 
                to lose their status, Chrystian/Vyolent/Wyccan will have to re-instate 
                you.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Also, welcome to all our new members; too many of you to list 
                by name, but welcome to the family!</p>

                Hum, seems Verant is gonna make some changes. Posted Wednesday, 
                October 9, 2002 by Silvermaine<br>
                Well kiddies, Verant is making some very major changes in the 
                next patch. Seems that Complete Heal, Mana Burn, Mages, and Monks 
                will feel the brunt of these changes. Complete heal will now be 
                a 7500 hp heal, not that Vallis has any tanks that reach that 
                level currently. Mana Burn will now have a 1min 1sec timer on 
                it where a mob will not be affected by another wizard's MB, Mages 
                mod rods are now no drop and summoned to the person that is targeted, 
                also will only give you 350 mana for 450 hp and can only be used 
                once every minute. Monks, well, seems that their defensive capibilities 
                are being reduced some by being put on a different damage table, 
                most likely the rogue/ranger one or one slightly different in 
                how they take damage. </p>
              <p>I'm sure there will be lots of discussion on this topic with 
                lots of wailing and gnashing of teeth by those affected by these 
                changes. You can read more about it here.</p>
              <p>Grats are also in order for Azaral. He managed to off that nasty 
                beast called Trak for his Epic. One more epic has entered the 
                world.</p>
              <p>Vallis is also recruiting. Were looking for some very talented 
                folks of various classes to round out our ranks. If your 55 and 
                over, come check us out, find some sluts and show off your abilities. 
                Were a CoV/Dwarf alligned guild and are mostly 57 and over. <br>
