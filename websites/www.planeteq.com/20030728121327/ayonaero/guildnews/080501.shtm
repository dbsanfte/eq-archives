              <blockquote>08/08/01: It got time for another routine kill. Sontalak 
                was so kind to show up so we went there and took him down. First 
                fight wasn't that great, tks mass linkdead, but second one was 
                ok and we kicked him hard. <br>
                <br>
                He dropped us Sontalak's Talisman for Ovelia. Grats to the winner. 
                <br>
                <br>
                After Sontalak we decided to move on to VP and clear it, since 
                no other boss mob was up at that moment. It went very well and 
                the entire dungeon was dragon free within the next 4.5 hours. 
                Silverwing, Hoshkar, Xygoz, Druushk, Nexona, Phara Dar got their 
                rear filled with a fiery feeling again and went away. ;) Grats 
                to the guild for the good work! <br>
                <br>
                08/09/01: A nice start for the day was the Derakor the Vindicator 
                in Kael. Since his guards were hiding (/rude) we got Vindi + 2 
                temple guardians inc. This time we showed that we learned of former 
                mistakes, we kited Vindi while we were killing the damn guards. 
                After that we killed him! <br>
                <br>
                He dropped us an Earring of Living Thunder for Tanaya. Grats to 
                the winner! <br>
                <br>
				<script type="text/javascript" src="http://ads.gamespyid.com/ad.aspx?S=PE&A1=NONE&G1=RPG&T=3&P2=0&A2=0&A3=IAB_MEDIUM_RECTANGLE?unique"></script>
 
                Kiss Norrath good-bye The Statue of Rallos Zek. After Mr Vindicator 
                was killed we decided to take down the Statue as well. The fight 
                went pretty good and she was flattened fast. <br>
                <br>
                It was Cloak's day....it had three Cloak of Falling Skies for 
                Corel, Svara and Melodie and also an Iron Scroll of War for our 
                sexy Anastasia. Grats to the winners! <br>
                <br>
                Then it seemed to be a slacking day, since nothing else was up 
                but then Sontalak the Ugly spawned right on me. We gathered forces 
                pretty fast and took him down only one hour after he showed up. 
                Grats Tala for your Sontalak's Talisman. <br>
                <br>
                The spawning went on and Zlandicar spawned as well. Big thanks 
                to you my friend, since you gave us another opportunity to kill 
                you again. We couldn't resist this nice offer. So we went to DN 
                after we were done with Sontalak. Zlandicar followed Sontalak 
                and died as fast. <br>
                <br>
                He dropped a bit more than Sontalak tho....Zlandicar's Talisman 
                for Aldarys and a Frakadar's Talisman for Alanthuriel, also the 
                Zlandicar's Heart, a Cowl of Mortality and the Cracked Claw of 
                Zlandicar. Grats to all the winners! <br>
                <br>
                08/11/01: Welcome to the Darkwind Jedi ranks, Kerleblanc. Your 
                testings took longer than for any other DW Jedi before. But in 
                the end you were successful and got your double lightsabers! Big 
                GRATS my friend!<br>
                <br>
                Then it got time for Kerleblanc to test his new toys on Mr Sontalak. 
                Too bad for the dragon, since we killed him in no time and our 
                barbu went on a killing spree. <br>
                <br>
                Sontalak's Talisman went to Mr DWTrueshot Kalaar. Grats to the 
                winner! <br>
                <br>
                Since our first ranger got finally his key we decided to show 
                him ST right after Sontalak's death. We fought our way through 
                ST, killed MotG, The Progenitor and The Final Arbiter before finally 
                reaching the warders area. Up to that moment we didn't have a 
                single loss. We were really lucky since the first warder - Nanzata 
                the Warder - was up. We gathered forces, buffed and attacked her. 
                The weak gimp went down without problems and wasn't able to kill 
                one of us. Poor old dragon.<br>
                <br>
                Loot was pretty nice tho: we got a Primal Velium Battle Axe, a 
                Primal Velium Warlance for our now better looking pally Danthalas 
                and also a Primal Velium Reinforced Bow for Kalaar. The two Red 
                Resistance Stones went to Melyania and Samarea and the Staff of 
                the Elder Claw went to Thorgal. Grats to all the winners!! <br>
                <br>
                And we were even more lucky that the third warder - Hraashna the 
                Warder - was up as well. We refreshed our buffs, got ready and 
                pulled her/him/it. This fight was a bit harder, since the warder 
                used a really vile AE breath. But in the end, the darkwindian 
                power was bigger. So we could add Hraashna the Warder to our kill 
                list and dance on his corpse! <br>
                <br>
                We got another Primal Velium Reinforced Bow, this time for uberbarbu 
                Lumadorf, a Bracer of the Claw for Danagorn, two White Resistance 
                Stones for Thorgal and Eaithalahsar and two Writ of Dragonkind 
                for Zindragh and Aldarys. Grats to all winners and grats to the 
                guild for that guild firsty! </blockquote>
              <a href="http://www.eqdestiny.com/"><b>Destiny</b></a> 
              <blockquote>08/09/01: So, just as any other week in Destiny we finished 
                more epics. Flyte, Franswa, and Thorrin all finished their epic 
                quests this week. That brings our active roster to about 90% epic'd. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Thorrin's was quite an interesting story and just happened this 
                morning. Krynus called my house at 7 am this morning to wake up 
                me. Luckily for him Kervasis hadn't gone to work yet as Kerv knocks 
                on my door telling me that Krynus called and Ragefire spawned. 
                We had like 8 people and like 8 invites all of which were basically 
                sleeping. Leading a fire giant/Ragefire raid that took two hours 
                (things move slowly, while asleep) with 90% of the participants 
                not yet able to think was indeed a fun event. Nevertheless, we 
                downed Ragefire with the only death to an invite, Iisis with her

                We had also been in ToV all last weekend. Drops were good as usual 
                for chain, silk, and leather classes. No complaints from the plate 
                side either as every person walked away with one piece. Most notable 
                drops of the weekend were Pixle receiving a robe, Kubla, Gundre, 
                and me getting plate breastplates. Thrakki and Uthor getting plate 
                legs. And Blearch getting chain legs. Still to do this date.. 
                after 10 (or more) plate breastplates we have yet to get a chain 
                breastplate drop.<br>
                <br>
                08/10/01: One group can only take so much prodding, so much whining, 
                so much complaints from one member until they finally break down 
                and do what the member wants. Our resident Thundercat, Shadowtorch 
                just has been on a recent tirade for us to stop putting off mobs 
                we can kill and to do something new. Well, we broke down last 
                night and headed to Velk's. <br>
                <br>
                Now I'm sure as most people understand I was timid to help with 
                Velketor because something just feels dirty about getting int 
                casters loot in Velious.. just.. seems out of place. So we buffed 
                up, pulled with no idea what to expect, and got spanked. I mean, 
                we got straight up owned. Only got him down to 60% the first try. 
                But, that was the first time we ever attempted the mob and learned 
                quite a bit. <br>
                <br>
                Now, I'm sure you're wondering how we go from 60% on one try to 
                killing him later that night. The secret was for Kervasis and 
                I to run him around the room (with his guards) for 138 seconds. 
                At which point we stopped and Kervasis bashed Velketor into the 
                wall. Once in the wall our buddy Velk cast Chill Sight, a wizard 
                spell, over and over and over again. Kerv would cast dispell magic 
                every time Velk's ultravision spell hit. At which point the guild 
                charged into the room and beat a blind, out of mana Velketor, 
                into the wall. The end result if this crazy tactic was <a href="http://members.home.net/jlunsfo4/velk.jpg">this</a>! 
                <br>
                <br>
                I know I'll be getting harassed by other Velk-able guilds for 
                giving out the secret strategy but it just had to be done. <br>
                <blockquote><i>Disclaimer: To avoid trouble from above I've been 
                  instructed by a nameless man to make note when I am kidding 
                  about exploits. Destiny killing Velketor had no use of the z-axis, 
                  no use of the well known Chill Sight bug, and instead involved 
                  only good tactics and good execution by my guildmates. The corpse 
                  shot, is however, in a wall.. because well Norrath is a MYSTICAL 
                  place where so many things are full of mysteries. Not even walls 
                  can be assured to be solid. Thanks! </i></blockquote>

                to kill Vulak. At this point several of his dastardly henchman
