You say, 'Hail, Bronlor Lightblade'
<p>
Bronlor Lightblade says 'Allo dere Norin , how does ye fare today? Are ye a priest of the great Brell Serilis? If ye are not I mean nothin against yar but I am on a mission to administer guidance to a holy priest of milord Brell Serilis.
<p>
You say, 'priest'
<p>
Bronlor Lightblade says 'Well now were talkin Norin . I think if ye have been doing well in your training then ye will be ready to assist me in with the problem we been havin with those dern good fer nothin [green rascals].
<p>
You say, 'green rascals'
<p>
Bronlor Lightblade says 'Well of course I be talkin bout dose goblins that have tried to storm our front gates fer some time. I reckon dey are up to no good sense I hear dey just be a few from a well trained horde of goblin invaders that are planning an attack me thinks. Will ye [help] us in finding and slaying these [goblins]?
<p>
You say, 'help goblins'
<p>
Bronlor Lightblade says 'Dats great to hear Norin ! To prove to me that you have found and slain these beasts bring 4 sets of the beads that dey carry around their necks. I don't know much about dem but id reckon dey have set up camp close bye ere. The night watch that haulted the first attack by these goblins described the fighting style to be of the highest goblin caliber. I hope this helps, good luck to ye.
<p>
-Now head out to ButcherBlock and find loc n300,p1100. This is a previously empty cove between the goblin warrior camp and the yellow skeleton tower near the Crossroads region. Here spawns 3 enraged goblins. They always drop an "Enraged Goblin Beads" and spawn every 20-30 minutes (didn't have a chance to time it).
<p>
Collect 4 of these and return them to Bronlor Lightblade. You are told the following text:
<p>
Bronlor Lightblade says 'I knew that I was able to trust ye to help me rid the land of these nasty goblins! The Bloodforge Brigade salutes ye Norin . Ye will be well known in our city for being the young one that helped rid our mountains of these goblins. Please take this as a Symbol of your devotion to your faith and your God and return to me when ye are ready for yer next task.

After completing the Initiate Symbol of Brell quest, Bronlor will ask you to take a letter to Taldrik in Oasis. He also says to bring Taldrik his favorite drinks: Elven Wine, Dwarven Ale, and Freeport Stout. All of these drinks can be purchased near the docks in Freeport.
<p>
Buy the drinks and head to Oasis. In the Southwest corner of the Zone, very close to the wall, is Taldrik Stumpystout. Give him the Drinks and the Note and he will start talking about his favorite drink of all time, Brells Blessed Stout.
<p>
The ingredients for the stout are
<ul type="disc">
<li> Preserved Hops (undead brewer in the Estate of Unrest)
<li> Battleworn Canteen (Tolkar Balltemaster also in Unrest)
<li> Forest Barley (puchased in Kithicor), and
<li> a summoned water.
</ul>
Ask him about a cask and he will give you a special cask to combine them all in (no brewing skill required). Then hand him the Stout, a Rat sandwich (made by combining bread and rat meat in an oven), and the initiate symbol of Brell. You get the disciple symbol of Brell.
