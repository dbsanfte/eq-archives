              Its been a big past week for us. RZ was downed on our 2nd attempt 
              and we have been exploring the Ele planes. Grats to Talons and CC 
              and thanks for all the hard work...and deaths it took to get us 
              there. SS incoming soon as we get a decent one!</p>
            <p>In the meantime we have been gearing up for Sol Ro himself by flagging 
              the 5 mini's. From the expression on Xuzl...it doesn't look like 
              he was having a good day.<br>

            <p>Yep, another god dies on the first try. Course, the run was about 
              as smooth as a gravel-latte, but he's dead, and many happy people 
              cavorted in the Plane of Fire following his demise.</p>
            <p>No picture, because some dumbass necro skelly-formed the corpse 
              again. Hooray for morons!<br>
              In other news, we've only had a few minor forays into the elemental 
              planes, mostly in the Plane of Air. Nothing too serious, mostly 
              screwing around and focusing on learning the zone. We managed to 
              knock over 2 of the Avatars there, in the course of poking around. 
            </p>
            <p>The bigger focus for the week was getting the remainder of the 
              guild flagged for the elemental planes. So, with our partners in 
              crime, Talons, we went and killed: Terris Thule, Saryn, Agnarr, 
              Bertox, and all the Sol Ro Minis at least once. </p>
            <p>All in all, not a bad week.<br>

            <p>There's an old cliche about a picture being worth a thousand words. 
              And for us, its never been more true in EQ than at this moment. 
              A thousand words couldn't describe the stress, effort, and toil 
              that went into learning this encounter...a thousand words certainly 
              wouldn't do it justice.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>There's no greater sight for us than to see him dead. I could talk 
              about how its only our 2nd time spawning Rallos...or how we kept 
              1 tank up until 10%, or how we had a whopping 10 deaths or so knocking 
              down the god of war. I could talk about how, unlike many guilds, 
              our first kill had no post-rallos wipeout to the swarms of mobs 
              in the arena - how our members kept their cool, killed the adds, 
              secured the camp, and flagged the majority of people in our alliance. 
              I could talk about the phat lewtz (2 grimfaced visors, congrats 
              Whopper and uh...me!). I could add in the usual trash talk about 
              how we beat guilds x,y,z to downing him...but to be honest, none 
              of this stuff matters.</p>
            <p>What does matter, is that the God of War is dead by our hands, 
              and the Elemental Planes lie open before us. The future looks bright 
              for our alliance. <br>

              25 Years Later...Spriggan is an epic wielder <br>
              Posted by Grasnalg On Feb 24 2003 At 11:36:31 PM <br>
              Congratulations to our newest(and oldest) epic wielder. 
            <p> </p>
            <p>Way to go Sprigs on finally getting that elusive epic by finally 
              finishing off that silly fish. 2 dead Fayd's in 3 days. It's been 
              a druid kinda week.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Thanks to all the folks that took the time to come out and help 
              and gratz again Sprigs, this was a long time coming for a guy that 
              has been a Coggie for a long, long...long.......long time. Well 
              deserved!!!!!!!</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>P.S. Gratz to Pippette and Juggles from Draconis Ascendant. Both 
              finished up their druid epics and some CoG were there to help celebrate 
              their killing of Fayd. Pippette and Juggles thanked all the CoG 
              that came out to help and it was nice to meet some new friends.</p>
            <p><br>

              Cazel...dead, Fayd...dead, Gopher...DEAD <br>
              Posted by Grasnalg On Feb 22 2003 At 3:13:29 PM <br>
              Well, a handful of us headed out to finish up a druid epic and while 
              we were gathering in Oasis made quick work of Cazel. Gratz to Chantille 
              I think, on the spoon(why does a giant carry a spoon I'll never 
              know). Pretty sure Tautog solo'd him btw.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Well, once we all found our way to the Fayd isle(a long and tedious 
              journey, we really need more mages), Draconis Ascendant had a few 
              folks there, but graciously allowed us to have Fayd since we were 
              ready to take him out and had our druid there already. So, that 
              being said, we made quick work of the most pitiful dragon in all 
              of EQ and Jordanth finished up his leafblower. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Gratz Jordypoo! You beat your dad to getting your epic. Pretty 
              sad Berg.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>FYI, Draconis Ascendant will be trying to get their first epic 
              soon and if anyone is willing and able, they could really use some 
              help. I will try to be there when they do it and if and when I go, 
              I will let the guild know. So if you can and would help, please 
              come to lend a hand.</p>
            <p><br>

              Sont and Zlandicar are down and out for the count. Grats to Gana 
              and Myzt on their ST keys. Drokaten was adding up how many keys 
              CoG and BG have and it was about 22 for BG and 18 for CoG...least 
              I think I heard him say that. I think that basically means we're 
              going to be continuing to punk first brood...</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Anyway, good job folks...<br>

              Happy Valentine's Day to those in Cog and out. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>When last I posted, Cog and BG were making ready to encounter the 
              triplets in NToV. Well, I'm happy to report it wasn't much of a 
              fight as our happy little family with our fighting companions Blood 
              Guards, have achieved a personal first...clearing NToV. Grats to 
              all those who received items and thanks to all who contributed to 
              make this week a success. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>I've learned some things or realized again over the course of this 
              week. These being: pixie sticks and a lot of Mountain Dew make for 
              interesting conversations; when people talk smack it only makes 
              us as a guild succeed more, so they're more than welcome to continue 
              to propell us to greater successes; some of the best times in game 
              can be had while waiting for a rez; family doesn't have much to 
              do with being related by blood...and everything to do we being related 
              by friendship. <br>

              Feb 23, 2003 Another successful raid with Obsidian Coven. Cleared 
              fear in about 2 hours and proceded to kill Cazic-Thule himself.<br>
              Cazic-Thule: [Brain of Cazic Thule] Xern (OC), [Halo of the Enlightened] 
              Gish, [Bile Etched Obsidian Choker] Bronx (OC)
            <p>We then went over to Cazic-Thule and gave the Ring of Fear a try. 
              For those of you who haven't done this event, man it's fun. We learned 
              alot killed mobs like Avatar of Dread [Dread Coronet] Polyneices, 
              and the Avatar of Fright [Mantle of Paralyzing Fright] Teranick 
              (OC). The Avatar of Terror got the best of us however. But next 
              time it will definately be a different story...</p>
            <p>Feb 20, 2003 After some talk with Obsidian Coven, The forces of 
              CT and OC decided to do a joint raid to see how things would work 
              out. Man did it work out well.</p>
            <p>On our first attempt ever and first time to team up, we went to 
              Kael Drakkal. Vindi died easily, and the Statue spawned so we gave 
              it a go. What a chump he dropped fast. So we then went ahead and 
              killed the Idol and AoW spawned. With around 65 people there few 
              gave us a shot at taking out AoW but...</p>
            <p>Avatar of War has been slain by Maxist!</p>
            <p>Congrats to all of the winners. [Chestplate of Vindication] Denor, 
              [Sleepers Tomb Key] Gish, [Swiftblade of Zek] Dakatsu, AoW loots: 
              [Blade of Carnage] Valstorm, [Flayed Barbarian Hide Mask] Brewall,

              Hammer of Battle, Flayed Barbarian Hide Mask, and Helmet of Rallos 
              Zek.</p>
            <p>After that CT went over and killed Trakanon Again and got [Donal's 
              Chestplate of Mourning] Ceeni, [Singing Steel Breastplate] Brewall, 
              And 4 teeth.</p>
            <p>Feb 19, 2003 After a slight problem in Plane of Air going after 
              the Warrior epic part. Our forces ran over to West Temple of Veeshan 
              to kill some dragons.<br>

              EQMaps has just posted 4 of Brewall's maps and 2 revised maps. These 
              maps have been available within the guild for quite some time and 
              are just now being released to everyone. As Brewall rises in PoP, 
              more maps will be created. Among the maps are:<br>

              Veeshan's Peak falls to Crimson Talon! After two hard fought nights 
              and a few months of working on our strategy, Crimson Talon cleared 
              all of the dragons of Veeshan's Peak.</p>
            <p>Alot of hard work and effort has been put in by our members to 
              get keyed up. In all it took us two years or so to get our keys 
              done and we still have a few people still needing to finish their 
              quest. Some guilds have completed the Kunark expansion faster than 
              we have, but most haven't done VP at all! WTG Crimson Talon</p>
            <p>Nexona: Nightfall [Dreamthief], Sprinkler of Suffering x2 [Aorthin, 
              Bormer], Robe of Adversity [Fenik]<br>
              This completes our conquest of Veeshan's Peak and the Kunark expansion.</p>
            <p>Feb 11, 2003<br>
              Veeshan's Peak was under heavy attack this evening by the forces 
              of Crimson Talon. Many dragons and their ilk fell to our swords 
              and magics:<br>
              Hoshkar: Grey Suede Boots [Kuriosity], Sword of the Shissar [Dreamthief], 
              Shissar Protection Staff [Skylynn], Green Dragon Scales, Emmissary 
              of Thule<br>
              Phara Dar: Robe of Azure Sky[Zionmaster], Shield of Elders [Tico]<br>
              Xygoz: Left Eye of Xygoz [Silvercaster], Razor Fang of Xygoz / Frozen 
              Zweihander [Valstorm], Torpor, Sunstrike<br>
              Druushk: Veridix's Swortsword [Klaminar], Sarnak Summoners Staff

              Don't mess with trolls the day they get their home town run over 
              by frogs!!! - delkor (2/7/2003 5:25 PM) <br>

              Well might as well use my new cosmic l33t posting powers to make 
              an update.</p>
            <p>The start of the day was great... People like me were very angry 
              with the wonderful new patch that caused broken UI's, and all zone 
              repop at 4pm pst (WTF???). So not much was up except Solro so we 
              went and hung out there with the other 20 guilds. Then gay froglocks 
              invaded the Troll city so some went to try to save the city but 
              got beat down by wuss froglocks. </p>
            <p>Then we killed some mini's in Water and looked for more stuff to 
              kill. Well Vyzh'Dra the Cursed triggers were up around midnight 
              and we only had 25ish mains online still so we decided the big snake 
              was an easy/fast target.</p>
            <p>Well Tirani didn't learn that messing with Trolls the day they 
              get rellocated to a new city by pussy froglocks is a BAD idea.</p>
            <p>[Thu Feb 06 23:29:12 2003] Tirani tells the guild, 'i hate trolls 
              more then anything'<br>
              [Thu Feb 06 23:31:47 2003] Tirani tells the guild, 'i wish all trolls 
              got deleted'<br>
              [Thu Feb 06 23:46:29 2003] Tirani tells the raid, 'how about you 
              all shut the hell up'<br>
              [Thu Feb 06 23:46:38 2003] Omnislash tells the raid, 'tirani so 
              negative'<br>
              [Fri Feb 07 00:07:06 2003] Tirani tells the raid, 'hope i get charmed, 
              i loaded all AE's '<br>
              [Fri Feb 07 00:08:39 2003] Tirani tells the raid, 'purposely dropped 
              my resists so i get charmed <br>
              [Fri Feb 07 00:22:42 2003] Tirani was hit by non-melee for 123 points 
              of damage.<br>
              [Fri Feb 07 00:22:42 2003] Tirani crushes YOU for 2 points of damage.<br>

              [Fri Feb 07 00:22:50 2003] Tirani tells the raid, 'hahaha'<br>

              on?'<br>
              [Fri Feb 07 00:28:31 2003] Tirani tells the raid, 'i keep casting 
              shock of magic on somebody'<br>
              [Fri Feb 07 00:28:41 2003] Tirani tells the raid, 'lol'<br>

              Started off in sol ro and knocked out 2 mini's just to finish up

              started getting tired, we were down to a shaman twink for the nite 
              so decided hey lets hit water fun zone....why so many people hate 
              water is beyound me ;/ Knocked out even more mini's and nice loot 
              was gained by all. </p>
            <p>Still taking apps, post it, trucari explains everything he wants 
              on it(hes the app guy...not me, so stop bugging me ;p). Still flagging 
              friends of the guild (ever notice how your friends list gets MUCH 
              bigger when you're in the elementals???), and still flagging other

              Efter at have tracket og fundet ud af der ikke var meget oppe, besluttede 
              vi at tage Zelnithak.</p>
            <p>Zelnithak gik nemt og hurtigt og han droppede et ranged FT2 item 
              til Silverskin.</p>
            <p>Herefter tog vi til PoS da vi ikke havde styrke til at tage IV, 
              som ogs&aring; var oppe. Vi bankede 4 mini bosses i PoS, og kom 
              en hel del videre med flags til BoT.</p>
            <p>Vi sluttede aftenen med at lave Ragefire til Crystals, som vist 
              var det eneste hun manglede til sin epic. Dermed har vi nu en cleric 
              epic mere i NoN<br>

              It's certainly been a busy week around the Relentless camp. We spent 
              the time as best we could, farming up mini's and other mobs for 
              elemental armor and other random upgrades. </p>
            <p>Plane of Fire has been especially good to us recently, countless 
              rounds of mini's and another run down the Fennin ring. Plane of 
              Earth has also been the spot of a few gatherings...too bad the place 
              doesn't work properly. A few visits to Plane of Water has left numerous 
              minis swimming with the fishes, and us rejoicing in thier loot.</p>
            <p>Our week hasn't soley consisted of Planar mobs, however. Also on 
              the dead list include Emperor and random VT mobs who were worth 
              more dead than alive. </p>
            <p>While it was fun for the time that we had it, the elementals are 
              now truly opened up on CT. Call me crazy, but it just seems more 
              natural to have everyone crowding around and bumping into each other 
              randomly. Congrats to SS/DA on Rallos Zek and welcome to the Elementals.

              After clearing out PoFire mini's yet again, I noticed that we had 
              some celebrities in our midst. Low and behold, Thundre is really 
              the most powerful man alive. The force behind the greatest dynasty 
              ever. The one known as....Ditka.</p>

              Dead, dead, dead, DEAD.</p>
            <p>Bubba Zek takes the big dirt nap and Shadowed Soul &amp; The Divine 
              Alliance are mo-ovin on UP To the east side!</p>
            <p>As soon as we started tryin this encounter we knew we would need 
              to be on our game to pass him, it's an encounter with challenges 
              from stem to stern. We lined him up and learned all we needed to 
              drop him, and then we did it. No excuses, no assistance, no surrender. 
              Not to toot our own horn....wait, actually yes....to toot our own 
              horn....it felt damn nice to take 60-65 folks through that encounter 
              and get RZTW to spawn....hearing that some folks out there bring 
              as many as 200 to this fight. We did damn fine with what are now 
              considered 'small' numbers (and that is a sad commentary on things).</p>
            <p>Each time we lined him up, we got a little farther and learned 
              a little more....culminating in our two tries today, which got him 
              to 0% health but not dead on the first run, and finally dead on 
              the second, usin 80 folks....which is a bit of a zerg for us, but 
              now that we're past the hump on him, I don't think you'll see us 
              needin that many again to make 'ol Bubba visit Freeport.</p>
            <p>So now we move on to the elemental planes, sure in the knowledge 
              that there isn't a thing in this game we can't beat the same way 
              we always have...<br>

              Zen-like moments are what it's all about!<br>
              Boy did we ever have one this evening.</p>
            <p>Seems we paid 'ol Seru a visit.<br>
              Usually we'd pack heavier for him but oh well.<br>
              Clean and fast kill with 27, what a rush!<br>
              Kills like this are too damn sweet.</p>
            <p>I can't wait to see what's next.<br>
