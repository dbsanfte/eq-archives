            <p><b class="heading">Cats in Hats Guild of Drinal Server</b><br>
             <br>
              <span class="byline">By <a href="mailto:stryker@planeteq.com">Stryker</a> 
              </span></p>
            <p><i>As part of our series on the EQ server community, I interviewed 
              the leaders of one of the Drinal server's most successful guilds,</i><b> 
              Cats in Hats</b><i>. This guild has accomplished many server firsts, 
              including killing Emp. Ssra, Lord Inquisitor Seru, and the waking 
              Kerafrym, or the Sleeper.</i></p>
            <p><i>Cats in Hats is organized to have co-leaders, rather than a 
              single guild leader. I spoke with two of the three co-leaders of 
              CiH. The conversation also included Saden, a member of CiH who joined 
              during the first week of its creation on Mithaniel Marr, where the 
              guild originated. </i></p>
            <p><b>Stryker: When was the guild founded, and why?</b></p>
            <p>Saden: Well we all had the goal of meeting people, accomplishing 
              goals, and having fun. We formed in Mid-July of 2000 on the Mith 
              Marr server.</p>
            <p><b>Stryker: Approximately how many members does CiH have?</b><br>
              <br>
              Lern: We moved to Drinal to get away from Afterlife [An &quot;uber&quot; 
              guild on the Mithaniel Marr server, which is still active today.], 
              to be able to grow as a raiding guild. We currently have probably 
              100 on the roster, with about 70 active members.<br>
              Trevize: We have more total members, but they float from really 
              active to non-existent for a time.<br>
              Lern: We' re in the process of trying to shrink (not recruiting 
              as people leave).<br>
              Trevize: /nod&#133;recruiting is completely shut down now.<br>
              Lern: PoP kinda hurt us, cause we have more then 60 people on currently 
              so some people can't join the raid [window].</p>
            <p><b>Stryker: Why do you run the guild with three co-leaders, as 
              opposed to one main leader?<br>
              </b><b><br>
              </b>Trevize: 'cause 1 leader would go insane =P<br>
              Lern: One thing this guild has never had was one solid leader. We've 
              always used a team effort to run it.<br>
              Trevize: And we feel a committee for important decisions works better. 
              Brings better balance and keeps the guild's best interest at prime 
              focus.<br>
              Lern: The nice thing by doing it this way is we've had multiple 
              officer turnovers. When an officer leaves, the guild doesn't fall 
              apart, we just elect a new officer.<br>
              Lern: The guild mostly runs itself, we are just here to point it 
              in the right direction for raids, and to settle disputes.</p>
            <p><b>Stryker: What was the first &quot;uber&quot; mob CiH killed?<br>
              <br>
              </b>Saden: Trakanon was a huge goal for us, and we accomplished 
              that quickly.<br>
            </p>
            <p><b>Stryker: Who was first in your guild to reach 65?</b><br>
              <br>
              Lern: Darkpyro was the first on the server, and our guild.</p>
            <p><b>Stryker: Why did you join CiH, on Mith Marr?<br>
              <br>
              </b>Saden: Friends and what everyone else wanted; to see things, 
              to do things, and beat things, be the best, and at the same time 
              have fun.</p>
            <p><b>Stryker: Saden, what is it like to be a member of CiH?</b><br>
              <br>
              Saden: [I have] always have been proud of Cats in Hats. We all have 
              a great time, we work hard at having fun and it makes us proud to 
              accomplish what we do.</p>
            <p><b>Stryker: What would you want someone reading this article to 
              know about CiH?</b><br>
              <br>
              Lern: We are a very casual &quot;uber&quot; guild. We don't run 
              it like a military organization. We have many part time players, 
              and people take breaks as needed.<br>
              Trevize: That we're normal working people that go to work, school 
              or whatever. Nothing really &quot;different&quot; about being a 
              high end guild except that you are a group of people that decided 
              to kill the bosses. Only difference is the zone we play in.</p>
            <p><b>Cats in Hats, like many successful and powerful guilds, has 
              a policy of mandatory raid attendance as part of the requirements 
              of guild membership. The guild raids almost every night. I asked 
              Saden, &quot;What do you think about the way CiH encourages going 
              to all raids called, even if you don't want to go?&quot;<br>
              <br>
              </b>Saden: People should go to raids when they are called merely 
              for the fact we are a raiding guild and people join to do that.</p>
            <p><b>Stryker: Why did you decide to wake The Sleeper, and what were 
              fellow guild responses?<br>
              <br>
              </b>Trevize: It was an accomplishment in EQ, the ONE AND ONLY thing 
              a guild can do that actually changes EQ. So doing the script and 
              being able to see it was special for me and I was happy to be a 
              part of it.<br>
              Lern: To me, being able to permanently change the server is a huge 
              deal. We even had members come out of retirement just to help wake 
              him.<br>
              Trevize: As for other guild's responses, many on Drinal hated us 
              for it and flamed us. Many others cheered us on.
            <p> <b>Stryker: Before the cleric epic quest was changed by SoE, the 
              Drinal server had a Ragefire list, where clerics would get in line 
              to take down Ragefire to complete their epics. CiH came in and took 
              Ragefire before a cleric camping it could rally the troops. Why 
              did you do this?<br>
              <br>
              </b>Trevize: Hehe, re: Drinal flame boards. Seriously though, this 
              was the act of a few guild members and even a few non-guild members 
              as well. It wasn't something the officers said 'go kill RF'.<br>
              Lern: From day one of being on Drinal, CiH has made it clear we 
              do not believe in waiting lists. The Ragefire list was started and 
              we made it very clear at that time we would not be following it. 
              It was only due to the fact that it took months before one of our 
              members actually found Ragefire up for us to kill him.<br>
              Trevize: ...but on that note, lists suck. If you want to kill a 
              mob get a force there to kill it first. Sitting around in a zone 
              for hours spamming &quot;this mob is mine&quot; really doesn't mean 
              any thing to me. The mob is yours if #1 you have a force to kill 
              it and #2 are actively killing the mob.</p>
            <p><b>Stryker: With the recent &quot;renovation&quot; of the guild 
              Avatar, a now 60+ guild, do you feel you have competition?</b></p>
            <p>Lern: Avatar was a guild of maybe 10 people when Drinal first opened. 
              [And now that they have grown] they [still] aren't any competition 
              anytime in the foreseeable future for us. Just being 60+ isn't enough, 
              you then need AA skills to beat a lot of the mobs in the game now.</p>
            <p><b>Stryker: What are your personal goals for the guild, now that 
              you have accomplished waking the sleeper, killing Seru, and Emp. 
              Ssra?</b></p>
            <p>Trevize: Simple in my mind... conquer PoP.<br>
              Lern: Same, the ultimate goal is to get into the plane of time. 
              That's probably 6 months away.</p>
            <p><b>Stryker: Has CiH killed any PoP gods yet, and are you planning 
              a raid on one of them shortly?</b></p>
            <p>Lern: We've been focusing mostly on letting our members level and 
              work on AA points, while getting their flags for next tier zones.<br>
              Trevize: /nod, this week has been get lvl 65 and get AA. Next week 
              starts full time raiding again.</p>
            <p><b>Stryker: What does CiH think about the new &quot;graveyard&quot; 
              effect in PoP? Good/bad?</b></p>
            <p>Lern: I love the graveyard, it lets groups try challenging things 
              without fear of having to find a necro to CR. One thing they could 
              do to improve graveyards is allow people to /corpse themselves once 
              they've run back. Having to sit there waiting for your corpse kinda 
              sucks.<br>
              Trevize: I dunno. Some things I like about the GY like Lern said. 
              What I don't like is how lazy some of the players have become, for 
              example, 'Oh I died. AFK for 20 min while corpse goes to GY'. =/ 
              No longer is there the challenge of CR.</p>
            <p><b>Stryker: Has CiH discovered any drawbacks to PoP, specifically 
              the functionality?</b></p>
            <p>Lern: One serious issue we see with pop is the fact that once we've 
              beaten the tier one planes, if a member returns to the game or we 
              recruit somebody we will have to go back and redo all the &quot;easy&quot; 
              mobs we already conquered, so that they get flagged and can join 
              us on the real raids. So right now, we are taking our time to make 
              sure we get as many members flagged now before we move on.<br>
              Trevize: /nod, having to re-do a tier 1 plane for just 1 person 
              isn't something I'm thrilled with in the design.</p>
            <p><b>Stryker: And now for a player submitted question: &quot;Would 
              CiH consider having a 'sponsor a player day', in which CiH would 
              rally around one player in Everquest, 50+ but -60, to either get 
              them an epic piece, a nice piece of equipment, or just some experience?&quot;</b></p>
            <p>Trevize: Hehe, I get asked this a lot. General answer is no. We 
              have guild members who need stuff and guildmembers are going to 
              get help in stuff long before we get time to help everybody on Drinal 
              out. However, this doesn't mean that members of CiH aren't helping 
              people out. Personally in the last 3 months I've helped non-guildmembers 
              with 4 epics.<br>
              Saden: I'd like to step in here, yes some of us had helped random 
              people on epic pieces, etc., even CoHed friends on different guilds 
              for items we may have not needed just to be nice. Just because we 
              don't need [an item] we won't always destroy.<br>
              Lern: Yeah, its really up to the individual guild members. If I 
              am not busy and get asked to help somebody I do my best to help 
              him or her. As a guild though, we just don't have the time to take 
              away from xping/raiding to help others.</p>
