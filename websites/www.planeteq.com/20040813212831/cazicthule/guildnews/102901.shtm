            month old.

              our uber AKP database. Oh yes we also killed Lord Bob. </p>
            <p>Wednesday went even better. First solo WToV attempt without any 
              CRs. That was prolly becouse i coudnt attend but i did get present 
              when i logged on next day. My very first own &quot;just-mine&quot; 
              Warlord boots. </p>

              of dead Dragons and lots and lots items for Us and our allies Project 
              E O N. GG Verant on repoping all the stuff for us. </p>

              Thanks to the GM events for Halloween, we were able to get a shot 
              at Zlandicar in the wee hours of Sunday morning, along with The 
              Relentless. I stole Murf's screenshot because I liked it better 
              than mine...hey, I'm a rogue, did you expect any less of me??
            Of course, 2 minutes later Murf was dead in Kael, so either the 
              dot killed him because our whole group was wasted, or the big mean 
              dead dragon fell on top of him and crushed him like a marshmallow!</p>

              obtained another Sleeper's Key for the guild. </p>

              Faydedar was completely owned by Crimson Talon this evening. Took 
              a while for everyone to make their way to Timorous Deep, but was 
              good to see everyone in the guild working together. After a complete 
              buffing, we proceeded to own Faydedar. Zero deaths and excellent 
              job by everyone for smart playing and controlling agro. Grats to

              We took down Sir Lucan last night for the first time for Aarek. 
              I would like to thank everyone there who helped out. We had a big 
              hand from Khandihcir of Inner Light, Forevercrystal, Cassop..(.not 
              sure) and of course Kalek. I understand that some of us took faction 
              hits and I would like to extend a big thank you as this sacrefice 
              is very important to the pally class. Sir Lucan went down like a

              Hehe yeah that's right Immortal Spirits took down VS again for the 
              3rd time this week. We had to wait an few to send VS to Freeport 
              due to the fact that some losers had him pulled to zone before we 
              entered KC, and we needed to wait for an GM to reset him. All that 
              said we did make VS pay again for being so nasty an Iksar and in 
              return he granted us to favor of adding some SS legs to the guildbank 
              (yeah we have no bards yet =/ ). So all in all Gratz to the guildbank 
              for some nice SS legs and Gratz to Valetta to have come one step 
              closer to completing her Epic.

              got drops!

              Tuesday night we ventured into the Hole for a couple epics, but 
              first we decided to kill the Scalekeeper in Yael's lair (Yael himself 
              wasn't around unfortunately). We killed him on the second try, and 
              got a Red Dragon Scale for the guild bank. As a side note, after 
              the first wipeout, more people wanted to come, and lacking CoH, 
              Effix had em take the shortcut.. diving into the hole for a rez. 
              Sowyou almost managed to survive, until big ogre Bonecrusha landed 
              on her, instantly killing her. 
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Afterwards we headed back up to the undead tower, killed High Scale 
              Kirn for Illessa, and the Ghost of Kindle for Prespone. Grats all 
              on a job well done, for our first uber-lifetapper kill, and congrats

              With all the GM events and re-pops of mobs this week-end the Saturday 
              ended with 3 guilds rushing for a 2nd Lodizal spawn last nite. The 
              mighty E O N duo of Balak and Radiation added their part and ended 
              up getting the kill. Great work we have to say. Gratz to Radiation 
              on getting his Map piece, and 1 more Lodizal shell piece dropped. 
              A belt also dropped, but it was looted by someone while Radiation 
              was kinda...dead. <br>

              Sunday 28 October, 2001 <br>
              After a long and tiresome day all around Norrath we ended up having 
              a great dinner in Iceclad. Main course was delicous turtle soup 
              and as dessert we got 2 rings, 1 Lodizal shell and Leita got a Map 
              piece. <br>
              <br>
              Sunday 28 October, 2001 <br>
              It has been a long day together with Anavon and alone as well. First 
              we sent Talendor to Freeport and continued doing Gorenaire for the 
              3rd time in 4 days. Next stop was Woushi to make it easier for all 
              to zone into WL. 
            <p>After saying goodbye to Anavon we all went to Fear and did all 
              golems and dracolich. Too many good drops to mention. Gratz to Muuven 
              and Teatralic on getting robes in Fear, and gratz to Devor from 
              Anavon on getting the last piece for his warrior Epic. <br>
              <br>
              Saturday 27 October, 2001 <br>
              Server GM decided to re-pop the dragons all over Norrath so we teamed 
              up with Anavon for some Saturday fun. First one to fall was Talendor 
              in Skyfire. Then the forces moved along to Dreadland and invited 
              Gorenaire to dinner. With the 2nd dragon down Woushi was the 3rd 
              to fall. </p>
            <p>As recommended dessert E O N then decided it was time to let Pender 
              get his druid Epic done after waiting for a month, so Faydadar also 
              ended up in Freeport. All in all a nice Saturday, and the 2nd Gorenaire 
              kill in 2 days. Gratz to Anavon on red and white scale today. <br>
              <br>
              Saturday 27 October, 2001 <br>
              We started today off clearing Fear and got Astaroth his Wraith of 
              a Shissir. Astatwink only needs a few more pieces to complete his 
              epic. Then Severilious spawned so we went over to EJ and paid him 
              a little visit. It was a nice kill, only one death and we didn't 
              get him stuck in a tree, which is good. Scale dropped which went 
              to Anavon(Grats Devor!) while we received the rest: 2 bags and 5 
              spells: Banishment, 2x Entrapping Roots, Emissary of Thule, and 
              Vengeance of Al'Kabor. </p>
            <p>Back to Fear we went and killed the enraged golem for Rexus. After 
              that we went to Kedge to kill Phinigel in hopes that he would drop 
              a wizard staff so he could complete his epic, but, unfortunately 
              he did not <br>
              He did however bless Darkonas with his epic staff. Grats! To finish 
              the evening off we went to WW to kill some dragons. Nice spells, 
              phat lewtz, and some mean grav flux'ing dragons which sent me to 
              the moon. <br>
              <br>
              Thursday 25 October, 2001 <br>
              Hat Trick! Gorenaire fell to the combined forces of Anavon and E 
              O N. With good tactics and a twist of luck we won. First attempt 
              = first kill. White dragon scale went to Eon with Avanon getting 
              the rest: Shield of the White Dragon, Dragon Hero Bracer, Warhammer 
              of Divine Grace, Heirophant's Crook, and 3 spells(Winds of Gelid, 
              Entrapping Roots, and Devouring Darkness). </p>
            <p>After that scouts were dispatched to Skyfire to check on Talendor. 
              He was up and proved no match and died to us in-house. Flawless 
              victory, well done. Drops were very good: Runed Bolster Belt, Gauntlets 
              of Fiery Might, Tobrin's Mystical Eyepatch, a red dragon scale, 
              as well as spells: Legacy of Thorn, Emissary of Thule, Disintegrate, 
              and Talisman of the Raptor (Xeryus). </p>
            <p>Then we went over to Wakening Lands where Woushi was bothering 
              Anavon so he needed to die. We quickly dispatched 4 groups to their 
              aid and Wuoshi fell with ease. It was a nice revenge on the whooping 
              he gave us on our initial attempt 2 months ago. Our first Woushi 
              kill with more to come in the future. Both Eon and Anavon received 
              a Scimitar of the Emerald Dawn and a scale for an Emerald Dragonscale 
              BP. Anavon also got a Tanglewood Shield. Congratulations to all! 
              Furthermore, the guild's first bard epic will happen soon. Good 
              luck Kemuvirion! <br>
              <br>
              Thursday 25 October, 2001 <br>
              We went on our planned Juggs raid, and on the way we got Cobalt 
              helm and Cobalt Bracer. Then we saw Trak was up and not being killed 
              in 24 hours we made an attempt..or kinda killed Trak. Drops: Cleric 
              BP, Druid BP and 2 teeth. Gratz to Leita and Evade on teeth. We 
              also got some nice spells today. </p>
            <p>Later that night as we were romping around Dragon Necropolis exploring 
              and looking for stuff to kill we teamed up with Cohort Chalybeius 
              to take on Zlandicar. It was an incredibly fun fight and we were 
              awarded a Massive Dragonclaw Shard.

              October 26: Thursday was a normal day for us.. Four dragons dead 
              in TOV. First was Lady Nevederia.. probably the longest fight with 
              her in the history of our alliance.. about ten different times we 
              thought we lost but somehow ended up winning. Don't know how we 
              won but she died! Loot was a Medal of Deep Thought to Summine, a 
              horn to Brackon of EOD, and Nevederia's Left Eye to Skuz. 
            <p>Second was Zlexak.. now we all HATE Zlexak, and if you've ever 
              fought him you know why.. probably the most hated dragon in the 
              world of EverQuest, Zlexak went down on the first try.. But like 
              the Lady Nev fight.. we thought we had lost a bunch of different 
              times and ended up winning anyway.. Oh well I guess we're just dumb. 
              Loot was a new Rapier of ownage (don't remember name) to Captain 
              Oatmeal.. errr Teufle.. and a belt to EOD.</p>
            <p>Then we came to two of the easiest dragons around. Cekenar and 
              Sevalak.. No, we never thought we'd lose to these ones.. but of 
              course the only death I had all night came to Sevalak the Paladin 
              dragon :~(</p>
            <p>Sevalak dropped an SK shield.. who cares who got it, and Cekenar 
              dropped another rogue weapon (Grats Gaef of EOD) and a Meneajejaejnejntaelin, 
              Bane of Giants sword.. uhh grats ME!!!!!!! All rotting phatlewt 
              must go to Zith plz thx.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>October 25: Having logged for the night in Lord Feshlak's lair 
              we continued upon our northernly expedition into the Temple of Veeshan 
              today. First on the list was Lord Kriezzen, who was dispatched quite 
              easily, and gave out some wonderful crap. I do believe however, 
              that his crap had been upgraded with this past patch and we now 
              have a happy rogue in the possession of one of his pokers (I cant 
              remember who it was, sorry). After this we decided that the path 
              of least resistance would be by way of Lord Koi Koi and his mistress 
              Mirenilla. We tried to push Crover off the cliff as we went by Vyemm, 
              but he knocked into Venid's feet and sent him over the edge instead. 
              Oh well, we didnt need Divine Strength anyway right? ...back to 
              the loot I guess. 
            <p>The Lord Feesh himself dropped a Bracer of the Deep Sea that went 
              to the Zippster (purple and aqua go well together right? right...no 
              wait wrong... ) Mirenilla spit out some Mithril b00bs that went 
              to the Fro himself, grats d0rf. </p>
            <p>Following a delightful romp around, while people trained various 
              drakes on each other, someone decided to go for Vyemm. Well, simply 
              put, he ate us, and then it was PJ time. You will however be pleased 
              to know he ate Zippo first....who was using a two hander and wasnt 
              even on the tank list. The Pally Dragon was jealous . </p>
            <p>The rest of ToV awaits tomorrow, maybe we'll get our act together 
              and clear it all, if only we can keep afk asslings away. Good night.
            <p>October 23: There was a patch last night that changed a few critical 
              things for us:<br>
              -Smakbuk's pants are now turquoise instead of Silver. I think they're 
              sexy, but he doesn't care for them much. 
            <p>-Teufle's dagger got upgraded. This is a major plus since now we 
              don't have to listen to him bitch nonstop about how weak it is and 
              how badly monks outdamage him now.</p>
            <p>-My Mrylokar dagger got nerfed, looks wise. WTF is this thing supposed 
              to be.. a letter opener? F this patch, seriously.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>We started our day by waltzing into ToV and waxing Eashen and Ikitiar. 
              Both were dispatched in normal BFA fashion and to the victors went 
              a Mask of Venom (Grats Ephron), and a Cloak of Sky (Grats Valde). 
              Next up was our good friend Aaryonar!</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>He was owned hardcore yet again by the combined might of Relentless 
              and EoD, and it seems like every time he gets easier. He dropped 
              a Circlet of Summer that went to Thrynne and an Amulet of the Dreadgazer 
              who went to EoD_member01. Not the best loot ever but definitley 
              not the worst we've gotten from him. </p>
            <p>Feshlak was pulled next, and as usual Soel fubared the pull, citing 
              &quot;AE feign break&quot; as his excuse for bringing the dragon 
              AND his two guards yet again. Luck was not on our side and the guards 
              tore apart too many casters, rendering the attempt a failure. We 
              came back strong the second round, though, dropping Feshlak in a 
              matter of minutes. In fact, I think there were only two casualties, 
              none other than myself and Zippo, my noble partner in death.<br>
              <br>
              Luckily, we've got two brand new bp's to show for our work.<br>
              <br>
              Grats Crestfallen on your new BP. CoP plz.</p>
            <p>The hour was late but we decided to push on and kill one more dragon 
              as we worked our way towards sleepytime. We wasted dagarn faster 
              than I've ever see him die before. 41 people, 3 rogues, and the 
              gimp died in literally 3-4 minutes of fighting. Grats to Thornsong 
              on your Wurm Claw pauldrons.</p>
            <p>Tomorrow we move onward, only 8 dragons left to kill!</p>
            <p>Finally, we'd like to extend a warm welcome to the newest member 
              of our enchanter doom squad, Teleri! Now two members strong, the 
              EDS continues to bring haste and clarity to the melees and casters 
              of the BFA. Welcome!</p>

              Just as I'm becoming more embittered to the lack of game design 
              AI, I'm reminded that Verant does have some events worthly of praise. 
              And on top of that they're having a GM event weekend, which I might 
              add, they should be doing ALOT more often. 
            <p>What has got me back onto the Verant bandwagon? The Dain's War 
              of course! Everything about this event just plain kicks ass (yes 
              I know we've done it a bunch all ready but this is the first time 
              I'm getting to post these news about it). First off all, throw all 
              the old rules about main tanking and pulling and all that crap out 
              the door. This is WAR!</p>
            <p>I find it humorous that just about all the aspects of a battle 
              are represented - scavengers picking off the corpses, the clash 
              of battle, calls to arms around the battlefield, mercanaries calling 
              to your banners to join in the war, etc. Combined with the fact 
              that they're able to randomize the attacks from the giants which 
              keeps the spoilers at bay and two makes the event more than just 
              an uber farming event. There are also subgoals to the event which 
              give more than just an all or nothing end result. Verant hopefully 
              is taking many lessons learned from the Ring War and putting them 
              into SoL. We'll just have to wait and see.Congrats to Valkemier 
              on his new Dain Frostweaver IV Ring!!!</p>
            <p>In other news, we absolutely annhilated Ol' Hairy Hands himself. 
              Even under the best circumstances we've always had to rez in more 
              than a few tanks more than once and wizards often joked about the 
              number of bind deaths they would take. Not this time, we rezzed 
              in all of four tanks and one wizard took one death. Not too shabby. 
              The end result was a Fearsome Cloak for Zam and a Halo for Saelvian. 
            </p>
            <p></p>
            Exciting as always, we layth great blustery beats the noggins of our 
            foes. Translation? Tormax, Staue, Vindi, Doze, Warders and a cast 
            of thousands dead. Total dead between all those mobs? Hmm.. six sounds 
            about right. Ok, so Lendi gated on us and munched a bakers dozen but 
            whatya going to do when your enchanters go linkdead?
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>My question is where's the variety? Mob AI is woefully inadequate. 
              We're adventures, fearless mercanaries stalking the evils of an 
              unjust world. Or maybe we're just trying to look cool to get laid. 
              What we aren't are uber farmers mowing down the phat lewt crops. 
              When are we going to see Vindicator pick up a gnome and toss him 
              over the side of the Arena? When will Dozekar call forth a band 
              of gay bixies to hump the living daylights out of our paladins? 
              When will Sontalak shout &quot;Engage!&quot; as we're setting up 
              to kill him and instead kill us? When will shaman get hound pets, 
              no bee pets, no hound pets that shoot bees out of their mouths!?!!?</p>
