              SEP 04, 2002<br>
              Unbelievable day. With the changes to Ragefire spawn, we decided 
              as a guild to concentrate our efforts and finish off some of our 
              cleric epics. Over 45 members formed an army and laid waste to hundreds 
              of wurms, drakes, and other dragon-ilk. Our clerics collected the 
              the precious shards as we worked out spawn arrangement order with 
              other guilds in the zone. The effort was well worth it:<br>
              Grats to Skylynn for obtaining the cleric epic!<br>
              Grats to Awll for obtaining the cleric epic!
            <p>Amongst the loots were a Treasure Hunter's Satchel [Altus], Red 
              Dragon Scale [Tresten], and several other items.</p>
            <p>SEP 03, 2002<br>
              Grats to Riverwake for reaching 60!</p>
            <p>SEP 02, 2002<br>
              Grats to Sylvanna for finishing our first Shadow Knight epic!</p>
            <p>SEP 01, 2002<br>
              Grats to Gilthanus for reaching 60!<br>
              Grats to Kandrahcir for finishing his epic!</p>
            <p>AUG 29, 2002<br>
              The Dain needed help with an accessory and Kestel decided to help. 
              Excellent turn-out once again by the Crimson Talon forces to help 
              Kestel beat back the horde of giants and protect a clueless dwarf. 
              Grats to Kestel for completing the Eigth Shawl. Grats to Kestel!</p>

              a grandmaster brewer - 250 (the other inspiration was brewing 4

              of Norrath</b></a><br>
              It's Official: We Suck <br>
              09.04.02 <br>
            </p>
            <p> Earlier today, in a press release by Verant Interactive, the game 
              developers' stance on &quot;guilds whose only common link is the 
              desire to be drunk and lazy&quot; was finally revealed.</p>
            <p>&quot;Seriously? Screw those people. In-game drinking, alcohol, 
              and debauchery are all things we wish we could 'un-include' from 
              this game. I'm told there's even a guild on our Cazic-Thule Server 
              that does these things almost to the exclusion of ALL other things. 
              To them we officially say, 'Get a damn grip. How many of you people 
              even have your epics? Why even play the game? You freaking suck.'&quot;</p>
            <p>Twyl, the leader of the Drunkards of Norrath, could not be reached 
              for comment, probably because he was praying the technicolor psalm 
              to the porcelain god, or scrubbing Emotion Lotion off of his fat, 
              sweaty body. <br>

            <p> Bullies - Stormhaven (9/5/2002 5:44 AM) <br>
            </p>
            <p>So here it was patch day and the normal race began. We knew we 
              had to get going quickly cause if we didn't all the good eats would 
              be gone, and we'd be left with nothing but creamed spinach and bean 
              sprouts. No one wants that to happen.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>There we were standing in line for our meal when this ass, the 
              Avatar of War, does the whole &quot;I'm bigger than you&quot; routine.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>We had to make sure he understood that we don't take kindly to 
              that kind of guff around here. We smacked him around until we shoved 
              him two-thirds of the way through the brick wall. We figure he won't 
              be bothering us again anytime soon. Despite his rep, he was a wuss. 
              In the past, he had been known to put several players into traction 
              - well we don't know where he got that rep from, cause he went down 
              without a single casualty. Even Booboo, the lame druid bear pet, 
              survived.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Well, he was soundly beaten, and we did what every normal 60+ raiding 
              party does when someone like the Avatar of War tries to take your 
              lunch...</p>
            <p>We stole his stuff.<p>
              Recruiting level 60+ folks!<br>

              Today we killed Grieg, Yelinak, Velk, Guardian Kozz, and Harla Dar.</p>
            <p>Needless to say, none of that matters for squat cause there's a

              -DN, ToV, WW- <br>
              After spending much time in Kael getting our dragon faction up, 
              we decided to see if we could ruin it. Took a small group into DN 
              goofing around and wound up wiping out. Was pretty fun though, just 
              don't let unstunnable rats gate. So after that we decided to head 
              into the Halls of Testing and see what we could do there. Learned 
              that you can't fight a mob while the only cleric there is back at 
              the zone in rezzing someone. But hey, at least the death toll is 
              rising, that's all I care about anyway. </p>
            <p>So after the fun of those two, we decided we'd hang out in West 
              Wastes and kill us some dragons. At the most we only had 10 people 
              on for these and spent several days in the zone. Got us quite a 
              few dead dragons, but not enough loot. We'll be heading back again 
              before too long. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>We have several new recruits, so we look forward to getting to 
              know them. As always if you're interested in applying to Juggernauts 
              contact me or Sithray in game, or look us up on the messageboard. 
              Next week is more Kael, experience, and epic work, hurray! </p>
            <p>Death Fest update! Some missing but who really cares? Not me. Although 
              I have to catch up! I have to win...or lose as it may be. </p>
            <p>As of 8/29/02[West Wastes]: <br>
              Sithray(Warrior) - 8 Deaths - I Disagree! <br>
              Ouden(Ranger) - 7 Deaths <br>

              This week we told Anavon we would leave Vex T alone to have some 
              time in the zone without interference since they did the same for 
              us. 
            <p>Spent the time finishing up a couple keys of newer members and 
              taking a trip down memory lane.</p>
            <p>We killed quite a few luclinite droppers in Luclin but also managed

              Day 164 &amp; 165</p>
            <p>The best way to spend patch day is dieing in hate only to lose 
              out on the Magi because once you step into the Plane of Hate your 
              mind is transformed back to the days when you were level 46 and 
              Plane of Hate was difficult. Anyway, that was a waste of time, 2 
              days in a row from what I hear since Tuesday was spent rotting there 
              too. Anyway, so h8 hate.</p>
            <p>Then its Avatar of War time, and we beat the big pumpkin down to 
              mushy pie filling without a single fatality on our side, just took 
              4 hours to get to kill him heh! Anyway, the following is the only 
              real strategy you need to kill the Avatar of War .. notice how the 
              giants are lured away ..</p>

              <br>
              Day 160 to 163 - This is not a test<br>
              Friday marked the first time we saw the mighty Emperor of Ssra in 
              action, of course our partners in crime EoD has been up in the big 
              room before, but this marked the first time the combined forces 
              took on the big fella. Without going into the details too greatly, 
              the secret plan did involve cheese sandwiches and druid pets, anymore 
              said then that would be giving the entire strategy away. Anyway, 
              87 Percent not too shabby and of course room for improvement, but 
              well with 76 people I personally thought we did great.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Then guess what? Come on, guess how we spent the next 3 days? I'll 
              eat a cookie if you can guess .. .. .. Thats right! We spent the 
              next 3 days in Ssra farming more key pieces and getting alot of 
              much needed ore for all the melee's. Come next attempt, predict 
              a big fat blood mark on the top of the temple that is Ssra.<p>

              Day 159 - Cobra Commander</p>
            <p>Spent countless hours last night on the 2nd floor, love everyone 
              that show'd up only to witness what I'm sure was the longest Commanderless 
              period of time ever! (or at least for us). I think we did get 2 
              more keys done last night with 1 2nd floor ring dropping, but we 
              kept the faith and will till we're done and everyone can enjoy the 
              sweet nector of the Shissar Ring.</p>
            <p>Why all the time spent in Ssra, well 1 for the key (which is the 
              sweet ring of course) but to take down this person, who is about 
              to have 100 more angry people that want to let out their frustrations 
              on this Time Sink run wild on him. I'm sure the Emp begs Verant 
              every day to say &quot;Lesson this Time Sink, OMG Please! They hate 
              this zone so much they won't even give me a quick painless death 
              .. they want me to suffer! :(&quot; .. Needless to say, suffer he 
              will.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>The combined forces of Element of Darkness and Schism will soon 
              see the big snake fall, and as with the rest of the content we've 
              knocked out during the past 2 months, if he doesn't fall the first 
              time, he'll not survive the 2nd and those that follow. Smart playing 
              will prevail, indeed.</p>

            <p>Killed Vyzh'dra the Cursed today with EoD, after killing the left 
              over Euro'ized Glyphed and Exiled placeholder triggers. Anyway, 
              as always the fight was a nice one, not to many glitches, so big 
              congrats to the rest of the team that came out and beat down Vyzh, 
              another great alliance effort or at least I thought so.</p>

              Mousketeer Roll Call, Sound Off!</p>
            <p><br>
              Guess what day it is?</p>
            <p>C'mon, yer thinkin it!</p>
            <p>It's Almost Anything Can Happen day again, mousketeers! What did 
              AACH bring for us today? All kinds of nice goodies, like the stacking 
              that doesn't, the epic that isn't, and the clerical hit squad that 
              rivals any scene from Resevoir Dogs. At least this patch loaded 
              in less than 10 hours, so it had that goin for it. So, with the 
              mystical voodo that is an EQ patch coursing through the realm, we 
              decided to get to work.</p>
            <p>First, Apoc explained in detail why he never tips. Kreate then 
              expounded on some strange Madonna theory. Lilcure decided he needed 
              to share a story about policemen in a urinal (that boy scares me 
              sometimes). So, as you can tell, it was pretty much a normal day 
              at the office. We made the rounds, whacked AL and Cursed (major 
              thanks to the folks pooching the spawn, who gave us time to grab 
              AL) and called and called it a night, logging to our 9 million twinks 
              to scour over skyfire so we can put epics on every cleric we can 
              find.</p>
            <p>Oh, here's a pic of what happens when you tell Thund to take a 
              group to camp shards in Seru:<p>
              Check back later when we will sing the the ranger blues otherwise 
              known as the &quot;F! Brells Still Overwrites! (in b flat)&quot;.<br>
