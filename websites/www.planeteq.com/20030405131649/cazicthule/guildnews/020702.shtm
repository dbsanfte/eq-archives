            </p>

              Well, we went to Chardok to visit the Royals again and said hello. 
              The Prince was kind enough to give us his head yet again(gratz to 
              Phalron). After the Prince had served us we moved on to his daddy 
              the King and took a note from him that went to KoL. </p>

            <p>Thanks again to Sahpra and her Knights of Loyalty for their joint 
              effort with us. They were there for the same thing we were so we 
              decided to team up and help each other out and it worked out well.

              we expected, but it was the DOING of it that was fun ehe..so woho 
              the bastige is dead <br>

            <p>FEB 04, 2002<br>
              Got necro epic drop this evening and moved a couple alts to the 
              zone so we can resume at a higher island more quickly the next time 
              we try this zone. Also helped some non-guild people get some epic 
              items before we fell down. Fenik now has a few turn-ins to do and 
              a revisit to 3rd island and we should have our first necro epic!</p>
            <p>FEB 03, 2002<br>
              On Friday, we decided to hit the plane of air. By Sunday, we had 
              made our way up to the sixth island and killed necro mob epic, but 
              he failed to drop the item. We logged for the night and will try 
              him again on Monday. Some of the drops today included: Sphere of 
              Swirling Color (rng epic) [Klaminar, Riverwake, Ronthen, Gilthanus, 
              Maemura], Belt of Pine (rng haste belt) [Riverwake], Belt of Contention 
              (war haste belt) [All warriors on trip], Belt of Concordance (brd 
              haste belt) [Devaberiel], Weight of the Gods (clr shoulder item 
              [Skylynn + 2more).</p>

              Monday - February 4, 2002 - Demana Azulene </p>
            <p>Not satisfied with the death of the Avatar of War, we spent our 
              weekend continuing the killing spree.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Vulak was once again kind to all but the monks. Do'Vassirs for 
              Altroz, crazy boots for Saelvian, and Hidemi looted an insightful 
              earring.</p>
            <p>Sunday morning Meester Dain Frostweaver showed up on his throne. 
              We decided that maybe Narandi was right, and that the King of Stumpymen 
              should die. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Grats to Chadd on getting some much needed head, Vaclav on very 
              shiny, glittering, sequined ring, and Zamdramas and Ironhelm on 
              their Frostreaver's Axes..</p>

            <p>The Avatar of War dead for the first time on Cazic-Thule</p>
            <p>After we managed to peacefully negotiate a more suitable environment 
              to work on this guy (thanks to our friendly competitors for being 
              willing to work this out, by the way) we took this no good son of 
              a bitch out for the count. This wasn't the only try since I last 
              update, but I decided that there would be no updates until this 
              piece of shit died (could have been a long time between updates 
              :p). Many props to my fine guild, and the equally fine guild of 
              Shadowed Soul that made the completion of this encounter possible. 
              It was truly an epic fight, and I think we all agree this was our 
              most amazing experience in EQ to date.</p>
            <p>And the loot did not disappoint--warrior helms of ownage for Chionia 
              and Hobjn, a brand new ring for Imrik, and Kaacee has a new pair 
              of red panties (make sure you wash those seperately, don't turn 
              your whites pink please).</p>
            <p>While this was certainly the highlight by far this week, we also 
              hit Akheva earlier:</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>And he looks like this when he's dead:</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>We have no damage output, so we were kind of surprised that we 
              actually killed him :p Grats to Xieus on his new Itrier Insignia, 
              and catch Thund using his new polo stick somewhere near you.</p>
            <p>That's pretty much all this week. Kind of hard to top the AOW kill, 
              ya know? </p>

              Some days it just doesnt go your way ;/ - ShadeStorm (2/6/2002 2:12 
              AM) <br>
              <br>
              We went for the creator. My side bet for the nite was badunga would 
              die first omalley second, So i screwed up a tad, omalley died first 
              ;&gt; Anyways, we get to hallway and well first time ya have please 
              dont aggro the big guy. So what happens? Yes....we aggro the main 
              guy ;&gt; Camp, come back...this time we get that straightened out(dont 
              say anything, they wont be tempted to do it ;&gt;). This time somebody 
              decided to play hey guys i like jumping off the ramp. Wheeee.....4 
              adds, and another camp. Come back, figuring ok, our luck is getting 
              quite sad. Get the charge signal and i froze for a good 7-10 seconds, 
              zippo gets a ch, then dies in good assling fashion. The wood elf 
              warrior dies because hey divine light is not a ch ;/ CAMP. Ok, when 
              i was about to deguild well every single person, i do a few changes.....hey 
              we got out of the starting gates(finally), and we were doing well. 
              Well we got it to like 50% some ch doesnt happen(i dont know at 
              this point as im dead) zippo dies, and then creator well smacked 
              the rest of the people down really quickly. Somehow we killed it 
              once, somehow we are missing like everything we learned to kill 
              it. As i said, some days it just doesnt <br>
              go your way ;/</p>
            <p>NOTE: Zippo is the best son ever! yay!</p>
            <p>Edit: We killed Gore like 3 times in the past week though so we 
              are at least 10x's more uber then BOTS who die to pansy druid dragons!<br>

              If you honestly expected us to move, your NUTS. Because you dont 
              understand, merauk was making a joke. Made me laugh my butt off 
              seeing you look foolish on merauk's joke. Anyways</p>
            <p>We dropped king tormax, vind, and tunare. Went to ssra basement, 
              glyph spawns then flees, next thing we know is we have the entire 
              first floor down with us, the entire basement aggro to hell, and 
              the glyph running all over the place. Verant please fix this zone, 
              and stop making us waste time on every damn zone where the bugs 
              are at. </p>
            <p>Congrats to ss/da on their killing of aow, was a good kill, and 
              the rotation we set up beforehand proved to be the differnce. Next 
              time i roll, i better get a higher number than a bloody 10 ;/<br>

              February 6, 2002</p>
            <p>Congratulations to HZ, OGS and friends! Our combined efforts paid 
              off this past weekend in The Temple of Veeshan, Halls of Testing. 
              Thursday night the odds were against us, and the servers were down 
              for most of the night, preventing us from our planned &quot;zone 
              in and camp&quot; plan. Therefore Friday night was a bit rushed, 
              trying to hand out resist gear and get everyone on sight in a timely 
              matter. Thanks to a few druid/mage combinations, we managed a plan 
              to get everyone CoH'd and Succored from CS to ToV in no time at 
              all. </p>
            <p>Needless to say Friday night provided few drops, unless of course 
              you count us dropping. But we learned several things about the zone 
              that night and came back full force on Saturday and Sunday nights! 
              Saturday night between both guilds, we counted 24 drops. Here are 
              the drops and the HZ member that it was awarded to...</p>
            <p>Leather Cap - Iillawen<br>
              Silk Bracer - Stryka<br>
              Plate Bracer - Enyon<br>
              Chain Gloves - Fiver<br>
              Silk Gloves - Neranek<br>
              Chain Boots - Sake<br>
              Silk Bracer - Tayzia<br>
              Leather Arms - Namffoh<br>
              Leather Gloves - Iillawen (Dunston holding for MQ)<br>
              Plate BP - Faerus<br>
              Plate BP - Enyon<br>
              Plate Legs - Faerus</p>
            <p>Sunday night the drops slowed down a bit, but I think we still 
              got 10 drops between both guilds. The following HZ, and friends 
              received these drops on Sunday night.</p>
            <p>Plate Bracer - Talios<br>
              Silk Pants - Imlarin<br>
              Chain Bracer - Dunston<br>
              Chain Bracer - Rivka<br>
              Chain Gloves - Rivka</p>
            <p>A great time was had by all, and I want to thank everyone for the 
              dedication in making sure that your characters were leveled, and 
              ready to take on this endeavor. HZ has benefited from this raid, 
              and you can count on the fact that we will be going back! What a 
              great week HZ!</p>

            <p>The humanoid menace collectively known as the Knights of Loyalty 
              has apparently declared war on mobs!!! This just in from all across 
              norrath...</p>
            <p>It was a peaceful relaxing moment for Zordak Ragefire as he visited 
              the Skyfire Mountains, when suddenly out of nowhere some 60 odd 
              members of the Knights of Loyalty came a knocking at his door. Big 
              Z as he is known smiled and welcomed these patrons (since he is 
              a vendor) and to his utter horror they promptly popped a cap in 
              him and sent his vendor form to bind. Being the upstanding member 
              of the Plasmatic Order that he was - he immediately repopped as 
              Zordacalikus Ragefire and got set to lay the law down on the brazen 
              humanoids. Sadly for the home team, 60 humanoids vs 1 mob just wasn't 
              fair odds. With a brief roar of defiance even Big Z was sent packing. 
              Deneb of KoL was seen removing the box from Big Z's corpse and rumor 
              has it he has used the box to make the despicable noodle stick of 
              rezzing that the humanoids love so much.....</p>
            <p>The undead bard was playing the tunes in seb when the kol menace 
              once again struck. With lightning speed and unmatched ferocity even 
              the bards dragon form was quickly put to rest. The undead bard, 
              Lord Trakkanon, Ragefire and yes even Lord Talendor were all seen 
              kicking back with the ghoul archmage at the casino this afternoon 
              =/</p>
            <p>To recap the headlines, Ragefire slain, Deneb scores a Water Sprinkler 
              of Nem Ankh...</p>
            <p>Undead Bard slain - Cris the bardicus now plays a singing sword....</p>
            <p>Lord Talendor owned - there was much humanoid rejoicing....</p>
            <p>brings a tear to my froggy eye =/</p>
            <p>Once again, this has been a NHN emergency report and we will be 
              back with more as soon as we respawn.... Live and direct from bind

              Took couple try's to figure out our tactics but once we did managed

              that we got 2 Mage earth staffs.<br>

              Inbetween all the exp and AA skill points we moved over to WW and 
              had a little talk with Klandicar and Sontalak. Shame they didn't 
              just give us the keys we asked for, so both ended up in FP. Not

              and got Moper his shammy Epic...gratz Moper!! Rest of the day we

              Quiet day overall with lots of exp and more needed skill points. 
              Teamed up for a while with Anavon and took down Sontalak and Zlandicar.

              After a miserable Thursday with just 2 Primals dropping in ST before 
              the server went dead we ended up having a great Friday. </p>
            <p>First we went to Fear to get out our people from last nite's server 
              crash. Killed Dragolich and got 2 items. </p>
            <p>Then we went to Ssra Temple and killed boss 2. He dropped a great 
              range slot item that Skoenne got, and some very nice spells...2x 
              Group Aego and some more. </p>
            <p>After Ssra we headed to ToV and took down Lendi...gratz to Andreas 
              on his ST key. Gratz to Lilcure on the BP and Eredhrin on the nice 
              ranger ring. </p>
            <p>Finally we moved to the Deep and took down Overfiend again. A great 
              fight, and some sweet drops. Gratz to Grip on his monk toy, Gardaor 
              on his nice spear and Garulfo on his level 60 familiar. We also 
              banked 1 C3 spell. </p>
            <p>All in all not bad in one evening...let's keep up the good work.

              We'd like to congratulate DA/SS on their slaying of Avatar of War 
              last week. It was the first killing of the AoW on our server and 
              it was made possible by an agreement made between a number of guilds 
              (6 total I believe).<br>
              While DA/SS killed the AoW we decided to make the best of our time 
              and after killing one ofr hte Tormax's I mentioned in a previous 
              post, we headed out to the Plane of Growth to dispatch that evil 
              sloot Tunare for her phat lewts (Take that Prince Thirnig). I managed 
              to get a shot of her before we dropped her, she can be seen here 
              begging Xate for mercy. No Mercy for the good.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>She dropped quite the phat loots for us, two Assasin's Chestguards 
              (grats twinks), a Rogue Dagger and Thorn Belt for EoD, and an Essence 
              of Nature for Talzok and a Massive Heartwood Flamberge for Noamuchath. 
              Grats on your sweet Tunare loots you two.<br>
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p> We been dyin' by the boat load, oh lawdy lawdy! <br>

            <p>As is pointed out all too often, unless you're going to ToV North 
              or other phat lewt havens around the globe, getting a solid turn 
              out is like finding a television station on after 4 am that doesnt 
              have porno or an info-mercial. So basically, we've been doing a 
              lot of short handed raids, or rather, raids where we have the minimum. 
              <br>
              Some might say, well doing it with the bare minimum is cool, its 
              a challenge, its fun! I say, thats a damn crock of crap and you 
              know it. Losing sucks, it sucks hard. It sucks almost as much as 
              newbies around Furor when he dangles new loot in their face. It 
              sucks as much as Shadestorm does at rolling randomly when our alliance's 
              interests are on the line.</p>
            <p>I like to win, I like to win hard, I like to win fast and most 
              importantly I like to win on the first try without me dying.</p>
            <p>We've been having not to much of that lately. Shie Venetras last 
              week, 8 of them spawned, a million guard adds as people died, what 
              a party. Maybe when Verant fixes the code of the mob, we'll be in 
              luck, till then, we'll try again and fail some more.</p>
            <p>A Glyphed Serpent, thanks area with NO pathing with mob that you 
              CANT snare and a TON of hps. Wave goodbye to a whip. Bye bye whip.</p>
            <p>Xerkizh the Creator, you sexy snake beast you. Well, damage output 
              short and clerics short so not really anyones fault, at least not 
              verant's this time. We know what to do though, so we'll succeed 
              again like the first time.</p>
            <p>However our failures are not without their silver lining. We have 
              our shot at AoW coming up, which I've got money on us like I did 
              on the Pats. We've got ToV north coming up, always a good bolster 
              for loots and turn out. We killed Tormax at least once with nice 
              drops. We killed...omg...LODIZAL, and got some nice drops for a 
              few people. And most importantly, we have some ring wars coming 
              up which should be a good deal of fun.</p>
            <p>So tune in next week, same bat time, same bat station.</p>

              It's A Lot Like Life....<br>
              Omnia Velia en tres partes divisa est...</p>
            <p>There Dad, ya see? The money wasn't wasted!</p>
            <p>Today, Dain Frostreaver again left his city defenseless. This guy 
              is kinda sad. We were all set to give it a good giggle and watch 
              the city fall to it's knees, but Saelvian wouldn't have it. For 
              some reason she just did not want to see the Dorf-ites die. So she 
              manipulated the lot of us to save the town for her. Good thing for 
              her, and the Dorfs, that we are easily duped. So us and DA hit behind 
              the rocks and the trees and the Giants showed up wearing bright 
              colors and marching in a straight line. It wasn't even close. Thurgadin 
              saved again. Congrats to Saelvian on her shiny new ring, let me 
              know how this affects the cost of the clerical special plzthx.</p>
            <p>Sunday, February 3rd, 2002 <br>
              And then there was one....We figured we had protected the weakling 
              Dain Frostreaver the IV long enough from Narandi and his band and 
              that it was time for a little 'payment'. So we gathered in Icewell 
              keep before the Dain and quietly planned his assasination. Here's 
              a pic of the Dain sitting on his THROWN ATROFEEDing away. (Titanax 
              speak for all you wondering what all that was about)</p>
            <p>
              Notice he thinks he's king of his domain and no one can touch him? 
              Well he thought wrong. The Dain squealed like a little girl and 
              curled up into a ball when it finally dawned on him that the dmg 
              shields he'd been equiping us with for the last 8 months or so were 
              going to be working against him. </p>
            <p>
              Congrats to Chadd on his new volleyball that looks amazingly like 
              the Dains head, (I heard he named it Wilson) Zamdramas on his new 
              Frostreaver Axe, Ironhelm on his new Frostreaver Axe, (How you going 
              to explain that to your fellow stumpymen Iron?) and Vaclav on his 
              new Ring of Winter.</p>
            <p>In other news, Saturday we finished up clearing NToV. Congrats 
              to Altroz on his Do'Vassirs gauntlets, Hidemi on her Solists Earring 
              of Insight, and Saelvian on her Sirran's Boots of Insanity. (Like 
              she needed help!) Since we got finished early we decided to pop 
              Telkorenar and Gozzrem and got a nice True Mithril bp for our new 
              initiate Bruzzer, a couple Black Rock Mauls for Tarath and Diabolus 
              as well as Circlets of the Silver Skies for Dira and Genevra. Congrats 
              everyone!</p>

              Oh the sweet taste of victory...<br>
              After finally coming to an agreement with 4 other major guilds on 
              the Cazic-Thule server, (Thanks guys) SS and DA were finally able 
              to secure a &quot;clear&quot; shot at the Avatar of War today. While 
              the zone crept into the 130+ range again as we fought, the lag spikes 
              and linkdeaths were more forgiving during our fight with the orange 
              statue of whoop ass. Some of our frequent readers might remember 
              this pic from a couple weeks ago.</p>
            <p>
              I am now happy to tell you that this is our new favorite pic of 
              the Avatar of War. FACE DOWN on the pavement for the first time 
              ever on the Cazic-Thule server!!</p>
            <p>
              The fight was amazing and truly one of the best fights around in 
              Everquest right now. Everyone had to be sharp and doing things just 
              right or it would have been &quot;Game Over&quot;. We had a couple 
              rough aggro transfers up around 75% health where we thought we had 
              lost it but our cleric core and secondary healers picked up the 
              slack and pulled through like the top notch players they are. Down 
              around 3% health our clerics were running on fumes and people were 
              starting to drop fast. The nukes going off was pretty amazing as 
              we desperately tried to squeeze every drop of damage out before 
              we got summoned and killed. Then suddenly the moment we had all 
              been waiting for, a kill shot by our very own Cerrasu and that awesome 
              CoV faction hit! We spammed the hell out of the zone for about 45 
              seconds and there were numerous people who were shaking from the 
              adrenaline rush of the fight, myself included. That might sound 
              a little silly but when you're dealing with a fight of this caliber 
              it gets you going pretty good.</p>
            <p>Congrats to all the members of SS and DA who participated in this 
              fight and pushed through the several lag filled attempts on him 
              till we got it right. Congrats to Kaacee on his Flayed Barbarian 
              Skin Leggings, (Need a pic of those KC, the ling in her excitement 
              fubared the screenie) Chionia on her new head wearable breastplate 
              err...Helm of Destruction, Hobjn on his Helm of Destruction (Dont 
              tell Hobjn he's starting to look like a noobie again) and Imrik 
              on his Ring of Destruction. (Hey Immy now you can cast C3 on us 
              one more time before being OOM! =P) Now onto Tunare and the rest 
              of Luclin's uber mobs! <br>
