            <p>Then we moved from one giant infested area to another and snuck 
              up on AoW. I think if he coughs up one more Bow, Uros is going to 
              hurt him in a way only an assling can. </p>
            <p>Vindi tripped over just afterwards, but that was probably due to 
              Gluhwein tieing his laces together as he was nicking his boots. 
            </p>
            <p>Also managed to somehow kill Terris Thule as well. </p>

              Posted by Battleskar On Dec 15 2002 At 10:15:12 PM <br>
              On Sunday, a great mobilization turned out to welcome Klandicar 
              yet again into the arms of oblivion. CoG and BG took out the nasty 
              once again to the poor dragon's dismay. Grats Devraider on ST key 
              =)

              Since no one else recently has decide to provide us, the readers, 
              with our fix of much needed news of the CoG coming and goings....I 
              thought I would. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>I understand that things were killed in IV recently as well some 
              exciting and weird conglomeration mobs we now fondly refer to as 
              &quot;those buzzard bee things&quot;..or &quot;dang, these things 
              look weird&quot; from PoS. Personally, I like calling them the Freaky-Deaky 
              Buzzbees. Anyway, much like anything else....they died and offered 
              us many warrior weapons and some nice gloves that somehow in a roll, 
              I defied the laws of my own luck and won. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>I'm sure alot of other stuff was killed..*breaks out her Pom-Poms* 
              Go Cog! But truely...all other mobs pale with knowing we killed 
              some very pissy, plucked, flying chickens. I'd show pictures but 
              I was too busy yapping about how weird they looked and I think they 
              were staring at me. It freaked me out a little to be honest.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>I'm listening to alot of John Mayer, in particular &quot;My Stupid 
              Mouth&quot;. It's rather fitting.</p>
            <p> </p>

              Recently we have done alot more of the same. It seems everyone wants 
              Sleepers Tomb Keys, Primals and Flowing thought for some reason. 
              So we have to make sure mobs like</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Zland, Kland, IV, IV, Zland, Kland, and IV </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>are all hurriedly dispatched.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>In other news we made our first attempt on 2nd tier boss. 7 brave 
              Adventurers in Plane of Storms valiantly engages Some Ancient Turkey 
              Wasp of the Trees at Allegorys suggestion. We only got him down 
              to 99% but it was a good attempt. I think we will get him next time 
              if we remember to bring a Beastlord. Planning is after all the key 
              to our success.<br>

              Time to go back to Veeshan's Peak for some more dragon slaying. 
              And of course, thats what we did. Hoshkar was first up tonight and 
              died quickly dropping us some nice stuff.<br>
              Lumper - Grey Suede Boots<br>
              Maxist - Feverblade / Green Dragonscale (gave last GDS to Lisner)<br>
              Signarius - Fatestealer (Icecream cone of death!!)<br>
              Devaberiel - Lumper's COF
            <p>We then quickly moved on to Silverwing and got a few things from 
              him.<br>
              Saille, Reidwen - Dragon Spine Staff<br>
              Klaminar, Zoranna - Blued Flower Katana</p>
            <p>Tonight we had a rogue with us so we decided to try another dragon. 
              Nexona was next on the hit list. Things didn't go so well though 
              but we learned alot and Nexona will die next time.<br>

            <p>Grats to Dimak for completing his epic. Great job and well worth 
              the effort.</p>
            <p>Been camping in ToV a bit more and picking up lots of nice gear 
              for peeps. Fulturn scored a nice new robe so big time grats to him. 
              He has deserved it for a long time and glad to see him get it.</p>
            <p>Groups of us have been plundering Kael abit more as of late. (faction 
              hunting) Grats to Lidayne on his new haste belt and Celtin for picking 
              up a nice new breast plate.</p>
            <p>Tons of peeps have leveled up quite a bit lately. Rylog, Lidayne,Kithov, 
              Zbar and Kalander to name a few. Everyone has been really growing 
              the exp bars in PoP. Keep up the grind guys and gals, it pays off 
              for sure.</p>
            <p>It was a great pleasure to promote Houfter to the rank of officership. 
              I can still remember the day he was guilded way back when he was 
              running round FV. Grats man and good luck ).</p>

            <p>Edit:by shadestorm.. seeing that trucari decided to throw this 
              up...will just say different fight, and most likely we did it in 
              the longest time of all those who did it(on other servers..this 
              is a serverfirst). Angarr was dropped in roughly 45 minutes. Hes 
              normally a 6-7 minute mob if that, but seeing we do things with 
              less people (we avg only 42 people per raid), and that we dont have 
              vengence items or barely any vt gear you need to improvise and figure 
              with what ya have. I will say this...Tactics over equipment....understand 
              that first, the second will come in time. So to those who whine 
              about we need vt and the vt key should be dropped or whatever(from 
              different message boards)...stfu, seeing it can be done, and without 
              a huge ass number, just figure it out. Seeya ;&gt;</p>

              We haven't been doing a whole lot with the holidays and all that 
              Merry Gay stuff. Lot of us have had real-life things come up. Like 
              Sithray invited us all to move with him in Hawaii and have orgies 
              with him and his wife. I've already claimed the butthole. When more 
              people get back from doing lots of different stuff we'll get back 
              to doing what we do best. Cyber while pretending to raid. </p>
            <p>One night we decided we'd be all cool and block the Bazaar/Nexus 
              zone. A fun time was had by all. Except for the people that couldn't 
              figure out how to get by. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>We hit up West Wastes again last night for some phat loots and 
              some general fun. Took us longer than usual, but we got the job 
              done and at the end the zone was cleared. Except for all that stuff 
              on tracking. </p>

              So yeah, no updates you say? Why? Ask Roy! Good week for the dynamic 
              duo of LoD/SA! Waltz into the north wing, and we see a big ugly. 
              So Roy, how is Freeport? From there, we rolled right along and dropped 
              half of North ToV without a hitch. Drops were great like always, 
              though Lord K is being stubborn with his sword though. Ya'll put 
              in a lot of work this week and did a hell of a job. Be proud ya'll, 
              and fear Da Rollin Ownage!</p>

              Wraa and stuff! So it's been a pretty good week for the Darkness. 
              Especially for epics, so here we go! Yalenya (click please!), Figelsworth 
              (DJ Dreggo's new bubble boy assistant), and Eamane (weeeee, I love 
              Skittles)! Also it didn't get thrown up last week, so I'll say congrats 
              also to Kinhammer, Saddarya, Nanalan, and Trast! Hrmm.... what else 
              did we do? Oh yes... there once was an old man from Hate, who's 
              death was a longer overdue fate. The Legacy came in, we did it again, 
              Rolling Ownage does it like that. Grats everyone on drops! Other 
              stuff out there, dead as well. Expect more to die soon. :D</p>

              Desire (di-zir')<br>
              1. To hope or wish ardently for: Crave<br>
              2. A strong wish or longing</p>
            <p>From the time Cazic-Thule came online after the patch this week 
              a band of gamers came together and pushed themselves and the game 
              to the limit. On this server, with so many capable guilds, it makes 
              advancement an even bigger struggle than usual. In this short period 
              of time, however, Relentless worked hard and proved true to their 
              name.</p>
            <p>Server up was filled with the normal mob hunt, ears perked and 
              nose in the wind constantly searching for the scent of prey. The 
              normal server up targets in BoT were the first to be claimed. Fortune 
              served us well as the scent of blood came to us, drifting upwards 
              from the moon of Luclin. </p>
            <p>We warmed up on Rumblecrush to get ourselves in a killing frenzy 
              (since it is easier just to kill him than to run him around). Zoning 
              into Vex Thal produced a disheartening moan throughout the temple, 
              they knew that Relentless had come. Kaas Thoz Xi Ans Dyek, Diabo 
              Xi Va<br>
              Diabo Xi Xin Thall, Thall Va Kelun, Mini-Aten, Kaas Thox Xi Aten 
              Ha Ra (x2) were all disposed of quickly and with ease. This screenshot 
              was taken to show what a boss mob sees just moments before it's 
              demise. <br>
            </p>
            <p>The sorceress of Vex Thal, in all her power and majesty, defended 
              her temple.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Here you see her standing in victory over the once mighty Relentless...or 
              you could look in the bottom corner and see her in a crumpled heap 
              while Visigroth plays with her reanimated corpse. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Another battle on Luclin that transpired was with the vendor to 
              end all vendors, Shei. Ironically the same technology that allowed 
              me to capture the vision of a Vex Thal boss in battle also captured 
              what the Shei fight looks like for most casters. Exciting isn't 
              it.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Aerin Dar fell before us once again in the planes. Although we 
              took quite a beating in the CoDb ring, we learned a great deal on 
              the first go round. So you can expect to see Bertoxx dead by our 
              hands soon.</p>
            <p>On to the other planes we next drew steel, besting the Behemoth 
              in PoI and earning entrance into the Plane of Tactics. We were tested 
              in battle for the first time by the great sons of battle Tallon 
              and Vallon Zek...they were found lacking.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>I am proud of everyone for having the drive and determination to 
              complete these tasks in such a short period of time. To my guildmates, 
              you are truly Relentless.<br>

            <p>Well, since Kyrthor is still recovering from visiting the pubs 
              with Fulaq, I guess my little update will have to take the place 
              of anything fun he would publish.</p>
            <p>We've had a busy couple of weeks, seen a lot of new things, killed 
              a lot of new mobs. Where have we been? What have we killed? Heck 
              if I know, I just swing my swords in the direction they point me 
              towards. (And sometimes I even hit the mob!!) All I know is we've 
              been having fun exploring PoP.</p>
            <p>While we were exploring we looked around and noticed a few Initiates 
              in our midst and decided it is time to make them Full Members. So 
              please greet the newest Full Members to the Shadowed Soul family.</p>
            <p>Welcome to the family Boanerges and Kellrin!!! <br>
