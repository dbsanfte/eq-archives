                                        not the definitive Shammy soloing post but nor is it meant to be...just a post to help those who have maybe never soloed and would like to (i.e. when you can't find a group) or just want some quick exp. 
                                        Contrary to what anyone says if soloing is done right it is usually the best exp aside from duoing that you can get in game (no mention of AE here!)... Albeit at the cost of turning you into a social hermit 
                                        and possible boring you to tears There are times when soloing is viable...you need some quick exp.you don't have time to dedicate to grouping etc <P ALIGN=LEFT><B>SHAMMY LVL 1-18 </B><P ALIGN=LEFT>Basically 
                                        you are a wannabe tank from levels 1-13, but that's okay. You have enough tricks to make soloing very viable. You have sow to run away when the going gets tough. You can root mobs and back off to heal or use 
                                        one of your lower level dots to do some basic root rotting, but more of that later. Once you hit level 14 things get better. You get Root and Spirit Strike (74dmg DD). These 2 new spells open up what is 
                                        known as DD kiting. <P ALIGN=LEFT><B>DD KITING </B><P ALIGN=LEFT>Simply involves using Sow to outdistance a mob and then cast Spirit Strike to inflict damage in 75 chunk intervals. You can also root blast. 
                                        Open the fight with Walking Sleep your 23% - 35% slow. Either way once you get the mob down to ~ 25% health you tank it to death. <P ALIGN=LEFT><B>SHAMMY LVL 19-23 (The Dark Levels) </B><P ALIGN=LEFT>These 
                                        are known as the dark levels for good reason...level 19 spells for the most part suck...sure you get a decent heal (80 health) and 1 mostly lame dot (affliction 126dmg over 2mins) but the others are nothing 
                                        to write home about. This is the level when most people quit playing their Shaman or turn into group shamans exclusively, always unaware that just over the hill they turn into solo machines. So what is a 
                                        shaman to do at lvl 19-23 if they do want to solo? Basically repeat the DD kiting method but work in more rooting and add the affliction spell to counter any mob regenerative ability. <P ALIGN=LEFT>
                                        Some zones for great soloing through the dark levels include the following:

                                        Regenerate on yourself. Pull a mob with Walking Sleep to your fighting spot. Root the mob and then cast Envenomed Breath on it. Unlike Druid Dots our shammy ones all (exception of epic) have a DD component 
                                        that has a nasty habit of breaking root. However the 1 nice thing to make up for this is that ALL SHAMMY DOTS STACK. Because your mob is slowed you will not take quite as much damage and besides raising 
                                        defence is needed for later levels. While the mob is rotting you cannibalize. After level 34 you will Canni Dance (more on that later). You should be able to get most of the mana back from casting Envenomed

                                        pester mobs and NOT as a tank because it isn't a tank not even close...What you are looking for is a way to maximize the life and return of you pet (cruel eh?). How to use the 600-800 hp and 10-25 dmg double

                                        quickest way. Basically aggro management is the key to successful pet kiting...If you do more dmg to a mob than your pet then he gets forgotten and you are enemy #1 in the mobs' eyes. The best zone for Pet 
                                        Kiting is GD and Kodiaks. You will be killing White and Yellows and getting 1/2 to 1 blue per kill. Blues are for sissies but when whites and yellows aren't around go for it... <P ALIGN=LEFT>USE 3rd Person 
                                        View. From default view Hit F9 3 times, 2 more brings you back to default. Learn to use this view by rotating mouse and moving while rotating. FPS shooter players will pick up on this quickly. <P ALIGN=LEFT>
                                        Find a nice safe wall (North West of the dragon circle is great) and park your pet. ALWAYS have quickness and Sow on your pet as well as your HP buffs. TURN OFF YOUR PETS TAUNT.../pet taunt off. Park your 
                                        pet in the camp spot and go find a Kodiak Bear (wanderers or cave #1-3). Aggro the Kodiak by getting into its face and pulling away from other kodiaks...Root the Kodiak in place and walk back. Cast Envenomed 
                                        Breath and Scourge on the Kodiak and wait for root to break. <P ALIGN=LEFT>You might need to re-root to apply both spells if it breaks after first. This is not much of a problem as any hits you take 
                                        contribute to your defence skill. As soon as root breaks the Kodiak wants you dead and will stop at nothing to rip your heart from your chest. This is the time to run (particularly if its yellow) back to 
                                        your camp spot. Once you get into your pets *master* range it will immediately attack the Kodiak and nip at its heals...Keep running and once you are in your safe turf begin to Run large circles. <P
                                         ALIGN=LEFT>You you may feel and look silly but when the mob in question is a white/yellow/red hell dawn the bo-bo clown face paint and wear it proudly. The Kodiak will continue to follow you while the Dots 
                                        (at a 33% penalty) and your pet are nibbling away at it. Once your pet does more than 1/2 dmg to the mob he will stop at begin to attack your pet but because your 2 dots are doing around 500dmg this doesn't 
                                        happen until the mob is at around 40% health. Use your lvl 24 DD to get back its attention. <P ALIGN=LEFT>The mob will resume chasing you and dying until it gets to the *flee* stage at which point you attack 
                                        it. While you are kiting you will notice you often have to stop to let pet and mob get close again...this is just enough time to Cannibalize once...when done strategically though out the fight you end with 
                                        only about 1-2 bubs of mana lost at most. Most fights end with you down maybe 1/2 a bub of mana. I suggest every 3 or 4th fight tanking the mob just before *flee* stage to work on your defensive skill. <P
                                         ALIGN=LEFT>Another great ability is: <P ALIGN=LEFT><B>CANNA DANCING </B><P ALIGN=LEFT>Information is sent to the Everquest servers every 6 seconds from client machines. This includes HP and Mana. If you 
                                        watch your HP and Mana closely you will notice that they rise in intervals exactly every 6 seconds. It doesn't matter what you do during those 6 seconds...the program only checks on the 6th second to see 
                                        whether you are sitting/medding or standing. If you are sitting you get mana if you are standing you don't. It is that simple. To canni dance you sit wait for a tick to occur and then stand up and cast 
                                        cannibalize before quickly sitting to catch the next tick. This should become a ritual between mobs and greatly decreases your downtime. <P ALIGN=LEFT><B>SHAMMY LVL 39-48 </B><P ALIGN=LEFT>

                                        root/rotting becomes viable. Also your downtime is much less than that of a druid/wizzy who has to wait till all their mana is back before resuming quad #2. Because of spells like Canni 2/3 you will be up 
                                        and ready for mob #s 2,3 and 4 before their next hopefully successful quad <P ALIGN=LEFT><B>SHAMMY LEVEL 60</B><P ALIGN=LEFT>This is the level where Shaman have no equal when it comes to soloing. No druid, 
                                        necro or mage can ever hope to solo the mobs that a fully equipped and battle hardened level 60 shaman can. Several items and aaxp make soloing at 60 a blast. General rule even without much aaxp is: <P

                                        by several percent. <P ALIGN=LEFT>Several higher end zones lend themselves to some fun soloing. IMO lvl 60 isn't just about the aaxp or raids it is about pushing yourself as a class as far as you can. <P

                                        alchemy as an extension of your spell book (albeit a costly one!) Think of it, how many of you have paid 30K or more for your spells? Exactly…so what's a few k for some potions? <P ALIGN=LEFT>It all depends
