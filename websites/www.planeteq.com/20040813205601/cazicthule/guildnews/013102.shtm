              Emergency patch provided ample opportunities for slaying this evening: 
              Phinny (junk loots), Venril Sathir (paly legs, bard legs, wizard 
              epic staff [Silvercaster]), Ixiblat, and then the Tangrin [Mysyn]. 
              Went to kill Uulump, but he wasn't up, so instead moved on to kill 
              reavers in CoM for a while, but no jade reavers dropped. Great job 
              mobilizing and getting several epic components in one night! Now 
              have 3 clerics waiting on Ragefire...</p>
            <p>JAN 29, 2002<br>
              Killed Ixiblat this evening to get Ointmennt to within 1 item of 
              cleric epic. With two clerics now waiting on Ragefire, we are eager 
              to get our first click-sticks. After Ix, we cleared the remaining 
              guardian wurm in SF, and then moved on to OT to kill cliff golems. 
              No good spell drops, but the adventurers in OT were fairly safe 
              while we buried goons of the indigo brotherhood.</p>

              <br>
              Derreck Reports on Sleepers Tomb Events:<br>
              Last week, a crack team of Drunkards managed to KS the entire Sleeper's 
              Tomb<br>
              zone right out from under the slack-jawed faces of The Relentless 
              and<br>
              Element of Darkness. Drops were: The entire BFA, 2 primal warswords 
              (Twyl's<br>
              pet kicked SO much ass with that sword), and some primal stick thingy 
              which<br>
              we destroyed. A good time was had by all except those that we trained 
              mobs<br>
              on.<br>
              <br>
              In the Field of Intra-Guild Happenings:<br>
              With dual V's leaving the guild, and Twyl once again at the helm 
              a few changes are going to be made with the way we deal with drops 
              on our raids.<br>
              Firstly - Any and all Dark Elf Enchanter usable items will be looted 
              by Twyl.<br>
              Second - Any and all Gnome Warrior usable items will be looted by 
              Twyl to give to assho- er Srukin.<br>
              Thirdly - Any items not usable by DE Enc's or Gnome War's will be 
              looted by Twyl to be sold at a later date. The money earned from 
              said items shall go into the GUILD TREASURY*<br>
              Fourthly - Any no-drop items will be looted by Twyl so he can inspect 
              them fully and ascertain if they are indeed quest items for Dark 
              Elf Enchanters or Gnome Warriors. If they are not, Twyl will then 
              inform all those who could have used the items that he is &quot;sorry 
              bro&quot; and that it was &quot;his bad.&quot;<br>
              Lastly - All coin and trinkets will be given to group leaders who 
              will eventually (through the magic of trickle-up economics) pass 
              them on to Twyl.<br>
              <br>
              * - The GUILD TREASURY shall consist of a separate account to be 
              paid for by Lohocla, and owned by Twyl. This account will be made 
              up entirely of characters holding items and money which the guild 
              can use to buy presents for Twyl and/or Srukin.</p>

              Shei Vinitras - Merauk (1/31/2002) <br>
              <br>
              Just a little shot of our Shei Vinitras attempt last night. Similiar 
              to Grieg this is a triggered mob which is spawned by killing another 
              mob. When she spawns she also spawns some guards.</p>
            <p>As if a direct answer to Shade's wish for more mobs, we were blessed 
              eight Shei Vinitras (who death touches) spawning along with an uncountable 
              number of guards (who harm touch) all at the same time!</p>
            <p>I would make a snide comment about working as intended but we got 
              GM rez's as apparently this is a known bug. Still sort of pisses 
              me off to waste an entire evening (for a second time at Shei as 
              our last one was bugged up to) on a mob that doesn't work right 
              almost two months after SOL was released. Verant either needs to 
              fix these mobs or /kill them so we don't waste time trying to kill 
              them.<br>
              <br>
              I was shocked!! - ShadeStorm (1/31/2002 ) <br>
              <br>
              Shocked when we saw only 135 players in Kael. Wasted Tormax in what 
              had to be the weirdest fight ever, half the guild logs out half 
              the guild fights Tormax because a miscommunication happened. Didn&#146;t 
              matter to me as I was dead with a res box thinking oh what the hell, 
              dying isn&#146;t all that bad ;&gt; Well seemed we decided basically 
              to fight Tormax and all the guards at once, with over half of everybody 
              ungrouped. Then we moved to AOW with 53 players, all tanks came, 
              just not the clerics. 135 players still causes lag, and we had a 
              few lag bursts that screwed the attempt. But as ya can see, one 
              group who wasn&#146;t in the zone had well you do the math on their 
              numbers from Monday ;&gt; </p>
            <p>We then moved to Shie and all was working as intended till the 
              actual fight. Now if a guild won against 8 Shies and roughly 25-30 
              level 60 guards all at once, I will say that is the most amazing 
              thing i would see. Because I dare anybody to explain how you work 
              against roughly 20 HT's and several DT's all at once all in a minute 
              of time. Then again, I say this mob is BUGGED beyond belief. </p>
            <p>As for high level content, everything on the ct server DIES in 
              2 days. What is everything? Here is a nice list of everything. Ntov, 
              Yel, Tormax, Vindi, Statue, IT, Overfiend, CT, mini bosses 1-2 in 
              SSRA, SSRA basement, Tunare, Doz, Lend, Trak, Greigs, Dain, Velk, 
              and even smaller spawns that I cant of. Creator also will be dying 
              regularly(not always by us soon), and high priest will as well. 
              Will Vex Thal solve the problems? Naw, don&#146;t even think it 
              will. It will be a small stop gap, but that&#146;s all. </p>
            <p>My own solutions are kind of simple. Yes one more expansion but 
              an expansion that wasn&#146;t even like SOV. This one is 15-20 zones 
              all different factions, all starting out indifferent, and each faction 
              take one extra faction negative and one extra faction positive. 
              Make the quests HARD in each zone. Make the loot from said quests 
              though DAMN good. Make all encounters similar to risk as well. Not 
              cookie cutter mobs, but different ways to make the zones truly raid 
              oriented. Make each zone have many mini bosses each also similar 
              to the different zones in terms of how hard they are, but again 
              not cookie cutter style. </p>
            <p>The other solution which is actually much easier to do is simple. 
              Add content to the existing zones now. Not sure on other servers 
              but Shadow Haven, SERU, and KATTA are barely used except to buy/sell. 
              Yes I know of the key quest in SERU(almost done for us ;p). But 
              that seems to be a single mob in such a HUGE zone. Same for the 
              other zones. Add mobs that start out INDIFFERNT to zones. This is 
              needed because people shouldn&#146;t have to fear certain areas. 
              Giants and dragons should be added to the zones as well. Yes they 
              are warring in SOV, but why aren&#146;t they expanding? Especially 
              the giants, the dragons have, and I am surprised so far to not see 
              a single dragon in all of SOL. Aren&#146;t they supposed to watch 
              the &quot;lesser races&quot;? If that&#146;s the case, why aren&#146;t 
              they watching this moon? Anyways, we will continue to do what we 
              can, and hopefully do them first on the server as we have before, 
              just that it seems fighting in lag constantly well isn&#146;t fun 
              ;&gt;<br>
              <br>
              What fun to just watch sometimes - ShadeStorm (1/30/2002) <br>
              <br>
              New record for Kael was 237 people. With the lag this bad, we decided 
              why even bother trying. That was Monday, today is Wednesday and 
              our server was down for an hour. Oh this should be fun, or maybe, 
              just maybe, something will be worked out. But this is the CT server, 
              where distrust is basically number one. And here I thought Kael 
              could only handle 200 people ;&gt; </p>
            <p>We also dropped IT(Akheva) this week. Yes, slow week because of 
              respawns, but that should change a tad with the server dropping 
              ;&gt;<br>

              And the hits just keep on coming - Merauk (1/26/2002) <br>

              Killed Glyphed in what could be described as well I don't know, 
              PRETTY SAD.</p>
            <p>Exiled just destroyed us.</p>

            <p>Killed ourselves three times on Xerkhiz in spectacularly lame fashion.</p>
            <p>Killed the Rhags for a late night pick me up.</p>
            <p>Thank god its not Friday anymore!
            <p> Did a few things - ShadeStorm (1/24/2002) <br>
              <br>
              Did a piss poor attempt on aow but then again 180 people in the 
              zone sorta puts a damper on trying to get a clean shot. Afterwards 
              dropped yel(yawn), and then dropped the two basement mobs in ssra.</p>

              this time. Dropped BP and his head. Grats Gwendle... and whoever 
              ended up with the head.<br>
              <br>
              We killed stuff <br>
              Solias writes &quot;So the past few days we've got several big kills.. 
              We went after the Vindicator and after a few borked attempts, managed 
              to down him and get a BP of Vindication (Gwendle). Were gonna attempt 
              Statue but our pullers couldn't seem to split it and it was getting 
              late so we took off. </p>
            <p>The next night we did Ixiblat Fer for 2 of our clerics, the Hole 
              for Damain, then took down Trakanon, winning a Donal's BP (Eloine) 
              and Shaman BP (Damain) plus about 5 teeth I think, as well as a 
              Jumpy robe (Prespone) and Hardened Clay Bracer and some spells etc. 
            </p>
            <p>The nite after that (Tuesday) we hit up Trakanon again (patch day), 
              drops being a Pally BP (Vigil) and Bard BP (Jammen). Then we headed 
              to VL and dropped Velketor for a Crystal Rod of Confusion (Solias, 
              yay me), Sword of Somethingorother (Pyriana), Some_Necro_Bracer 
              (Tylerkx), and Velketors Spellbook (Arae), plus 4 spells (pretty 
              loaded corpse) including Ice Spear of Solist. Then those remaining 
              dropped down to whack Lord Monklewts, who didn't surprise us by 
              dropping an Tunic (Buhf) and Glowing Red Stone (Fuddrick). </p>
            <p>Grats all on the good work, we are improving our skill in dropping 
              these guys greatly =)<br>

              Klandicar &amp; ST <br>
              Today was a lot of exp for many of the members. In between we teamed 
              up with Anavon in WW and slayed Klandicar for 1 more ST key. Gratz 
              to Dirkin on his ST key. </p>
            <p>Then we moved to Sleeper's and did all 3 named bosses. Gratz to 
              Azazu and Leita on getting Primal's and Torut on getting his Primal 
              Avatar spell. <br>
              <br>
              Monday 28 January, 2002 <br>
              Sontalak slayed <br>
              We all went to WW and teamed up with Anavon for our best Sontalak 
              slaying so far. A few deaths and a solid victory made this a very 
              fun team effort. He dropped a BP, some spells and the Talisman. 
              Gratz to Samirah on getting her ST key. </p>
            <p><br>
              Sunday 27 January, 2002 <br>
              Lucky drops <br>
              Sunday meant another fast run down to Traks lair. This time he dropped 
              cleric and bard BP + 3 teeth. </p>
            <p>The ST key holders headed over to Sleeper's Tomb and got very lucky. 
              Gratz to Banno and Blackbadger on Primal Warsword and Deacis on 
              Primal Avatar spell. <br>
              <br>
              Saturday 26 January, 2002 <br>
              Sontalak &amp; RoF <br>
              We decided to go after Sontalak again and headed to WW. After a 
              very close 1st attempt we got our heads together and slaugtered 
              Sontalak for 1 more ST key and 6 spells. Gratz to Sicon (Anavon) 
              on his ST key. </p>
            <p>Then it was time for Ring of Fire fun, and fun it was. Just too 
              bad 2 people went LD inside the ring just as boss 5 spawned. Killing 
              boss 5 with 12 adds ended up being a bit too much: P <br>
              <br>
              Friday 25 January, 2002 <br>
              Slow day &amp; ST cleared <br>
              Friday was our slow day with exp camps all over the place. The ST 
              key holders headed over to Sleepers Tomb and left it empty. Very 
              good drops today in ST. Gratz to Kianwan on his Primal bow. We also 
              got a bunch of Priceless stuff. Gratz to Azazu on 2x Priceless.

              We've Been Killing, Oh Joy of Joys. <br>
              Posted By: Lovern Merrilon on 29 January 2002, at 11:29 PM </p>
            <p>Since the last update we've killed a bunch of stuff.<br>
              We killed Tunare once, we killed the Itraer Vius 3 times, we killed 
              the Named Mobs in the Basment of Ssra, and we killed the named mobs 
              in the upstairs of Ssra. We killed Yelinak too somewhere in there, 
              congrats Foulbreath on your Gauntlets of Dragonslaying.</p>
            <p>We also died a bunch. We died to the AoW various times, we died 
              to other named stuff around Luclin, and I think Soel died to the 
              spawnmaster in ToV. </p>
            <p>All relatively unimportant, as we slew that vile beast Dozekar 
              again tonight. We r 2 l33t 4 u!</p>
            <p>But on to my real point, stuff will die soon, fear us, we are coming. 
              Our leet AE groups have amassed us a bajillion AA points and you 
              will learn our wrath, for we are the unmerciful, the hard-headed, 
              the Spartan, the draconian, the stringent, the resolute, the inexorable, 
              the not to be shaken, the stony-hearted, the implacable, the impenitent, 
              the recusant, the unrepentant, the remorseless, the graceless, the 
              malevolent, the ruthless, the vengeful, the cruel, the brutal, the 
              infuriate, the rabid, the savage, the all-singing, all-dancing crap

              When boredom attacks.....<br>
              With the Cazic-Thule server down boredom set in. Naturally they 
              goof something up or melt something down pretty good the day we're 
              scheduled to clear NToV. Oh well guess that means we'll just have 
              to clear it in one day so we can keep to our schedule of raids we 
              have planned. Anyway, while we sat in the chatroom for 5 hours waiting 
              for the server to come back up I decided to revamp the websites 
              links so they didnt go to sites that were gone. I also added a &quot;EQ 
              Guilds&quot; section that contains the 6 big CT guilds and the rest 
              of the servers heavy weights. Added a couple links to the EQ News 
              section and fixed the server monitor. (again) Then I decided to 
              fix the damn SS rollover in the top left of the website that has 
              been driving me nuts for over a year. Roll your mouse over the top 
              menu and see how it looks. Mail your comments to Pirotess@shadowedsoul.com 
              if something looks goofy. I'm thinking about adding headlines to 
              the news page and maybe a Java ticker with our confirmed kills or 
              something like that. We'll see. Someday soon I might revamp the 
              roster too, its starting to annoy me with 60+ twinks clogging it 
              up. Race you all to a mob tomorrow. Later. </p>

              Confutatis Maledictis...<br>
              We started our day in Kael, once again testing our mettle against 
              the Avatar of War. Things felt good to start, but 1 lag burp and 
              1 push too far add up to too many things to recover from with this 
              guy. Still a fun fight and I am confident the AoW will be sent packing 
              soon, just not today.</p>
            <p>So, we assuaged our hunger for fresh conquest by moving to ahkeva 
              and whacking the Itraer Vius, a mob we had not yet killed. The fight 
              itself is rather vanilla once you get it sorted out, but the getting 
              TO the fight is a lot more 'fun' than most other raids.<p>
              On the plate yesterday was another war for the ring of Dain Frostreaver 
              (well known punk and ne'er do well). It was, as always, a blast...I 
              just have one thing to suggest for this encounter...REMOVE THE &amp;^#$^%$#ING 
              FACTION FROM THE GIANTS IN THE WAR! If the design team does not 
              understand why those giants having faction on them is a BAD thing 
              it could only be that they have never tried it on a live server. 
              Ranting aside, congrats to Hobjn on his ring and grats to the whole 
              alliance for continuing to tackle what is STILL the coolest encounter 
              in the game with style and speed.</p>
            <p> </p>

              Bela Lugosi's Dead....<br>
              ...and the AoW still isn't. 'Nuff said.</p>
            <p>Was a pretty light weekend, nothing major went down so lots of 
              time to sit around and be social. Valkemier won the Lithuanian Haiku 
              competion, Jackedd downed the most Tumpy Tonics without hurling, 
              and Thund got the award for largest lawn jockey built entirely from 
              hair shaved off his back (honestly, no-one else competed in that 
              one, but none of us could breathe long enough to tell Thund).</p>
            <p>After the AoW didn't die, we moved on to Ssra and had some fun 
              there...however, this 'not dieing' campaign is going so well we 
              are going to expand on it. On patch days, look for AoW, Emporer 
              Crush, Fippy Darkpaw and Sgt Slate all to NOT die. Once we get our 
              tactics down for that scenario we plan to expand into the dorfs 
              in butcherblock and anything else a Druid might kite.</p>
            <p>In other news, Bruzzer didn't duck fast enough and got hit with 
              the guilding macro, everyone say hello and remind him that all his 
              earthly finds go to the &quot;Kyrthor Pony Fund&quot;.</p>
