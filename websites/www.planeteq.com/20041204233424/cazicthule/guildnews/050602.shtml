              Fall of the big green lizard, part two<br>
              Posted by: Swiftwolf on Friday, May 03, 2002<br>
              <br>
              Friday Severlious decided to show his ugly green head again. Shortly 
              after a team of Bloods assembled and pulled him. After the bastard 
              decided to pick on our poor puller Shamy, we quickly made short 
              work of the beast. Grats to Shirak on the wizzy ice lure nuke, Garhix 
              on shield. Others to be awarded later or I just forgot.</p>
            <p>We weren't done though. In true BG fashion we moved right on to 
              our next target, the retarded loot table mob, also known as the 
              Va`Dyn. Drops were predictably Toetwister, Bracer, and spell Warder's 
              protection. (Think I heard someone there predict 2 of the 3 drops) 
              Grats Shrug on the bracer, Dida on the Toetwister.<p>
              Did somebody say gems?<br>
              Posted by: Swiftwolf on Thursday, May 02, 2002<br>
              <br>
              Tuesday we stocked up our gem supply, getting the needed gems to 
              finish BPs for Aeria and Craz! Grats guys!!</p>
            <p>Wednesday we hit ToV. Was pretty crowded, but still managed to 
              pull out some decent armor drops for a weekday night. Bubbuls took 
              in a nice haul, grats big guy on plate helm, gloves, and legs. Naeadas 
              also did well with a chain bracer and arms. Grats! <p>
              Va`Dyn feels BG's wraith<br>
              Posted by: Swiftwolf on Tuesday, April 30, 2002<br>
              Va`Dyn falls again to Blood Guard on Monday night. Yet another copy 
              of the 60 necro spell (yay =/) and some other stuff. This guy's 
              spell loot table seriously needs to be randomized a little better.</p>
            <p>Grats Freo on Toetwister, grats Bubbuls on bracer.<p>
              Temple of Chain Arms, errr Veeshan<br>
              Posted by: Swiftwolf on Tuesday, April 30, 2002<br>
              Sunday we finished up our weekend ToV run. 15 drops total, including 
              4 chain arms, giving us 6 sets over the two day raid. (Spawn_Master_01 
              probably got a good laugh out of that...)</p>
            <p>Grats Aeria on Plate BP, Terrik and Talanthos on Plate Legs. <p>
              The Slaying Continues...<br>
              Posted by: Swiftwolf on Saturday, April 27, 2002<br>
              Friday we continued the dragon slaying by taking down Trak! Grats 
              to Heart and Terrik on BPs, and lots of others on spells, teeth, 
              and other pickups along the way.</p>
            <p>Saturday started off a weekend ToV trip nicely.. 16 total armor 
              drops! Grats to Craz and Prom on the big ticket items, Craz with 
              a Plate Breastplate and Prom with Plate Legs. <br>
              <br>
              lizards lizards everywhere!<br>

              so this afternoon, our intreped mage trevelly spots that big red 
              annoyance talendor in skyfire. because it's just so annoying to 
              see a living dragon, BG got together and stomped him flat. after 
              that, i think we got a bit bored.. so we went and played with that 
              ugly white dragon gorenaire for about a 1 and 1/2 minutes.... needless 
              to say, gore is gonna be out of commission for a week or so. how, 
              just as we were finishing off the white one, this obnoxious green 
              dragon chooses to rear his ugly head, so we went on over to emerald 
              jungle and cut it off...... well, just to top the evening off, lodizal 
              decided to pop, so another group of BG went and made sure he would 
              pop again later....</p>
            <p>so, to recap, today, Bloods Guard killed, in order:<br>
              Talendor, Gorenaire, Severlious, Lodizal.<br>
              <br>

            <p>Thanks Druss for stepping up and taking over for me during my very 
              much unwanted absence. </p>
            <p>Tonight we took a break from the tedium of key camping in Ssra, 
              and defended Thurgadin against those mean old giants for Dinuvian's 
              10th Ring War. </p>
            <p>We were triumphant, and I really don't want to know what lengths 
              Din had to go to so he could secure the ring as his own. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Grats Avar on the Crown of Narandi, Boanerges on the Choker of 
              the Wretched, Cueina on the Mask of Bentos the Hero and Ronolo on 
              Narandi's lance.<p>
              What we've been up to.... <br>
              <br>
              Posted by: Druss on Monday, April 29th, 2002<br>
            </p>
            <p>Yeah, no pictures, no big list of names of the lucky recipients 
              of phat lewtz. Deal with it. I'm pinch hitting for Mirax. Us Barbarians 
              aren't exactly known for our eloquence or reporting skills. </p>
            <p>Ok, what have we done since the last update...oh, a couple things. 
            </p>
            <p>Lets start with the AoW - After several attempts, we finally took 
              this bad-boy down on 4/21. About a smooth as killing as you could 
              imagine. Congrats Taraddar on his Ring of destruction, Shaofung 
              on his Flayed Barbarian Leggings, and Talons on their Ring of Destruction 
              and their flayed barbarian skin mask. </p>
            <p>Amazingly, within hours of his death, our strategy on how we killed 
              him was leaked on to CTC. With this supa-sekrit-ubah-strat, every 
              guild on the server will soon be knocking down Rallos Zek's avatar. 
              Missed the post on CTC? Afraid you missed your chance to be Uber, 
              too? Well, out of the goodness of my heart (and that $50 check &quot;Lords 
              of the Ogre Dance&quot; sent me), I'll repost it here. Ready? </p>
            <p>ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS HIT CH </p>
            <p>Revolutionary? Yes. We had a team of over 50 trained chimps, brainstorming 
              for months, before we came up with this radical new concept in raiding. 
              Complete Heal. Combined with our patented &quot;Bind-point-rush&quot; 
              tactics, the avatar of war was no match for the forces of Zerg. 
              &quot; </p>
            <p>On a side note...the one chimp that suggested pulling the AoW to 
              Tormax's room, then kicking him off the bridge into the wolf pit, 
              has since been fired. Though I hear he found work with another guild, 
              and that the &quot;WHY PUSH IN WOLF PIT WHY WHY WHY&quot; Strategy 
              has worked out well for them. </p>
            <p>Moving right along... </p>
            <p>Well, a month has passed, and it seemed it was our turn for ToV 
              North again. Cleared out 7 or so dragons on the 24th. Congrats to 
              all who received phat lewtz. Server came down two days in a row, 
              so we ended up going back to clear it again on the 26th and the 
              27th. </p>
            <p>There was a Tormax killing tucked in there somewhere too. </p>
            <p>And then on the 26th, we went to Ssra. Killed Rhag 1, The Glyphed, 
              Exiled, and the Creator. </p>
            <p>So...thats what CC/Talons got done. </p>
            <p>Throw in the tedium of Luclin's key farming, a wee bit of AA, and 
              a bunch of small stuff that died, and you have a week in the life 
              of a CC member. </p>
            <p>Anyway..hurry back, Mirax - bring back normal news page updates!<br>

              Well things got off to a rocky start and didnt end the best either 
              but as you will see below the drops more than made up for it. To 
              start things off a NToV mob decided it was going to explore the 
              rest of the zone for a little while and wondered around the hub 
              for a while killing everyone that make even vaguely close. After 
              a few people chain dying trying to get him out of there we finally 
              got rezzed, buffed, and moved on into the left side heading towards 
              zoneout camp. We got there in record time tonight with not that 
              many deaths and nice steady pulls.... maybe a little too quickly 
              tho at the end. We had a white wurm gate on us at the zoneout cubby 
              camp and while we were killing it we got a roamer add and then a 
              few min later respawn. Thanks to some great work by Pheign, Meff, 
              and Thooven they managed to get everyone rezzed at zoneone and only 
              needed a single coffin.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Grats to the following on loot tonight: Thooven on plate gloves, 
              Sterling on plate helm, Barbed on plate bracer, Rayn on silk hat, 
              two more quest symbols for the bank, a PLATE BP!! for Bregga (50ac 
              9sta 5agi 15wis 9mr/dr 8fr/cr/pr 50hp 90mana effect: mark of karn) 
              and a CHAIN BP!! for Hewbert (43ac 6str 6sta 6agi 6dex 15wis 4mr/fr/cr/pr/dr 
              45hp 90mana effect: riotous health)<br>

              May 01, 2002<br>
              Grats to Wyntyr for finishing the wizard epic quest this evening. 
              Phinny was very stubborn for her and he finally decided to reward 
              her for her efforts. In looking over our guild news from the past 
              month, it is easy to see we've been rampaging on epics of late. 
              With 10 in just the last 30 days, including some of the toughest 
              in the game (magician, warrior). For a guild of our size, this is 
              an epic achievement of its own, and demonstrates how well we all 
              work together. There aren't many epics left to get, and if could 
              just catch Ragefire...
            <p>Also this evening, the Halls of Testing: Chain Bracer [Dreamthief], 
              Plate Boots [Gish], Silk Boots [Groovit, Silvercaster], Plate Gauntlets 
              [Stien], Silk Wrist [Jarheuu], and Chain Gauntlets [Shcammer].</p>
            <p>APR 30, 2002<br>
              ToV again. Killed twice as many mobs as the night before, but far 
              fewer loots: Silk Bracer [Zionmaster], Chain Helm [Barelil], Plate 
              Bracer [Chadmoe], Leather Legs [Physst], Plate Helm [Maxist], and 
              Plate Arms [Ceeni].</p>
            <p>APR 29, 2002<br>
              Big raid on The Halls of Testing this evening and we came away with 
              quite a bit of loot: Leather legs [Ikana], 3 Plate Legs [Machedor, 
              Aorthin, Khandrahcir], 2 Plate Bracers [Awll, Uggabuga], Chain Tunic 
              [Alone], and 2 Silk Turbans [Mmatil, Silvercaster].</p>
            <p>APR 28, 2002<br>
              Finished another epic this afternoon - congrats to Ippit for finishing 
              the monk epic! Also raided Siren's Grotto for some gems.</p>
            <p>APR 27, 2002<br>
              Raid on Kael. Quite a few drops: Plate Arms [Grumpie], Plate Bracer 
              [Khandrahcir, Stien], Silk Sleeves [Greymask], Plate Boots [Tarrask], 
              and a few quest items. Killed Phinny later that night and dropped 
              nothing of value, just 1 item short of another wizard epic - and 
              we are waiting.</p>
            <p>APR 26, 2002<br>
              Raid on Ssra Temple this evening. Easily cleaned out first floor 
              with little difficulty. Came away with some nice spells and next 
              time will progress much deeper into this dungeon.</p>
            <p>APR 25, 2002<br>
              Stevenfost completed Shield of Bane quest. The first time he tried 
              to do the quest, the mob ran off at end of the fight and died in 
              a rock. When he tried to get help from customer support, they didn't 
              do anything to help him, even when he offered to just roll back 
              his character. Hats off to Tilol though, he checked the logs and 
              saw that Stevenfost did get to this point in the quest and restored 
              his items. Steven did last fight this evening and kept the mob snared 
              and far away from rocks.</p>
            <p>APR 24, 2002<br>
              Hawkien completed 8th ring quest this evening. Ippit also attained 
              his Robe of the Whistling Fist and then finished the monk epic!</p>
            <p>APR 22, 2002<br>
              Miscellaneous experience raiding the next week as we gear up for 
              some guild raids the week after.</p>
            <p></p>

              </b></a>Had another fun week of EQ.</p>
            <p>In honor of our recent one year anniversery, we held a gnoob gnaked 
              gnome brawl. In remembrance of our first<br>
              Guild Leader Lorayna Bobbit, everyone created female gnome warriors 
              with the exception of a certain cleric who cheated with an SK. It 
              turned out to be a good time and I was able to empty some of the 
              guild bags and off load some of the extra gear that we have aquired 
              in recent raids.</p>
            <p>Legion of Nox, DoKR, The Templars and Bastion Amici teamed up to 
              rumble into hate for bit this past weekend. This was a first for 
              some peeps and overall it was a decent night as we took down many 
              mobs with<br>
              minimal deaths and down time. We even helped out another group of 
              peeps that suffered an untimely wipeout.</p>
            <p>Kael yelded many good drops again, everything from plate to silk. 
              Plate legs, chain gloves, silk bracer<br>
              gloves and helm all dropped. Kithov scored a bracer and congrats 
              to him on his first time in Kael. Our 2<br>
              main warriors are quickly aquiring many plate drops and I must admit 
              the silver look is pretty cool.</p>

              Can I get some friggin options please?<br>
              You know I read quite a few of the websites and message boards of 
              the large guilds and see their rants and quietly nod my head. Almost 
              immediately after I shrug my shoulders because more often than not 
              not a damn thing changes. Here's one example out of a hundred. How 
              many posts were there about fixing the Ring of Fire? How many were 
              blatantly ignored in light of the 'Vision'? RoF 1.0 was FUN after 
              the first 3 cycles and pretty challenging in that laggy room. What 
              did Verant do though? Nerfed it into non-use effectively removing 
              an option for people. Ring of Vulak same deal, option removed and 
              whats this crap about load on the server screwing up the trigger? 
              Run a load generator or better yet the login server off of test 
              if you need to QA your code under load since anything is better 
              than the login crap you have now. If you absolutely cant figure 
              that out download Seti@home or open a porn server on it to simulate 
              load for cripes sakes. </p>
            <p>We the people who have playtested Verants content for the last 
              3+ years probably have a fairly good idea of what is fun and what 
              is broken. Well Im here to tell you that Luclin is pretty damn broken. 
              Yeah I know that Tigole and Furor and all the other Guildleaders 
              have been saying that for quite some time but that has been a little 
              bit more about the encounters themselves, risk vs reward and the 
              number of timesinks in the game. I agree with them mostly but Im 
              talking about being even more fundamentally broken. Here, I'll show 
              you.</p>
            <p>Kunarks end game zone was Veeshans Peak. To get there you had to 
              build a key that was built from drops across the continent with 
              a bottleneck at Trakanon. Ok fine you dont want everyone there so 
              you have one PREDICTABLE spawn as the bottleneck, something everyone 
              can count on. If there were several groups of people who wanted 
              him rotations werent that difficult to work out since there werent 
              that many who could do him at the time due to a younger server population. 
            </p>
            <p>Velious's end game zone was Sleepers Tomb. While the zone itself 
              was broken with its 'dynamic content' crap and the warders should 
              have been just a WEE bit more difficult than the first brood dragons 
              you had to kill just to get into the zone, the key to get to it 
              was alright. You had 5 options to gather keys for your guild and 
              get in there. On top of that Verant had the start of a good idea 
              in having 3 different lines of faction to keep an aging server population 
              (more lvl 60's) from bumping head consistantly. Granted it would 
              have been pretty damn nice if they had worked the storyline to allow 
              for the Kael and maybe even Thurgadin ubers to be able to drop key 
              pieces as well so we werent forced to kill our faction of choice 
              but I'm asking for too much there now and in the end we had 5 options 
              so thats good enough.</p>
            <p>Enter Luclin, simply put the most poorly thought out expansion 
              yet. It had potential when we started. There were some nice new 
              ubermob abilities that we had to work out tactics for, a fairly 
              in depth storyline and what looked to be 3 seperate factions (read 
              options) on how we might be able to get into the end game zone of 
              the expansion. Boy were we stupid, or maybe just deceived. Can anyone 
              explain to me which brainiac decided that it would be a good idea 
              for the Emperor of the Shissar to be the only uber to control access 
              to Vex Thal? Couldnt you have had Seru conspire against the shissar 
              and steal part of their sacred celestial power source so we didnt 
              have to fight over the Emperor? Could you also explain to me why 
              Lcea is such a puss? Why not make her on par with Seru or the Emperor 
              so we have another option or make her trigger Katta's awakening/resurrection 
              and have him awake with knowledge from the afterlife about the celestial 
              power source?</p>
            <p>As it stands right now you have an extremely aged server population 
              all fighting to get to Vex Thal. On CT, which is one of the original 
              launch servers, we have 3 alliances who have all killed AoW/Tunare 
              with a 4th coming up pretty quickly. All are quite capable and all 
              of us realize that the road to Vex Thal runs through Ssra. Before 
              Tritons Emperor slaying you would find maybe 60 people in zone when 
              a raid on the Arch Lich or High priest was in progress and maybe 
              20 people when there wasnt. Now the zone AVERAGES 110 people in 
              zone all fighting over RANDOM SPAWNS. WTF!</p>
            <p>Not only did you turn the zone into Sebilis 2.0 you made it impossible 
              to establish any order since the spawns we are sitting there waiting 
              on for 1-5 hours can spawn anywhere. As soon as trackers pickup 
              a Commander, 50 people are rioting and stumbling over each other 
              to make it dead. Add to that this bullshit new &quot;We dont want 
              to deal with spawn disputes&quot; attitude from our quite lacking 
              server GM's who would rather run mini best of the best tournaments 
              than do anything else and you are just asking for alot of pissed 
              off customers ready to tear each others throats out. I dont blame 
              my competition for trying to monopolize the bottlenecked spawns 
              to Vex Thal. I understand they want whats best for their people 
              just like I want whats best for mine. I blame Verant for forcing 
              us into the situation with poor planning. </p>
            <p>The 3rd floor and basement portions of the Emperor key quest are 
              fine due to their decent drop rates. The Commander portion of the 
              key quest needs some serious help. Here are my suggestions to give 
              people more options in Luclin, I'll even give you a couple different 
              options to fix it. ;&gt;</p>
            <p>1) Use the Seru faction. Fix Seru's sword so that it summons power 
              sources the same way the Emperor's sceptre does. If you insist on 
              leaving his sword in its present broken state include a SMALL NON 
              TIMESINK quest to extract the power sources from it. Charge his 
              key quest to either require the reports portion to be done to get 
              a 100 charge key or better yet unlimited charge key. That quest 
              sucks so many hours out of our playtime I think you could justify 
              it. If you want to leave it so we can get the key by only killing 
              the minibosses make them not SUCK ASS. Yeah its real fun to kill 
              those mini's, I think I'd rather shoot lead directly into my blood 
              stream. While you're at it FIX THE DAMN PATHING AND WARPING.</p>
            <p>2) Use the Katta faction. Buff up Lcea to Seru or Emperor level, 
              RE-ITEMIZE her loot table and have her glean knowledge of the power 
              source through some contact with the now dead/in stasis Katta. OPTIONALLY 
              allow her to ressurrect/awaken Katta so we can fight him instead 
              and have him drop an item that summons power sources. Make him on 
              par with the Emperor or Seru and add Katta banes if you want or 
              make him harder and dont add banes it doesnt matter.</p>
            <p>3) Ok, ok I know you're lazy and dont want to put all that work 
              into the game that you are now charging us even more for even though 
              we're getting less support than ever before. That and I understand 
              you are far too busy working on PoP to fix the bugs and completely 
              unfun content in Luclin. Here's a suggestion for you though. Instead 
              of raising prices to keep your profit margain well ahead of your 
              costs, how about make your game better and attract new business? 
              Its real nice of you to tax your loyal customers that have stuck 
              with you through all the other games that have come out in EQ's 
              lifecycle. Here's another suggestion. How about kick back PoP, take 
              those developers and add them to the 'seperate crew' working on 
              Luclin and get shit fixed THAT MUCH FASTER! Hell you could get the 
              heal bug fixed in 2 weeks instead of a month and a half maybe. Anyway 
              back to the point.</p>
            <p>You're lazy. Fine, make some minor changes to the Emperor key quest 
              and move the bottle neck for Vex Thal somewhere else. Increase the 
              spawn rate of the commanders to be on par with the 3rd floor or 
              basement portions of the quest. Lets be frank. Your precious Emperors 
              cherry has been popped so you can quit worrying about delaying us 
              from killing him. It obviously didnt work and the whole key quest 
              within a keyquest is pretty lame anyway. Trust me the Emperor isnt 
              just going to keel over and die to 20% of your subscriber base even 
              if anyone could just walk up to him. Its going to take the best 
              of the best to make him dead so lets just make him easier to get 
              to and this whole ugly situation will go away and be replaced by 
              nice happy rotations. If you really want to be asses, and I know 
              you do because you like timesink mezzed customers, make the shards 
              more difficult to obtain. THAT DOES NOT MEAN MAKE THEM MORE RARE. 
              Instead make it take more tactics, smarts, organization, whatever 
              to gather them instead of just randomly dropping off of Joe Q. Mob.</p>
            <p>I know what you're thinking. You're thinking we cant possibly understand 
              why you must design things the way you do. We cant possibly understand 
              the business ramifications or difficulty in coding things the way 
              I've suggested. You'd be surprised just how much we do understand. 
              We're not stupid people just because we have 200+ played days in 
              your game. The sad thing is everyone else probably understands it 
              as well and someone, somewhere, is going to make a game that includes 
              what we want and EQ is going to go the way of AO, AC, DAoC and all 
              the other failed or failing MMORPGs. Hope you enjoy rubbing elbows 
              with M59 in the not too distant future. Remember that game? Me neither......</p>
            <p>I just gave you 3 options to fix Luclin and make it better than 
              it currently is. I just gave you 3 options to retain customers and 
              maybe even attract new ones or lure back retired ones. Its your 
              choice to take them or not and Im sure you wont but maybe, just 
              maybe, the kinder gentler Verant will consider them since 'the Vision' 
              seems to have left with changing of the guard. </p>
            <p>Oh and while I have you listening. FIX the bane/mitigation bullshit. 
              Is it really necessary to force us to farm and waste time on your 
              lame tradeskills just to have our melees gimped worse than us casters 
              were in Kunark? I wouldnt wish that on anyone and let me tell you 
              what, while I really enjoy the changes you are making to casters 
              I wouldnt trade it for an inversely gimped melee crew in a million 
              years. Bane weapons are a cool idea. I like not being able to damage 
              a mob unless we have special weapons but once we get those weapons 
              we shouldnt be reduced to 10dps. They are called BANES for a reason, 
              look up the definition in your local dictionary. Let the banes be 
              the only way for melees to hit the mob but let them hit for regular 
              damage or *gasp* even more damage and increase the mobs HP or regen 
              accordingly if you want a longer fight. Let EVERYONE feel like they 
              are making a real contribution on these epic fights not just the 
              select few. As it stands right now people are just going to bypass 
              your timesink because its lame. Im sure some guild with an army 
              of nukers is marching on these ubers right now. Oh and make bane 
              arrows please so our rangers who have put in the hours to get AM3 
              dont see it wasted on the ubers.</p>
            <p>Anyway, enough rant, Im wasting my breath.</p>
