			<p><strong><img src="crystals.jpg" width="614" height="203"></strong></p>
			<p> Imagine yourself in a place in Norrath where high fantasy rules.  As you
			  explore a new land, lured there by the promise of adventure by
			  the mysterious Priests of Discord, you encounter strange creatures:
			  grotesque, beautiful,
			  frightening,
			  and absurd – but in the mythical tradition of dragons, demons and magic
			  wielders. </p>
			<p><img src="girplan.jpg" width="349" height="311"></p>
			<p>They live in colorful caverns filled with bright blue
			      crystals and sweeping orange staircases,
			      leading to strange arcane lizard creatures worshiping huge
			  pillars of energy that erupt in crackling bursts of orange, reaching
			    high above them into the
	      darkness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </p>

			<p>Welcome to the Omens of War expansion. </p>
			<p>Have the art and design team surpassed themselves again? Yes,
			  in the Omens of
			  War expansion they have. I truly enjoy taking press tours of expansions

			  I get to see the vision that the artists and the designers imagined
			  and then created in the newest EQ zones (without worrying about
			  dying, even
			  though
			  I did die when Brenlo said, “go ahead and attack something!” This is fun….
		  Uh oh, here                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ’s
		  more ...gaah… Loading, please wait…). Despite
		  experiencing the good and bad of EQ all at once, my overall impression
		  was that this expansion again pushes the envelope of design, graphics,
		  technology,
			    and creativity
			    for EQ players to explore, as well as adding new design and adventure
			    elements for all kinds of players: hard core, casual and anything
		    in between. </p>
			<p>The guild summit opened a line of communication between
			  the players and the designers that has changed the game forever.
			  As a result of the guild summit
			  and player
			  feedback, the designers went back and retooled the Omens expansion
			  to reflect	the desires of the player base. No more aliens – this is a fantasy
			  realm. The expansion’s elements reflect what players told the designers
			  were the most important in a playable game. And with the addition
			  of realistic elements
			   as a result of improving graphics technology, the game comes more
			  alive than it ever has before. An amazing realistic addition is
			  shadows
			  that move with
			   characters and NPCs, reflecting light sources that change with
			  the environment, and in the case of the sun, with the time of day.</p>
			<p><img src="myshadow.jpg" width="419" height="362"> </p>
			<p>Characters live in the
			     environment now, not just inhabit it as cardboard figures. The
			    shadow
			    effects will carry over into the old world zones as well, adding
			    a realistic dimension
			     the familiar lands have never had in the past. There are new
			  water effects again reflecting the sophistication of the tools the artists
			    have to work
			     with. The Omens NPCs show off the new detailed modeling employed
			    by the artists and animators, who stretched skin tighter, showing
			    more detail, and implemented
			     more realistic animations. This is a imagined world with depth
			    and character brought to life by the artists and designers. The
			    skies change with the weather. The day turns to night, the sun
			    sets and stars come out. The vicious mobs really do look nasty
			  and the elegant
			    ones are impressive. The flames really crackle, the bats fly
			  erratically like they should,
			    and the bad guys run just as fast as always, but look better
			  doing it.</p>
			<p><img src="pyrilen.jpg" width="470" height="461"></p>			<p>Are there experiences for the casual player?
			  Yes. The task system, which will start in the old world and carry
			  over to Omens, will give any
			  player something
			   to do for 30-90 minutes. Even better, there is no time limit on
			  the task system, so you can start a task and then go on to do something
			  else and come
			   back to it (although you can only do one task at a time). The
			  task system starts at level 5 and goes all the way up to 70, so
			  anyone can participate. If you are a casual player, there is something
			  for you to do when
			  you log
			   on for 30 minutes. If you are a serious player but are waiting
			  for a group, there is something for you to do for 30 minutes while
			  you wait. And	if you
			   are a role player, you have an opportunity to use the task system
			  as part of role playing adventures.</p>
			<p><img src="bridge.jpg" width="585" height="289"></p>
			<p>There is only one flagged zone in Omens (Anguish), so for the majority
			  of the expansion players can go anywhere to solo, find pickup groups, or
			  do guild events. There are new epic weapons to achieve. There are
			  involved quests to go on. There is good gear to be won. There are
			  new spells to get. You can work on
			   more alternative advancement skills. You can get to level 70.
			   And from the looks of the zones I visited, which included Dranek’s Scar,
			   Riftseeker’s
			   Sanctum, and Harbringer’s Spire, there are plenty of boss mobs and difficult
			   areas to test a guild’s skill.   The spire with worshipping dragon-like
			   monsters around it, the room with many mobs where I managed to
			   die a graceful death under about 10 monsters, and other areas
			   appear to be both
			   a challenge and
			   an enjoyable place to fight (I didn’t last long enough to really experience
			   the fighting part, but I think it would be fun if the mage wasn’t trying
			   to be a solo tank). The scenery certainly wasn’t boring!  The colors are
			   bright, the designs of the natural features are complex, and the
		   architecture is sophisticated in the zones I visited.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </p>
			<p align="left">People have
			   been asking about instanced zones, and there are some in the expansion,
			   but no solo instances. The reason for not including them in this
			   expansion,
			   Brenlo explained, was that when you go in a solo instanced zone,
			   you are cut off from all social interaction, and that is not what
			   they are aiming
			   for in the overall game design. EQ is a social game by its very
			   nature of being online. They are hoping the task system will fill
			   in the gap for people
			   who like to solo and want finite things to do for limited game
			   time, or just something to do by themselves to get experience
			   and items.</p>
			<p align="left"><em>When we started an instanced zone in the expansion, this box
			  came up:</em></p>
			<p align="left"><img src="instance.jpg" width="497" height="581"></p>			<p>The testing, too, has come a long way since Gates.  Brenlo assured me this
			  testing plan has been more solid, as they invited whole guilds from various
			   servers
			   to test content and didn’t try to introduce a new graphics engine in the
			   middle of the beta test, which is one of the problems Gates experienced.
			   They are trying to make this expansion as bug free as they can
			   make it before it’s released.</p>
			<p>And when will that be?  September 14, I am told, just around the corner!
			  You will enter the expansion zones through a Priest of Discord (remember
			   him?) because the Priests of Discord are creating portals in major
			   cities to create
			   chaos and discord in this new world by porting Norrathians over
			   to disrupt it. (Finally, the priests have a role in the story
			   instead of just being
			   fun to dress in hand me down robes, anyone remember that?) To
			   find out more of the story, you will have to check the story pages
			   in the game and learn
			   for yourselves what the history is of this strange new land. The
			   Wayfarers story line is coming to a close and a new one is starting ….
			   Omens of War.</p>
			<p><img src="icecastle.jpg" width="613" height="396"></p>
			<p>I will be visiting Omens again next week with the promise of a glimpse
			  at the new Epics and the flagged zone. More to come!
