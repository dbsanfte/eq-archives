                and Talendor for the 1st time and a would have killed Gore, if

              <blockquote>On the June 9th we went in and raided the Crystal Caverns 
                and basically walked through the place :) It took our guide Cazbain 
                a little while to find the Dwarf town, but hey, he got us there 
                eventually. Then we were on to the Queens lair. When we got there 
                the queen was spawned, so with some legendary pulling from Larlador 
                we managed to get her back to the entry hallway alone, and we 
                took her down :) Congrats go to Kilrason who we gave the Crystalline 
                Robe to, because no self respecting member of our guild should 
                still be wearing an Advisor at 51! ;) Unfortunately we only saw 
                the queen that once. <br>
                <br>
                I am happy to announce that Larlador has accepted the position 
                of Director of Events for our guild. This position requires an 
                immense amount of work and organization, and Larlador has already 
                proven himself in these areas. Additionally, he has the respect 
                of all of the guild members with his willingness to selflessly 
                help whenever there is need. I look forward to working with Larlador 
                more closely as we step up our event schedule in the upcoming 
                weeks.<br>
                <br>
                It is both a privilege and an honour for me to announce that on 
                June the 16th, 2001, at 1pmEST, in the arena zone off of Lake 
                Rathe, our guild will enter into its first alliance with the Norrath 
                Militia. Many, many people in our guild have expressed a great 
                respect for NM, its members, and its abilities. It seems to me 
                that we already know a great many of them. On the 16th we will 
                make it official. Please come out and show your support for this 
                alliance.</blockquote>
              <a href="http://crimsontalon.gleinig.com/"><b>Crimson Talon</b></a> 
              <blockquote>Agreement with Bloods Guard to rotate on Vox spawns. 
                They took Vox Thu Jun 7, and Brewall's open raid will hit her 
                on Sat Jun 16. From there, it will alternate between the BG closed 
                raids & CT open raids. In the event of a patch, the guild with 
                next spawn has 2 days to kill her, otherwise, that spawn is FFA 
                and the rotation resumes as normal upon her death. Both raid leaders 
                will share information regarding time of death & warn of any respawn. 
                Goal for both raids is to maximize kills. BG will also not be 
                killing Naggy Wed/Thu next week leaving it open. Ixnus of Jedi 
                Praxum is leading this raid (sign up on Everquestraids) and Brewall 
                will assist Ixnus in any way possible (but is not leading raid 
                nor is raid using Brewall's raid points). An organized dragon 
                schedule is a lot more preferable than a FFA system that can lead 
                to a lot of fighting and one-upmanship by guilds & players. CT 
                is made up of ex-big guild players seeking to avoid this type 
                of play style, hence our NGB, open loots, and public disclosure. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Night not a complete loss, since raid cancelled early in evening 
                and a few different epic mobs were slain for enchanter (Grats 
                to Greymask for finishing 1st part of enchanter epic) and monk 
                epic quests. <br>
                <br>
                Descended upon CoM and slayed final mobs needed for Khallin to 
                complete epic quest for his Spear of Fate. Congrats Khallin! A 
                Atramentous Shield (ac28 int5 sta5 str5 hp50 mana50 cr5 fr5 mr10 
                Deadeye/ shd) also dropped [won by Lsoth from AoF]. <br>
                <br>
                Went over to Lavastorm to do battle with Eejag for monk epic pieces. 
                First time, many of us had ever intentionally jumped into lava 
                - don't try this in real life. Battle was interesting, but incredibly 
                hard to see. Can definitely kill him with melee approach. <br>
                <br>
                In the morning, killed Venril and got stone [Tomwin] and other 
                items. In the afternoon, raided City of Mist. Unannounced in-law 
                visits ruined my Sun raiding times. Don't have details on raid 
                results.</blockquote>

              <blockquote>While I was napping on Thursday (yeah, I do that a lot 
                now :p) DA and our friends keeled Klandicar. As I said, I was 
                napping...so no picture. Aliudyen received the talisman, so our 
                fearless leader will be forging DA's path into Sleeper's Tomb.<br>

                ToV was a bit crowded on Friday night, soooo we keeled some dragons.

                that snappy dresser Sanglant one day, so we felt we had to exact 
                revenge on Sanglant's behalf. And we did. Since I botched the 
                first pull and ended up with Karkona and Cargalia on my ass all 
                the way to DN (where I gracefully died with my little dragon train 
                in tow), we killed <a href="http://www.neoweb.net/brad/da/images/karkona060801.jpg">Karkona</a> 
                too since she decided that Esorpa was worthy of assistance.<br>
                <br>
                Had we known these guys were such poosaes, we would have killed 
                them both at the same time. And, Karkona posed well for a picture, 
                so its all good. Loot wasn't impressive, but we had fun.<br>
                <br>
                Saturday was spent pharming the testing halls, and we'll be there 
                again today. See you there, and may the lewts be phat.<br>
                <br>
                Your favorite webmistress has returned from the depths of Der 
                Fatherland. Rejoice, dance, and be happy (come on, I know ya want 
                to). The trip was great, but it's good to be home, and to be using 
                a keyboard that doesn't contain any f*%king umlauts. <br>
                <br>
                In my absence, I heard we killed some stuff. Some of that stuff 
                may or may not include a few Cazic-Thules, a poosae green lizard 
                who lives in Sebilis, a poosae floating lizard who lives in Karnors, 
                and some silly cannibalistic dragon who calls Dragon Necropolis 
                home (a first for the DA/EL/SS alliance, I might add). Not many 
                people have the same love of the screen shot key that I do, so 
                I highly doubt that we'll be seeing any pictures of our recent 
                exploits. Grats to all my guildies who got phat lewt without me, 
                and grats to our allies on all their new goodies as well!<br>
                <br>
                DA and friends spent some time pillaging the halls of testing 
                last night--the named drakes have gone to drake heaven, and Kalorn 
                is the proud owner of some boots and greaves of the myrmidon. 
                Bryony will soon have some new drood booties, and of course, the 
                night was not complete until we got our uber rare chain bracer 
                (grats to Kerlen on that piece). No pictures, blame jet lag, and 
                of course, umlauts. Umlauts are to blame. Down with umlauts!<br>
                <br>
                Before I go, I'd like to take a brief moment to welcome that cheap 
                slut known as Jandra back to the family. Good to have you back,

                <br>
                Eod and Relentless decided to go to VP and lay down the smack.

                After we downed Zlan, we decided that why should we walk from

                up, and we air assaulted from Dragon Necropolis to Wakening Lands 
                and dropped Woushi in I believe under 1 minute (I hate walking). 
                Loot was 2 scims, 2 scales, 1 shield, 3 spells. <br>
                <br>
                Downed Zlandicar to get another sleeper key. 2 cowls, Frak tailsmen(rotted),

                out the Dain. It was a total owning despite gimps handing him 
                weapons. Starting to think people don't like us. Grats Laan on 
                his belt of dwarf slaying and Athren on a dain crown. Next up 
                was Yelinak. The beast dropped despite poor showing by the warrior 
                crew. Grats to Gaef on his gloves and Mintern on his Sleeper's 
                Keys. Rest of drops were a bunch of gay weapons. Vindicator was 
                the fourth target since the day was early. Grats Lovern on boots.

                charter that revolves around the exploration of zones, not sitting 
                in static camps - we certainly fulfilled that this week. We crawled 
                through numerous zones, from old standby's like Skyshrine and 
                Howling Stones to Dragon Necropolis to Velks Lab. We did manage 
                to hit Hate and Air successfully this past week and hope to get 
                to Fear and Growth within the next week or two.<br>
                <br>
                We've added more members, and have promoted 3 members from probationary 
                status to full membership. Our guild bank is starting to look

                for primary characters instead of having to sit in boring camps.<br>

                However, we didn't miss a drop of experience this week either, 
                we had 11 members level and with the sole exception of our guild 
                leader, almost everyone showed good progress in the relentless 
                pursuit of the elusive level 60. With a commitment to excellence 
                - we have decided to relax our recruitment policy. While to be 
                considered for full membership in the guild you must still be 
                55, we will consider select applications from those who can demonstrate 
                excellent in their play and have the ability to make good progress 
                toward level 55.<br>
                <br>
                Now that our membership is starting to stabilize and we are getting 
                solid in our raiding parties - we are looking forward to moving 
                onto some of the Kunark dragons this coming week. As always -

                guest of VG. BG buffed everyone and we went in and killed her. 
                BG was very generous with the loot. They kept the pally book and
