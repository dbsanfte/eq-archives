              Congrats to Blood Guards and ourselves on some really cool stuff 
              lately. Walked the gnome and got a load of folks flagged, killed 
              zlandi, killed Statue of Rallos Zek and got AoW to about 39%. We'll 
              get him next time now that we've learned a little better what to 
              expect. We've also killed trak, IV, doom, and have been camping 
              VT shards recently...killed in Ssra mines last night and I'm hoping 
              some shards dropped for folks. 
            <p> </p>
            <p>Congrats to recent additions to our family and welcome to new applicants.<br>

              So, good job on the latest killings of Klandicar, some sleepers 
              mobs, Trak, and Velks. Also welcome to our new applicants Spellena,

            <p>Helped Windsensai with the 8th shawl and we successfully protected 
              the dwarf once again. Grats for finishing this difficult quest!</p>
            <p>After that, we flawlessly killed a big mob, but no details due

              Veeshan Peak killing. Returned again to VP to liberate some loot 
              from the residents. We weren't disapointed:<br>
              Hoshkar: Green Scale [Dakatsu], Feverblade [Kuriosity]<br>
              Silver: Scimitar of Life Stealing, Robe of Smothering [Hattrick],

              Phar: Robe of the Azure Sky [Fenik], Shroud of Veeshan [Barelil], 
              Shield of Elders [Aorthin], Sword of Rile, Hierophant Cloak passdown 
              [Fluteria]</p>
            <p>April 08, 2003<br>
              Kill Grieg this evening due to the emergency patch. Flawless execution 
              and kill. The new adaption to help prevent the human form poofing 
              seemed to work.</p>
            <p>April 07, 2003<br>
              Attempted Grieg with a minimal crew and our strategy that we worked 
              hard to develop. We killed him flawlessly with no deaths. Just prior 
              to killing him, we pushed him out from the wall so the human form 
              would not appear in the wall. The plan worked perfectly, except 
              that the human form appeared and then vanished on us within a second. 
              It is very annoying to succeed, only to have a bugged script cause 
              the NPC to poof on us. We already have a strategy to hopefully prevent 
              this the next time.</p>
            <p>April 04, 2003<br>
              Playing around in the Plane of Mischief, watching the puppet show 
              and touring the zone. Have killed virtually everything and a few 
              people are close to finishing some of the basic quests. Loot drops 
              are fairly rare and there is a very long respawn rate. Still, many 
              of us are excited to see a zone that so few people see.</p>
            <p>April 03, 2003<br>
              NToV is cleared! Tonight, we finished clearing the remaining dragons 
              for our rotation. This was an exciting time for many of us to finish 
              this area of the zone. Drops were:<br>
              Jorlleag: ?<br>
              Nevederia: Nevederia's Horn [Maxist CT], Nevederia's Claw [Alone 
              CT] (both were likely to rot)<br>
              Lord Vyemm: Vyemm's Left Eye [Gargamesh OC], Gaudralek, Sword of 
              the Sky [Stien CT]<br>
              Koi: ?</p>
            <p>Grats to all winners, and we are all looking forward to our next 
              rotation slot! We are also working out plans to attempt Vulak himself.</p>
            <p>After NToV, about 3 groups decided to pay a visit to the Plane 
              of Mischief. We explored quite a bit of the zone and marveled at 
              all the special features and rooms (Alice in Wonderland area, the 
              Chess set, the Puppet Show, and more). The zone is pretty wild and 
              it looks like a lot of work went into this. A few of us plan on 
              staying for a couple days just to play around.</p>
            <p>April 02, 2003<br>
              The Cazic-Thule server has always been quite cooperative with rotation 
              agreements because they save everyone an enormous amount of time. 
              Tonight, due to a guild going rogue in NToV, per rotation rule #11, 
              we alerted all other NToV rotation guilds of this transgression. 
              Rule 11 states:</p>
            <p><i>11) Should a &quot;rogue&quot; guild decide to try and interfere 
              with the set rotation, instead of attempting to cooperate with it, 
              there need to be a means set in place to stop them from doing so. 
              In such a case, all guilds/allies in the rotation will be asked 
              to come and fight for NToV as one large alliance, to force that 
              rogue guild to compete with 200+ people, hopefully forcing that 
              rogue guild into cooperation.</i></p>
            <p>Within 15 minutes, over 250 people from the rotation guilds of 
              Crimson Talon, Obsidian Coven, Exhumed, The Dragon Alliance, Legacy 
              of Darkness, Second Age, Blood Guards, and Council of Grey were 
              in the zone! After discussions with the GM's, the rotation agreement 
              and enforcement stands. A special thanks to all the other guilds

            <p><a href="http://defenderskerraridge.tripod.com/dokr/index.html"><b>Defenders 
              of Kerra Ridge</b></a></p>
            <p>The Coven gathered in the icy hallway and prepared for its first 
              joint take down. Legion of Nox, Children of Tunare, Loyal Defenders, 
              and Kerra Ridge had sent forth many a mighty ambassador to accomplish 
              this task. Vindicator merely chuckled at the news of this upstart 
              force lurking at his front door.<br>
              <br>
              The Coven advanced at a lighting pace blowing through any giant 
              or foe that opposed them and quickly had cleared the area that would 
              become Vindi's last stand. New to this type of battle many of the 
              Coven members fretted nervously as they checked blades, mumbled 
              incantations and readied prayers and spell books. 2 times the Coven 
              faultered but still they persisted finally, Natazuul lured the lumbering 
              giant to his final resting place perfectly as Sarine, his fellow 
              monk looked on in admiration. Waiting in the shadows, Shirmar grinned 
              evily and began his onslaught, shouting out Vah Shir battle cries 
              that drew the remainder of our forces into the fray. With such mighty 
              blows from the arms of Shaylah, Drizo, Zbar, and many others, Vindi 
              began to wither.<br>
              <br>
              The first cleric to drop was Andorean, exhausted from the constant 
              healing, she collapsed into a meditative state. Darwinn and Ziam 
              were quickly succombing to the constant drain as well. This gave 
              Vindi renewed strength and he punished Shirmar brutally. Under this 
              enraged attack Shirmar finally collapsed. Januse quickly took his 
              place and fended off Vindicators wraith until he too was beaten 
              unconsious. Vindicator shouted wildly as the Coven called forth 
              all of its combined might. The air crackled and exploded as fire, 
              ice, and lighting filled the small area surrounding Vindi. As soon 
              as the knee of Januse bent, Katslayler jumped in calling forth the 
              power of Rallos Zek to protect him. He held the vengeful fury of 
              Vindi for as long as he could then he too stumbled and fell.<br>
              <br>
              But just as Vindicator thought he had achieved victory, the full 
              fury of the wizard Mortalist, the mage Ithaka, the druid powers 
              of Kaldek and Fairsong, and the combined host struck witih a mighty 
              thunderous boom. Vindicator teetered for a second reeling from this 
              blow as Celois's pet gave him one final shove to topple this mighty 
              Giant Chieftan.<br>
              <br>
              Shirmar claimed the fallen giants breast plate as Kaldek cleaved 
              the head of this beast as a trophy. Sporting the rewards of their 
              spoils the Coven then left the city of giants to pursue more loots 
              and trophies in Fear but that is another tale to be told. <br>
              <br>
              Recent Epic accomplishments of note, Kithov is now the proud owner 
              of the necro epic. Natazuul recently achieved epic status. Yaldain 
              has also finished up her cleric epic.<br>
              <br>
              Congrats to Jonzer,Swadi, Andorean, Kalander, Xmortis, and Drizo 
              on finishing up their Lodizial Shell quests after stalking this 
              turle down on a number of occasions.<br>

              WOOOOTTTT Emperor down! Very nice work nomads - we can be proud 
              of this! The fight against Blood just took a couple of minutes and 
              then Emperor spawned. We had good control of the 8 other mobs during 
              the fight, even though one of them was loose at one point. During 
              the main fight we had several changes of MA and the CH chain did 
              impressive work. He died after more than 20 minutes of fighting. 
              During the week raiding has been very crazy as well. Saturday Vindi, 
              Statue, Idol, AoW, Arch Lich, Burrower Beast and CT himself went 
              down. Terris Thule and Ssra has been biting the dust on the other 
              days. We have raided every day of the week!<br>
              <br>

              First attempt on emperor went quite well. Good add control and mezzing 
              and we killed Blood. Only flaw was that the emperor himself did 
              not want to die ... but next time! :)</p>

              Decided to try a couple of new mobs. Together with VA we went to 
              The Deep and killed Burrower Beast and Thought Horror Overfiend. 
              Those two can expect to meet our blades and magics again in the

              I'm sure everyone has had a poor experience in this game at one 
              point or another. It could have been your own fault, but more likely 
              it was due to circumstances beyond your control. These circumstances 
              are called bugs.</p>
            <p>The Everquest CS group catches a lot of flack day in and day out 
              about their effectivness, or usually the lack thereof.</p>
            <p>Tonight we encounted not one, but two, of these circumstances. 
              Poor pathing and mapping lead to a corpse that was out of reach, 
              while a kink in a script kept us from talking to certain NPC's. 
            </p>
            <p>This is usually the part in the story where I am supposed to shout 
              in outrage about the lack of support from the makers of the game. 
              How we had to sit with our thumbs up our butts and wait for ages 
              until a guide told us our petition had been forwarded. </p>
            <p>But that is not the type of story I have to tell tonight. This 
              story involves a GM who did all in his power to help us not once, 
              but twice. One who was willing to attempt whatever was in his power 
              to fix what was broken. Most of all, one who responded swiftly and 
              in good humor, willing and eager to help.</p>

              Anuhadu, we salute you for your hard work and dedication to the

            <p>News: Note to SOE about the PoE B Key <br>

            <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
              So apparently you decided to change the PoE B ring to only give 
              out 6 to 18 keys per successful key attempt?</p>
            <p>Do you think this lame maneuver to extend the time it takes guilds 
              to get into Plane of Time will do anything other than alienate 90% 
              of the uber guilds out there from this game? </p>
            <p>This is the most asinine change to your game ever. The key event 
              doesn't even work half of the time or ring events don't work. You 
              can even blow ring events just by exp&#146;ing in the zone.</p>
            <p>WTF were you thinking SOE? Change the PoE B key back like it was, 
              this is a very bad idea to keep it at most 18 (sometimes only 6, 
              it has already happened) keys per successful PoEB event completion. 
              This makes the lame ass time sink known as the entire SOL expansion 
              seem like child&#146;s play.</p>
            <p>What happened to the &#147;no more timesinks&#148; mantra you fed 
              us at the beginning of PoP? </p>
            <p>Think long and hard about keeping this change SOE. Do the right 
              thing for the players not your lame ass projections that are worried 
              people will quit once they hit Time. </p>
            <p>Have we quit in the past farming the end game zone? No.</p>

              Last night was an awesome night. Dedication and perserverence really 
              showed in all aspects of our play. Xegony 2.0 is a tough encounter 
              to say the least, but after a few days of runs it is apparent that 
              she is going down soon.</p>
            <p>Best run last night put her at 54%. While that may not sound too 
              impressive, those of you who have completed or participated in the 
              encounter know just how much it takes to do that. A little bad luck 
              ended the night, but it did not end our determination.</p>
            <p>Thanks to all for the hard work that we have put in to this point, 
              and to those who have kept us on track. We will soon reap the benefits

              Ok, yah...I know what yer thinking...it's the silly bird, so what? 
              Well, it was a really fun fight! And that's what we've been up to, 
              boys and girls....lots of really fun fights!</p>
            <p>We've been up to our eyeballs the past couple weeks getting ourselves 
              locked in on how to tackle these fights in the elemental planes. 
              There have been a couple bad nights, but each time we hit a snag, 
              we look at how we tackled it and come back the next time stronger 
              and better. Take silly ass bird boy up top. First time I saw him 
              was a fight that still makes me giggle a little....but like 'ol 
              Nietzche said, &quot;That which doesn't kill you makes the abyss 
              look into you&quot; or somethin like that. So the result is we take 
              that knowledge, whack the bird then, whack him a few more times, 
              and that brings us to the point now where we have turned him into 
              a &quot;raid limbo&quot; competition.</p>
            <p>This week we also took our second shot at this nancy-boy...</p>
            <p><img src="Fenin5FS.jpg" width="520" height="332"></p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>As you can tell by my lack of declaring him dead, we didn't win. 
              However, after some re-arrangement of how we handled the fight for 
              our last shot at him, we hit paydirt. Fenin is absolutely a tough 
              boy to drop, and we were all a bit sad that our final try landed 
              just short.....but we'll be back, he'll be dead and we'll have overcome 
              like always.</p>
            <p>Now before I sign off....just a quick reminder. Like Pirotess posted, 
              we have a few spots available for highly qualified, skilled, and 
              motivated individuals. If you think you have what it takes, you 
              should contact our recruiting officer to discuss the matter. However, 
              when things get really tough, if your first inclination is to ask 
              for help....this isn't the place for you. On the other hand, if 
              your response is to look at what yer doin and how yer playin and 
              figure out how to improve your game plan and overcome....you just 
              might have a spot here.</p>
