                </b></a>Patch - Kael ... Friday, January 11, 2002<br>
                Posted by: Aldarys </p>
              <p>We were a bit lazy this patch and only cleared Kael Drakkal a 
                bit. That way we could get some sleep back! 8)</p>
              <p>The usual start of a Kael event was King Tormax. Since he had 
                shown how worthless he is, we didn't give him any chance this 
                time. After wiping the floor with him, we went on the arena to 
                continue our assassination of the head giants in Kael.</p>
              <p>Their temple leader Derakor the Vindicator met our Inquisitors 
                and found out that we have the better arguments. The discussion 
                was ended by the sudden death of the giant.<br>
                Since we already were in the arena, we could take out The Statue 
                of Rallos Zek too. We played around with it a bit, but in the 
                end it was another victim of our holy inquisition.</p>

                Patch - ToV, this time without clowns... ... Thursday, January 
                10, 2002<br>
                Posted by: Aldarys </p>
              <p>Thanks to the sudden patch it was our turn in the Temple of Love 
                again. We cut through the entrance mobs, Ikatiar the Venom and 
                Eashen of the Sky, short after our cothings were done.</p>
              <p>Same procedure as every ToV clearing followed then - we got ready 
                for Aaryonar. He was killed by our 35 men force easily but hit 
                us out of the grave by giving us pretty bad loot. After clearing 
                some of the drakes then, we could pull THE DAEMON aka Lord Feshlak. 
                The only evil thing on him was, that we could easily kill him.</p>
              <p>We took down some more drakes then and attacked the wurm boss 
                Dagarn the Destroyer. Not much to add to him...pull...fight...kill...loot. 
                Next and last dragon on the right side of the pit was Lord Kreizenn 
                then. The naggy clone was no problem either.</p>
              <p>We started with the backspawn dragons then, as usual with Jorlleag, 
                followed by Lady Nevederia. Those fights were smooth and we had 
                no problems at all. We started to pull from the gay trio then. 
                First guest was Zlexac. We smashed him into pieces and got ready 
                for his two friends, Cenekar and Sevelak.</p>
              <p>While fighting Cenekar an ancient guardian repopped and entered 
                the fight, which is not really a problem, but caused Cenekar to 
                warp around like crazy. The wurm was dead quite fast, but then 
                we got a huge lagspike and Cenekar warped somehow back to his 
                lair. There he was now, summoning one by one of our forces. (I 
                will try to get some screenshots, wasn't able to make some by 
                myself, since I got summoned to him as the first. Could gate with 
                1.5 red bubbles left tho ,,|,, Dragon) Some very funny person 
                screamed 'CHARGE' and like 50% of us charged Cenekar, causing 
                Sevelak to join the fight. We failed since this wasn't really 
                prepared, but had some funny moments. :)<br>
                We ressed up and rebuffed and then owned both of them as revenge.</p>
              <p>Another hard fight was Lady Mirenilla since we managed to get 
                her, her two guards and a Flurry-Drake in our camp. Well, to surrender 
                was no option, so we fought back. It wasn't looking too good for 
                some time, but we could lay waste to the drake and her guards 
                and then focus on the dragon. She was no real opponent after that 
                recovery. Was a challenging fight.</p>
              <p>The kill of Lord Koi'Doken was good to chill out a bit then. 
                After we had our sushi we could prepare for Lord Vyemm. We killed 
                him without adds this time, what made him one of the more boring 
                fights of the evening. Since he was Vulak's last guardian we could 
                finally get ready for the ph@t lewts then. The fight vs Vulak'Aerr 
                was spiced up by the respawning ancient guardian (hey we had that 
                one today already!) and two drake adds. I never saw Vulak walking 
                so much, but in the end we had him stable again and the adds dead. 
                Since the adds were dead, he went down too and we could cheer 
                about another ToV clearage, maybe one of the most interesting 
                ones since we started doing northwing (except the first few fights).</p>
              <p>Vulak'Aerr:<br>
                Brother Xave's Headband ~ Greehma<br>

                Some missing Luclin events... ... Thursday, January 10, 2002<br>
                Posted by: Aldarys </p>
              <p>...will be added here now. They were before the last ToV clearing, 
                so don't think we killed all that stuff yesterday. :)</p>
              <p>We killed The Itraer Vius in Akheva Ruins as serverfirst, and 
                also Grieg Veneficous in Grieg's End. The Thought Horror Overfiend 
                was added to our kill list too, although it wasn't a serverfirst 
                this time.</p>
              <p>The Itraer Vius:<br>
                Vex Vi Vius ~ Damacles<br>
                Crown of Itraer Vius ~ Damacles<br>
                Itraer Insignia ~ Samarea / Deidda</p>

                Patch action... ... Wednesday, January 09, 2002<br>
                Posted by: Aldarys </p>
              <p>...included today a wipeout of Kael Drakkal and also an attack 
                of Akheva Ruins.</p>
              <p>We started with King Tormax and took the giant king down once 
                more. We tried to make it a fight by sacrificing our first two 
                maintanks in the first 10 seconds, but we fizzled that one and 
                killed him with the 3rd. Well Tormax what shall we do? You suck! 
                :(<br>
                As usual on such a day, we moved on to the arena after that and 
                prepared for Derakor the Vindicator. He went down in short notice 
                and we could buff for The Statue of Rallos Zek.<br>
                Statue fight itself then was calm and easy and it went down with 
                no casualties on our side. The Statue fought as well as it\'s 
                loot was then. :/<br>
                Last step of our killing spree that day was The Itraer Vius in 
                the ruins of Akheva then. He put up a bit better fight than our 
                opponents before, but had to fall in the end. Was a nice day! 
                :)</p>
              <p>Loot:</p>
              <p>King Tormax:<br>
                White Dragon Scale Helmet (Head) ~ Minka<br>
                White Dragon Scale Sash ~ Iisbliss<br>

                Shissar Temple ... Tuesday, January 08, 2002<br>
                Posted by: Aldarys </p>
              <p>Darkwind went to Ssrawhatever Temple on last sunday to lay waste 
                to some of the upper class snakes.<br>
                I can proudly announce, that we got two more server firsts that 
                day. First and biggest victory of that day was the defeat of Arch 
                Lich Rhag'Zadune.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>It was our third try ever on it and after we fixed some flaws 
                it was really owned by our finest fighters. This is the 2nd kill 
                of this mob serverwide if I am not mistaken.<br>
                Beeing still enraged from that victory we marched on and payed 
                Xerkish the Creator a visit. We reached out for him and he succumbed 
                to our grip. So this was a very very succesfull day and I want 
                to thank all people who made that possible. Great work!</p>
              <p>Arch Lich Rhag'Zadune:<br>
                Shield of Auras ~ Thalanx</p>
              <p>Xerkish the Creator:<br>
                Shiny Trinket of Speed ~ Fafrd / Aethis</p>

                ToV with troubles... ... Sunday, January 06, 2002<br>
                Posted by: Aldarys </p>
              <p>When we went to the Temple of Veeshan after the last patch. We 
                started with Ikatiar the Venom and Eashen of the Sky. Those were 
                dead within a few moments. The gatekeeper of good old northwing, 
                Aaryonar followed short after. We went on with Lord Koi'Doken 
                then since we tried to be nice to Justice Divine and let them 
                have some mobs too, although we were there first with enough power 
                to kill Aaryonar and open the door, since gimp cothing to the 
                safespot is no longer possible. We killed the fish and not too 
                long after that took out Lady Mirenilla too. We continued clearing 
                and entered the former safespot area to pull Jorlleag and Lady 
                Nevederia. Those were done without any problems, so our pullers 
                prepared to get Zlexac. Paying for all the problems his smaller 
                brother Hoshkar caused once to us, he suffered from our rage and 
                went to hell. Cenekar and Sevelak were two quick pulls after that 
                and the fights didn't take much time. We moved to kill Lord Vyemm 
                then, since we aggreed to let the right side of the ring to Justice 
                Divine. (They were still busy with failing at Feshlak at this 
                time) Vyemm pull and kill went very smooth and I can say that 
                this was one of our easiest Vyemm fights we encountered so far. 
                Next victim had to be Lord Kreizenn then since JD was still busy 
                with Feshlak and wasn't able to kill him in the 4.5 hours we killed 
                the others. So we pulled and wiped the nagafen clone. JD then 
                finally managed to kill poor old Lord Feshlak so we decided to 
                be generous and leave Dagarn the Destroyer up. (he destroyed JD 
                a few times before dieing himself then) We went back into position 
                and got ready for the so called uber mofo Vulak'Aerr. Comparable 
                to the Vyemm fight before this fight went very very smooth and 
                we killed him in like 12 minutes. (thats for those poor souls 
                who are busy parsing our damage per second) So it was a quite 
                sucessfull day, except those minor troubles with bottomfeeders 
                united (thanks Gladstone!). :)</p>

            <p>As you prolly already noticed, Kerafyrm aka The Sleeper was released 
              by Darkwind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Surprise, surprise, no loot, since we couldn't kill him for some 
                reason. =p</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.eqdestiny.com/"><b>Destiny</b></a><br>
                01-13-2002 - prysenius <br>
                Being a later guild we can't get the tons of people on early as 
                many other guilds on the server do so we've often been killing 
                what other people just leave up. It's unfortunate being a late 
                guild on this server but we manage to get by. </p>
              <p>We started off the day with a Dain kill. We had 4 deaths and 
                we executed nearly perfectly. </p>
              <p></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Now notice I said nearly perfectly. Notice where the Dain's corpse 
                is, nice positioning guys! This fight would have been far easier 
                if we didnt beat him into the wall the entire fight. No matter, 
                he still died in the end. </p>
              <p></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Aegis of Ice went to Malazar, Thromguard looted theFrostreaver, 
                Aildarae received Frostreaver's velium crown, and Elegos looted 
                the head to later receive the belt of Dwarf Slaying. </p>
              <p>Now at this point the night was not over. Rumor had it for some 
                reason Klandicar was still up. Always happy to add another sleepers 
                key to our collection we headed to Western Wastes and dropped 
                this chump with ease. We suffered six losses in the fight (with 
                me being one of them!), and I don't believe our main tank died. 
                It's amazing what the strategy of keeping the tank alive can do. 
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Hirao got this sleepers key bringing our total to nine. </p>
              <p>No other fun mobs were up so we called it a night. <br>

                With so much drama in the L.B.C<br>
                So, we really wanted to do the west dragon trio tonight but unfortunately 
                another guild had Telk and Gozz occupied. Not wanting to completely 
                ruin our plans we decided to at least drop Lendi. Now, this was 
                a seriously different type of Keeper fight. We only had 18 people, 
                12 paladins and 6 rangers. We had only FOUR losses the entire 
                fight (frown pallies) but we dropped the Keeper. We decided to 
                call the rest of the guild down so we could at least give the 
                loot, but huge hats off to our hybrid team that only suffered 
                four losses and gave us such a wonderful victory on the first 
                attempt of the night. </p>
              <p></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Keeper has some real nice drops, and this is exactly what ya 
                want to see when ya reach for the corpse. </p>
              <p></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p></p>
              <p>The sleepers key went to Skyshadow. Ring of Omfgwtfisthisringitstoolongtotype 
                went to Sindal, and we received two Gloves of Stability's which 
                went to Kacarrotto and Kubla. </p>
              <p>At this point all west dragons were cleared and North was actually 
                untouched. Having only killed one North wing wyvern ever (with 
                much difficulty I might add) we decided to give our buddy Ikatiar 
                the Venom a shot tonight. Basically, this was our last test before 
                exploring North ToV. Err, nevermind that. Anyhow, we pulled, we 
                owned, we looted. </p>
              <p></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Now, I don't want you seeing my corpse there and thinking that 
                I was one of the only deaths we had at Ikky. That would be simply 
                embarassing. I must explain this pull was pretty sloppy. We got 
                Ikky, some guards, some hatchlings.. you name it - it was there. 
                So yours truly was kiting his two main guards around the top of 
                the rotunda as the guild was killing Ikky. I didn't last long, 
                but lasted long enough for the kill. </p>
              <p></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p></p>
              <p>On our first Ikky kill he coughed up Poison Soaked Tunic which 
                Vixie looted and a pair of Ancient Wyvern Hide Leggings which 
                went to Imran. </p>
              <p>We also got a Dain in there somewhere, and saw our first piece 
                of Dain loot rot! <br>

                A Quote<br>
                &quot; It is not the critic who counts. Not the man who points 
                out how the strong man stumbled or where the doer of deeds could 
                have done better. </p>
              <p>The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose 
                face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; 
                who errs and comes short again and again; who knows the great 
                enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy 
                cause. </p>
              
            <p>Who, at the best, knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, 
              and who at the worst, at least fails while daring greatly, so that 
              his place shall never be with those timid souls who know neither 
              victory nor defeat.&quot; </p>

            <p> With the other two Scales allready aquired in the night, what 
              could fit better to close a night, than to teach Severilous some 
              lessons in battle etiquette and obtain a green Dragon Scale?</p>

            <p> Vision managed to assemble in Sebilis shortly after a prime time 
              patch and dispatched the much beloved poison dragon. Loot included 
              a Donal's Chestplate of Mourning, Singing Steel Breastplate, Undead 
              Dragon Sinew, and 3 Trak Teeth.</p>
