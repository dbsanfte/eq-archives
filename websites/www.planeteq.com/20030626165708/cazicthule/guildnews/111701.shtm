            <p>CC and Talons went to Fear last night, and the god was ours, along 
              with ALL the loot this time! First of course, Draco decided to give 
              up a Grotesque Girdle for CC's Motu and a Crimson Robe of Alendine 
              for Talons, grats! </p>
            <p>Then time for Cazic..after being sure Kegas wasn't hanging around 
              again, Cazic was pushing up the daisies. Grats Taraddar on his Brain 
              of Cazic Thule. Does this make him smarter or more of a smart ass? 
              Only time will tell I suppose. Grats also to Druss on his Cloak 
              of the Fearsome. Matches that dress nicely! Grats Talons on their 
              Pauldrons of Ferocity. As the night went on, we noticed some...changes. 
              Skeletons in ogre and troll racial helms, but.... <br>

            <p>Zlandicar Dead November 16th, 2001<br>
            </p>
            <p>CC and Talons took another Zlandicar kill last night. Grats to 
              Nemisiis on his Frakadar's Talisman, and CC on the Heart and the 
              Gauntlets of Mortality. Grats to Talons on the Sleeper's Key and 
              the Cowl of Mortality.<p>
              Venril Sathir dead Thursday, November 15th, 2001<br>
            </p>
            <p>CC went back to the basics for us and did a late night slaying 
              of Venril Sathir. He ended up in the cubby, but it didn't matter, 
              he died just the same. Grats to Ragathor on his Shaman legs and 
              Kela on her Gnarled Staff for her epic. </p>

              hehe, in a bold move, Trakanon took an attempt to Train the forces 
              of CoG and pr, and thinkin he had won after killin MANY people, 
              made the mistake of summonin Bladestrike, who quickly layed into 
              him and dealt the killing blow..</p>
            <p><br>
              2 days of ToV yeild some good drops..</p>
            <p>Grats to Hewbert and Rutgereos on Chain legs, Skar on shaman bracer, 
              Raflen on ranger boots, Duco on chanter arms, Blade on warrior gaunts,

            <p> THE SLEEPER HAS AWAKNED..check CTC site for pics posted by TR/EoD..or 
              if glif can post some...the Sleeper slaughterd Tr/Eod after he woke,

              mob in zone till he got to Lord Yelnik, who took 3 Dt's before dieng...Sorrow 
              to those that are found by this mighty dragon as he spawns in every 
              dragon zone in game, kills the entire zone, then goes to enxt zone..well 
              see how long he stays up before despawning ehe..GRATS to anyone 
              able to get a pictrue of him before dying!</p>
            <p>Well, mixed gratz to CoG and PR on a solid attempt on Gorenaire. 
              From my understanding we came extremely close to vanquishing the 
              Queen of the Kunark Dragons. With a similar turn out, we shall surely 
              drop her, next time.</p>
            <p>Also, gratz to Nikolette on vanquishing two of her nemeses, the 
              Corrupted Aqua Goblin Shaman, who she found hiding from her UNDER 
              Lake Rathe(talk about filling someone with fear), and that pesky 
              corrupted barracuda, also hiding on the bottom of a lake...Ill Omen

            <p>NOV 15, 2001<br>
              Hate again. Managed to kill Magi, but no magician epic piece. Cleared 
              all the Rev's for the fifth time and still no vampire essense, which 
              is beginning to tick-off the epic-hungry crowd. Still, we were able 
              to get a few gems and a items:<br>
              Shaman: Rune Etched Greaves [Barelil]<br>
              Warrior: Hand of the Maestro [Lisner] 
            <p>NOV 14, 2001<br>
              Vowing to get an epic piece for our enchanters or magicians, we've 
              decided to stay in the accursed plane of Hate before leaving. Gave 
              away a lot of items to other groups in the zone due to duplicates. 
              Hit the second floor again, and aside from junk FS weapons, the 
              loot was very stingy. Among our drops were:<br>
              Cleric: Ethereal Mist Gloves [Skylynn]<br>
              Enchanter: Insidious Gloves [Mysyn]<br>
              Mage: Apothic Gloves [Immolar]</p>
            <p>NOV 13, 2001<br>
              Another night in the Plane of Hate. Started the night with about 
              18 people and eventually headed up to the second floor with just 
              14. We are definitely a guild that is able to kill with finesse 
              instead of zerg-type tactics. Great smart-playing and teamwork by 
              everyone! Cazic-Thule is also a great server in that the various 
              guilds up in Hate last night gave-away unneeded loots instead of 
              letting them rot. Helmets off to everyone. Drops last night:<br>
              Cleric: Ethereal Mist Vambraces [Skylynn, Aorthin]<br>
              Enchanter: Insidious Greaves [Greymask]<br>
              Mage: Apothic Boots [Immolar], Apothic Bracer [Immolar], Apothic 
              Crown [Immolar]<br>
              Rogue: Woven Shadow Greaves [Zoranna]<br>
              Warrior: Culler (2hs 31/37 war rng 4str 4sta 8.9wt) [Maxist] </p>

              Mariokarts grandprix P, what? hell yeah that must be done sometimes 
              as well P). From what i heard we owned the place and we had some 
              nice drops there as well, too bad there wasn't a rogue present or

              to Immortal Spirits as well.</p>
            <p>The weekend of 17 and 18/11: DN, we ventured again into DN, and

              Time: Friday, November 16th, 2001, 5:00 PM EST<br>
              The setting: Sleeper's Tomb.
            <p>We entered the tomb of the Sleeper with one intention: Kill Ventani 
              the Warder in order to release the mighty prismatic dragon Kerafyrm. 
              The offspring of two dragons of different colors, legend has it 
              that Kerafyrm is the most fearsome being to ever walk the face of 
              Norrath. It is rumored that his power is comparable to that of Veeshan 
              herself, the dragon that originally brought life to Norrath and 
              scarred the frozen plains of Western Wastes with her massive claws. 
              The warnings impressed upon us not to venture further, stressing 
              the danger of releasing one as mighty as Kerafyrm. However, we were 
              not so easily fazed. As the sun fell upon the snowfields of the 
              Eastern Wastes, we entered the sacred Tomb and prepared to bring 
              a new age to this world.</p>
            <p>For those of you who have not ventured into the Tomb, it is guarded 
              by an ancient race of golems and gargoyles entrusted with securing 
              the upper regions of the tomb.<br>
              They are commanded by the Master of the Guard and the Progenitor. 
              We, however, bested the guards with ease and dispatched of both 
              the Master of the Guard and the Progenitor. The Final Aribter, a 
              slightly more difficult Golem than MOTG and Prog, stands as a final 
              line of defense before the four seals sealing the Tomb. He fell 
              with ease and we were ready to go.</p>
            <p>The Sleeper is held in place by the powers of four Warders, endgame 
              dragons assigned the task of keeping the sleeper entombed in his 
              massive bubble prison.</p>
            <p></p>
            Once all four Warders fall, the spell is broken and the Sleeper awakes. 
            The first two Warders fell with ease, and we prepared ourselves for 
            the most formidible of opponents we would face that night: Ventani 
            the Warder.
            <p>Ventani is the most powerful of the Warders, and the last obstacle 
              in waking the Sleeper. She has two area-effect spells, one of which 
              is devastating to melee classes and one that is harmful to caster 
              classes. Due to these area effect spells, a new strategy would have 
              to be used. After several attempts, the strategy was refined and 
              we were ready to kill Ventani. Below is a screenshot from the fight.</p>
            <p></p>
            The fight was long, as it takes a great number of arrows to chew through 
            the health of a dragon such as Ventani. However, she fell without 
            incident, and we braced ourselves for the final fight with Hraashna, 
            the third Warder, and the final force keeping Kerafyrm in his prison.
            <p>As Hraashna fell, a pall drew over the Tomb. For ten suspsenseful 
              seconds that seemed like a year, we waited. Suddenly, a low rumble 
              shook the foundations of the square bridge surrounding the Sleeper. 
              We gazed off to the far side of the tomb and witnessed the great 
              prismatic dragon Kerafyrm awake for the first time.</p>
            <p></p>
            Kerafyrm tore through us, and what was left of the tomb. He killed 
            all the sentries and gargoyles that had kept him imprisoned for so 
            many millenia. But Kerafyrm was not finished. He soon left the Tomb 
            for the Skyshrine to exact his revenge upon Yelinak and his minions.<p>
            He tore through the Skyshrine, killing every sentry and minion of 
            Lord Yelinak, and finally slaying Yelinak himself before he left Norrath 
            to plot the entirety of his revenge. We were left to ressurect our 
            fallen and prepare for life in a world forever changed.
            <p> 18 November 2001</p>
            <p>Well, we've killed a fewm obs since the last news update.<br>
              We killed Klandicar on Thursday. Congrats Etiena on your Sleeper's 
              Key.</p>
            <p>We killed Ikatiar, Eashan, Aaryonar, Feshlak, and Dagarn on Friday. 
              Tons of crap dropped, JoY! Honestly, you dont even care what people 
              got it was that bad.</p>
            <p>On Friday night we decided it might be time to finally get around 
              to killing Ventani, so what the hell, why not give it a try? By 
              the time we killed Ventani (it took a few tries, I think? ) we had, 
              well, lets put it this way, too many people in the zone. Between 
              returning retirees and visitors zoning into watch, there were plenty 
              of people in the zone to hear Kerafyrm shout their name.</p>
            <p>Crover should be following up with plenty of screen shots once 
              he gets his act together.</p>
            <p>The on saturday and sunday we finished up our clear of ToV North. 
              Dropping Kriezzen, Koi`Doken, Mirenilla, Jorllaeg, Nevedaria, Zlexak, 
              Sevelak and Cekenar Saturday night and then Vulak and Vyemm on Sunday 
              when Vulak finally spawned.</p>
            <p>Congrats Korkrest on your Tolan's Longsword of the Glade, most 
              of the other drops were crap and who cares about anything but Vulak, 
              eh?</p>
            <p>Also, on a side note welcome Hierl, Shaman, to the guild.</p>

              Made the rounds today. Derekor the Vindicator cried for his mommy. 
              The Statue of Rallos Zek got whacked and is suing Thund for separate 
              maintenance. None of us are too clear on why, but Thund was awful 
              grumpy about it (hey, maybe size did matter?). Lendiniara the Keeper 
              decided that maybe if she played nice we would let her go. Stupid 
              wench never sees it coming.
