              Kasmira hosted a raid on crushbone last night for our alts. We had 
              a blast once we were able to take over the Throne Room. I'm going 
              to try to name everybody that was there but can't make any promises; 
              Niline, Xeldac, Portimus, Tily, Hangg, Alyah, Pamila, Mitout, Syclops, 
              Cookee, Koneta, Ganthir's alt (sorry didn't write down spelling, 
              know it started with an A) and also thanks to the assistance of 
              Dory, Redwud and Avandi. If I forgot anybody, I really am sorry. 
              We first tried to take over Trainer Hill (I think that's what it 
              was called) but with all of us that were there it was just not enough 
              for us. Once we were able to get into the Throne Room that's when 
              things really happened and we had a great time. Unfortunately Tily 
              died so Mitout got Avandi for the rez. Thank you again everybody

              Aug 12 2002 9:13AM - Fun weekend ;) Deacis <br>
              We did shards...some more shards...and a few frames... :p </p>
            <p>And Emperor... Who isnt too keen on dropping Garrisons, but seems 
              to have developed an affinity for horses... Yay... On the bright 
              side he dropped a pair of moccasins for Andreas and a nice Ring 
              for TR ;) Was good kill, despite a dodgy start, but Brownys blue 
              leggings pulled us through the fight for victory... </p>
            <p>Also dropped Creator for some wee loot as well and an orb... We 
              like orbs...yes we do! </p>
            <p>On the bright side we have breached the 200 shards to go mark ;) 
            </p>
            <p>Now if only ME would care to drop about 25 shards today, we will 
              be kicking :p Oh well, can dream... 
            <p> Aug 10 2002 1:05AM - More shards, more orbs and some random insanity 
              Blackbadger <br>
              Killed THO and Grieg today<br>
              Starting to worry for the sanity of my fellow officers with all 
              these shard camps... </p>
            <p></p>
            <p> Aug 8 2002 11:54PM - Well... Deacis <br>
              More keys, shards, frames, mobs we killed before... </p>
            <p>On the bright side, only 6 emperor keys to go for entire guild 
              to be outfitted, including recruits and what not :p And we got about 
              400 shards over the past few days, and database is glowing from 
              people constantly updating :p </p>
            <p>And we killed AL for the first time with TR the other day, which 
              for us was a first and a pretty fun fight :) </p>
            <p>Besides that we killed Tormax and IV today for prolly the worst 
              loot ever, but still made people happy :) </p>
            <p>All in all a good day, with good effort from everyone :) <br>

            <p>Iki and Eashen spawned, and a good number of CC decided to forgo 
              sleep to go ahead and knock them out.</p>
            <p>Grats to Groggh on the Claw of Lightning, Nalk on the Bracer of 
              the Sky, Feochadan on the Twisted Steel Gauntlets. Iki dropped Ancient 
              Wyvern Hide Sleeves and Boots...grats whoever got those because 
              I was on my way to being unconscious by then.<br>
              <br>

            <p>Though in all honesty, if the shoe fits...</p>
            <p>Cohort took the Dain down 4 times last night. Sure...real exciting, 
              right? Well, this is more of a challenge than you might think, considering 
              3/4ths of the guild is on Dain faction and is unwilling to take 
              a hit due to either having an 8th shawl to finish, or a 9th/10th 
              coldain ring to do. The real fun is on the guard pulls, when there 
              are 4 guards in the camp, and only 1 tank fighting...</p>
            <p>The new UI added some amusement, and people now could pick exactly 
              the percentage of health they wanted to log out at. </p>
            <p>What else died this week? </p>
            <p>Began the week with another Blood killing (the lootless version, 
              heh), followed by our first real emperor attempt. Of course we got 
              our asses handed to us, but we went into it expecting a learning 
              experience. Next time, we might even support or 10 squads of zerglings 
              with a couple squads of hydralisks, or something...</p>
            <p>Aow Died Monday - drops were 2 blades, a helm, and monkey legs. 
              Kept one MT up for the entire fight, a nice first for the alliance 
              (and welcome news for all of us poor and abused tanks).</p>
            <p>And while our nights were spent in Ssra farming keys and ore, our 
              day crew kept themselves busy killing the rhags and talendor. <br>

              Well, this guy dead by CoG in house with 30 people, flawless...actuallly 
              Ayanar died cause he went LD. He droppoed nice BP that went to Cabrine. 
              Pauldrons that went to Corus. (i think the 2 bards are sharing a 
              dice). and nice uber hat that would have looked good on me except 
              that went to Mythika, LOL. I swear guys, she said pass it to Pheign, 
              how come nobody believes me?
            <p> </p>
            <p>We had plans to do more, but it was getting late so the late crew 
              went to Tim Deep to do a quick slaying of Faydedar for Tyelia. unfortunately, 
              some bug despawned the trigger dorf and we had to cancel it. oh 
              well.</p>

            <p>Dragons and Snakes... - Stormhaven (8/11/2002 4:38 AM) <br>
              <br>
              We started off the day a little early killing off Klandicar just 
              because he was up. A nice, nearly flawless killing. Unfortunately 
              we lost Gobober... he was sorely missed.</p>
            <p>Then we tried Sontalak. We won't talk about that.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately nothing really spawned till later in the evening 
              so a few guildies had some time on their hands. We went our separate 
              ways, mostly doing exp, key and shard camps - the day also included 
              a successful 8th Shawl event.</p>
            <p>Around 8pm EST we heard that the Rhag's were spawning. Finally, 
              a real mob! We made our way to the Temple of Ssra and killed off 
              both Rhags and the Arch Lich.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>A somewhat slow, but still successful day all in all. Congrats 
              to all those who got loots!<p>

              Slacker only... - Stormhaven (8/10/2002 4:08 AM) <br>
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>So yes, I've been slacking on the news a bit lately. Well as you 
              can see from above, we've killed pretty much anything we can think 
              of that's spawned. Despite being in the middle of the night on a 
              Thursday, short a few clerics, short a few damage dealers, we did 
              pretty well in the Burrower Beast ring in the Deep.</p>
            <p>We juggled Shei around a bit, but considering we had a lot of newbies 
              at the event, it went pretty well. The last hop for the night was 
              a quaint jaunt in Veeshan's Peak. Phara Dar died in record time... 
              not much you can do to thwart the onslaught of four simultaneous 
              manaburns.</p>
            <p>Oh, then to leave VP, you've got to take the port to the Plane 
              of Air, then jump off the side to get dropped off in Freeport.</p>
            <p>Well... apparently some of us have had past... &quot;issues&quot; 
              with some of the residents.<br>
              Poor Bronto.</p>

              posted on 08-13-2002 07:14 PM by Magnuss Surestab<br>
              Spent a lot of time lately chain dying and learning the in's and 
              out's of Vex Thal. No free rides in this zone - it's ass rapingly 
              fun through and through. 
            <p>We have, however, been relentlessly trudging through, making leaps 
              and bounds out of our time there. We do our jobs, and we get things 
              dead...Plain and simple.</p>
            <p>Kaas Thox Xi Ans Dyek died last night, killed to the hands of The 
              Relentless, yet another server first. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Loots SUCKED. Verant needs to seriously upgrade this shit for all 
              the people who have devoted countless months of their time to this 
              waste of an expansion. Thank god PoP is right around the corner...You 
              be the judge.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>On a brighter note, we took out the Emperor again this past Saturday 
              as Rj stated in his last post. Loots weren't too bad...</p>

            <p>News: Stuff Died <br>
              posted on 08-12-2002 02:39 PM by rj<br>
              Saturday we killed Emperor number 5. Foul died about 60 seconds 
              into the fight but we pulled our head out and Browny tanked the 
              rest of the fight no problem. Browny got the uber Emp ring for his 
              efforts, and Teleri got an uber horse that can smoke Fflew in a 
              race to the fridge for more beer.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>We then went to kill AOW, in house only of course. We had a massive 
              lag bubble halfway through the fight that lasted a good 10 seconds 
              and we lost a lot of people, including the main tank and about 5 
              people to link death (including a few clerics on the heal rotation). 
              But lag doesn't matter to us, we are Relentless, we kill dragons 
              and shit. </p>
            <p>We got two BOC's and a ring off his lame ass. I think we can safely 
              relegate AOW to farm status. Can't believe he used to beat our ass 
              so much when we were allied with EOD. /yawn &lt;-- for all you sensitive 
              girls out there, that is directed at AOW and not EOD, thx drive 
              thru.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Also spent a lot of time dying in VT Saturday and Sunday, but we 
              are slowly mowing through the lame ass yard trash mobs to the real 
              meat of the zone. /rude Verant<br>

            <p>News: More VT, Thall Va Xakra dead! <br>
              posted on 08-07-2002 03:20 PM by Magnuss Surestab<br>
              Went to Vex Thal again last night, and totally obliterated the first 
              boss mob we've encountered to date, Thall Va Xakra. </p>
            <p>Took a lot of screenshots for you guys to check out, however, it 
              is so damn dark outside the castle it's almost impossible to make 
              anything out. The trash mobs are pretty sick too; super high ac, 
              hp's, crazy AE's, and a respawn faster then you can blink. To be 
              honest, getting to Thall Va Xakra was harder then the encounter 
              itself...</p>
            <p>Grats Bonshee on your new cloak </p>
            <p>Anyway, have a look-see at the shots and enjoy. Don't fret, there 
              will be plenty more to come soon.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>And we can't forget the best screenshot ever, Tronsmang sealing 
              the victory for our first VT boss mob kill. I mean, how did the 
              mob even stay standing after this instense show of power? TEACH 
              ME THE WAYS GOOD SIR~</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>As an aside we killed Emperor again last Saturday, killed a bazillion 
              mobs in ME (F ME), killed Arch Lich today and who knows what else 
              over the weekend. </p>
            <p>All in house only except for our fantabulous-zergtastic-1-MT-tank 
              only killing of the Emperor with Anavon. We are shooting for a 10 
              minute Emperor implosion next time.<br>

              Day 139 to 141</p>
            <p>A 4 armed guy in Akheva was the way to start off Friday night, 
              Shei Vittle's n' Bits, which really is an interesting fight, and 
              what is even more amusing then the fight is that Shei starts off 
              as a vendor that actually does sell stuff :) Anyway, the fight was 
              good and lots of fun stuff droppped ane everyone was happy, just 
              happy enough to go to Veeshan's peak, the land of the manaburn dragons. 
              More on the Phara fight later, but VP is an ok zone, a place to 
              go when every mob in the land is dead I guess, because as of late, 
              thats what norrath is, a barren wasteland of no big mobs up for 
              days ;(</p>
            <p>Anyway, on to Saturday which was oddly starting out with Klandicar, 
              then tea time with Sont, but he didn't like our company and well 
              he got away :( Then it was on to Snake town to kill the Rhags and 
              then the Arch Lich, which is always enjoyable because he drops such 
              nice things and its nice to kill the cycle, if people would just 
              pay more attention and didn't die every 4 steps on the way, things 
              go quicker, but this went quick enough. Sunday finished off with 
              even less stuff to kill, so we killed Doomshade, who was fun to 
              pull. You can tell, like I said above the barren wasteland, when 
              people are killing things just because they're up. Oh, and 7 of 
              us finished the night in Greigs end killing this guy that must have 
              a gazillion hit points, and he only dropped a necro thing ;(</p>
            <p>The following image montage is because I didn't have time to make 
              up 3 images, because I had to create two others that go with a little 
              rant I have, which I will link to. Rant Here </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>The following are a cross mix of images from Solias from the actual 
              battle with Phara Dar cut and spliced so they wouldn't be so large 
              and also with a few of my own comments tossed in (not much, as he 
              really captured the momment)<br>

              Day 137, 138 - I lost 1 Metric Ton!</p>
            <p>Wednesday was another one of those &quot;I know I should be in 
              Ssra, but no&quot; days that we all spent doing this and that, I 
              know some people where in ssra so that was good, gotta get em all! 
              I spent most of the night in the Plane of Air waiting for a GM to 
              come repop the quest npc's because they wouldn't respawn after they 
              despawned (like they're supposed to). So me and Malachy spent the 
              evening despawning all the quest npc's! Oh, and that big Air Pet 
              is freaky in there .. goes nicely with the freaky mages! :)</p>
            <p>Thursday almost started out that way, but near the end of the day, 
              the Burrower Beast show'd his fat self and bounding to the zone 
              with EoD we took on the worm ring of The Deep. Fairly interesting 
              event, waves of worms spawn, little guys at first, then bigger guys 
              but less of them, then 2 bigger ones, then the big fat fella himself. 
              Who I guess was hard, but we made him look easy (I guess!). Some 
              neat flowing thought items dropped and a dagger for picket, yippee 
              for us all! Oh, and the only way to beat the beast is to offer him 
              the following : </p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>On a completly unrelated note, after seeing simalar things pop 
              up on the Rangers Glade, I decided to make my own Brells Spell Icon 
              that will alert me of the vile nature of the buff when cast on me. 
              Yes, I now a big Pink heart might have been enough, but it looks 
              too nice to represent what brells really is. So I offer you the 
              following screenshot, and link to the spells tga that will let you 
              to, fellow rangers, have that instant warning when your buff goes 
              poof!</p>

              Nobody Does It Slower....</p>
            <p>The folks at the Guinness Book visited our guild today to make 
              their official rounds. The events fortold by Nostradamus, the Book 
              of Revalations, and crazy Chauncey the prognosticator had come to 
              pass, and the Guinness folks had to dutifully record it.</p>
            <p>Way back in distant times, when Norrath was new and dinosaurs still 
              roamed the planet, there was a little PalaDINK chick with a dream. 
              The dream to grow and be the best little DINK she could. The details 
              of these times are few and far between. Civilizations have risen 
              and fallen since then. The great ice age has returned and relented 
              3 times, grinding most records of this mythological period under 
              the stark power of nature. The few details that have been secreted 
              away and passed from father to son to lecherous uncle to police 
              sargeant and then back to father tell us that in these times there 
              were only a slight handful of Norraths, and our own home, Cazic 
              Thule, was one of them. They tell us that in these times, among 
              the first few adventurers of Norrath waded the little lost DINK. 
              While some adventurers raced against the cruel realities of Norrath 
              and built themselves into powerful machines of vengeance incarnate, 
              our little DINK wandered the countryside in search of thongs, good 
              times, backrubs, and a mythical Trout.<p>
              As time marched on and other raced like high powered rocket fueled 
              funny cars, our DINK raced along more like a Tonka Truck. Events 
              were stacked against her. Having grown up before such modern convenience 
              as language, it's use often evaded her and left others wondering 
              what to do with words that would make the Ebonics folks stop dead. 
              Hurdles like this merely steeled her rigid resolve to grow at a 
              pace rivaled only by continental drift.</p>
            <p>
              But, as fate and psychic predictions fortold, there came a day, 
              TODAY where our little DINK would carve her name in the recordbooks, 
              in first place before every person who has ever played this game.</p>
            <p>And that came to pass, for today, Jenka made level 60. Nobody on 
              any server has taken longer to reach this goal. There were no Alts, 
              no delevelling, no calling it quits and abandoning the game, just 
              an unsteady shuffle to max level that wound it's way just about 
              every direction but straight.</p>
            <p>To be sure, there were long pauses in growth at some points. Jenka 
              helped introduce Thund to EQ. When Jenka did this, she was level 
              54. When Thund made 60, Jenka was still 54. This steadfastness of 
              purpose to meander to where ya wanna go was truly amazing to watch.</p>
            <p>Some day, some dedicated individual might set their minds to it 
              and break Jenka's record, but for today, we salute Jenka for an 
              achievement that puts her in a position above all other players 
              of EQ throughout the world.</p>
