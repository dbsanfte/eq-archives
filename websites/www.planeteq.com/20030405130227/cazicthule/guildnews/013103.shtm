              Trying out the CoD ring for the first time, went nostalgic and did

            <p></p>
            <p>Tonight was a shit sandwich. How the hell are we supposed to zerg 
              our way through PoP when this happens to half the raid force?</p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Pretty sunset, no? This, apparently, is whats under HoHB. How do 
              you get here? You stand in your camp, and fight. And if you're lucky, 
              the raid-fairy (no, not Evincar) will pick you to go on this very 
              special ride. Or he can pick 30 of you and your closest raiding 
              buddies to go here. Or crash to the desktop. Or warp back to zone 
              in for an assbeating by the guards. FUN FUN FUN!</p>
            <p>Nor was this an isolated problem with Marr's house...we heard about 
              cancelled raids in Sol Ro's tower and Torment, from others on the 
              server. Yay patches!</p>
            <p>Waiting for Rallos... <br>

            <p>Sigh, Bottlenecks. Every expansion seems to have them...one critical 
              mob that stands between your guild, and piles of the proverbial 
              Phat Lewtz. For this expansion, the bottleneck is Rallos Zek. Its 
              not enough that he's (so we've heard) a very difficult encounter 
              - here, on Overcrowded Thule, we've got 3 alliances pounding away 
              at him (One sucessfully - Congrats EoD/TR, one unsucessfullly, and 
              one (us) who have yet to get a shot at him).</p>
            <p>So, in the meantime, what have we been up to? Every night, we've 
              sent teams to explore Sol Ro's Tower. I gotta say, this is quite 
              honestly the best looking zone I've seen in EQ. The pillars of lava, 
              the vaulted ceilings, the mobs...just an amazing job. Some of the 
              bugs we've found in the zone, however, are not so amazing.</p>
            <p>In the course of our exploration, we've killed 4 of the 5 Sol Ro 
              bosses (all of which were pretty damned fun fights).</p>
            <p>In between the Sol Ro exploration, we've spent the past week doing 
              catch-up flags for our guildmates - lots of HoH trials, the mini-zeks, 
              Saryn again, Terris Thule, and other assorted miscellany. The effort 
              shows - Sol Ro flagging is almost done.</p>
            <p>In a fit of late night boredom, our fearless guildleader Kenji 
              also took some folks to the ring event in the old Avatar of Fear's 
              chamber (part of finishing up the guild &quot;been there, done that&quot; 
              checklist, I guess). We never bothered with this event before, but 
              the server was pretty bare of spawns by this point in the week, 
              so we went in, kicked ass, and actually got a pretty nice drop (along 
              with 4 not-so-nice ones, heh). Ah well, variety is the spice of 
              life.</p>
            <p>We should be looking at our first attempt at Rallos this week...news 
              and pictures then. <br>

              It seems no matter where you go in life there are always doubters. 
              People who say it can't be done. Sometime's those people know it 
              can be done, but they just doubt you can do it. Well when the time 
              comes that someone doubts you, you need to stand up and show them 
              first hand. 
            <p> </p>
            <p>CoG/BG has been in that situation recently. It seems some of our 
              friends on the server didn't believe we could do this particular 
              Dragon. They wanted us to prove it to them, they couldn't take our 
              word for it. So here's the pro0f.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>We also has an incident with Eashen of the Sky. Somebodies pet 
              decided to try and beat up the poor drake and we couldnt avoid putting 
              the guy down like an old race horse.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Grats to the loot winners n such.<br>

              Sunday and Monday kill sheet <br>
              Posted by Pheign On Jan 21 2003 At 02:39:03 AM <br>
              Sunday was slow and had a hard time with IV for some reason so that 
              kill took 2 rare tries.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Tonight, however, we made up some killz. Below are todays tally...</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Zlandicar - gratz Cyke from BG on ST key, cowl dropped, i don't 
              know who got all the ghetto lootz since i wasn't there, hehe</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Sontalek - damn, he gave it up faster than a drunk prom date. gratz 
              Engress on ST key. he also gave up bp, legs, boots, and 3 spells, 
              but don't know who got it since they were ghetto too</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Xanamech - we did walk the gnome thing and killed this mechanical 
              dragon. he dropped a nice neck piece that had major haste on it 
              and gratz to Feller of BG on that. Draconal got his nice ring that 
              even a monk would wear, but it has like 12wis/int and 75hp/mana 
              so ppl would have thrown stones if i had won it...</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Vindicator - killed him because he was on our damn way to get Statue. 
              we just pulled him and his gaurds at the same time cause we had 
              NO TIME for his bull kaka...some shaman got bp, forgot who</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Statue of Rallos Zek - he died quick, what else can i say. once 
              slowed, he's a wuss. dropped cloak, 2x 1hb hammers, and a 2hs sword.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Idol - dead. no loot. he sux. die fiend!</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>AoW - NOT DEAD, but he was the star of the night. we lost 2 clerics 
              on first 30 seconds of engagement and left us with only 4 clerics, 
              so had to call on all our uber druids to help heal Havasee (great 
              job by the way). we flopped on execution and planning, and engaging 
              at 12 midnight PST, ppl were probably tired too, but we got him 
              down to 35% anyway. next time, he's definately toast.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>most agreed, this was a very fun night well worth staying up for 
              and being late for work tomorrow, LOL. Gratz everyone. you rock!<br>

              The Kerran Defenders guild has been quite busy lately and I've been 
              way too busy to update our news page. </p>
            <p>We are not openly recruiting but those who may be interested here 
              is some info on us and our policy,.. First rule, we are a guild 
              of people who enjoy hunting with each other. We are currently only 
              looking for the classes of Enchanter, Rogue, and Bard. <br>
              All new applicants must of 55 level or higher with suitable gear 
              for those levels.</p>
            <p>Submitted by Houfter Well last night I got Jonzer to put a Motd 
              for me to do the hole and the response I got was awesome. Before 
              the Hole a bunch of Dokr went to Karnors and beat down on VSR for 
              a ranger epic peice I believe. Then we all proceeded to head to 
              the hole and blew through there like a whirlwind. </p>
            <p>We took out the ranger epic mob for Zbar then proceeded in orderly 
              fashion to High Scale Kirn. We smoked both these guys like a well 
              packed pipe. Thanks to all that came, and this is the kinda team 
              work that I love to see us acheive.</p>
            <p>Submitted by Fairsong Last night Houfter and I stopped into Umbral 
              and ran across a named Moktor. After a totally Fairsong like pull 
              I did manage to grab him single. Well that dude had about 20k hps 
              and arms longer than Big Bother. It didnt matter though as he dropped 
              dead as a door nail. Aliciarose is not sporting a nice new bracer.</p>
            <p>After Houfter logged Xmortis and I cruised over to Western Waste. 
              With a bottle of liquid courage and full pipe of Halfling Leaf in 
              the belly, we decided to pick a fight with some of the Named Dragons 
              and won, sorta hehehe. Xmortis ran home with a new pair of boots 
              so grats to her. </p>
            <p>Wandered into Tov during off hours the other day and 2 groups of 
              us pillaged at will in HoT. Grats to Angelicas on her new gauntlets 
              and Andorean on her new arms.</p>
            <p>Submitted by Fairsong Ok im at work with no sleep. not one minute 
              of sleep less you count the 2 mins I drifted off at the keyboard 
              during the CR. We rumbled into Chardok with the Legion of Nox intent 
              on murdering the royal family ala Zcar style. It was a good night 
              as we helped Tanc from Nomads get his epic from the Queen after 
              dispatching the King for Nowee. All total we dropped the Queen 2 
              times and the King 3 times. Grats to Andorean who got her note from 
              the king, so she is so much closer to completing her epic. Just 
              a ragefire camp now.<br>
              Mindaarie scored huge last night by getting an ultra rare pair of 
              gauntlets.<br>
              Vibrating Gauntlets of Infuse and Blackwand went home sporting a 
              shiny new Incardine breast plate.</p>
            <p>Smoked a few giants in Kael faction hunting. Grats to Drizo and 
              Katslayer for picking up a new pair of shoulders. Swadi is closing 
              in on completing the quest. It will be another busy week as we are 
              on schedule to do 8th shawl quest, Cleric Epic completion, Druid 
              Epic Completion and with luck closing in on another Shammy Epic.</p>

            <p> Getting everybody into the elementals - ShadeStorm (1/31/2003 
              1:19 PM) <br>
              <br>
              Thats right, getting members, apps, twinks, 2 boxers, 3 boxers, 
              4 boxers, 5 boxers, 6 boxers, future apps, and friends of the guild 
              into the elementals this week so we can pretty much go 100% in the 
              elementals. So we been back flagging like crazy this week so that 
              everything is done. With an agreement among cohort, talons, and 
              the relentless on basically flag sharing on any mob that each has 
              done, this alone has helped us the most. </p>
            <p>Dropped angarr, and bertox yesterday so two more back flags done 
              by us. </p>
            <p>Still taking apps for the guild, but understand once we start doing 
              the elementals, we will be doing the lower tier bosses on a schedule 
              that we are trying to figure out so that we can get max bang for 
              the buck on everything. You will get into elementals, just not the 
              day of your app has been recieved, examined, poked, and made fun 
              at ;&gt; Expect 2-3 weeks before you get in the elementals, as we 
              are trying to outfit our players with elemental armor and weapons, 
              and whatever else there is asap.<br>

              20k fun baby - ShadeStorm (1/29/2003 1:06 AM) <br>
              <br>
              Today's patch was suppose to well do some things, the nice nerf 
              feature was to 20k players whenever they well did anything. Unlike 
              some guilds, when we got hold of the gm(we rarely petition as is), 
              instead of dismissing him after the first summons or whatever, we 
              make sure we get our money's worth for the petition. Thats right, 
              we sorta made him go through the zone with us summoning people whenever 
              they 20k'ed, or dt, or thrown to bind point, or whatever other fun 
              things that could possibly happen to the player. Thank god we barely 
              petition, they will forget the incident where we held them hostage 
              and made them turn into summoning guys for the remainder of the 
              raid..we did get one mini in sol ro, but decided that the gm was 
              good enough sport so let him go help other guilds ;&gt;</p>
            <p>Now ya think it be hard to 20k in plane of water...you would be 
              wrong in that assumption. We found out its possible to fall to your 
              death in an underwater zone. So we decided ok...maybe its just pop 
              zones....hahah, if it were only that simple. No, it seems EVERY 
              ZONE was affected. </p>
            <p>I hear there's a patch to fix this patch(gee, like we couldnt have 
              figure this was about to happen). Wonder what they break though 
              during the &quot;fixing&quot;. </p>
            <p>Anyways, been back flagging people, flagging people who want in 
              eod, and killing gods and non gods for phat lewts.<br>

              Our favorite shaman twink, in his never ending quest to put it where

            <p>Unfortunately, with Bertoxx isn't the god of Disease and Decay

              <br>
              Serveren havde v&aelig;ret nede, s&aring; ST mobs var allerede oppe 
              igen. Vi nakkede, som vi snart har for vane, de to f&oslash;rste 
              named. Vi havde dog wipe p&aring; nummer 2 en gang, men vi fik den 
              i andet fors&oslash;g. Det blev til primal til Chanze og Zagis, 
              og en ekstra 2 hand primal til Sleipner. Grats til jer.</p>
            <p>Status er nu at NoN har 19 ST keys. Vi har 10 nomader med primal, 
              og har for &oslash;jeblikket kun vores 3 monks, det ikke er lykkedes 
              at f&aring; primal fists til. S&aring; vi skal se at f&aring; nogle 
              flere ST keys.<br>

              Utanaden <br>
              Exhumed var ikke p&aring; pga patch problemer, men det var NoN, 
              og ST mobs var oppe. Tog lidt tid at komme dertil, fordi man gik 
              LD hver gang man zonede.</p>
            <p>Vi havde dog et st&aelig;rkt fremm&oslash;de og endte med at nakke 
              begge de f&oslash;rste named ST mobs. Det blev til en primal piercer 
              til Pega og en primal Claydmore til Chanze (opgraderes n&aring;r 
              vi f&aring;r en 1-hand primal). Og s&aring; fik Bokg en ekstra primal 
              2 hander til at lege med.</p>
            <p>Tak til Saelaru og Onti der hjalp til.<br>
              <br>
              Title: Xp og Venril Sathir Date: 28-1-2003 12:48:58 Author: Utanaden 
              <br>
              Dagen blev brugt p&aring; xp og p&aring; at nakke Venril Sathir 
              til Sharwanna. Heldigvis droppede han staff til wizard epic, s&aring; 
              nu mangler Sharwanna kun en ting mere. Tillykke med det!<br>

              <br>
              Lendi var oppe i dag, og vi bad derfor som vi har aftalt Exhumed 
              om at komme. Det ville de gerne, og vi tog derfor til ToV. Desv&aelig;rre 
              skulle Exhumed g&aring; n&aelig;sten lige da de var kommet, men 
              de gav os s&aring; tilgeng&aelig;ld lov til at tage Lendi inhouse.</p>
            <p>Vi klarede den lige med n&oslash;d og n&aelig;ppe i f&oslash;rste 
              fors&oslash;g. Hvilket m&aring; siges at v&aelig;re en utrolig flot 
              pr&aelig;station af NoN. Der var desv&aelig;rre ikke det vilde loot, 
              men det blev til en ST key til Silverskin.<br>

              Title: Farming i HoT Date: 26-1-2003 1:02:28 Author: Utanaden <br>
              Vi hunter armor i ToV alt hvad vi kan. Fredag og l&oslash;rdag har 
              v&aelig;ret to gode dage, med masser af armor drops. Der er stadig 
              en del nomader der mangler, men det begynder at hj&aelig;lpe p&aring; 
              det. Grats til alle de heldige. Hvis vi forts&aelig;tter i dette 
              tempo, er vi snart klar til at skifte faction.</p>
            <p>Samtidig med vores ToV raid lykkedes det os at nakke prince i Chardok, 
              s&aring; Chednezzar kom et skridt t&aelig;ttere p&aring; sin epic. 
              Tillykke til hende.<br>

              Title: I ST med Exhumed Date: 24-1-2003 7:38:05 Author: Utanaden 
              <br>
              Vi var i ST med Exhumed. Desv&aelig;rre var der ingen clerics online 
              fra nogen af de to guilds, s&aring; Utanaden m&aring;tte boxe Hoen. 
              Det var jo p&aring; en m&aring;de meget godt, for vi blev tvunget 
              til at l&aelig;re hvordan man single puller, og det var faktisk 
              nemt nok. Det lykkedes at nakke MotG, som desv&aelig;rre ikke rigtig 
              droppede noget vi havde brug for. Han droppede fists (ikke primal) 
              og primal bow. Luxe fik fists og Exhumed fik bow. Den anden named 
              vi plejer at tage, havde vi ikke mod p&aring; med en cleric. S&aring; 
              det var ikke nogen specielt god dag i ST.<br>

              Kinda silly how hard we work sometimes. I mean we in the sense of 
              all Everquest players. We push, we fall, we learn and we redo. In 
              the last two weeks nearly every Tier 1 guild on the server has run 
              the gauntlet concerning back flags. It's amusing to that it took 
              us about four months to reach this point and less than two weeks 
              to do it all again. But hey, that's progress.</p>
            <p>Relentless has worked hard to get everyone caught up, and last 
              night was a huge one. Dropping the Zek twins in PoTactics (without 
              the zone crashing!!), then punting the HoH dragon once more for 
              posterity, we even dropped in CoDb and paid a visit to the planar 
              projection. All that work for one line of text, six little words. 
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>We spent the first part of PoP farming in Luclin, which was truely 
              open for the first time when everyone rushed to the planes. Yeah, 
              it got old, yeah it was dull, but I'll be damned if it wasn't the 
              right course of action. The long hours and hard work that we put 
              in have served us well in PoP. I have no doubt that the backflagging 
              will serve us just as well. </p>
            <p>With only two mobs left to complete the circut again we are poised 
              to push onwards united and whole as the strong guild that we are.

              Last night the Rallos Zek rotation once again landed on us. We were 
              unable to even attempt the encounter after the original patch, with 
              people 20k'ing after walking down a step, or being randomly shot 
              to their bind point or desktop. So we set forth after these things 
              were &quot;fixed&quot; and started up the encounter. With all the 
              bugs did Rallos have a better chance at winning? Could he possibly 
              regain control of his domain? Could he lay waste to our raid and 
              stand victorious in the arena?</p>
            <p>????????????????????????????????????????????????? </p>
            <p>Nope.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>As promised there was a fix for the trouble that was occuring with 
              the arena not respawning properly. I don't want to give away any 
              of VI's technical secrets, but maybe these phrases will give you 
              a clue.</p>

              Having spent the past week or so rounding up flags and tying off 
              loose ends in the lower planes. Mithaniel, Rallos, Agnarr, HoH Trials, 
              etc. etc. If it needed killing then it got it.</p>
            <p>A few of us took some time to explore a bit into the elemental 
              planes. We explored the Plane of Earth on Super Bowl Sunday...the 
              elementals there were more into football though. Here you can see 
              an impressive Power-I formation. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>The mobs in the Plane of Water were much more cooperative in giving 
              us what we wanted. After just a few minutes we had scored some nice 
              items.<br>
            </p>
            <p>We're now ready to rush headlong into the elemental planes and 
              unlock the power within them. <br>

              We'll Verant really screwed up this patch. Their QA team should 
              have gotten a severe beating yesterday.</p>
            <p>Knowing the server would be down before 5pm PST, we decided to 
              do a quick Cursed. What a crappy one it was. We got our 13th Goldenrod. 
              Note we still have 0 rogue daggers. That's the second one in a row 
              we have had rot.</p>
            <p>Servers go down and you can zone without crashing. Good news so 
              we head to Water for a few minis and then hit RZ. Starting the RZ 
              encounter, 30 people go linkdead and another 5-6 get randomly translocated 
              to their bind point with no message.</p>
            <p>Ugh, RZ is undoable in those conditions so we decided to do something 
              we can do in our sleep - Vex Thal.</p>
            <p>Thank goodness we did (and half the camp was asleep and playing 
              on autopilot by the time we got to Aten, myself included). Fifteen 
              minutes til patch, the wench Aten coughed up not one, not two, but 
              three BPs. Grats to Luzz on your Shadow Platemail, Grats to Mitrahacker 
              on your Mail of Judgement and Grats to Naela on your Robe of Secrets. 
              Grats to Samirah on your neck.</p>
            <p>It would have been a shame to have that Aten rot. <br>

            <p>One of the earliest axioms of computer programming I learned was 
              that every program has at least one bug and can be shortened by 
              at least 1 line. Thus it follows that any program can be reduced 
              to one line of code that doesn't work. As we learned today, the 
              EQ code base is shrinking rapidly, the 'one line' goal must surely 
              be in sight.</p>
            <p>Thus the patch today was christened the &quot;Monty Hall&quot; 
              patch, and we saw that it was AACH day, and it was good. For those 
              that missed it, however, I have included a home game...</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><br>
              What news for us? The big anti-climax. After doing great and heroic 
              battle with massive LD's quadding our raid for 12 disconnects a 
              round we moved up and laid waste to the Keeper of Sorrow in Torment. 
              Actually, the Keeper was sort of dead before any of us realized 
              we were fighting...which was important to us WHY? Well because last 
              week, we did this...</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>And we were all pretty happy about that except that since the Keeper 
              wasn't up, still no Sol Ro Tower for us. So we waited. In the interim 
              we took our first swipe at RZ (which went pretty well if you look 
              past all the horrid painful death) and took on Terris Thule again 
              (which went really poorly cus there wasn't anything past the horrid 
              painful death to look at).</p>
            <p>So now to bed, in the sure knowledge that there are more AACH days 
              following in really close succession.</p>
            <p><br>
