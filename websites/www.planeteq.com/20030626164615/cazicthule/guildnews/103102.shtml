              Tonight was Plane of Nightmare night for Talons. We explored a large 
              portion of the zone and ended up killing a mini boss named Vhaksiz 
              the Shade (Pic2), who dropped a Flame Engraved Torque for Rownin. 
              Congrats to Kajawana and Tarisk each on getting one of the two Iron 
              Scream Earrings that dropped during the night from a large spider 
              named Terror Matriarch.</p>
            <p>Also, congrats to Talons and CC on killing AoW. Egral walked away

            <p>As promised, a few screenshots of our first steps into this new 
              plane. Honestly, there's much to be said about being the first ones 
              into a zone...to see it for the first time, knowing absolutely nothing 
              about what awaits you. To experience it before its mapped and spoiled 
              on any site...as corny as this may sound, I guess its the thrill 
              of exploration we felt.</p>
            <p>Cloud Giants<br>
              Treants<br>
              Entrance to the Bastion of Storms<p>
              The zone is beautiful. The mobs are challenging, the loot disapointing...but 
              for some reason, noone was really down about it. Instead, we're 
              all marvelling at this expansion. Admittedly, many of us have very 
              low expectations following Luclin...and for the first time in a 
              while, we're all somewhat stunned at how good PoP really is. </p>
            <p>We poked around in the Plane of Valor as well, but all my shots 
              turned out horrid. Ahh well. </p>

            <p>Emperor x2 (kills #3 and 4), Glyphed x2, Exiled x2, Cursed x1 (Thanks 
              to that wonderful patch where everything was broken and GM despawned...), 
              Burrower Parasite x1, and Blood x2.</p>
            <p>CC found time to squeeze in a creator kill, Vindi/Statue, 2 Rings 
              of Slime, the Rhag kids, and camp an ungodly number of shards.</p>
            <p>We also had our first peek inside VT. Fun stuff.<br>

            <p>Wuoshi dropped not once but twice in less than a week. We managed 
              to catch her up (now that the manaburn crew is out of business) 
              and took her down with relative ease. Had one false start )P. Tons 
              of nice loots from her rotting corpse. Congrats to Shirmar for getting 
              a green scale toward his epic, Kalander for questing a new BP for 
              himself and passing down his to Fellkin. (hope he patched up the 
              holes). Fonyodii picked up a new shield,Bastile scored a new spell 
              as did Balazar, Malom has a new toy bow to play with, Jonzer is 
              hacking up orcs with his new CBoL, Ligoris also is slashing orcs 
              with new scimitar, and I finally got a rezz from Celtin's new click 
              stick. </p>
            <p>Hooked up with Legion of Nox to break into fear late last week. 
              After a couple of tries we managed to finish the job and rumble 
              through the plane dropping mobs like candy. Monk items were the 
              flavor of night. Teamed up with them last night to wipe up on Wuoshi.</p>
            <p>The middle of last week had us rampaging with Yorick's Merry Men 
              for one of the 2 Wuoshi take downs.</p>
            <p>With new PoP out many of us have been exploring the newer zones 
              as well as hitting some of the less congested zones now. Groups 
              of us can be found in Greg's End now on a nightly basis.</p>
            <p>A fair number of us went to Umbra and scored a few upgrades and 
              play toys in there as well.<br>

              Questing levels and AA Oh My - ShadeStorm (10/29/2002 1:16 AM) <br>
              <br>
              The weekend we did the trials of justice and been able to nail to 
              2 of them(execution and hanging, we are damn close to beating lashing 
              and flame) and get everybody flagged via that way. Also started 
              the quests in valor and storm and mainly been busting ass doing 
              levels and aa points. </p>
            <p>Will say this though...wizards if the nerf bat hits you...dont 
              come crying, and on this server you know who ya are ;&gt; </p>
            <p>So far still love how the flags and everything work. Dont care 
              for some of the buggy quests, but overall, verant has done something 
              right which was a long time coming after the crap in sol with the 
              most massive time sinks ever possible put in the game.<br>
              <br>
              Just testing stuff out - ShadeStorm (10/26/2002 5:21 AM) <br>
              <br>
              Well had to wait on some group to do the pon quest and while waiting 
              we decided to test out TT. Its a fun fight i can see that, got it 
              to about 65%-60% with over half our crew not even around. Yea, about 
              39-42 people i believe so not bad for a test run with most of the 
              clerics i think on strike as well as the warriors....guess they 
              want more benefits past eye care, dental, and major medical ;/</p>
            <p>Jumped over to do the plane of justice quests...almost did it, 
              came down to the final boss on the one trial but just couldnt pull 
              it fully off. Oh well it happens.....like to say congrats to CC 
              (cohort for those who dont know) for being first guild on server 
              to do those quests. Good job. </p>
            <p>Also earlier in the afternoon.....dropped the cycle of glyph/exlied/and 
              cursed. <br>

              -More Epics, ToV, Oh Yeah!- <br>
              Have a lot of news to get talked about, but first I would just like 
              to say that homophobia has finally hit close to home. Me and Klopo 
              are very upset about this, and do plan on making our life partnership 
              a full one. Who are you to judge us people!??! </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Anyway, so after I gave it up to the whole guild repeatedly, we 
              finally hit up Plane of Sky without any idiots having beaten us 
              there for the last piece of my epic. We spent all night slaving 
              away in this insanely annoying zone with 9 people. But finally we 
              got where we needed to go and I got my ranger epic. Whee. There 
              was much cruising on the hershey highway aftwards. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Next day back to my favorite zone - Shitdok! We ran on down and 
              took out the Prince for Tyrell's epic, and followed that up with 
              the King. I'm afraid I didn't get any screenshots of the King fight, 
              as it was a complete cluster and I was the only enchanter. We downed 
              the King with another small force, but managed to wipe out to the 
              12 adds that came during the fight. No idea how we did it, but we 
              did. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>After King the only thing Dorry had left for his epic was Ragefire. 
              So Annoying About Ragefire Fest '02 had begun! After all of our 
              heads had exploded five times from the constant Ragefire chat, we 
              finally scraped our brains together and decided to give Ragefire 
              an in-house shot. Needless to say the big goofy dragon went down 
              with a flawless kill and now Dorry is our second epic clerical person 
              guy. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Finally we hit up Halls of Testing in Temple of Veeshan, hopefully 
              this will mean much less Kael as I think we can all agree that we're 
              sick of that zone. Things went really well for us and we got quite 
              a few nice drops. However I didn't get to get them, since I was 
              off camping Stormfeather*grumble*. I'm sure we'll be there plenty 
              now though, and if not I can always cyber for some loot. We had 
              a lot of drops for a lot of people, but the most important things 
              are, Grats Dorry on Plate Breastplate(!!!), Grats Sithray on Plate 
              Legs(!!!), Grats Tiliu on Chain Breastplate(!!!), and Grats whoever 
              on Silk Legs(?!?). </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Sithray dared to go AFK right before my Plane of Sky raid, hopefully 
              he learned his lesson after this: </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>While me and Nik are both camping Stormfeather, we decided that 
              we'd sit down with our buddies the gnomes. Unfortunately these little 
              cheating bastards were using loaded dice and stealing our money. 
              We got it back like the straight up thugs we are though:<br>

              Posted by: [Thund] on October 31st, 2002 @ 04:06 PM</p>
            <p>It's been a while. We took a break from raiding to explore the 
              joy and wonder that is Planes of Power. I now sincerely believe 
              I've gone through zone entrances of every conceivable shape and 
              size. I fully expect the plane of time portal to be a giant pendulum 
              you need to click on when it's at a specific point in it's swing. 
              And let's not even TALK about my expectations for the plane of Smurfs.</p>
            <p>But, it's halloween, and that means costumes. So HERE we go...</p>
            <p>Oh wait. First a question. Naw, let's put it on the picture.<br>
              And, of course, what would an update be without those quotes we've 
              all come to know and love?<br>
              Oh, yeah, one last thing. That whole PoP expansion. Kick ass. muco 
              fun. we kill it soon. See ya.</p>
            <p><b>Strategic Alliance</b><br>
              October 22nd: Tonight was our first foray into Howling Stones. Our 
              first break-in was interesting to say the least. Carse, our entertainer(bard), 
              cried like a girl for heals when his invised popped in the middle 
              of a large group of Scorps. Lumpeey, cleric extraordinaire, refused 
              to pop her own invis to heal him. After a quick rez, we were ready 
              to zone in. Vaughan, the only porter/evacer present, realized he 
              forgot his key, shortly after our valiant guild leader zoned into 
              the dungeon. Fortunately Nato was able to camp out quickly, since 
              another guild had recently cleared the zone-in. After retrieving 
              his key, and enduring repeated verbal abuse, we finally all zoned 
              in and secured the platform. Due to repeated connection problems 
              and LDs, we cut our raid short after travelling a short way into 
              the North Wing.<br>
              <br>
              October 23rd: We took out our frustrations by attempting to annihilate 
              the Darkpaw Gnolls of Jaggedpine Forest. We fought deep into the 
              gnoll caves, killing gnolls as we went, until we arrived in a large 
              cavern with a named gnoll present. We pulled Barduck, and with our 
              little band of adventurers, got him down to about 10% health when 
              a defiler spawned nearby. With our entertainer rooted, our evacer 
              feared, and our ranger charmed, Barduck made short work of Lumpeey, 
              which in turn spelled death for the rest of the party. Thanks to 
              our expert corpse retrieval unit, we were all rezzed and safe within 
              the hour.<br>
              <br>
              October 26th: Grats to Lumpeey on 55.<br>
              <br>
              October 27th: Our first guild raid into Kedge Keep. We successfully 
              camped the mermaid temple and took down several named mermaids, 
              as well as CauldronBoil and CauldronBubble. Guyl temporarily dinged 
              55 before his token death of the evening.<br>
              <br>
              October 28th: We returned to Howling Stones, with the intent of 
              seeing more of this exciting zone. After liberal use of the Lessor 
              Succor spell, we were able to develop tactics to allow us to break 
              into the North Wing successfully. We had only one death (Guyl as 
              usual), some good druid spell drops (Mask of the Howler and Circle 
              of Winter), and succesfully traversed the entire North Wing. Grats 
              to Guyl on 55 again, we hope it sticks.<br>
              <br>
              October 29th: Our largest guild raid yet, we took our massive group 
              of 8 into the Tower of Frozen Shadow, with the intent of getting 
              some good exp on the higher floors for our mid-40 players, but we 
              soon tired of killing greens on level 2 to get a keyholder spawn. 
              We all ported to Toxx Forest and entered the Hole, which was deserted, 
              much to our surprise. We dropped down and camped the city entrance 
              for nearly 2 hours with no deaths, not even Guyl. <br>
