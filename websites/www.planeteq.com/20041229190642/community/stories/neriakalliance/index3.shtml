              <br>
            </p>
            <span class="headline">Chapter 3 - Journeys</span> 
            <br><br>Dvinn journeyed 
              for a day in the company of four Neriak regulars. As the evening 
              began they were joined by a small horde of Orcs who spread out in 
              all directions clearing the path through Lesser Faydark towards 
              Greater Faydark. All night they kept up a steady pace.
            <br><br>When morning 
              came the Orcs made camp, but no fires were lit. Although they were 
              more orderly than Dvinn had expected, they were undisciplined by 
              Neriak standards. They complained to three larger Orcs about the 
              march, and about the lack of warm blood and fresh meat for their 
              breakfast before finally settling in for sleep during the daylight 
              hours.
            <br><br>The Neriak 
              guards kept watch. They were expecting the Ambassador to rest, but 
              he did not. Dvinn, not wanting to sleep near the Orcs, moved quietly 
              checking the guard posts on a regular basis.
            <br><br>In the 
              late afternoon his guides for the next leg of the journey arrived. 
              They were three female Wood Elves dressed in black. Part of a bandit 
              community that had a secret camp in Greater Faydark, they too wanted 
              to see the demise of Kelethin.
            <br><br>Dvinn left 
              with them as darkness fell upon the forest. Instead of a march, 
              he and the Wood Elves slipped slowly and silently from shadow to 
              shadow, and thereby entered Greater Faydark.
            <hr>
            <br><br>The portal 
              at the Druid ring in the Butcherblock Mountains closed with a soft 
              glimmer after depositing Niffun and the Dwarf upon the hard ground 
              there. The Dwarf was ecstatic about the escape, but the Druid was 
              perturbed. He had missed his opportunity to get the teleportation 
              device.
            <br><br>"Well done, 
              my friend, well down!" the Dwarf shouted as he embraced Niffun in 
              a bear hug. "Of course, I would have got the better of those devils 
              given time, but don't think for a moment I don't appreciate what 
              you've done. I'm forever in your debt. My children's children will 
              honor you name… errr… your name? What is your name?
            <br><br>"Niffun 
              Tuttle, but I…"
            <br><br>"Well met 
              Niffun! Yes, glad to meet you! Ahnog Nogginbash is the name, and 
              bashing is my game. I'll make a song about all this. A good one! 
              Your name will be sung among the Dwarves, and…"
            <br><br>Niffun 
              rolled his eyes, "Enough of this. We must make haste!"
            <br><br>"Indeed!" 
              the Dwarf replied. "We must warn the Stormguard! They will know 
              what to do with those dark devils."
           
            
            <p align=center>"Clip,

            <br><br>&nbsp;"Yes, 
              yes," Niffun replied. "Sing while you run, please!"
            <br><br>"Of course. 
              Of course," The Dwarf said.
            <p align=center>"This

			For two 
              hours they ran. Ahnog went on and on about everything! When he wasn't 
              talking, he was singing. The constant verbal barrage overwhelmed 
              Niffun, who was used to being alone. He usually traveled quietly, 
              and few noticed his passing--but not today! The loud Dwarf drew 
              the attention of every creature in the mountain. Niffun was relieved 
              when he saw Kaladim's gate in the distance. He fully intended to 
              leave the Dwarf there and press on to Kelethin to warn Trueshot 
              about the dangers in Lesser Faydark. The Dwarf, however, would have 
              none of it. He spoke briefly with the Captain of the Guard, who 
              in turn went inside the mountain-city to muster Dwarven troops for 
              a march to Kelethin. Ahnog took some armor and weapons, and then 
              insisted on accompanying the Halfling on his journey to warn the 
              Elves.
            <br><br>By the 
              end of the day they reached the pass out of the mountains into the 
              forest. The Druid led the way as they plunged into the darkness. 
              Finally, the Dwarf grew silent, but his armor and heavy feet were 
              anything but quiet. Consequently, the bandits with Dvinn heard him 
              long before he or Niffun were aware they were there.
            <br><br>They didn't 
              want a confrontation, but luck was not with them. As they hid, one 
              of them stepped on a branch and it broke with a loud, distinctive 
              pop. The Dwarf stopped and drew his sword. Niffun, on the other 
              hand, moved silently away from the Dwarf flanking the source of 
              the sound.
            <br><br>Ahnog, 
              in typical Dwarf fashion, moved directly and challengingly towards 
              the sound. The bandits, perceiving that battle was unavoidable, 
              and believing that the Dwarf was alone, split up. One went after 
              the Dwarf while the others led Dvinn away from the battle toward 
              their ultimate destination.
            <br><br>The tactic 
              almost worked. But, unseen and unexpected, Niffun glimpsed the fleeing 
              party as he was flanking the bandit attacking Ahnog. He had not 
              just seen them, but he had also recognized the ambassadorial raiment 
              that Dvinn was wearing. Immediately he suspected a connection with 
              his mission to Lesser Faydark, and left the Dwarf alone to deal 
              with the remaining bandit so he could pursue Dvinn.
            <br><br>The bandits 
              with Dvinn moved quickly believing that they had escaped. Dvinn 
              too thought they had escaped at first, but after only a few moments 
              of evasion his instincts as a soldier told him that he was being 
              hunted. He was only familiar with Greater Faydark through maps, 
              but he thought he could find his own way to Crushbone alone. So, 
              at the first opportunity to do so unnoticed he broke off from the 
              bandits. Maybe the unseen pursuer would follow them.
            <br><br>Niffun 
              paused at the point where Dvinn had separated. His mind weighed 
              the group's separation and concluded that an ambassador would not 
              be left alone. He followed the path the two had taken. It took him 
              10 minutes to catch up to the point of being able to see them and 
              realize his mistake.
            <br><br>Cursing, 
              he backtracked to pursue the other trail. To add speed, and the 
              power to track by smell, he shaped changed to a wolf and then set 
              out at a quick lope. Dvinn was in unfamiliar territory and wasn't 
              hard to catch up to. Niffun's plan was to follow him quietly, try 
              to determine who he was and what he was up to, and then capture 
              or kill him. He moved out to a parallel course and kept pace with 
              the Neriak as he picked his way through the dense forest.
            <br><br>Suddenly 
              the ambassador stopped. He stood perfectly still for several seconds. 
              Niffun did as well, but he wasn't really afraid that he had been 
              detected. He was a Halfing and a Druid. His ability to hunt silently 
              was something he was extremely proud of.
            <br><br>Dvinn turned 
              slowly in Niffun's direction and froze. Niffun could only see the 
              lower portion of his face. It was pale blue, with red lips that 
              were now turning up in an evil smirk.
            <br><br>"I know 
              you are there." Dvinn said.
            <br><br>Niffun 
              didn't answer, but doubt formed in his mind about whether he had 
              been actually detected or not.
            <br><br>Dvinn slipped 
              his hand under his robe and drew his Dragoon's dirk.
            <br><br>Upon seeing 
              it Niffun understood for the first time that he had hunted an administrator, 
              but found a seasoned warrior instead. "A prize," he though to himself, 
              "a prize indeed! No Elf can call me 'little Niffun' again if I bring 
              in a Neriak Dragoon!"
            <br><br>"Is Neriak 
              so strong that she can send her sons to die in Faydark?" Niffun 
              challenged in return.
            <br><br>"Yes," 
              Dvinn replied. "Not only to die, but to conquer."
            <br><br>"Are you 
              greater than your fathers who were driven from here in shame?" Dvinn's 
              eyes narrowed at the insult, and he chaffed at the arrogance of 
              the challenge. "I shall know that soon," he said as he moved toward 
              Niffun, "but you… you will be dead."
            <br><br>Niffun 
              cast a snaring spell to trap the Dragoon, but it had no effect at 
              all. Mildly annoyed, he cast it a second time; but again, it did 
              not take hold.
            <br><br>Dvinn laughed 
              and closed the distance between them. Still, Niffun was not dismayed. 
              He had time for one more spell, and selected his lightning spell. 
              It struck the Neriak, but had no visible effect. Niffun's arrogance 
              melted away, but not his confidence. Still in wolf form, he savagely 
              leaped for the throat of his foe. At the last possible moment Dvinn 
              parried with his right hand, and buried the dirk in his left hand 
              into the hindquarter of the wolf.
            <br><br>Niffun 
              yelped with pain, first from the slashing wound, and second as his 
              back hit a nearby rock as he was falling. Desperately he fought 
              to rise, but couldn't.
            <br><br>Dvinn stood 
              over him savoring the coming kill.
            <br><br>"Before 
              you die, I think you should know what is about to happen," Dvinn 
              gloated. "Orcs from Crushbone and Lesser Faydark, supported by Neriak 
              Regulars are going to besiege and destroy Kelethin, so your family 
              and friends, with the possible exception of your females, will soon 
              join you. Who would you prefer have your female? Me, or an Orc?" 
              Muhahahahahaha!
            <br><br>Niffun, 
              in pain, but not completely robbed of his senses, retorted. "You 
              mean the Neriak Regulars in Lesser Faydark that we killed today?"
            <br><br>Dvinn paused 
              for a moment and studied the eyes of his adversary, and then slowly 
              grinned. "Nice try. You are lying."
            <br><br>He raised 
              the dirk for the final blow, but it never fell. Ahnog came roaring 
              out of the darkness with a two-handed sword above his head and charged 
              Dvinn. The Neriak was completely surprised. Not knowing whether 
              or not the Dwarf was alone, he fled into the forest.
            <br><br>Niffun 
              yielded to his wounds and drifted into dark unconsciousness.
