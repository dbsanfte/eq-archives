            <p><strong><font size="+2">Guild Summit at SOE<br>
            June 4-6, 2004</font></strong></p>
            <p>So what are we to think of the recent guild summit held at the
              SOE headquarters? The vocal contingent of the community, as observed
              on various guild and public message boards, was skeptical. They
              wrote how this event was all about selling the latest expansion
              and EQII, not about fixing all the problems that are still in the
              game. A press junket, an SOE love fest, nothing will get solved,
              people wrote. The casual gamer won&#8217;t get a word in, it&#8217;s
              all about the uber guilds, and they are just pretending to care
              what the players think, right? Just more smoke blowing from the
              marketing department, they thought. But the invitees still came.</p>
            <p>Almost 60 guild leaders and the fan site press converged on San
              Diego, willing to give it a try, bringing with them questions and
              concerns from guild mates and the community about exactly what
              was wrong with the game. Woody of GU comics was an anticipated
              disgruntled guest, and indeed he did show up with a designer T-shirt
              reading &#8220;the first marketing person to talk to me gets hit.&#8221; As
              far as I know, no actual violence occurred. John Smedley kept his
              sense of humor and made a couple of jokes about it, and Woody took
              it all in stride, even when Tom Taylor lifted his wallet &#8211; all
              in good fun. But they were ready to take his concerns seriously,
              as they were everyone else&#8217;s. We were all there with questions,
              and the SOE staff and developers were all ready to answer them
              both Friday night at the ball game &#8211; I gotta say, people,
              the Padres are not the best ball team, are they &#8211; where Smed
              and many of the staff were there to talk to the attendees, and
              all day Saturday from 8am to 6:30 pm, and then at dinner after
              that until 11:00. Every staff member was available for questions,
              comments, and suggestions. And they really listened, discussed,
              and wrote things down. We had been provided in our welcome packets
              with a sheet of paper to list questions to ask the staff members
              and then turn into the SOE staff (both sides of an 8x 10 sheet,
              lots of room), which even included a space to indicate whether
              those questions had been addressed during the day, which seemed
              an auspicious start. The ball game was the first chance to talk
              informally with the SOE people, and although I didn&#8217;t sit
              next to any SOE staff members, I heard that good discussions had
              already started at the game before the formal meetings even began.</p>
            <p>I never fail to give Tom Taylor his due as an event coordinator,
              and I will do it again &#8211; he is organized, always around whatever
              is going on, and never fails to keep his sense of humor. Some of
              you may remember him from Fan Faire as being a great MC, which
              he is, but his organizational skills should be recognized because
              he really does make it seamless. Okay, enough Tom ass kissing,
              but really, he does a great job making sure people are where they
              are supposed to be and having a good time. So I think he deserves
              a mention.</p>
            <p>Brenlo, Alan Crosby, was also always there making sure everything
              was okay and people were having a good time. He&#8217;s also a
              lot of fun and seems to love his job.</p>
            <p>Breakfast on Saturday at the hotel gave people the opportunity
              to talk with other attendees and some of the SOE staff members,
              who mingled freely with the guests. If you think you know what
              kind of people show up at these events, I think you would be surprised
              at the variety of people who lead guilds on your servers. It was
              a very diverse crowd of all different kinds of people, with the
              ages ranging from 20s to 50s. There were perhaps 8 women there &#8211; not
              a surprise, perhaps, since it reflects the population ratio of
              men to women in the game in general. The one commonality to be
              found was the commitment to EQ and a love of the game, even after
              five years or more of playing for most of them. The crowd consisted
              almost overwhelmingly of very serious players. These were the guilds
              that had warriors with 700 AA and 14K hitpoints. One very nice
              woman I met had 22 characters total and led her guild with a 65
              enchanter. Another guild leader had 6 million personal plat legitimately
              earned in the bank. Everyone had brought questions and concerns
              from guild mates and message boards, and not just raiding guild
              questions, although obviously that was the focus of most of the
              group.</p>
            <p>It was fun just to sit around with people that morning who love
              EQ. I had a very enjoyable discussion with a group of six attendees
              over breakfast about all kinds of issues, including why most clerics
              and enchanters are female, and often played by females, armor variations,
              customizing characters, bear hats, and the over-use of pink armor.
              We were joined by one of the EQ artists, Tom Tobey, who talked
              to us about some of his animations. Turns out he worked on the
              new frog
              model animations, among other things. He told us that the new graphics
              engine, which is much more efficient than the old one, is allowing
              them
              to do
              much more interesting graphical things, including making the mobs
              much more believable in their movements and more streamlined in
              style. Over time, all the characters both NPCs and PCs will be
              redesigned into more sophisticated models. He has worked on getting
              the drogmars to move more smoothly as a recent
              project. His colleagues Dante and Adam draw, color and texture
              the models, and he gets to animate them so they look like they
              could really exist somewhere. I was able to talk to Adam later
              in the day about his career with
              SOE as an artist as well.</p>
            <p>After breakfast we all boarded buses to go to the SOE offices,
              where we were greeted by John Smedley, President of Sony Online
              Entertainment, and the entire SOE development staff. The SOE offices
              are actually in three
              buildings,
              housing
              the developers and artists, the servers, customer service, and
              the administrative offices. Sitting down at tables under a white
              tent in the warm weather outside, surrounded by blue and white
              balloons under a beautiful blue sky (Smed smugly pointed out to
              those of us who live in other climates the weather was like that
              all year round), we donned name tags and prepared to listen to
              what Smed had to say about this event. He set the tone immediately
              by saying, &#8220;we are not here to sell you anything, but to
              listen to what your concerns are and hear your suggestions. When
              you create a game and work this hard you don&#8217;t like to disappoint
              people or have them quit.&#8221; He also went on to surprise us
              by saying that the most common players are those between levels
              30 and 50. One of their toughest problems is to gear each expansion
              to the middle and high levels, to match where the fan base is at
              a particular time. He also want to dispel the myth that just one
              developer works on the game &#8211; each developer has a different
              responsibility, and they work together to put the entire system
              in place. The designers get royalties from the game, so they have
              every motivation for keeping players happy &#8211; but after spending
              two days with them, they really like designing a good playable
              game, too. They want things to work. As one of them said, &#8220;Perception
              does not always work in reality.&#8221; What they want to happen
              in the game doesn&#8217;t always pan out the way they expected.
              For instance, they decided not to beta test the Plane of Time because
              they wanted the first glimpses of the zone to be a surprise to
              everyone. The players explained that they would rather test something
              first and they didn&#8217;t have a problem with coming back to
              a zone again, multiple times, when it went live on the servers.
              The developers agreed that it would have been wiser to test it
              with a beta. They were quite eager to explain how things happen
              and why some content is not as they would like it when it is released.</p>
            <p>The developers and the SOE staff tried to make it clear they are
              very committed to making the game the best that it can be. They
              want to run EQ and EQII concurrently. In fact, Smedley said that
              if he could change one thing, it would be &#8220;not to name it
              EQII.&#8221; It is designed to be a different game. The EQ developers
              plan on keeping EQ around for at least another 10 years, they told
              us, and they want to keep making it better and retaining players.</p>
            <p>Smedley wanted general questions about the game to start out the
              day and people were at the ready. In a candid manner the staff
              indicated that they wanted to listen, dialogue, and fix problems
              in the game. Every development team member plays every day, he
              explained, some in high level guilds (and I learned that one of
              the developers that I met with in my break out group indeed used
              to run a high level guild on one of the servers). In fact, as part
              of the employee performance reviews, each person has to bring their
              character up at least 10 levels in actual play. One of the first
              questions was how Alan selected the people that came. The answer:
              a matrix that counted active play time. They felt the top community
              leaders, in the form of uber guild representatives, would have
              a unique top down perspective on the game, and could give them
              good feedback on the problems both in the endgame and for the lower
              levels of play. In response to a question about the Gates expansion,
              Smed explained that raising the level cap to 70 was originally
              slated for a two stage process, to be implemented as early as April
              of this year, to coincide with the release of the Gates of Discord
              expansion. It didn&#8217;t happen as planned, and so the cascade
              of events made the launch of Gates problematic, including the limiting
              the number of testers for Gates, which they felt was a mistake
              in hindsight. Nevertheless, it is hard to motivate players to come
              play on test, and they listened to suggestions about how it might
              be possible to get people to test content. For the next expansion,
              they hope to initiate entire guild moves, copying all characters
              and items to test for a real workout of the expansion by people
              who play together all the time. </p>
            <p>After the general meeting, we broke up into groups to tour the
              facilities. We were allowed everywhere, peering into staff cubicles,
              admiring concept art in the artist&#8217;s area, looking in the
              server room, in the operations room, and walking through the area
              where the GMs sit and interact with the players. As we all trooped
              through the GMs on duty kept on typing and working on problems,
              so they are out there!<br>
                <br>
                The first set of meetings was held in the morning with members
                of the development team. They sat groups of 10 of us in a conference
                room around a table and sent two hapless developers in to take
                the heat, in the case of my group, designers Ryan Barker, who
                does spells, and Aikil Hooper, who designed the Tribute system
                among other things. It soon became clear that this was a real
                discussion about issues that people cared about. The developers
                freely admitted that Gates was rushed onto the live servers,
                and it had problems. It was originally designed for the new levels
                coming out with Omens of War, which they ended up not being able
                to implement in time for Gates &#8211; so some of the content
                was geared for players up to level 70. The testing was not what
                they had hoped, they had very little time to do what they wanted,
                and the results were what you might expect &#8211; content that
                many players don&#8217;t want to spend time doing. The goals
                for Gates were also different than the Planes of Power expansion &#8211; the
                content prevented progression, rather than obtaining keys. It
                was designed to be a test of player skill and readiness. Winning
                the encounters was about how well you played, and it was meant
                to be hard. After the meeting, the guild leader representative
                from the server I play on said he would be willing to try it
                again after hearing what was communicated in the discussion.</p>
            <p>We were allowed to discuss whatever we wanted in these meetings
              and the developers gave candid and thoughtful answers to the issues
              the players brought up. In my group, we discussed the following
              ideas, and more:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>&#8226; Changing specific mobs in a zone. The developers explained
                that changes will be systemic for the most part, rather than
                specific, because it is often very hard to balance specific mob
                changes in
                a zone.<br>
&#8226; The AI system. They would like a more sophisticated AI for the
                NPCs, and are working on that.<br>
&#8226; Rain spells are limited in efficiency to put a cap on kiting more
                than about 4 mobs at a time.<br>
&#8226; 
                The idea of a chain heal and other chain spells, such as an infection
                spell, which jump from one player to another, are something the
                development team is kicking around. It&#8217;s a concept right
                now, and they are not sure how useful it would be.<br>
&#8226; 
                Cleric invisibility was asked for. It&#8217;s probably never
                going to happen, but some potions might get improved invisibility
                as
                a compromise.<br>
&#8226; 
                Ryan and Aikil both agreed that death penalties are important to
                the game, so diminishing them by coming up with resurrection spells
                that would bring back mana and health right away would not add
                anything to the game. The players didn&#8217;t agree, arguing
                that it would waste less time on raids.<br>
&#8226; Call of the Hero was discussed, and it was suggested that it would
                be helpful to be able to summon across zone lines. This they
thought that although not a bad idea, would be difficult to keep from being
                exploited, so they were going to consider how it might be done.
                They did agree that any zone with CoH capability should have
necro summoning as well, but any zone without CoH should not have necro
                summoning. Sort of all or nothing.<br>
&#8226; Expanding the number of buff slots<br>
&#8226; Progressive instanced dungeon raids were something people liked
                the idea of.<br>
&#8226; The raid numbers in LDoN are now fixed at 54 and they are not going
                to change that again. Raids will not be scaleable.<br>
&#8226; Removing augments or making augments an item. They are at least
                going to be reusable.<br>
&#8226; Putting tradeskilling items in LDoN chests.<br>
&#8226; Different mounts for different races (never going to happen).</p>
            </blockquote>            <p>The developers were very willing to listen and discuss what was
              going on in the game and what their ideas and thoughts were about
              the issues that people brought up. They considered the ideas our
              round table proposed to them, discussed the pros and cons of each,
              and took notes. There was no sense that the ideas weren&#8217;t
              being taken seriously. It was real discussion with game designers
              and players.</p>
            <p>At the barbeque lunch, I ended up having a very interesting conversation
              with two of the artists, Tom and Adam. Tom is an animator, and
              Adam designs models. They don&#8217;t
              really get any feedback on their work most of the time, and would
              love
              to
              hear
              from the
              players on what models are good, or what the players think of their
              work. I also discussed making avatars more unique and the faction
              system and its importance in the game with Alan Van Couvering and
              Scott Hartsman. I expressed my opinion that by losing the faction
              system, there are no consequences to a character&#8217;s actions,
              making the world a little less real and immersive. They took some
              notes during our conversation, and were very serious about considering
              the idea of faction again. Scott especially felt that faction brought
              another dimension to the game, which was one of the driving ideas
              behind Velious. So if faction comes back, you can blame me, I suppose!</p>
            <p>The role players are out there, and were represented by the site
              director of EQRoleplayers.com. I had a very nice conversation with
              her. She plays a lawful good enchanter and leveled her character
              up without ever playing with an evil race! Wow, is all I can say. </p>
            <p>After lunch, we had our customer service meeting. Our group met
              with the lead GM, who was a little nervous about meeting all these
              players face to face! We didn&#8217;t cause her any bodily harm
              or yell at her, so she quickly got more comfortable with the ten
              of us. George Scotto, the head of Customer Service, also joined
              us to talk about the changes they are making to allow the GMs and
              guides to respond more quickly to petitions. The focus now is on
              efficiency and taking less time to address player concerns. Currently,
              the average response time is 33 hours for a petition, but they
              hope to cut that down by implementing the following tools:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>&#8226; Persistent messaging to players: when a GM contacts
                you, even if you are not in game, you will get a message when
                you log
                  on that you have a message from the GM.<br>
&#8226; Restoring items when you are off line<br>
&#8226; A graveyard GM shift for players from other time zones or for those
                  that play different hours<br>
&#8226; A sorting system for customer problems, such as a drop down menu
                  with choices, that will allow the GMs to determine what the
problem is more quickly and respond appropriately</p>
            </blockquote>            <p>They passed out a sheet that outlines a program they are implementing
              in the near future for registered guild leaders, where the guild
              leaders can email SOE at a special address during a raid event,
              using problem categories in the subject line of the email. The
              response time for these guild leader emails (the guild leader must
              be registered with SOE) is targeted at 15-30 minutes. If this pilot
              program works then the model can be used for the general population
              to lower response times for petitions. We had a very lively discussion
              with the customer survey team about letting guild leaders know
              the reasons why guild members were banned (not going to happen
              because of privacy issues), the safeguards they take to make sure
              GMs are doing their jobs, and other customer service issues. The
              question of inappropriate names came up, and the GM explained how
              they decide to rename someone after a complaint. Basically, they
              want to give any player with an inappropriate name the chance to
              change it on their own, and stupid names, although annoying, are
              probably not going to be changed. The CS staff was extremely open
              and candid with everyone in the room, and there was no feeling
              of &#8220;us against them.&#8221; It was clear they want to be
              professional and sympathetic when dealing with the customers, and
              they really didn&#8217;t want to make arbitrary name decisions.
              They mentioned the Indian phone support and explained they only
              handle the simplest of problems (and not name changes as English
              is not their native language), and anything that takes research
              goes to a GM in San Diego.</p>
            <p>And there was more. Everyone was drinking Red Bulls by this time!
              We met with the developers again, including the programmer who
              is the collision expert. The group members praised him for explaining
              on EQLive exactly what he did with the collision system, and he
              agreed he would try to post more of what they did technically on
              fixes in the future. We learned that every day the developers read
              10-15 pages of feedback and bug reports from the test and live
              server, each team member looking at the parts of the report in
              his special area (Ryan Barker looks for spell problems, for instance).</p>
            <p>They let us know that they really wanted this to be a strategic
              and not a user-interface oriented game. It was clear from a day
              of discussion that designing a game as complicated as EverQuest,
              balancing mobs, classes, spell effects, and the environment takes
              much forethought on what changes will do to the game as a whole
              and even a zone. Changing one spell or one monster can send ripples
              of impact over the entire game.</p>
            <p>One issue that came up again and again was backflagging, something
              they really wanted to solve as it is impacting the social structure
              of the game and that matters to the developers. They want people
              to be able to play with friends and guilds to advance in the game.</p>
            <p>Some suggestions from our group were more dragons in the game,
              more dungeon areas like Sebilis, and better heal spells for druids
              and shaman. The developers and Tamara from Marketing really pushed
              the group to come up with some new ideas for the game, things that
              players wanted.</p>
            <p>After the meetings, we all went to dinner for more informal conversations
              with the entire SOE team. Each table at the Rock Bottom Brewery
              had at least two staff members for 6 players. My table had a programmer
              and the tradeskills developer who were very happy to chat with
              us about the game.</p>
            <p>At the end of the summit, the SOE staff had a meeting and released
              this sheet at dinner that contained a synopsis of the ideas they
              were planning on working on:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dear Guild and Community Representatives,</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thank you very much for a great Summit! By all accounts it was
                a huge success. I can speak for the EverQuest Development Team
                and tell you that we're all grateful for the input you provided.
                In fact, in trying to generate this list to give you this evening,
                we realized there was so much to go over that we wouldn't be able
                to get a complete list together in time. We're committed to not
                only listening to your feedback, but working with you to make EverQuest
                more enjoyable for years to come.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, we decided to list the Top Ten themes we would address starting
                Monday, as well as the most common themes that we'll come back
                with more information on by mid-week next week.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A quick discussion resulted in a list of items that we will immediately
                address:<br>
&#8226; Add scripting to shut off empty instances of Plane of Time <br>

&#8226; Guild and individual rewards for guild beta testing <br>
&#8226; Work on larger To Do list...I know this one is a little random</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Future items we will immediately begin looking at and discussing
                are as follows:<br>
&#8226; Plane of Time instancing and other issues <br>

&#8226; Solo LDON-Style instances or similar content <br>
&#8226; Issues with item augmentations <br>
&#8226; Possible enhancement to guild wars</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course these aren't all of items. You brought us a CD, 2 books,
                20 printed sheets, and a manifesto. We'll need to go through all
                of those and our notes before we can really get a good tally of
                all the wonderful ideas and questions that were presented.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thank you again for
                  your feedback and participation. We&#8217;ve
                  had a great weekend and a wonderful display of things to come.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sincerely,<br>

            </blockquote>            
            <p>I was very impressed by the passion and commitment the SOE team
              has to the game, and the work they put into making this Guild Summit
              a productive session between players and developers. The rumor
              is that there will be another one in six months or so, so keep
              your eyes open.  I met and talked to so many people, so if I forgot
              to mention you, my apologies ...<br>
