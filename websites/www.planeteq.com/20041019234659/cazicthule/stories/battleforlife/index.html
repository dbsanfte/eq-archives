<b class="heading">A Battle for Life</b><br>
<i>by</i> Ninara

<br><br>
 I prayed to Tunare the mother of all to aid me in my journeys for the day. I heard foot steps behind me heavy ones with full armor on ready for a battle no doubt. I put one hand on my axe and the other on my whip preparing for a fight to the death with my attacker.
<br><br>
Just when I was preparing to attack I turned to face my attacker I raised my axe to slice and I lowered my whip to strike. I hear "Ninara stop it's me Rynn" said my best friend Rynn, &quot;whoa that was close one more second and your head and arm would have been at my feet.
<br><br>
"Sorry for interrupting your prayers Nin " said Rynn. That's okay I was about finished any ways. "Well you had better pray for grace for a battle that we are going to fight soon" what battle would that be just ask Tunare for the answer to that question. As I knelt down to the ground and began to pray again I heard A voice inside me not in my head but in my heart it said "
<br><br>
Ninara prepare for a battle to bo fought on the ground behind you it will be fought to let any one worship me do so in free will. To prepare for this battle place your weapons on my alter before you then step into the roots of my blessed tree and thorny vines will grow over you to make you a armor to protect you in this fight. I must leave you now but I will be watching over this fight if you need help just call out my name and I will be here to do so." I will Tunare I will then I rose to my feet and placed my whip axe and bow next to Rynn's to be blessed. Then in a bright flash of light I knew that they had been blessed. I picked up my bow and slung it over my back as I usually did and as I did I felt stronger and that I had the power to call fire from the sky. As I placed my axe in my main hand and my whip in the other I felt power flux through my body from the axe and my whip made me feel resolvent. At the same time I noticed that Rynn's sword now had the color of ebony and she had look on her face that she had grown stronger.
<br><br>
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://ads.gamespyid.com/ad.aspx?S=planeteverquest&A1=NONE&G1=RPG&T=3&P2=0&A2=0&A3=300x250?unique"></script>
 
Then we stepped over to Tunare's tree we stepped into the roots and as we did a sort of armor made out of thorny vines that gave us more power and some how protected us from harm. Just as we stepped out of the tree and made a vow not to run from the fight and that if one of use was poised to the extent that we would die a long painful death that we would kill the other one. Just as we did we herd marching in the distance. Rynn cast a spell to let her see in the distance but only for a moment and she saw a group of soldiers clad in all black armor carrying weapons of pure black. And we knew that they where the ones who where going to fight us. As soon as they got close enough we started to let our arrows fly we took down two of them. There where still about a dozen of them left we then prepared our selves for the fight of our life. As we battled we fought them we took one down after another but they just kept coming like they could rise from the dead. Rynn run now I will hold them off "no I will not run " just as she said that I felt a sharp stabbing pain in my back. No they just backstabbed me and poised me with it. "They did the same to me " shouted Rynn. Rynn we must ask Tunare for help. Tunare I am asking for help I can't win this fight without your help. Just as I did I hear a voice in the wind that says "combine your power and let it out in one mighty burst I will strike them down then and only then". Rynn did you just hear what I just heard " yeah lets do it". At that moment we ran togther and made our powers one and then a surge of power left us and as it did I could see all of the men on the field of battle fall to the ground dead. Tunare I thank you for your help " Ninara help I can't move and I am growing weaker" Rynn so am I. " I am sorry my children but I couldn't revers te effects of the spell put on you, but for your service I will not let you perish but live on in a different for still serving me and never dying but changing lives of those who need protecting. Thank you Tunare but when will this pain end " it will end now ninara and the same for you Rynn" goodbye old friend " it's not goodbye it's hello again good friend. And at that moment my life ended but it also began again for me and Rynn and whoever we would be protecting.
<br><br>
Chapter 1 A new life begins:
<br><br>
I awoke in a cloud of mist I felt lighter than I had ever before I looked down at my feet and saw that they where transparent like air or mist. I looked to my left and saw my friend Rynn the same way then I looked ahead and saw Tunare just like us. "Thank you my servants or serving me with courage. I need you to go to Kelethin to protect and give love to a half elf bard that serves me there she is lonely and carries the knowledge of where my next temple will be built and the evil orcs of faydware want her dead. She has not been able to find a man that will love her and take her hand in marriage so I need you two to go there and protect her and love her till I call you away again." I will go there Tunare
<br><br>
"and I the same" said Rynn. "I must tell you one knowledge one of you will be in the form of a child while the other will be her pet a wolf but they will have the power at night to turn into a human child" . I will go as the wolf Tunare I might serve you better in that form than that of the child "why do you say that nin" you are a better people person remember the incident in the bar in Freeport "oh yeah I remember you got into the fight with that ogre beat him bare handed too I feel sorry for that guy." "Okay I will do this for you but I will have o take your knowledge of where you are and how you got there. Okay well I am ready "so am I" said Rynn. "Then here we go in three 1.. 2.. 3.. . Just as Tunare said that I hear a poof and I can't remember anything before that. I awake in a basket next to Rynn but she doesn't look like herself but the same to me and I look down and see that I have paws like a wolfs, but then I fall asleep again and see nothing but a bright green field where a little girl and her dog are playing and having fun. Then I awake to find myself next to Rynn or I think it's Rynn we are lying in a bed and then Rynn wakes up and just then a half elf female walks in singing a very happy song. "Well its good to see you are awake now what is your name" I go to speak but find I can't then I realize I am in a wolfs body "my name is Rynn" the little girl says " and this is ninara my pet wolf cub" "well that's a interesting name for a wolf cub well my name is Cait faith full half elf bard of tuanre I bet you two are hungry get dressed and then come into the next room I will have something for the both of you to eat."" Umm I don't have any clothes do you have anything I can wear and ninara could use a collar so hunters around here wont kill her for sport or food"" you don't have to worry about the hunters hunting for sport not here we are mostly worshipers of Tunare and treasure life above all things so we only kill for food and self defense. As for the clothes you just wrap up in this blanket and i will go fix you something for both of you to eat then go to the tailors and have them make you a outfit to wear till we both can go and get you some more for you to wear." "Thank you" Rynn said " and what should I call you cait or what?". "You may call me mother or some thing along those lines" said cait. "Okay mom it is then" said Rynn and this is where I can no longer tell the story for now I mostly become a wolf except for night and then I can't remember much from then. Hello I am Cait and this is the story of me and my child Rynn and or pet wolf ninara. My story begins a couple of hours after I found them on my doorstep in a basket with only a blanket covering them. "Mom what is here to eat I am getting hungry and so is ninara she is gnawing on my blanket ,and its getting cold in here I could use some clothes" said Rynn. Okay hold on ne sec I got some bread cakes in the oven cooking and I will get you a skin of milk to drink as for the clothes everything I own will be to big for you while you eat I will run to the tailors and get the to make you a outfit to hold you over till we can get you some more clothes. Here are the bread cakes and milk and a bowl of bread and milk for ninara I will be right back I am going to go get you some clothes don't leave the house this city can be dangerous we do live hundreds of feet in the air and the fall would surely kill you" okay mom we won't leave. Then I left with my speed song playing at full speed with my mm drum I got to the tailors just as they where finishing the outfit I had ordered it was a brown shirt with the tree semble of kelethin on it and a short brow skirt that would be perfect for Rynn to run and play in and some brow boots so that they wouldn't wear out so quickly. I picked up the clothes then ran back to the house just to see them finishing off the food I had prepared for them. " Oh hey mom glad to see you are back the food was great thanks for it." Good glad to hear you enjoyed it here is the outfit I got for you . " It's beautiful I love it and it fits what do you want to do now." "Well I was thinking we should take you to meet the local guild leaders to find a profession for you we will visit the bard hall and the ranger hall and the druid hall and maybe the warrior hall to if need be. " That sounds good but can we do it tomorrow I want to see the city tonight if that's okay with you" said Rynn okay that's what we shall do. We walked around the city for once in my life I felt loved as we where walking we where on our way home when we reached the druid hall and we decide to talk with the guild leader to see if Rynn would be able to become a druid to see if she had the skills and to see if she had the spirt to call upon nature to cast the spells of Tunare. We walked in and we saw the guild leader speaking to some new recruits older than Rynn but they seemed different younger in spirt the guild leader said "welcome cait who might this be with you" said the guild leader. This is my daughter Rynn and her pet wolf ninara we have come to have her tested to see if she is of strong enough of will and spirt. "Well then let the test begin first for the test of will she must call upon nature to defend her self against a weak spell I will cast, and for the spirt that test shall revel it's self." Ryn are you ready for the first test "yes mother I" said Rynn " then prepare your self " said the guild leader. The guild leader begins to recite the words for a damage spell then Rynn says "nature I call upon your spirt in the tress to protect me in this task oh great Tunare grant me this wish." And all of the sudden her skin takes on the appearance of bark just as it did the guild leader finished reciting the spell and a flash of light consumed the room and a bolt of light hit Rynn knocking her back a little but other than that it did no harm. "Good her will is strong" said the leader "for the rest of the tests you must join our ranks and study with us for a year" said the leader. "No I will not join your ranks I must stay with my mother I am all she has so I will not leave her for no reason." "Good you are welcome as a druid of Tunare for you have passe the test of spirt and will your spirt of love was sop strong that you would nolt leave your mother even to become a powerful druid int eh service of Tunare this proves to me how strong your spirt it is. We shall begin your training in a week for now learn these basic spells they will aide you in your training and service to Tunare and I will bless your wolf with a powerful spirt to be held inside her till she needs it to protect you she will have the speed of a wolf and the strength of a bear the power to breath under water like a fish the power to soar like a eagle. This wolf shall protect you and your mother like tuanre protects us all." I thank you for your help master druid what can we do to further her training while we are away from this hall for I travel a lot working for Tunare. "What you may do is when she can cast the spells I give you flawlessly then she shall be ready to learn some more ,but one she reaches the 5 rank of casting she shall have to spells she has learned to find the other ones. Once she reaches this level she shall be ready for the final test to prove she can fight for Tunare." "I shall do this master" said Rynn.
<br><br>
Chapter 2 A new chapter in Rynn's life:
<br><br>
Hail my name is Rynn this is the story of how I grew to become a powerful druid. Hey mom where are we going today "we are heading to erduin I have heard of some poachers in the tox forest that Tunare wants dispelled we will stop in surefall glade to see if you can get your next rank of spells." Okay that sounds good do we have to take the boats again I get sea sick on them and ninara goes nuts. At the time this story is taking place I have just turned 16 along with ninara and now I can truly protect my mother. Ninara has gone thru may changes into her human form but unlike her wolf form which has been growing so everytime she appres as her humdan form she is only a little girl. "Rynn get ninara we must be off or we will miss th Boat and we will have time to stop by kalidim.
