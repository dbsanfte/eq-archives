  The evening began with a rather easy slaying of The Itraer Vius. Gratz Jord
  on Sunbeam Staff. He also dropped Itraer Insignia and Collar of Tavuel Xakreum
  which were awarded to Ty and Sprig not sure who got which =p. We then took
  an orderly march to Wester Wastes where Klandicar was beaten like a rag doll
  gratz to me on Klandicar's Talisman . After that our scouts reported our favorite
  permarooted ToV mob was up so we paid her a visit gratz to Wolfz on Ring of
  Relkententinar and Velium Maul of Superiority Gratz to Nenulwen on Lendiniara's
  Talisman and once again gratz to me on Truesight Helm.</p>
            <p>A very productive evening for the machine.</p>

  The call is given, a guildie needs help. The response ... a well oiled and
  formidable machine rolled thru PoN in small numbers but great power taking
  out Vhaksiz the Shade with little trouble. Congrats Stormie on the heart of
  the shade!<br>

              Submitted by Fairsong on 02/10/04...  Finally getting around to
              a full update of the news. Sorry for the delay and I know Im not
              gonna have everything down correctly but here goes.</p>
            <p>Congrats to Mindaarie on her Epic...She completed her epic on
              the 4th of this month after a stellar rampage down to the Royals
              in Chardok. It was a grand night as we dropped both King and Queen,
              then while Mind did the final running around to set up for the
              Rage take down we slipped into Griegs and put the hurt on the Servitor.</p>
            <p><img src="file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/m-miron/My%20Documents/My%20Pictures/guildnews/dkr1a.jpg" width="450" height="247"></p>
            <p>Then it was off to Skyfire to complete one of the most used epics
              in the game.</p>
            <p><img src="file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/m-miron/My%20Documents/My%20Pictures/guildnews/dkr2.jpg" width="450" height="338"><br>
              Congrats to Ziam on his Epic...Last night was another slash and
                hack night with dragons dropping dead all over the place. We
                set up in the Halls of Testing in ToV while waiting for the numbers
                to gather up. Ziam scooped up a plate bracer, Houf got a new
                helm, and Sevi got boots and a bracer while we waited. With our
                numbers at a comfortable level we decided to test our selves
                against a very worthy foe. And like the little engine that could
                we put this bad boy down with only 2 peeps dropping at the very
                end. Im sure the next time we can go for the flawless victory
                as we picked up a few tricks and learned a couple of things as
                well.</p>
            <p><img src="file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/m-miron/My%20Documents/My%20Pictures/guildnews/dkr3.jpg" width="500" height="375"></p>
            <p>After this foul beast was left to rot, we then headed over to
              Skyfire for a return visit in less than a weak. Rage the wuss lasted
              less than 30 seconds and Ziam quickly knelt down to loot the prized
              heart that many clerics work very hard to achieve. Ziam and Mindaarie
              were no exception to this as they both waited along time. Grats
              again to both of them.</p>
            <p><img src="file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/m-miron/My%20Documents/My%20Pictures/guildnews/dkr4.jpg" width="550" height="413"></p>
            <p><br>
              We also stuck around last night and helped another cleric drop
                Rage as well so the server now has another clicky stick to count
            among its ranks as well.</p>
            <p>Also wanted to post up this screen of Gore,
                  who dropped to us a couple of weaks back and forked over those
                  rare pally books.
              Grats to the pally on those loots as I dont recall her name atm.</p>            <p><img src="file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/m-miron/My%20Documents/My%20Pictures/guildnews/dkr5.jpg" width="600" height="450"></p>

            <p>The 10th day... | <br>
              Posted by: Hideto on Wednesday, February 11, 2004 - 04:58 AM <br>
              <br>
              Well I been lazy and havent updated in a while. What has ioa been
            upto these past 10 days or so you ask?<br>
            <img src="file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/m-miron/My%20Documents/My%20Pictures/guildnews/ioa1.jpg" width="500" height="400"></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><img src="file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/m-miron/My%20Documents/My%20Pictures/guildnews/ioa3.jpg" width="500" height="400"><br>
                As you can see we have been very busy these past 10 days. Everywhere
                from Rallos Zek to PoAir to Vex Thal..we have been in straight
                farm mode. We have mainly been backflagging so that we can make
                a strong charge into the elemetals. First up on our mission was
                Bert who was one of the last mobs holding a bunch of people back
                for the ele's. Grats to Kolrath on your The Rotting Fistand Jaskur
                on the symbol of the plaguebringer . This was our first Bert
                kill in a long time and I think we did it in record time. With
                bert dead we got about 15 more flagged for eles, so we took our
                first exploratory run and got a nice mask for Beandoh and Renek
                on a nice leather cap.</p>
            <p>I think it was Thursday or something
                    we found
                  Rallos Zek up and decieded it was his time to die....again.
              We didn't get to see a BoW drop but still got a lot of much needed
                  flags and some decent loots. Grats Kenaf on Boots and Tannus
                  on The collar of boundless stuff .</p>
            <p>Monday brought our first
                major elemental raid. Some minis and the Avatar of Wind were
              up in
                    PoAir and we were there. All our hard work backflaging paid
                off
                    as we were able to get about 54 into the zone and kill the
                Avatar + 3 mini named flawlessly. We got about 4-5 loots including
                our
                    first elemtal mold, a Chain bracer that went to Rakhal, Grats. </p>            <p><img src="file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/m-miron/My%20Documents/My%20Pictures/guildnews/ioa5.jpg" width="500" height="400"></p>
            <p>We also got a nice cape! that went to tanniz and Mask (link above)
                  went to suttoy. Twan finally gothimself a nice new weapon!
              . Tonight (tuesday) was the launch day of GoD, which I will have
                  to say went pretty well as far as SoE usual track reccord.
              The
                  server didnt crash once yet it is schuedualed for an update
              tongiht (woot patches!!!!). Regardless we got VT to ourseleves
              today
                  and we cleared it all in record time. There were over 30 loots
                  sorry I didnt get a list this time. I do remeber that AHR loots
                  were: Xaldren got the Orb, Chrono got the gloves, Sveva on
              the ring, and Yourstruely (hideto) on the tailsman! Grats to everyone
                  on the loot it was a good much needed farm indeed. We have
              gotten
                  a ton off loot I would say over 50 loots in the past week (29
              last night alone in VT. Good work.<br>
              <br>
              Anyone up for a Marathon? | <br>
              Posted by: Hideto on Sunday, February 01, 2004 - 10:37 AM <br>
              <br>
              Well the past few days have been busy, ever since Monday's death
              of RZ we been at it non stop, including one 12+ hour raid on VT!.
              On Tuesday not much was
    up so we backflagged and got AD (grats whatever apps on whatever loot droped).
    After, a few did hedge runs, while most of the guild explored the new elemental
    planes. On Wedsnesday not much was up so we continued on doing the backflagging
    thing... Sol Ro mins for flags and loot where first up, Jiva = owned. Grats
    to Caymon on your new Rebb, that thing owns! We then took a quick peek into
    PoAir and killed Queen Easy err sildaienada or somehting....Grats Jabis on
    your new mask. We were about to head for the Ring of Mist when VZ spawned
              and was uncamped. We made a b-line for tatics and with the help
              of some CT's we
    waxed VZ for some much needed backl flags! Oh ya and gratz to Sveva and Angel
    on thier new hammers. </p>
            <p>For some unkown reason the Cazic-Thule server crashes more than
              any server that Sony operates, making that either a terriably good
              or bad thing for us, and this week it was both. Thursadays brought
              with it an emegency patch we got some ssra named...namely the EMPEROR! </p>
            <p><img src="file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/m-miron/My%20Documents/My%20Pictures/guildnews/ioa7.jpg" width="500" height="400"> </p>
            <p>Grats Nish you lucky bastard on your new sword (first one we have
              ever seen), Ozz on the Cloak, and Dean on the horse.<br>
            </p>
            <p>That night lo and behold, CT went down not once but twice! (The
              Good) IoA formed early and got to VT on a full spawn! With low
              numbers we start making our dent into vt and clearing towards AHR.
              Here is a small collection of what we got.</p>
            <p><img src="file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/m-miron/My%20Documents/My%20Pictures/guildnews/ioa8.jpg" width="500" height="400"></p>
            <p>So We cleared all off VT and we are outside of Aten Ha Ra door,
              its about midnight and many poeple have been in vt for 10 straight
              ours, we go to open AHR door and guess what! </p>
            <p>&quot;You have been disconected&quot; (The BAD)</p>
            <p>I HATE sony...feel free to fix your friggin servers. So VT crashes,
              we dont get ahr end of story right? Wrong. We somehow manage to
              live through the server crash and wind up next to AHR blob (blob2)
              room, with full VT up! So at 1am, we start clearing VT for a second
              time. We only manage to get another set of Blob2's and another
              Blob1 but all in all we got about 40+ loots..So we didnt get AHR
              but we did get 3 extra mobs!</p>
            <p>Here is one of the better ones:</p>
            <p><img src="file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/m-miron/My%20Documents/My%20Pictures/guildnews/ioa9.jpg" width="500" height="400"><br>
              Good Job everyone on the 6-14 hour marathon raid depending on who
                you are. All in all we got about 41 loots with most everyone
                getting some loot (and others like WOODSING getting 3 pieces!).
                Even Shorrtee got in on the action! </p>
            <p>There were many more that I didnt list or forget what dropped...basically
              it was a loot fest!<br>
              Sorry for the lack of links, you can look them up yourself on alla's!! </p>
            <p>IoA is currently looking for a few ACTIVE Rogues, Bards, Pallies
              and Necros....Got what it takes? Join here.<br>

  Welcome to the Elemental Planes Illusion Of Apathy | <br>
  Posted by: Hideto on Tuesday, January 27, 2004 - 09:04 AM <br>
  <br>
  The day has arived.</p>
            <p><br>
              What once seemed all but imposible, has happend. The feat which
                all other guilds said we couldn't do has been done in house with
                65 people (+ 1 railus, thanks bro) first try of the night with
                minimal deaths. What can I say? We Fukin owned hard tonight,
            clerics, kiters everyone, what a clean and near flawless kill. </p>
            <p><img src="file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/m-miron/My%20Documents/My%20Pictures/guildnews/ioa15.jpg" width="650" height="520"></p>
            <p>Grats to Manadar on the Red Eyed Mask of Rage and Anaraei and
              the Grimfaced Visor<br>
              <br>
              Oh and to our friends over at OC who zoned in 50 people the WHOLE
                time we were doing the RZ script to LAG us out.....again....bad
            tatic, that one was for you! </p>
            <p><img src="file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/m-miron/My%20Documents/My%20Pictures/guildnews/ioa16.gif" width="500" height="339"><br>
              So anyways, after we OWNED RZ, it was only 8:45 pm...since nothing
                else was up we headed over to VT to try to get some more loot.
                Grats to:</p>
            <p>Fanorn - Shield <br>
              Ian - Orb <br>
              Vynaen - Helm <br>
              Debjorn - Amulet <br>
              Klou - Staff <br>
              Xald - Book </p>
            <p>It was a nice way to finsih the day, 8 loots and about 65 ele
              flags! WTG.</p>
            <p>It seems IoA 2.0 has really shown what it is capable of. The combination
              of our recent additions to the guild and all of our old-timeers
              with thier knowldege and exprience has really proven to be leathal.<br>

  Lord Mith Marr doesnt stand a chance to IoA 2.0 | <br>
  Posted by: Hideto on Thursday, January 22, 2004 - 08:33 AM <br>
  <br>
  Oh ya so yesterday we finally spawned RZTW on got him to 30% for first try&#8230; he
  must and will die, it only a matter of catching him up with more than 55 flaged
  people online. </p>
            <p>Anyways on today&#8230;</p>
            <p>Thanks to your friendly neighborhood TR, IoA plans for RZ&#8217;s
              dirt nap had to be postponed until further notice coughnexttimehesupcough...well
              it turned out to be for the good for us I guess cuz Lord Mith Marr
              decided it was his time to die. At 8pm with only 40 people on we
              headed over to the Temple of Marr. It took a while for flagged
              people to join raid, however with out too much delay we were off
              and rolling. I would like to say that in the days that followed
              the guild &#8220;shakeup&#8221; one of my deariest friend slapya
              told me, &#8220;It is impossible for IoA to ever kill Mith Marr
              again. He will never die to you guys in house again&#8230;well
              I would like to say to my beloved slapya is:</p>
            <p><img src="file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/m-miron/My%20Documents/My%20Pictures/guildnews/ioa18.jpg" width="650" height="520"></p>
            <p>Not to mention the fight was pretty much flawless except for flux
              who died on the suicide tash&#8230;this buds for you slap! Great
              job all around guys, espcially the clerics very nice job. This
              was a really clean kill way better than we have ever done &#8220;before.&#8221; Grats
              to Nishn00ba on his belt and Twan and the nice new range item.
              Oh ya guess what rakhal, by the time we had finished up the flawless
              MM kill it was only 10:45, well before 11pm! Maybe people felt
              inspired! </p>
            <p>Another pic that Chrono send me:</p>
            <p><img src="file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/m-miron/My%20Documents/My%20Pictures/guildnews/ioa19.jpg" width="450" height="338"></p>
            <p>Since we still had some time to spare we off Jiva. Did I ever
              tell you how much I love sol ro? We got a good 6 ornate drops (Sveva
              legs, Radik Bracer, Rreckrrrrr Sleeves, someone else on a bracer,
              someone else on something else&#8230;.)&#8230;and ya we got Jiva
              and she dropped a nice ring for Como who secretly has something
              going for for Jiva. That twink Jaguarx took the questionable sword.
              Overall it was a nice little clearing. </p>
            <p><br>

            Posted by: [Pirotess] on February 12th, 2004 @ 05:26 PM </p>
            <p>Well I finally got sick of the way the site looks. We're going
              to be around for a good long while so I figure its time to finally
              polish off the site some more. Im currently looking for an experienced
              Graphic Artist to design a new logo, guild icon and button set
              for the website. Since I want the work to be exceptional this will
              be a paid endevor, I am not asking for freebie work.</p>
            <p>If you are interested in taking this job or know someone who is,
              please email me with your rates and portfolio/links to existing
              work. If you do not have a portfolio or links to existing work
              we may still be able to work together but I will need to have you
              workup a sample to get a feel for your skill. <br>
