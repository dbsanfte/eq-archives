I have played D&amp;D since the early 80's (hehe, im showing me age here :)) And i remember all the hassle i got from people concerning my 'satanic' hobby. What a croc, all people want is scapegoats as you say. Those who beleive that eq is a roleplaying game are im sad to say, totally wrong. If it where a true r/p game then we would be free to do whatever we want as our charachter dictated! I know that i as a noble human warrior would bash in dark elves at every opportunity just to rid the land of there evil :) However this isnt possible in just about any mmorpg. This looks like some of the new games coming out 'might' be able to do this but i'll wait and see.</P><P>The only roleplaying game that i have ever played on a pc that came close was daggerfall (remember that old chestnut?). It allowed complete freedom to do as you chose, wanna kill guards? do it. Wanna kill peasants? do it.</P><P>But i digress, the whole point of this rant is to say that i found it to be a well written and well thought out article that makes very good points!</P><P>Keep up the good work.</P><P>Elof</P><P>P.S Love the site :)</P><P>dont blame me i only live here :)</font></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor='#6F6559' valign="top"><font color='#ffffff' face='Verdana, Arial, Helvetica' size='2'>tryzak</font></td><td bgcolor='#6F6559'  valign='top' ><font color='#ffffff' face='Verdana, Arial, Helvetica' size='1'>Posted - 17 October 2000 15:52 PST</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="Javascript:openWindow('profile.asp?mode=display&id=19697')"><img src='profile.gif' alt='Show Profile' border=0 align='absmiddle' hspace=6></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href='mail.asp?id=19697'><img src='email.gif' alt='Email Poster' border=0 align='absmiddle' hspace=6></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href='post.asp?method=edit&reply_id=130213&auth=19697&forum_title=EQ+Tavern&topic_title=Comments%3A+%28PHOF%29+%2D+Not+an+RPG&forum_id=1315&topic_id=28807'><img src='edit.gif' alt='Edit Message' border=0 align='absmiddle' hspace=6></a><hr noshade size=1><font color='#ffffff' face='Verdana, Arial, Helvetica' size='2'>I second that.

About a year ago, to the day, I quit Everquest.  I played on Rallos Zek and was part of a great group of PvPing Roleplayers that can now be found at ralloszek.net (use to be at .com), though.</P><P>My original character was a High Elf Paladin called Anduril Valar but after a while, I became a Dark Elf Cleric by the name of Kallystra.  Kallystra was part of the Straylight Saga (also found at http://www.ralloszek.net/) and was arguable the Daughter of Innoruuk.  I wrote some stories about her adventures... some of which can be found on EQXpress (http://eqx.simplenet.com/credits/kallystra.htm).</P><P>Things were going great for the most part (except I had a huge issue with PvP in EQ but we won't get into that) until my final days which basically coincided with the appearance of Lanys T'vyl, the &quot;true&quot; Daughter of Innoruuk.</P><P>Lanys approached me one day when I was in the Nektulos Forest and just said &quot;Ahhh, the falsechild.&quot;</P><P>This actually made me glad, though.  Here I was, an avid RPer (although some called me a PK because I *gasp* killed the Tier'dal and humans!) and a Guide/GM was RPing with me.  Just to give you some insight, we at rz.net had been trying to get some GM support in the past with our storylines so you can see why I was excited.</P><P>Anyhow, the battle of wits began... and quickly died.  I told Lanys I was &quot;the Mouth of Innoruuk&quot; and then when she said &quot;I am Innoruuk's true Daughter&quot; I told her the same thing she told me, that she's the falsechild.</P><P>Next thing I know, I'm killed &quot;by the power of the gods.&quot;</P><P>But I was a good RPer and I wasn't about to let this stop me.  I came back and said something to the equivolent of &quot;Innoruuk has seen fit for me to live again.&quot;</P><P>After trying to make her prove that she is the true daughter of Innoruuk by speaking the Litany of Birth or the Commandments of Innoruuk (which any Dark Elf should know) she came up empty handed and I was killed by &quot;the power of the gods&quot; a few more times.</P><P>After getting most of the crowd there to side with me (I was a regular in Nektulos, healing the injured Dark Elves and slaying the wandering High Elves and Humans that wandered in), the next thing I know, I was SQUELCHED!  I couldn't /say, couldn't /shout, couldn't /ooc.  I couldn't even /guild.</P><P>So finally I attacked her.  After unleashing all my mana on her and smacking her around with my Hammer, I noticed she took no damage whatsoever (and there were about 20 - 30 others attacking her, too).  Lanys kept on me most of the time but I kept myself healed.</P><P>Before I knew it, though, a Dark Elf had enchanted me and dragged me away from the conflict.</P><P>To make a long story... well, not any longer, it just killed me.  Here I was, a Guide on another server, who liked to RP and PvP and I was SQUELCHED for Roleplaying!  Mind you, this isn't as bad as what happened to Myztere but it left a bad taste in my mouth.  I tried playing EQ for a while longer but after being treated like that (and I had emailed the higher ups, so to speak, and never heard a word from them), I left EQ.</P><P>I guess if you read the story, it makes more sense than my ramblings at the moment (Need some caffeine!):</P><P>http://www.eqx.simplenet.com/Issue96/daughter.htm</P><P>All in all, I guess I just wanted to share my little sob story and say your story hit home with me and I am sure many others.</P><P>- - - - - - -</P><P>Ashen Temper<BR>Internet Relations Manager<BR>WolfPack Studios, Inc.<BR>http://www.shadowbane.com/<BR>&quot;Become a Hero, Raise an Army, Rule an Empire&quot;</P><P>Edited by - Ashen_Temper on 10/19/2000 4:05:12 PM</font></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor='#6F6559' valign="top"><font color='#ffffff' face='Verdana, Arial, Helvetica' size='2'>Ashen_Temper</font></td><td bgcolor='#6F6559'  valign='top' ><font color='#ffffff' face='Verdana, Arial, Helvetica' size='1'>Posted - 19 October 2000 15:53 PST</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="Javascript:openWindow('profile.asp?mode=display&id=19921')"><img src='profile.gif' alt='Show Profile' border=0 align='absmiddle' hspace=6></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href='mail.asp?id=19921'><img src='email.gif' alt='Email Poster' border=0 align='absmiddle' hspace=6></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href='post.asp?method=edit&reply_id=131666&auth=19921&forum_title=EQ+Tavern&topic_title=Comments%3A+%28PHOF%29+%2D+Not+an+RPG&forum_id=1315&topic_id=28807'><img src='edit.gif' alt='Edit Message' border=0 align='absmiddle' hspace=6></a><hr noshade size=1><font color='#ffffff' face='Verdana, Arial, Helvetica' size='2'>Errr, what happened to my format???

Most newcomers don't understand the true meaning role-playing.  It goes beyond the newly-established paramaters that big-time (revenue hungry &amp; lazy) companies have created which restrict gamers' options in current &quot;RPG&quot;'s.  Don't get me wrong.  I love Diablo II (for example), but you don't even have the option of using your immagination to be anything other than the hero who has to wade through thousands of corpses to complete some stupid-ass quest prompted by the game and ultimately kill the the arch-villain?  </P><P>Second, it sounds like you were a real prick in EverQuest. WHICH IS EXACTLY THE POINT OF RPG's!  Be whomever you want.  Do whatever you want.  Want to kill the shopkeeper &amp; take the loot?  Do it!  Reap the benefits or suffer the consequences!  </P><P>Keep the intelligent articles coming.<BR></font></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor='#6F6559' valign="top"><font color='#ffffff' face='Verdana, Arial, Helvetica' size='2'>brianw</font></td><td bgcolor='#6F6559'  valign='top' ><font color='#ffffff' face='Verdana, Arial, Helvetica' size='1'>Posted - 21 October 2000 0:39 PST</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="Javascript:openWindow('profile.asp?mode=display&id=20146')"><img src='profile.gif' alt='Show Profile' border=0 align='absmiddle' hspace=6></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href='mail.asp?id=20146'><img src='email.gif' alt='Email Poster' border=0 align='absmiddle' hspace=6></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href='post.asp?method=edit&reply_id=132431&auth=20146&forum_title=EQ+Tavern&topic_title=Comments%3A+%28PHOF%29+%2D+Not+an+RPG&forum_id=1315&topic_id=28807'><img src='edit.gif' alt='Edit Message' border=0 align='absmiddle' hspace=6></a><hr noshade size=1><font color='#ffffff' face='Verdana, Arial, Helvetica' size='2'>you are croorect i played a evil death night for 3 weeks only to get this e-mail (small cut out of it.)&quot;you have ben banned for miscunduct.&quot; i replyed in an e-mail &quot;wtf! i WAS PLAYING A EVIL CHAR! if an evil char is not acting like it then he is NOT EVIL!&quot;</P><P>e-mail 3 was this. &quot;reguardliss of what your char. class is ambushing players at there bind points is miscounduct.&quot; in other words...F^&amp;* YOU!<BR>and that was my ONLY CHAR.</P><P>i have NEVER played eq since then.</font></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor='#6F6559' valign="top"><font color='#ffffff' face='Verdana, Arial, Helvetica' size='2'>Phrost</font></td><td bgcolor='#6F6559'  valign='top' ><font color='#ffffff' face='Verdana, Arial, Helvetica' size='1'>Posted - 22 October 2000 23:4 PST</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="Javascript:openWindow('profile.asp?mode=display&id=20249')"><img src='profile.gif' alt='Show Profile' border=0 align='absmiddle' hspace=6></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href='mail.asp?id=20249'><img src='email.gif' alt='Email Poster' border=0 align='absmiddle' hspace=6></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href='post.asp?method=edit&reply_id=132919&auth=20249&forum_title=EQ+Tavern&topic_title=Comments%3A+%28PHOF%29+%2D+Not+an+RPG&forum_id=1315&topic_id=28807'><img src='edit.gif' alt='Edit Message' border=0 align='absmiddle' hspace=6></a><hr noshade size=1><font color='#ffffff' face='Verdana, Arial, Helvetica' size='2'>I'd like to thank everyone for their feedback on my first article here, but I have to warn you.. you probably won't always agree with what I have to say in the future.</P><P>Ashen_Temper brings up a good point about how roleplaying is handled.. err mishandled in EQ.  I actually remember reading about that incident and was just as ticked as I am about the Mystere thing.  The only thing that really keeps me coming back to EQ are the people that I've made good friends with over the last year.</P><P>Don't get me wrong.. EQ is a good game.  It's challenging, fairly detailed, and has some awesome eye candy.  But it's not a roleplaying game by any means.  PvP was added as an afterthought to snag people away from UO.  </P><P>I've since quit my Dark Elf Necromancer and now play a Human Monk.  I enjoy the PvE aspect of the game (aside from the occasional bug) and respect the skill and coordination it takes to get some things accomplished.  But nothing can take the place of well played, in-character interaction between good and evil, hero and villain.</P><P>If you go and ask some of the people that my guild was &quot;dicks&quot; to over a year ago you'll find that most of them will say that the conflicts we had were some of the most memorable times they've had in EQ.  In a game where you sit and kill the same things over and over 90% of the time, conflict between players is actually a good thing.  In my opinion, if a game can engage your emotions BOTH positively and negatively then it's doing something right.</P><P>I'm honestly looking forward to Shadowbane; hoping that I can find a greater ammount of interaction not only with the environment, but with other players.  The freedom to chose any path you want to take, be it merchant or murderer, is what makes a good game great.</P><P>Phrost</font></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor='#6F6559' valign="top"><font color='#ffffff' face='Verdana, Arial, Helvetica' size='2'>Inspiration</font></td><td bgcolor='#6F6559'  valign='top' ><font color='#ffffff' face='Verdana, Arial, Helvetica' size='1'>Posted - 23 October 2000 3:23 PST</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="Javascript:openWindow('profile.asp?mode=display&id=20255')"><img src='profile.gif' alt='Show Profile' border=0 align='absmiddle' hspace=6></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href='mail.asp?id=20255'><img src='email.gif' alt='Email Poster' border=0 align='absmiddle' hspace=6></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href='post.asp?method=edit&reply_id=132973&auth=20255&forum_title=EQ+Tavern&topic_title=Comments%3A+%28PHOF%29+%2D+Not+an+RPG&forum_id=1315&topic_id=28807'><img src='edit.gif' alt='Edit Message' border=0 align='absmiddle' hspace=6></a><hr noshade size=1><font color='#ffffff' face='Verdana, Arial, Helvetica' size='2'>i cannot help but post a reply to this.</P><P>i am the only roleplaying cleric of the tribunal server, retired from EQ out of sheer boredom.  the problems of EQ being what they are, i have absolutely no intention to continue playing, and i wait rather impatiently for its on-line successors to mop the floor with verrant.  powerleveling and twinking have reached an all time high, nobody role-plays, the same indistinct characters camp the same items, whatnot and so forth.  and these are just a FEW of the problems i have found.</P><P>the biggest problem of these on-line games is the least able to be remedied.  simply put its the people.  you all brag about being in gaming since the 80s, ok fine.  there are quite a few in this gaming thing that predate that, myself included.  i personally cant sit in on a table-top game with a group of young people and do the powergame thing anymore.  what some of you dont realize is that POWERGAMING and ROLEPLAYING are not the same.  they are two completely different things.  the &quot;my character can smash your character&quot; philosophy went out of my game decades ago.  which leads me to my point.  do not call yourself a roleplayer if all you do is go around and pvp.</P><P>i do play pvp, if only because the paranoid atmosphere keeps down powerleveling and twinking.  i would rather be on a server where at least the powergamers had to earn their character instead of having it handed to them.  but this is the only thing that recommends it.  having to play on a game where i would never in a million years sit down and play table-top with these people almost offsets this advantage.</P><P>just because you (or your parents) pay 10 stinkin dollars a month to play a game does not give you the right to ruin a hard working guy's off work enjoyment.</P><P>now having said that i do have to say that there are very few instances where i have been truly upset by a powergamers actions.  but you know how some kids get when they dont know when to quit.  i am in agreement that some things should not be tolerated and some things should be regulated.  i am also of the opinion rules should be in place to control unruly behaviour within reason.  as we all know, only a few bad apples make the rest look bad.  the rules should be in place for them.</P><P>the trouble i think comes from when some do not realize that to EVERYTHING there are consequences. taking that out of a game atmosphhere where the game is meant to be a social and fun retreat is a mistake.</P><P>templar inspiration nifesprophet<BR>voice of the prime healer<BR>   </P><P></P><P></font></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor='#6F6559' valign="top"><font color='#ffffff' face='Verdana, Arial, Helvetica' size='2'>Grimgash</font></td><td bgcolor='#6F6559'  valign='top' ><font color='#ffffff' face='Verdana, Arial, Helvetica' size='1'>Posted - 23 October 2000 9:45 PST</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="Javascript:openWindow('profile.asp?mode=display&id=19837')"><img src='profile.gif' alt='Show Profile' border=0 align='absmiddle' hspace=6></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href='mail.asp?id=19837'><img src='email.gif' alt='Email Poster' border=0 align='absmiddle' hspace=6></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href='post.asp?method=edit&reply_id=133124&auth=19837&forum_title=EQ+Tavern&topic_title=Comments%3A+%28PHOF%29+%2D+Not+an+RPG&forum_id=1315&topic_id=28807'><img src='edit.gif' alt='Edit Message' border=0 align='absmiddle' hspace=6></a><hr noshade size=1><font color='#ffffff' face='Verdana, Arial, Helvetica' size='2'>Phrost overlooks one very important part of true RP:  accountability.  Using &quot;roleplaying&quot; as your excuse for ruining another player's experience when there is nothing the other player can do to stop you except complain to the powers that be is just plain wrong and it's NOT roleplaying.</P><P>That being said, I can only agree with Phrost that EQ is not a roleplaying game, but I don't play it for roleplaying purposes.  I play it for the challenge and for the friends I've made.

If my DM said &quot;This session we will be starting new, good/neutral characters.&quot; Or, &quot;Lets roll up some evil pirates (&lt;--this turned out to last well over a year)&quot; then thats the way it was. If you whined about not being able to play an evil character while everyone else was good then the DM made your life unfun till he killed you. If you were an ass about it you didnt get invited to the next session. Case closed.</P><P>So Verant is a crappy DM. Big deal. Didnt take me long to figure that out. I like the setting even in its unyielding, static state. RPing is possible. Its not easy and about the only reward you get out of it is from others of like mind. </P><P>I take EQ for what its worth.
