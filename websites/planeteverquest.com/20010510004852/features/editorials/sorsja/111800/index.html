<b class="heading">BoTS Disbanded on The Rathe</b><br>
<i>By</i> Sorsja (11/18/00)<br><br>

After logging in this morning unto The Rathe server for no more than 5 minutes, I was informed a well known guild Brotherhood of the Spider, AKA BoTS was disbanded by a GM (I am not disclosing the GM’s name) last night for &quot;training&quot; in the Plane of Fear.
<br><br>
BoTS is highly known on The Rathe server, for their &quot;attitude&quot; and for their &quot;uber&quot; ways.
<br><br>
They have been a part of the gaming world for about 5 years now and have resided on The Rathe for about as long as Rathe has been active.
<br><br>
With 80+ active players and 150+ members total, BoTS has been a hot issue for quite some time amongst the whispering rumors of our server.
<br><br>
The details of last nights event were sketchy at first as they were coming from several different sources and of course there were and still are 3 to 4 different sides of this story.
<br><br>
I contacted BoTS guild leader, Mistabone and one of his trusted Officers and here is what they had to say on BoTS behalf:

<blockquote class="quote"> <b><i>Sorsja: &quot;What exactly happened from your eyes?&quot;</i></b>
<br><br>
<b>BoTS:</b> &quot;The Rathe server has been experiencing problems with many of the higher level guilds abusing calendar systems, by utilizing &quot;pet guilds&quot; of lower levels to increase their number of plane reservation dates. It has become clear that the calendar system is dead, and everyone knew it. We had wanted Fear last night and were unable to get it. So, we decided to come in tonight. There was a smaller guild there, Bloodline of the Bear, and honestly, the overwhelming opinion of the guild (BoTS) was NOT to muscle our way in, nor to take all the loot.
<br><br>
I was completely behind that as well. (name deleted) (GM of Bloodline of the Bear) sent me a tell as he had known that we wanted Fearplane, and we began discussing things... we had a mutual respect for one another, and he seemed to have no problem with letting us have CT / Draco / Epic Quest mobs.
<br><br>
The fear was that it would take too long, and eventually he and I came to an agreement, a mutual agreement between the two of us, that BoTS would take CT, Dracoliche, and Epic Quest mobs, and we would have the first choices on those mobs.
<br><br>
Obviously the point behind that was because this guild, in all reality, could not defeat those mobs alone.
<br><br>
More evidence of that will be shown later.
<br><br>
We began to form up at the portal, as he had said he was ready for us.
<br><br>
We had a plan to break in at West Wall as not to cause problems for the others at the Safe Spot (BoTB)
<br><br>
Unfortunately, one of our invites had taken that as WEST CAMP, and ran to the west camp near the safe spot and a completely unintentional train occurred.&quot;
<br><br>
<i>BoTS went on to tell me about the GM who was present during this whole event.</i>
<br><br>
&quot;The GM, who has had a personal issue with our guild for some time, claimed that it was, &quot;The most frightening intentional train he had ever seen.&quot;
<br><br>
He claimed that we had been causing problems on the server for a long time, and that we had been warned SEVERAL times before, of which, he gave NO documentation, NO evidence.
<br><br>
The fact of the matter is, our guild WANTED BoTB to enjoy their fear raid, we wanted them to get the armor they needed, we wanted to assist. Yes, we also wanted CT, Dracoliche, and quest mobs... but &quot;here is the rub&quot;.
<br><br>
We did not have to do any of that.
<br><br>
The GM would not be able to do ANYTHING if we were to zone in, set up another camp, and start pulling. It would be a completely fair option under the Play Nice Policy.
<br><br>
But we did not want to do that. We didn't want to muscle them out of armor they clearly needed. We wanted to be fair...
<br><br>
Our formal agreement was this, if the following items drop off CT/Draco we get them: BCG, CroA. The epic quest mobs were ours, and besides that, they got EVERYTHING else off all mobs.
<br><br>
And here is the kick in the face.
<br><br>
Last night, after BoTS was disbanded, BoTB called in another high level guild to take down CT for them.&quot;
<br><br>
<b><i>Sorsja: &quot;What was the GM's official reason for disbanding BoTS?&quot;</i></b>
<br><br>
<b>BoTS:</b> &quot;Let me load up the screenshot, I'll read the exact quote&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;While I realize that you were attempting to negotiate some sort of &quot;deal&quot;, the fact remains that they did NOT want to make that deal with you.&quot; (Which is untrue. He came to me originally, I did not come to (name deleted – BoTB’s GM). He started talking to me, and he is the one who wanted to deal. Sadly, we didn't even have to deal with him, we could have gone in under PnP rules.)
<br><br>
&quot;Then, I witness what could only be called the scariest intentional train I have ever seen.&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;Based on previous warnings, and the happenings tonight in fear, GM-(name deleted) and I have decided to disband BoTS as of now. Take this time to say your farewells, if you wish.&quot;
<br><br>
<b><i>Sorsja: &quot;How do you think the situation should have been handled?&quot;</i></b>
<br><br>
<b>BoTS:</b> &quot;That's easy... He should have firstly given us the documentation that we had been warned before.
<br><br>
Secondly, he shouldn't have treated us as the epitome of the server's hatred. He may have had a personal vendetta against us for some reason, he may have been having a bad night. But his methods were unfair, and once he had his impetus for destroying us, he did it.
<br><br>
<b>Mistabone:</b> &quot;1st of all I think he should have let us continue on with our CR in fear we would have ressed the parties that got killed and continued on however he put a stop to that with the server wide message he didn't give us a chance to correct the accidental training almost like it was premeditated and was looking for any little excuse to disband us.&quot;
<br><br>
<b><i>Sorsja: &quot;What are your plans for the future?&quot;</i></b>
<br><br>
<b>BoTS:</b> &quot;Trying to get the guild reinstated is the 1st priority. Take it as it comes, and see that this GM doesn't take things out of proportion...&quot;
<br><br>
<b><i>Sorsja: &quot;Anything else you would like to add?&quot;</i></b>
<br><br>
<b>BoTS:</b> &quot;This is a warning for all big guilds across all servers. BoTS has had the misnomer of &quot;the bad guys&quot; of the Rathe. It's unfair, and hopefully things will be restored.&quot;
</blockquote>

After spending some quality time with BoTS, I have seen that they are mortal and they are basically playing the game and that’s all they’ve ever done. Although I have had my share of words with them and I still disagree with how they have handled some things in the past, I do believe this is completely unfair to them as a guild.
<br><br>
Regardless, even if the &quot;train&quot; was intentional there was really no clear reason to disband an entire guild. I personally have been trained plenty of times by guilds in various places and I still wouldn’t want to see their guild disbanded. There was no justice in disbanding, those who did wrong should have been warned or suspended or what have you. But, to disband an entire guild simply has no meaning other than to cause anger and conflict.
<br><br>
<i>What is Everquest?</i> An RPG that’s competitive and a place where the strong will overrule the weak – at least when it comes to the elite mobs and &quot;uber&quot; quests. You are here for one purpose, to be stronger than the next person.
<br><br>
An RPG is <i>just</i> that, A Role Playing Game. A real RPG has no GM’s, no supervisors. Not one single person to tell you how this game should be run. Hell, where was the GM when the electric shut off the other night before I could save my spot in Final Fantasy? What are you going to do /petition the electric company?
<br><br>
I do know that there is more than one side to this story and I am all ears if someone would like to e-mail me their chapter.
