            <p> <b><a href="http://www.anavon.org/" target="_top">Anavon</a></b><br>
              After Zlandicar went down we moved to SolB and killed Naggy again 
              with PE and some other help. 
            <p>One Treasure Hunter Satchel to PE, one to Anavon (Grats Volk ). 
              <br>
              Gauntlets went to NoN as they sended a complete group. <br>
              Rest randomed to people at Raids. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Dec 1: We took Velk down with few deaths. Grats to Turbo on mage 
              boots. Grats to PE on chanter stick. Moved on to Gore who dropped 
              a white scale for us to loot. Then onto Kael where Vindi proved 
              to be a tough pull. Next time he has to die. </p>
            <p>Dec 2: The forces of 4 guilds strode forth to give the Plane of 
              Growth a makeover. Unfortunatly, the diagnosis was not good, and 
              some serious cosmetic surgery was required. Its a damn shame none 
              of us are surgeons. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Tunare =&gt; Rivervale </p>
            <p>Big grats to Anavon, Project E O N, The Relentless &amp; Element 
              of Darkness for defiling The Plane of Growth. Tunare's body now 
              feeds the trees she used to live in.</p>

              12/02/01: Yesterday we had some fun time (and some rough times lol) 
              in Kael. Congratulations to Aarek for winning a corroded plate bracer 
              for the Velious armor quest and to Machedor for willing a pair of 
              Silver Steel Gauntlets. Good job everyone!<br>

              DEce. 2: I would first like to dedicate this portion of the news 
              to the waitresses at Hooters who got Izzu all drunk and let me die 
              afew times and the fine people of Scotland who invented Dewars White 
              Label who assited me in my death pulls and my antics later in Velks.</p>
            <p>Anyway we hit Chardok to get Stabu her assling mask. I have no 
              idea why anyone would want to look like a midget but we all know 
              those rogues have an identity crisis and are kinda fruity. We get 
              our asses there and bust down to the spot the guy spawns in record 
              time rapin those Sarnak bitches the whole way down. Well we finally 
              hit the spawn place and the the mass quantities of alcohol must 
              have kicked in on me and Izzu cuz we just decided to let everyone 
              die mass deaths and introduce our new member Envia to what a goatfuck 
              is. No fuckin mask but we got some Enchanter bracer gratz to Inkitta 
              and Nasthar legs to Aumeshing or somethin.</p>
            <p>Later me Zum, Kati, and Demo hit velks. I decide in my drunkeness 
              that I'd take that pos Gaby's job for the night and try to pull 
              the named from TS and train them. I'd apologize but that aint my 
              style thats what duels are for. Ok maybe I'll apologize to Zum for 
              talkin shit but the rest can suck it. Adios <br>

              For those that have SoL working, it has been a time of exploration. 
              Numerous hunting and expedition trips have been made to Maiden's

              a vampyre in Tenebrous, and were the only ones in the zone for hours 
              on end. Sanctus Seru is a risky place to visit, if you are evil, 
              some of the guards will attack you. There are also guards that are 
              part of the eye, that could attack you at any time, also, don't 
              drink in this town around the guards.

              Started the morning off killing Faydedar for Dunskye's epic. Excellent 
              fight and agro management, and we were able to pull it off with 
              no deaths for the second time in a row! After the fight, we headed 
              off to Seblis to get some spells, and then followed that up with 
              Chardok to help Chiun camp the pipe. After many an hour, the mob 
              never spawned, and everyone vowed to return and kill the yellow-bellied 
              mob.</p>
            <p>DEC 01, 2001<br>
              Many in the guild got to witness a GM event where Al'Kabor appeared 
              and needed some assistance. Many within CT helped the famous wizard, 
              and our own Tippe was given the title of &quot;Tippe of the Nexus&quot;. 
              Grats Tippe! This evening, we camped Codfisher in TD waiting for 
              him to spawn so we could finish Dunskye's epic. Hawkien even put 
              some dwarf bait out, but no luck. Two hours past spawn time, we 
              called it a night.</p>
            <p></p>
            NOV 30, 2001<br>
            Raid on royals in Chardok. This time, we were able to slay the prince 
            [Greymask now 1 item from enc epic]. Still learning this zone, and 
            this was our furthest push ever into the royal area. Next time, we 
            will kill the king and queen and put ourselves within reach of cleric 
            and warrior epics!
            <p>NOV 29, 2001<br>
              Raid on Kael to push into King's area for some armour drops. Decided 
              to kill Dlammaz Stormslayer (100k+ HP that quads 500s, flurries, 
              rampages, etc) and one of toughest mobs we have ever faced as a 
              guild. We slayed him with only a few deaths, and fought him again 
              later that evening with zero deaths. CT is getting stronger as a 
              guild, which combined with our smart playing is a lethal combination. 
              Drops this evening were: Plate Bracer [Hawkien], Leather Bracer 
              [Tippe], and 2 Cloaks of the Malestorm [Zoranna, Chadmoe]. In addition 
              to Dlammaz, we were easily able to slay Sentinel Drag / Yeljorn 
              / Demek.</p>

              So Team Divine Souls (or so we were known as on Rallos Zek) went 
              to the server finals yesterday. After making sure everyone got copied, 
              and after finally getting our tag set up, we waited for our match 
              to start. [please go to their website for some very funny quotes 
              pasted into the news, they aren't text--Kwill] Unfortunately for 
              us, Quellious was a formidable opponent, and they managed to down 
              four of our people while we only got one of them. It was a great 
              battle though, and it was a tremendous amount of fun, even when 
              we lost. </p>
            <p>Before I leave you with a few lewd quotes, I'll take a minute to 
              thank the great team we took to the server finals. You guys absolutely 
              rocked it on RZ. I would also like to send special thanks to Natysha 
              for all her hard work getting all our stuff together for this. Once 
              again, you all rocked, and I'm proud to have been a member of this

              Weekend of Nov 2, 2001 Sirens Grotto and Sky<br>
              Phinny had been knocked off, so we went to DN, then decided to stay 
              in SG because the Seahorses are so nice this time of year. Got some 
              nice loot:<br>
              Ancient Seahorse Hide Cloak - Faerus<br>
              Seahorse Spine Bracelet - Namffoh<br>
              Neriad Shawl - Fendos</p>
            <p>We also got another 2 or 3 (memory is all foggy) Seahorse Spine 
              Bracelets, and a few gems (Black Marbles, Diamonds, Blue Diamonds, 
              etc)<br>
              <br>
              On Saturday we went to Sky and did pretty well except for one misshap... 
              Note to self: Never type a message to anyone starting with the letter 
              'u' while sitting in the &quot;port-dish-thingy&quot; while holding 
              the key and also without hitting the 'r' key and making sure it 
              got pressed... /sigh Sadly, the cleric was eaten by a hungry Azarack. 
            </p>
            <p>The purpose of the raid was of course to get Nam his epic bit from 
              Gwan - who went down like a ton of bricks... hardly a challenge. 
              Two more epic mobs and a pipe for Nam and he's done! </p>
            <p>Blade of Abrogation - Palanor<br>

              12/4/01: Obviously the largest news recently is the new SoL release. 
              Many people have been anticipating this for a long time, and personally 
              I am hoping that many who ran away to DAoC will come back now. But 
              ... heh.. we'll see. </p>
            <p>Over the last few weeks we have done some interesting things. We 
              have been to Fear, and managed to score some loot, including a nice 
              ranger BP. We finished Shcammer's epic, and Fenier's epic. We been 
              in Charsis, Chardok and a few other zones. In each of these we have 
              done well.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Hmmm... so what else is new? Well, we are still recruiting. If 
              you have a friend or know someone who would like to join KoT, then 
              please send them my way. We are looking mainly for level 50+ but 
              will consider others if they are willing to play catch up with the 
              guild.</p>

              December 2: Not much to really report today. Mostly the guild spent 
              some time xping. We did help VerinSolen from BDA though take out 
              The Cabilis and King Kong (To save Syrillia from his clutches) mob 
              for his EPIC quest. He is now only two mobs away. Way to go Verin!</p>
            <p>Also ran over to Swamp and took out the Druid EPIC thing for Taddon. 
              Grats Taddon!</p>
            <p>Rajja later played tracker, after he bound and gagged Salerien 
              and Taddon, and went out to find Scout for us again. Congrats to 
              Palos on the Benevelonce quest!</p>

            <p>Taddon 60 DR00D!</p>
            <p>Started out the day by heading up to Hate in search of Magi. Found 
              him, but he had the last laugh again and left his staff at home. 
              -Grumbles-</p>
            <p>Our goal was to take out Faydader for Lilili next, but BG beat 
              us to him while we were in Hate. So everyone headed to Lavastorm 
              and took out Eejag for Rajja. Congrats Monkey on your EPIC piece! 
              From there we headed to Burning Woods to summon forth Ixiblat Fer, 
              for Kaedin. Our lady Pokebard came running in screaming for help 
              from the pull, and Karksus froze in his tracks in FEAR!, so I stepped 
              up to save her. My death was a mere set back as the forces stepped 
              up to take him down. Congratulations Kaedin on your Cleric EPIC 
              piece! Congrats to Taroith on some crown piece off the Large Elemental. 
              Decent FR gear if anything! I forget the stats. I wanted to thank 
              Lelar and Yilina(spelling ;x), and Khayne for coming out to help 
              us in BW. And of course the people from BDA, your help is most appreciated. 
              Thanks Ajire, Sald, and Lazz (Yes he did come out of hiding! ;p).</p>

            <p>Hail Riders! While everyone is getting used to SoL and getting 
              their computers upgraded, we have been doing a few exploration runs 
              in SoL. First off we hit Maiden's Eye, and got some good Medalions 
              and weapons. Then we headed to Arkheda (Or something like that) 
              Ruins. There we picked up some really decent weapons including a 
              14/27, 8str 8sta sword that has a badass graphic. Lastnight we spent 
              some time in Fungus Grove and got a truckload of spells. We also 
              managed to pick up a few 6ac 55hp 55mana 10DR 5CR rings. We will 
              continue exploring in the next few days. <br>

            December 2: Well, today was another glorious day on Rallos Zek. Our 
            opponent for the round of 16 was a wiry guild alliance from Quellious. 
            Say it with me...wiry...WIRY! We moved into Arena and started to lay 
            down the smack, and they proceeded to do likewise. It was a long and 
            hard fought battle, and like every other one we have had in this tournament, 
            it was fun as hell. When the smoke cleared, the folks from Quellious 
            had taken the day, 17-14. They now face the FUN task of moving on 
            to face Afterlife. Best of luck, guys!
            <p>So, the folks from SS and DA take a bow and exit gracefully, with 
              a smile. We would have liked to go farther, but I don't think there 
              is a one of us who does not feel that we kicked ass. What do we 
              take away with us? A few lessons for next time, certainly...a whole 
              lot of stories...and for me, a never ending nightmare of a Chanter 
              with 100,000 hp!</p>
            <p>As the sun sets on this event, we start licking our chops an looking 
              to Luclin! Seeya there. <br>
            </p>
            December 1: Today, as you will probobly read on MANY web boards throughout 
            the EQ community, we spent a LONG DAY on Rallos Zek. If it was old 
            Soviet Russia, I bet I would have finished the lines for Bread, Shoes 
            AND Toilet Paper (what do you think we Rangers make our armor of, 
            anyway?). For all our dogged persistance and sticking aroundness...we 
            were promptly rewarded with the second to last fight even allowed 
            to be run today. In that match, we met the team from Prophecy, off 
            of Bertoxx. It was a DAMN exciting fight. In the end, we emerged victorious 
            and move on to competition tomorrow. Thanks Prophecy for the great 
            match, you fought well!
            <p>Now for a public service message. If you know someone who plays 
              on a red server, please CALL them and promote their feelings of 
              self worth. I have NEVER seen so many people so obviously insecure 
              about their place in the world. They need our LOVE and support. 
              When they call you vile names and insult your skill and tell you 
              to just go home because you have no chance...remember to see the 
              poor, downtrodden fellow screaming for help. We love and value ALL 
              you red server folk, really...we do! After the event is over, I 
              will be having Jenka set up a &quot;Pally of LOVE&quot; helpline, 
              to get these poor folks that immediate emotional support so obviously 
              lacking from their lives!<br>
