<b class="heading">Disturbance at Innothule Pass</b><br>
<i>by</i> Kaas Khaseem Paladin of Karana, Qeynos, Cazic-Thule

<br><br>
<i>Hello, I was bored, and wanted to write something. I'm not sure if any of you are familiar with the short story titled Disturbance at Owl Creek or not, but its my favorite short story of all time and I highly recommend you read it. I just wish I could remember who wrote it :)
<br><br>
I'm not the most creative person, I prefer to use the CASE method. (Copy AndSteal Everything) I'm also not a world renowned writer. All this aside, though, I thought I would write this short story based completely off the aforementioned short story and put an EverQuest twist to it.
<br><br>
I submit this story to you now and welcome all comments and critiques.</i>

Although it was a day like most other days, there was something different wafting about on the breeze. The mist, thick and layered, floated like it did incessantly over the swamp. The chatter of unseen frogs and crickets played in perfect unison with the occasional growl of alligators basking in the glory of their last meal. The foul odor of stagnant water and thriving algae combined with the stench of decaying froglok corpses to put the finishing touches on the dank and dreary atmosphere of this ancient and evil place. These things were the same as they had been since he had arrived at this place, but there was something different, unseen, calming. This difference was very welcome on this day...the day of his execution.
<br><br>
As the executioner prepared the gallows, the unusually quiet murmur of two trolls could be heard grating across the platform. The bridge was relatively high, maybe a hundred feet above the swamp. The rope hung from the supporting beams high upon the structure, dangling over the water below.
<br><br>
A few more trolls arrived and took up their post to the left of the gallows while another troll opened the massive gates that until now had kept the masses at bay outside the arena of execution. The man about to be hanged stood in his place guarded by two trolls in plate armor. It was obvious that this man had once been a valiant warrior, but that the battle was over and that he was defeated could clearly be discerned by the slight slouch in his posture. If any cared to examine his expression closely, it would find a desperate hope of salvation lurking in the crease of his brow.
<br><br>
Slowly the arena filled with all manner of troll and the occasional ogre. Almost hidden in the shadows were a small gathering of Tier`dal huddled together whispering and nodding to each other, occasionally glancing at the man to be executed.
<br><br>
The gallows were prepared, and the time of death was nigh. A large black hood was placed over the man's head and he was lead to his place under the noose. The loop of rope was place around his neck while his hands and feet were bound securely. The size of the bridge and its height dwarfed the man as he threw back his shoulders and stuck out his chest, standing tall and proud. He shouted something unintelligible, most likely a loud prayer to his god, which reverberated off the water and trees until it was absorbed the thick cloudy mist.
<br><br>
With everything prepared, there was no ceremony. The plank below him was quickly yanked from beneath him and he began to fall.
<br><br>
The prayer worked! As the man fell the rope broke and he continued to fall down into the water below. Knowing that he was now about to be hunted by his enemy he struggled to devise a plan of action. Wriggling and striving with all his might the ropes binding first arms, then his legs, came loose. He had been under water now for almost a full minute, trying to stay out of the sight of his captors. His lungs were about to explode but he swam beneath the surface for some time until he reached a shallow spot where he could no longer swim.
<br><br>
The air exploded into him, burning his throat and mixed with droplets of stale, stagnant water causing him to erupt into a violent fit of coughing. He looked around to see if he was being followed. It appeared as though he had escaped. So far. As he rubbed his wrists and ankles, trying to aid the circulation back into his hand and feet, a crisp frost slammed into him. The Shaman had found him!
<br><br>
Immediately the man jumped to his feet and ran. He had no idea where he was or what direction to run, he just knew that his life depended upon speed at this moment. And he ran.
<br><br>
It seemed strange that at a time like this, for the man's thoughts to traverse back through time to a love he once knew. His love was so strong that he never bound his affection to another. She was still in Freeport the last time he had heard.
<br><br>
An arrow skimmed past his head whistling evilly as it flew past, snapping his attention back to his escape. Tripping over roots and sloshing the swamp he ran, jogging this way and that, trying everything he could think of to throw off the party hunting him.
<br><br>
An hour had passed and the man had still not stopped running, but the sound of the trolls and ogres that had been chasing him were no longer heard. He took this opportunity to rest beneath a palm tree and catch his breath.
<br><br>
A palm tree! What was a palm tree doing in a swamp? The man looked around and noticed that where the swamp had ended, a desert was extending. A familiar desert it was too. This was the desert where he had been captured, and the man knew his way home from here.
<br><br>
Up he shot, running at full speed across the desert to his home in Freeport. It took him several hours to transcend the desert, and he had taken a few breaks along the way, but he became overjoyed to see the walls of his home city before him. The sight had added renewed strength to his weary body and he rushed to home of his one love.
<br><br>
He had rounded the corner to see the long path to her house and started yelling her name as loud as his tired lungs would allow. She stepped out the door of her dwelling, first curious, then astonished about who was summoning her so loudly. She dropped the food she had been preparing and bursting into tears she ran toward the man she loved so dearly. It seemed an eternity had passed before the couple was within arms distance. Tears streamed down her face as sweat poured down his. She delicately reached out with both hands to caress his strong neck.
<br><br>
But her grasp came as a shock to the man. She snapped hard against the base of his head and jerked him up off the ground squeezing tighter and tighter until his breath was completely closed off.
<br><br>
The man hung from the bridge, swinging quietly to and fro, as the trolls nodded to each other satisfied that they had been avenged. The crickets and frogs resumed their harmony with the alligators as the executioner started to take the man down from the rope.
