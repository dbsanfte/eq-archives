                Nikhola are thrilled not only to gain a wonderful daughter to 
                bring more joy into their lives, but a new son-in-law to help 
                Enoc around the family hall with repairs and chores while mother

              <blockquote>Cohort Chalybeius took down the Sorceror Velketor on 
                the Day of 11th May 2001<br>
                <br>
                After a long and arduous fight that foul beast Velketor fell to

                <br>
                Upon searching his body we found some of his wondrous devices 
                and items:<br>
                <br>
                Vermillion Orb of Torrefaction <br>
                Vermillion Robe of Torrefaction <br>

              <a href="http://members.tripod.com/crimsontalon/"><b>Crimson Talon</b></a> 
              <blockquote>Vox was definitely scared of the dragon hunting party 
                that assembled outside her lair last night. Already overdue for 
                a spawn (last kill was Fri at 10:31pm EST), with 7 days + random 
                24 hours expired, she should have been up. By midnight CST, Brewall 
                called the raid off. By 7am CST she had spawned in her lair and 
                is now waiting to be killed. All attendees were credited with 
                1 raid point and will try again on Sunday at 10pm EST. If approximately 
                the same people show again, we will be able to form groups and 
                buff very quickly and slay Vox in short order. <br>
                <br>
                If anyone was looking to complete a quest in Kael Drakkal last 
                night, they were out of luck. Crimson Talon decided to set up 
                residence inside the quest givers area and proceeded to take out 
                all the giants. Lots of unusual and different items dropped: Silver 
                Dragon Tattoo (ac2 str4 wis4) [Skylynn], Helm, Greaves, Axe, Dragonhide 
                Belt (ac6 sta10 wt0.0), and a Mask of Malediction (wis-4 int+5 
                mana+10 fr-5 cr-5 wt 0.2). <br>
                <br>
                HS raid on north wing to restock some keys. A nice little raid 
                in an empty dungeon. Only odd thing of the evening was a bug that 
                caused Altus to get stuck in a wall. At least we now know that 
                safe-spot for corpses is at zone in. Numerous spell drops were 
                collected and added to guild vault. *Also, be sure to welcome 
                Malvado to the guild. <br>
                <br>
                Raid on the Hole. Definitely getting better at hunting in here, 
                and we were able to make it further back than ever before. Several 
                loam pieces dropped and were divided out. <br>
                <br>
                Grats to both Greymask and Immolar on their AC rings. <br>
                <br>
                A glorious day for the Crimson Talon on two fronts. Lotera got 
                help from the Divine Alliance and is now the proud owner of the 
                rogue epic "Ragebringer". I don't have any screenshots, but as 
                soon as I get some in, I'll post on the site.</blockquote>
              <a href="http://www.neoweb.net/brad/da/"><b>Divine Alliance</b></a> 
              <blockquote>While this is not a server first, it is a first for 
                the combined forces of DA, EL, and SS. It was a fun fight, and 
                once we got the strat down, he went down nice and easy (like a 
                certain ranger we all know and love). Sammer of SS is now strutting 
                around in his new Chestplate of Vindication, and a lucky druid 
                from EL is one step closer to completing his or her PoG quest 
                gloves. Sorry I don't remember who, but Siabot distracted me with 
                promises of Hot Gnome Sex. <br>
                <br>
                Ulath Ironarm, Beast of Halas, was able to complete his epic this 
                weekend as well.<br>
                <br>
                Right after I uploaded the last update, I remembered that we killed 
                the big god of poo himself, Cazic-Thule, with our friends in SS 
                and EL on Monday night. Because I'm lazy, you all didn't get to 
                hear about that freaky halfling Murz getting that neat cleric 
                halo that he drops until now. I have no idea what else dropped, 
                since I wasn't able to be there. But, grats Murz on the new hat 
                and grats to the rest of the folks who got some lewt.</blockquote>
              <a href="http://www.elementofdarkness.com/"><b>Element of Darkness</b></a> 
              <blockquote>Putzed around in TOV again last night and killed <a href="http://www.elementofdarkness.com/images/member/Xate/eashen.jpg">Eashen</a>.<br>
                <br>
                First of all big thumbs up to our fearless leader Bgup on his 
                wedding nuptials today. Best of luck to him and his bride (plus 
                he said he would broadcast the wedding night live on the Internet!).<br>
                <br>
                Secondly happy birthday to THE RAUK, who picks up speed sliding 
                down the hill (I hope they have cushions at the bottom).<br>

                Got a second wind and dropped Nanzata with 27 EOD/TR peeps. Grats 
                Deedit on her primal warsword!<br>
                <br>
                What can I saw shit happens and Dain beat us and The Relentless 
                like silly school girls. Regrouped and beat him the second go 
                but wasn't one of our better showings. Grats Grumpyleaf on his 
                crown.<br>
                <br>
                Moved onto Sleepers and wasted Tukaarak who dropped a nice primal 
                spear for Gengice. Picked up a primal axe for Bkua along the way 
                as well.<br>
                <br>
                Somehow the zone crashed in fear. So we did Yelinak, Klandicar, 
                tried Sontolak, and then finally move over to beat down CT once 
                again. Loot was halo and 2 cloaks.<br>
                <br>
                Killed Yelinak and Klandicar with The Relentless. <br>
                <br>
                We were feeling particularly saucy so decided to take a stab at 
                Sontolak. Beat him to about 50% but it was a pretty good ass beating 
                by him on us. I am happy to report that 2 necros, a monk, and 
                THE RAUK survived the first attempt. As usual figured a bunch 
                of shit out and when we get really bored we will try him again 
                (risk vs reward gg Verant).<br>
                <br>
                Grats to Archelon of The Relentless on winning CT's druid BOTB. 
                Best of luck on test.<br>
                <br>
                Dropped CT and Zlandicar again. Loot for CT was Halo/Shoulders. 
                Loot for Zlandicar was Zlan's tailsmen, Frak's tailsmen, Claw, 
                Heart, Guantlets, Flawless diamond and 5 spells.</blockquote>

              <blockquote>We had a busy weekend this week. Friday morning we went 
                into Sebalis and camped the Mushroom King. That was great fun 
                and we ended up walking away with a Robe of Living Fungus. Though 
                it was not the BP we were hoping for, we did have fun. <br>
                <br>
                Friday night, we held our weekly raid on Tower of Frozen Shadow. 
                We worked up into the third floor with no problems. Everyone was 
                making xp and working hard when BOOM all of a sudden, Fendos is 
                summoned and killed by Tserrina. After we summoned the corpse, 
                we manage to work our way to Tserrina and kill her. Grats to Etana 
                on her pickup of the staff. <br>
                <br>
                Saturday morning, everyone saddled up and went to Howling Stones. 
                Kam's group managed to walk away with a couple VERY nice druid 
                belts. I would imagine we will try the zone again as it was very 
                entertaining. <br>
                <br>
                Sunday morning we did Chardok. Mostly for XP, we only found a 
                Trident and a Shaman Spear along the way. <br>

                <br>
                The Relentless performed well in the tournament. We had four druids 
                enter and we all won our first rounds. Unfortunately, Breezer 
                and Feral had to meet in Round 2 and Feral and Archelon had to 
                meet in Round 3. But, all in all, Relentless went 7-0 vs outside 
                opponents.<br>
                <br>
                On a side note, we killed Cazic Thule and Zlandicar tonight - 
                Lyddea got a key. But that's normal stuff nowadays.<br>
                <br>
                What more can be said about Veeshan's Peak. Hours spent killing 
                tons of dragons only to end up destroying or banking most of the 
                loot. It's still worth it however. We got a late start, killing 
                Talendor well after our designated start time. As usual, he went 
                down like a total chump. Our chanters forgot to Shissar everyone, 
                so we were attacking really slowly. We figured it was to give 
                Tal a fighting chance. He didn't have one.<br>
                <br>
                Zoning into VP was fun as usual. People had decided to die the 
                night before zoning in, I'm still not sure how they managed it. 
                We ressed them or dragged their corpses, and set up as usual.<br>
                <br>
                Things started off badly, pulling Silverwing at the same time 
                as another Wurm. Fortunately Aly was able to kite it away, and 
                Silverwing went down like a chump as usual. Drops from him included 
                a Hammer of the Dragonborne, so at least we knew they trip wouldn't 
                be a total waste.<br>
                <br>
                Of course, while ressing a few people from the Silverwing fight, 
                Hoshkar decided to drop in and join the party, wiping us out completely. 
                Yay.<br>
                <br>
                We ressed up and headed to Hoshkar's lair to fight him. One of 
                our groups died on the way do to some miscommunication problems. 
                Too lazy to res them, we just dragged their corpses back to camp 
                and waited for Hoshkar to arrive. Hoshkar went down in record 
                time. FOr the first time we managed to kill Hoshkar on the first 
                attempt. Sadly enough, our post-Hoshkar strategy still needs much 
                work, and we had 2 more wipeouts simply trying to get from Hoshkar's 
                lair back to the camp spot. Sadly, we killed every dragon on the 
                first try on this trip, yet we still managed to have 3 full wipeouts. 
                GG team! Hoshkar dropped the kickass cleric staff, but nothing 
                else useful.<br>
                <br>
                Then we headed deeper into VP-land, and pulled Phara Dar, our 
                favorite dragon-which-fight-is-completely-based-on-luck. Unlike 
                last time where we had only 5 deaths, this time we only had 5 
                survivors, but Phara died anyway. We obtained the server's first 
                Crown of Phara Dar for Merauk, Shroud of Veeshan for Omalley, 
                and Yuunb's Earring for some other as-of-yet-unknown EoD guy. 
                No weapons on Phara = good news!<br>
                <br>
                Then we proceeded to lay waste to the "lame dragons", killing 
                Druushk really quick. Now at this point I had to bail cause i 
                was in serious need of some alcohol, so the rest of this is hearsay. 
                I will mention however, that when a see-invis wurm spawns up near 
                the doors to Druushk/Nexona/Xygoz, it can be REALLY annoying. 
                Probably should have killed it, but instead we took the lazy way 
                out and left him up and waited for him to wander to the right 
                place. So while I say at my computer waiting for the Wurm to move 
                so Gengice could come and open a door for me, my liver started 
                yelling at me, demanding the alcohol it so rightly deserves. So, 
                the lesson for today: If you want to drink, kill all the see invis 
                wurms!<br>
                <br>
                After Druushk died, the team killed Xygoz, but he didn't drop 
                anything useful, and since he's not really a dragon, more of just 
                a gold plated bug, it's not really worth mentioning what happened. 
                I'm not sure what happened, but Nexona never died, which is for 
                the best imo, because Nexona is one uglee looking dragon, and 
                is no fun at all when half your raid force dies after Nexona does.<br>
                <br>
                This was all Friday btw, as usual, the weekend was full of a bunch 
                of nothing events, so until something interesting spawns I guess 
                it's gonna be a bunch of no-updates or boring updates. Not sure 
                which are better. </blockquote>

              <blockquote>Friday night started off on a rescue mission for Altora. 
                He was stuck in a death loop in the monkey caves in Wakening Lands. 
                After clearing the monkeys so Altora could log on, we killed one 
                monkey that had Gloves of Kromzek Might on him. Darias was there, 
                so he got them. Yeah! So after all Altora corpses were rezzed, 
                we moved over to the planned raid at Kedge. Someone forgot to 
                inform Phinny of our plans. The big fish in a pimp robe failed 
                to make an appearance. We did kill Cauldronboil and Estrella before 
                our numbers thinned out and we called it a night. Our two guests 
                were lucky on the rolls tonight. Rado won the roll on the Sharkjaw 
                Cutlass and Venswayla won the roll on a Prayer Shawl before she 
                passed and it went to Altora (the next highest roller).<br>
                <br>
                It was a very slow start in Wakening Lands on Thursday night. 
                A few people gathered to get strong wooden branches and raptor 
                guts for the Ice Forged Shackles. After a rough start, the monkey 
                cave was cleared and the loot started dropping. I had to leave 
                before the event was over, so part of this account is from me 
                and part comes from Galaen. Tons of Mojo sticks dropped. Since 
                anyone could cast the effect, we handed them out and blasted monkeys 
                with them. These spells dropped: Mage - Summon Shard of the Core 
                (4), Necro - Chilling Embrace, Enchanter - Wandering Mind (2) 
                and Wizard - Invis to Undead (2). Rado and Voompa got Gloves of 
                Kromzek Might and Azzor got Holgresh Spirit Beads and one of the 
                Wandering Mind spells. Here is who got branches: Thomdar, Maffil, 
                Pipp, Bakdor, Voompa, Rado, Greyy, Galaen and Tharuzdin. After 
                everyone that needed branches got them, they went out hunting 
                tigeraptors. None dropped guts, but Thomdar already had some from 
                before. Everyone headed over to Iceclad to watch him finish the 
                quest and he is now the owner of Ice Forged Shackles. Grats!<br>

                Cataluap called on the guild to come quickly and help her in Neriak 
                Tuesday evening. Verina Tomb had spawned and another guild had 
                backed off from killing her due to low numbers on their part. 
                We formed three groups of mostly guild members plus some friends 
                that Cat called to helped. Verina fell down really fast. She didn't 
                even get a complete heal off of her. Cat looted Innoruuk's Words 
                and then thanked everyone about a million times. She was quite 
                happy. Grats Cat! I took one picture of Cat next to the corpse, 
                waiting for it to open so she could loot.</blockquote>

            All of the above Guild News was either taken from the guild web sites 
            or news which was mailed into me. The only modifications made, have 
            been to any spelling errors.
