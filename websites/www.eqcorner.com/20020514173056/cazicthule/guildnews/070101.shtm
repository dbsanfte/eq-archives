              <blockquote>07/07/01: BDA, VG, and Shahmat join us for a little 
                POG. Tearing it up for abit until we once again get a sudden case 
                of A.D.D. We decide that Fayle must die and begin to pull his 
                big woody ass. Last time I saw that much wood, it was at the band 
                camp bonfire. =P By the time we played musical monks to get our 
                asses res'd it was rather late so we called it a night. Not much 
                dropped, but gratz go out to Darias on the Beserker Helm, Rado 
                and Ointment on their Stonewood Mail. How about a little cow action 
                tonight? <br>
                <br>
                07/06/01: We take BDA, VG, Attekah, and Olebass deep into DN for 
                more exploring. We see the entire Chetari side tonight up to the 
                lava. Was a good night for tank drops. We scored several weapons 
                and a couple of priest BP gems dropped. We didn't get the flawed 
                diamond that we came for, but we owned DN outright. Look for Boner 
                Airwayz coming to a zone near you.<br>
                <br>
                07/05/01: Since last night went so well in Kael, we decided that 
                more giants needed to die! BDA and VG join us for a little courtyard 
                action in which much giant ass was raped. Gratz to Caymon on his 
                leather tunic and Bolgor on his plate legs. We were able to kill 
                ahead of schedule, so we pulled Kallis for the hell of it. During 
                the camp Caymon wondered why the female gnolls dislike him.<br>
                <br>
                07/04/01: Happy 4th everyone. BDA and again some VG all thought 
                fireworks were over-rated so we decide to kill in Sirens and Kael. 
                Gratz to Rabrak on his new belt and ice on the plate legs that 
                dropped. We had a few plate drops and some silk, was a nice calm 
                evening that was much needed for all. I came across this web page 
                while surfin......enjoy. <br>
                <br>
                07/03/01: Last night was so bad it took me a day to have enuff 
                courage to post it. We take BDA and some VG down to DN to yet 
                once again get reminded that we must cross our t's and dot our 
                i's, laziness in this zone will rape you. All I can say it was 
                as ugly as Blighte's mom the morning after. We had some gem drops 
                and we also snagged yet another Kelp tunic on the way. Very character 
                building evening. F Verant! We also tag Ganadan as a lackey tonight, 
                welcome to BFD bro.<br>
                <br>
                07/02/01: Atte, Ginss, Kati, Lazz, and Meph join us as we all 
                opted for Siren's Grotto tonight since the drop rates are through 
                the damn roof atm. Pulled down 2 more ancient seahorse cloaks, 
                another kelp tunic, and various kelp items. I am currently banning 
                Twigs from anymore underwater adventures until he completes his 
                arm floaty quest. The whole time we were in Sirens, Mustaffa was 
                in Sebilis and kept us informed how the King was up and had been 
                for awhile. We finally got our fill and decided that the King 
                must die! The best part of the King adventure iz that it turns 
                into a F*** OZZYENNE story. WOOT! King dropped like the chump 
                that he iz and left his tunic for our collection, did it with 
                10 minutes left till server patch. Gratz go out tonight to Atekah 
                and Reddish on the cloaks and the tunics went to the guild funds.</blockquote>

                Dalnir was great fun and quite a success despite our unfortunate 
                demises. Zasiss managed to escape without a death and walked out

                rotate Nagafen with is in Temple of Veeshan for next few days 
                and are unable to get to Nagafen. I have scheduled a raid for 
                Saturday at 10pm EST. I will be doing some RL stuff and will be 
                on right at that time. I will take names when I get on. <br>

                07/05/01: Vox dies for a seventh time at the hands of another 
                Brewall led raid. The cruel oppressor felt the hot hand of death 
                tonight and her rule over Permafrost has ended. Textbook execution 
                of surround maneuver again and even though she managed to get 
                off 1 complete heal, she went down easily. Drops were: White Dragon 
                Scale [Persecutis], White Dragon Scale [Greymask -> 3 high level 
                bards present, rolled for trade - Lovern (58 bard) won and I enforced 
                trade of WDS for a Heirophant cloak, no need to send Greymask 
                tells, he never actually had the WDS], Rune Bolster Belt [Sintosa], 
                Dragon Bone Bracer [Chiun], and a Kayvrul's Mystical Pouch [Rizzhogg]. 
                Brewall raids are now 7-0 versus Vox and 1-0 versus Nagafen. No 
                books yet again. Only seen 1 frost book drop on last 7 raids.

                looking for some spell drops. Much easier to get here with the 
                changes to the port spells. Killed Eldrig the Old and let a bard 
                from Horizon's loot, and killed other named mobs a number of times 
                as well. </blockquote>

                Upper Guk raid. Although it was not completely productive for 
                some i think all had a good time. Sadly some who wanted to come 
                along could not, but we shall have more raids in the future and 
                hope you can join us. I do want to convey a thought to all. When 
                things get hairy, and all is not going so well, i do hope that 
                i never see it turn into a Free for All and people hightailing 
                it out, leaving their guildmates to fall at the hands of our foes.<br>
                <br>
                I can only hope i lead by example, and nearly at the cost of my 
                life stood at my mates sides and tried desperately to save them. 
                My own sacrifice would have been worth it had i been able to allow 
                one of them the chance to escape. I hope this is an attitude i 
                will find guild wide. We are not cowards, and Hecate will not 
                suffer cowards. This comment has no target, only something i wish 
                to say that i feel normally goes unspoken.<br>
                <br>
                All in all i was elated to fight at your sides, and look forward 
                to another battle. For me it is not win or lose, but who i share 
                the honor of standing victorious, or fall beside.<br>

                Elme with her druid Epic<br>

              <a href="http://relentless.volitionx.com/main.shtml"><b>The Relentless</b></a> 
              <blockquote>07/07/01: After a really horrid start, two days of non 
                stop disasters, and starting off today with two big wipeouts, 
                we finally got ourselves on track. No more putzing around, it 
                was time to kill Dragons! First though, we downed a few named 
                drakes for some 'trinkets'. Laldarie and Lyddea both received 
                a shield, Athren got a necklace. Unlike last night, we didn't 
                end up pushing a drake into a wall and making it warp, so it was 
                all good.<br>
                <br>
                We then started off with Lord Feshlak. Now Lord Feshlak is a grade 
                a certified wuss compared to the other dragons. Yet for some reason 
                we felt compelled to make it harder. So we ended up wiping out 
                twice before finally pulling him for real. He dropped the server's 
                first Chestplate of Fiery Might, which Ianin received. At least 
                when a caster gets the Vulak robe, no one will be able to tell 
                Ianin that they have a higher AC BP than him.<br>
                <br>
                Moving on, we pulled Dagarn the Destroyer. I don't really like 
                Dagarn. He drops lots of cool monk stuff, so you'd think that 
                I like him but I don't. The reasons are this: <br>
                <br>
                1. He's a wurm. I don't like wurms. I don't like killing wurms. 
                I like killing dragons. Killing wurms makes me feel like I'm in 
                Burning Woods again, and I was never even IN burning woods. Maybe 
                the necros and shamans feel this pain more than me.<br>
                <br>
                2. His AE is really annoying. It doesn't do that much damage and 
                it's not really that hard to deal with, but he spams it at an 
                insane speed. I mean, the spam in ToV when there are 3 separate 
                raiding forces hitting it is pretty bad just cause of shout and 
                ooc. But Dagarn's AE spam is by far worse than that.<br>
                <br>
                3. His tail can be used as a whip. Now that's just stupid. Who 
                the hell would want to rip the tail off a wurm and use it as a 
                whip? I mean have you SEEN the wurms in ToV? Their tails are thicker 
                than an ogre's legs. It's just stupid.<br>
                <br>
                Anyway, Dagarn dropped Wurm Claw Pauldrons for Malstorme and a 
                Wurm Hide Robe for Grizumpy (sadly enough, this robe is just considered 
                resist gear for him and was gonna rot if he didn't want it).<br>
                <br>
                We then headed to Kriezenn. Kriezenn is kinda a badass. Compared 
                to most other ToV dragons. But our bfa ultra-secret strategy defeated 
                him handily. We had our five druids kite him around the ToV North 
                shrine area until our necro's DoTs wore him all the way down. 
                Athren got some kind of 50ac horn from him when he died.<br>
                <br>
                Moving from Kriezenn to Mirellena we ran into a few problems but 
                we managed to recover from the one wipeout we had. I'm not sure 
                what caused it, but as is popular practice in our guildchat, everyone 
                blamed the people that couldn't hear our own guildchat. Poor Venid, 
                who wasn't guilded by EoD or us was probably getting blamed for 
                snowstorms in antarctica.<br>
                <br>
                Lady Mirellena was pulled shortly afterwards and while she was 
                buffed a tiny bit, it didn't really make a damn bit of difference. 
                She dropped a nice Orb of the Crimson Bull for Kobadshaw.<br>
                <br>
                We then decided to press our luck and pull Fishmaster Koi Doken 
                right before the drake respawn. Koi was a wuss so we weren't worried. 
                Of course, Koi got buffed too but he was still pretty doable. 
                The two drake adds that we got during the fight due to respawn, 
                however, proved to make the fight quite exciting. While I was 
                kinda praying for a total wipeout so we could call of the rest 
                of the raid and I could get to bed, unfortunately the BFA managed 
                to keep things together and Koi Doken went down handily along 
                with the drakes. And fortunately, Smakbuk was able to scavenge 
                Deep Sea Leggings off of him. We thought the legs would look deep 
                green or something, and make Smakbuk look REALLY hideous (as an 
                ogre SHOULD look), but instead they ended up matching his BP off 
                of Telkenor perfectly. So he actually almost looks stylish now. 
                We gave him -20 DKP for this affront, but let him keep the legs.<br>
                <br>
                At this point we had 5 dragons dead today, and were getting kinda 
                tired, but we still had enough people and energy for a few more. 
                So we headed up to the north section (what I call ToV North North. 
                Well actually, more like ToV North Northeast, since ToV North 
                North would probably be a different area, but I digress...). We 
                pulled Jorlagg the incredibly annoying vox clone. All over the 
                world, people hate vox clones. Vox herself was always a bitch. 
                Then there was Gorenaire, the most annoying white dragon to kill 
                thousands of newbies a week in Dreadlands. And then our friend 
                in Sleepers, Ventani the Warder, who has the most unbelieve set 
                of abilities. And now there's Jorllag. He's not tough, or scary, 
                or dangerous. But he's still a vox clone, and for that we hate 
                him. We smashed his face in, and for our troubles, he gave Damodread 
                a Facesmasher, which we hope he puts to good use in the cleric 
                botb.<br>
                <br>
                Finally, for the last dragon of the night, we took on Lady Nevederia. 
                Now some people say Kriezenn is one of the toughest. I think Lady 
                N is far worse. The fight is longer and you don't know until the 
                end if you'll win or not. She's kinda like Phara Dar on crack. 
                And one of her AEs makes you spin around. And she casted Forlorn 
                deeds on me for half the fight. But regardless, she had to die, 
                and die she did. Zith ended up getting a Cloak of Thorns for our 
                trouble.<br>
                <br>
                This ended our night. We managed to take out 7 dragons. Probably 
                not our record, but damn close. After 2 horrible days or 1 or 
                2 boss mobs, getting 7 at once is always a good morale booster. 
                Congrats to all on their loots and our victories. Unfortunately, 
                the patch and other events are preventing us from going further 
                and doing new dragons on this trip, but on the next trip I'm hoping 
                to report the death of some new dragons.<br>
                <br>
                07/06/01: We decided to do some ToV last night. It went disastrously. 
                Every problem that could happen (bad pulls, camps trained, crs 
                busted, spawns at wrong times) DID happen. We all felt much pain. 
                The stench of death was in the air. It didn't smell good. We did 
                manage to kill Ikatiar and Eashan though, as well as get a few 
                other good drops. I got the Ancient Wyvern Hide Tunic. Bodmerian 
                got Wyvern Hide Boots. Lyddea got Onyx Chain Sleeves. Archimedez 
                got Bracelet of the Sky. Faio got Chain Leggings, and Faolan got 
                Plate Leggings.<br>
                <br>
                07/04/01: Another emergency patch another fun filled patch day! 
                Dain, Yelinak, Nanzata, Tukaarak, Hraashna, and Master of the 
                Guard all killed. Loots were Krak-dwarf slaying belt, Averyl-hammer, 
                Zith-dragon slaying gaunts, Gizumpy-yelinak robe, phaenon-sleepers 
                key, Kobadshaw-staff of morning dew and dragonscale mask, seudar-red 
                resist stone, mintern-clawed guardian bracer, smakbuk-primal axe 
                and athren-priceless spear. Not bad for a hard day's work. <br>
                <br>
                07/02/01: Started the night with the destruction of Trakanon with 
                a guild low of 23 people. We OWNED him. Thanks paly bp and mantle. 
                Then we returned to sleepers. Once again we journeyed into the 
                land of phat lewt. Golems and sentries dropped like rangers on 
                Trakanon raids. Then onto the warders. Warders 1-3 dropped in 
                pretty routine fashion. Grats Hamishh on the guild's first, and 
                server's first, clawed guardian bracer. Grats Noa on his 2hs primal. 
                Grats Seudar on his staff thingy. Grats Mand on a primal lance 
                and primal axe (we got to get people to give these too). Grats 
                Dori on the mask and we had a couple resistance stones given out.<br>
                <br>
                We didn't stop there. We thought we would try this guy. Hail Ventani 
                the Warder.</blockquote>

              <blockquote>07/07/01: Shahmat welcomes Gish and all of Equinox's 
                senior players. Both guilds are strengthened with the merger. 
                We are honored that Gish and Equinox choose us, and look forward 
                to a fruitful time together in Everquest with them. Additionally 
                and in no small part because of our merger with Equinox some very 
                personal firsts for Shahmat this week; we surpassed 50 members 
                total, and achieved over 35 members online at the same time. We're 
                still looking to recruit a few good people, we would like to be 
                able to consistently field 36 members online. When something pops 
                up, we'll be ready. Between second and third shift jobs in the 
                US and a small but strong contingent of European players - we've 
                got a consistent if lowered presence even during off peak hours, 
                which is good to see. If you are curious about us, we invite you 
                to contact any member of Shahmat online or visit our web site 
                at www.shagya.com - also, we are pleased to announce that Nandaar 
                has returned to fulfill his role as our Recruitment Officer.<br>
                <br>
                Raiding - we slowed down a bit this week, only two raids on Chardok, 
                two on howling stones and one to the hole. We'll be speeding up 
                our raids this coming week. Watch our web site for details on 
                upcoming raids <a href="http://www.shagya.com">www.shagya.com</a>. 
                We have begun working toward our epic weapons in Ernest, and have 
                appointed Sneeky as our Epic Raid Officer, along with Lenwae as 
                our Raid Officer.<br>
                <br>
                We're polishing our resist gear (or buying it :) and getting ready 
                for dragons. Watch this space soon for news on that front.</blockquote>
