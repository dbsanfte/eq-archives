              Nothin much goin on the past few days, people just checkin out the 
              new zones (fungus grove, go somewhere else 105 players at any given 
              hour) and the rest who dont have the expansion are chillin in the 
              old zones grinding out the xp. Me, Mal, Ritah and afew others decide 
              to check out The Grey. The usual crazy drop rates for these new 
              zones, we probably walked off with about 2-3 decent items each and 
              had named mobs about every 5 minutes. I think its something they 
              did on purpose to lure people to buy thier new expansion and as 
              usual when the novelty wears off and they sucker enough people over 
              there they will nerf the hell out of it.</p>
            <p>Anyway today we'd like to welcome Aumeshing, Aarorn, Tephlon and 
              Falorm as our latest lackeys. Please purchase coffins at your local 
              merchant. <br>

              December 14th: Each day there's a patch, CC/Talons moves a little 
              bit further in our quest to clear NToV, and last night was no exception. 
            </p>
            <p> First, again, was Eashen of the Sky. Grats to Rulak and Minke 
              on their Claws of Lightning. </p>
            <p> Next was Ikatiar. Grats to Soonice on her Ancient Wyvern Hide 
              Leggings, and Murf and Catch on their<br>
              Ancient Wyvern Hide Boots. </p>
            <p> Then Roy. Not even 3 adds could deter us from taking this guy 
              down without a wipeout, although the<br>
              HT from the black drakes hurts! Grats to Ulthumbra on his Katana 
              of Pain and Farun on his Circlet of<br>
              Summer. </p>
            <p> Lord Feshkar...we didn't have a chance for a good try on him the 
              night before because of time<br>
              constraints, so he died easily last night. Oh yeah, almost forgot, 
              Valorath did a great job on the pull of<br>
              this meanie. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Grats Hass on his Staff of the Silent Star, Skeezix on his Thunderstone, 
              and Kaylynne on her Vambraces<br>
              of Discontent. Dargan..he's a wurm! </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Grats Olebass on his Bow of the Destroyer, Saze on his Ancient 
              Wurm Hide Leggings, and Whopper on<br>
              his Wurm Claw Pauldrons. </p>
            <p> Last up for the night was Lord Kreizenn. </p>
            <p>Grats to Gukaz on his Kreizenn's Flame, Warlor on his Silver Disk, 
              and Delila on her Dawncaller. </p>
            <p> The random drops for the night were a Ring of Superiority to Heellar, 
              two Shields of Thorns to Sehria<br>
              and Twenky, a Bow of Silver Fang for Jozz, Shield of Wurms for Motu, 
              Shadow Fang Necklace for Tegian<br>
              and Shield of the Protector for Conanan. Great work everyone! It 
              was definitely a night to be proud of!</p>
            <p>December 13th: Server down again, meant Iki, Eashen and Roy again 
              for us. </p>
            <p> First Eashen, grats to Shaofung on his Fist of Lightning and Vyce 
              on his Cloak of the Sky. Then Iki...Grats Saze on his Ancient Wyvern 
              Hide Tunic and Pava on his Mask of Venom. </p>
            <p> Next was our good bud Roy. The fight went as smooth as it did 
              the night before, thanks Warlor for<br>
              documenting what happens when a rogue ends a dragon fight with 8 
              hps left. Grats to Kinson on his Katana of Pain and Avar on his 
              Rocksmasher. </p>
            <p> Assorted drops as we cleared were a Shadow Fang Necklace to Talons, 
              a Silver Fang Necklace to Murf,<br>
              a Bow of the Silver Fang to Widowstein, a Runed Fang Necklace to 
              Whopper, a Shield of the Dawn to<br>
              Delila and a Shield of the Wurms to Egral. </p>
            <p> Grats to everyone that got some new loot to play with, it was 
              a fun night for us all!<p>
              December 12th: Thanks to Verant, we got to do it all over again! 
              This time the lag was better, there were no mass LDs and we got 
              the job done! </p>
            <p> First up again was Ikatiar. Grats to Tarisk and Tegian on their 
              new Poison Soaked Tunics. Then Eashen, Grats to Kinson on his Ring 
              of the Sky and Whoa and a Talons Monk (sorry, didn't catch the name) 
              on their Fists of Lightning. Set up again for Roy, time was on our 
              side again. One of the mobs along the way decided to drop a Bow 
              of Silver Fang for Sylverblade. </p>
            <p> Then, the big guy, Roy....It always feels good to drop a mob on 
              the first attempt! Grats to Spiritsong on his Katana of Pain and 
              Tyriaana on her Circlet of Summer. A very good night all around 
              for CC/Talons, securing our spot on a NToV rotation!</p>
            <p>
              December 11th : CC/Talons made their first venture into NToV yesterday. 
              Connectivity issues and lag was a huge factor, but we still had 
              a good time and managed to kill 2 of the first 3 mobs. </p>
            <p> First, was Ikatiar the Envenomed. Grats Murf on his Ancient Wyvern 
              Hide Tunic and Zugshad on his<br>
              Cloak of Venom. Grats Talons on their Ancient Wyvern Hide Sleeves. 
            </p>
            <p> Then came Eashen of the Sky. Grats Druss on his Twisted Steel 
              Bastard Sword and Darrak on his Cloak of the Sky. Grats Talons on 
              their Bracelet of the Sky. </p>
            <p> Aaryonar's guards gave Talons a Ring of Superiority and Shaofung 
              a Silent Fang Necklace. It got to be<br>
              too late with the impending patch for an actual attempt on Roy himself, 
              so we'll down that beast today!<br>

              Both the Prince and Overking of Chardok were killed this evening. 
              This raid was 
              our second prince killing and our first king, and it was also our 
              first large scale 
              raid that mixed standard pulling and AE tactics. Grats to Mysyn 
              for getting 
              enchanter epic piece and to Skylynn for getting to within a Ragefire 
              of a cleric 
              epic! We are very close to having two more class epics within the 
              guild. Other drops this evening were Argent Defender [Lisner] and 
              a Palladium Axe [Valstorm].
            <p> DEC 09, 2001<br>
              Attack of the killer Groovs. Today was practical joke time on our 
              resident Sorcerer Groovit. About twelve of us made HE wizards with 
              names similar to Groovit's including: Groovite, Groovism, Groovitsold, 
              Groovstyles, Groovikat, Groovinacht, Gagrgov, Groovitsego, Groovdawg, 
              Groovycajones, Groovieluv, Groovtastic, and Groovthaag. We sent 
              Groov a message over guildchat that Al'Kabor was in Felwithe and 
              needed the assistance of a powerful sorcerer. Groov quickly loaded 
              up port and rushed to GFay as quickly as he could to try to get 
              in on the event. As soon as he ported in though, the 'Groovs' began 
              to spam him with stupid questions and OOC'd/shouted Groovit's typical 
              hotkey setups. Took him a couple minutes to realize that he had 
              been had and even though the real Al'Kabor was not present, a fun 
              time was had by all.</p>

              A number of guild raids have taken place over the last several days

              Hail Riders! While everyone is getting used to SoL and getting their 
              computers upgraded, we have been doing a few exploration runs in 
              SoL. First off we hit Maiden's Eye, and got some good Medalions 
              and weapons. Then we headed to Arkheda (Or something like that) 
              Ruins. There we picked up some really decent weapons including a 
              14/27, 8str 8sta sword that has a badass graphic. Lastnight we spent 
              some time in Fungus Grove and got a truckload of spells. We also 
              managed to pick up a few 6ac 55hp 55mana 10DR 5CR rings. We will 
              continue exploring in the next few days.

              Thanks to the never ending patches from &quot;Nerfs of Luclin&quot; 
              the servers reset again. So we ventured into ToV for a second dose 
              and attempted Telkorenar and Gozzrem again. </p>
            <p>Both went down and nice loots were collected. </p>

              Thursday 13 December, 2001 <br>
              A Great Day! <br>
              The day started off with Project Eon taking a trip to ToV. However, 
              on the way there we discovered Myga was up so of course we just 
              had to kill her. Grats to the 2nd Wizard with Dragonsbane in Eon, 
              Dallandra! </p>
            <p>After that we went into ToV with our allies, Anavon, and took down 
              Telkorenar with ease on the first attempt. <br>
              Drops: </p>
            <p>Eon - Circlet of Suffering - Azazu <br>
              Anavon - Lance of Thunder - Pepi </p>
            <p>After being successful with Telkorenar we decided to press our 
              luck and attempt Gozzrem. In what was one of the closest fights 
              that we've ever had with only 4 melees left remaining at the end 
              of the fight we managed to prevail! GG |337 paladin tanking and 
              ubah monk damage Fantastic job all and grats on the great loot! 
              <br>
              Drops: </p>
            <p>Eon - Circlet of the Silver Skies - Samirah <br>
              Anavon - Bracelet of Protection - Emmuno <br>
              Eon - Eye of Rigtorgn(Rigatoni) - Hedstone </p>
            <p>Next time you see Hedstone please ask him to share his ice cream. 
              Also, grats to Hedstone on picking up a Plate BP from TOV as well 
            </p>
            <p>The great day was not complete after ToV as we took an expedition 
              into Hate in search of epic drops and came away with Eon's 54th 
              epic, Arrynean's Ranger epic! Grats! Also, look for another Enchanter 
              Epic in the future.<br>

              Epic 53: Vidar <br>
              Some bored Eon's went to Timerous Deep together with Vidar the Flying 
              druid. According to rumour Vidar was last seen in EC behind the 
              2nd Inn trying to impress and cyber female druids with his new Epic. 
              Anyway...gratz to Vidar for finally getting this done.</p>

            <p> 12 December 2001</p>
            <p>It seems like every 5 minutes the servers are coming down, so off 
              to Kael we go to farm some more phat lewts. This time we had a little 
              competition so while the other people in zone wasted Vindicator 
              and Statue we took down Tormax.<br>
              It wasnt all that easy unfortunatly and as Tormax enraged the zone 
              crashed and the other guilds in zone lost their Vindicator loot 
              as the zone was reset to about 15 minutes prior. So we cleared to 
              Tormax again after res'ing and quickly dispatched him...in a fairly 
              sloppy manner. It happens, on to the loot right?</p>
            <p>Congrats Choter on Giant Head and thank you to my guild for awarding 
              me Velium Encrusted Gauntlets. Sweet.</p>
            <p>Hopefully sometime this month we'll have a solid few days of no 
              patches so we can get around to accomplishing something, cheers. 
            </p>
            <p>11 December 2001</p>
            <p>We welcome Tdill, 60th enchanter, hailing from those faraway lands 
              of where they don't speak right, to our family.<br>
              Also, contrary to Lovern, who is a crabapple, I think most of us 
              are enjoying the AA experience.</p>
            <p>Our ranks are now full of Barons. Grats Baron Soel, Baron Teufle, 
              Baron Talzok, Baron Mintern, Baron Farea, Baron Crover, Baron Kobiera, 
              Baron Trucari and any more I might have missed.</p>
            <p>I expect these and more people to get uppity attitudes in the near 
              future </p>
            <p>11 December 2001</p>
            <p>Well, once again, its back to the exp grind. I'm sure everyone 
              can relate to the short-lived feeling of accomplishment at your 
              exp gains meaning something again. Took about 2 AA Points for that 
              to wear off. Already I want to crawl to ebay and curl up in a corner 
              sucking my thumb. Damn exp. <br>
              So we got off our collective asses and went to Kael for some killing.</p>
            <p>First to die was King Tormax. Congrats to Shar on Ring of Lightning 
              and Trucari on Giant Head.</p>
            <p>Next we offed Derekor the Vindicator. Congrats Hyperio on Boots 
              of Vindication.</p>
            <p>Then we killed the Statue of Rallos Zek. Two Reavers and two Hammers? 
              Always a party you giant POS.</p>

              Hey there Campers. Took a small hiatus from updating to deal explore 
              the new expansion. Like a lot of y'all, I had some problems getting 
              it up initially. The EXPANSION, you perv. What have we been up to? 
              Lots of exploring, a little bit of raiding and a whole HEAP of tech 
              support. While that might not sound like worlds of fun, I can tell 
              you it is! Looks like our family is growing once again. Please take
