<b class="heading">Analeia, Part V</b><br>
<i>by</i> Penya Dreamlight

<br><br>
Worlik was uncomfortable. Leave it to elves to build a city in the trees where every step carried you close to a fatal fall. Worlik tried not to look down too much, and when he stepped onto the lifts, he did so with the utmost care. He noticed that his concentration drew more than one chuckle from the wood elves that called this place home. Let the frivolous race laugh. Dwarves were not meant to stay in the dizzying heights where only birds should travel, especially on the poorly constructed (at least by dwarven standards) walkways precariously hanging among the branches. As always when he was in too much contact with the elves, he thanked Brell that he was of a more sensible race that built their homes in the solid protection of a mountain.
<br><br>
It was safe to say that Worlik hated Kelethin. Not only was he forced to remain dangling above the ground with nothing but unstable wood below his feet, but he was also surrounded by wood elves. Elves, as a race, were far too flighty for his dwarven temperament. They seemed to concern themselves too much with music and magic. Their thoughts were scattered and impractical. It was due to a less-than-sensible elf that he was here in the first place. For the last two weeks he, Analiea, and Loralie had been trying to retrace the steps of the elder Dreamlight. Sometimes it was easy to forget how long-lived the elves truly were. He remembered hearing stories as a child of Dreamlight. His father would occasionally go adventuring with Dreamlight, bringing back tales of giants and dragons, and huge undead creatures inhabiting mountainsides. As Worlik grew up he began to hear how Dreamlight had told his family that he was not going to settle down in Felwithe and be a good noble son, nor would he marry the woman that he had been betrothed to since birth. Worlik also remembered the day that the wayward Dreamlight stumbled into the dwarven city with a half-elf baby girl, Analiea. This girl was his daughter and soon became the reason he returned to Felwithe. There he did what he swore he would not do - marry his high elf betrothed, Loralie's mother. All three children grew up knowing Dreamlight was a traveler.
What they did not know was that how long Dreamlight had been away from Felwithe. The elders of the family would refer to Dreamlight's little jaunt with an amused irritation. Even Loralie's mother shrugged it off as a short time when he had left the fold. Over the last couple of weeks, however, when really asking the details of his absence, it quickly became evident that he had been gone for close to two hundred years. Certainly long enough to have traveled the entire known realms. In order to find the sword in their dreams - although Worlik was beginning to doubt the reality of all of this - they would need to retrace the elder Dreamlight's footsteps.
<br><br>
Worlik hated travel, and he knew his wife would not be happy.

So, while Loralie and Analiea traveled through Kelethin chasing the rumor down that Dreamlight had adventured with a wood elf bard for awhile, Worlik sat in a tavern, trying to drown his sorrows. He wasn't being very successful. The alcoholic fare in Kelethin was weak at best. He sat at his table, perfectly sober, doing his best to scowl so that no one would join him. As he sat there, a female wood elf bard came to his table and began to serenade him. In irritation, Worlik raised his hand for another drink and did his best to ignore the attractive woman as her voice spread throughout the tavern. The twenty or so people there seemed far more appreciative of her talents than Worlik, but she stubbornly stayed, trying to get the dwarf to smile at her. Worlik, in turn, changed tactics and glared at her fiercely. The whole bar was watching the exchange at this point, and Worlik didn't like being the butt of some stupid elven joke. In fact, trying to cheer up the sour dwarf so amused the patrons of the hall that the woman's small pouch placed on the floor nearby was quickly filling.
As the dwarf's attention was focussed on the bard, the barmaid went to pick up his drink from the bar. She put the mug on her tray, but was distracted for a second when a flirty customer grabbed her arm and demanded a kiss. She laughed, hitting him lightly and told him to stop. She never saw the man next to them both reach out a hand and quickly empty a packet of powder into Worlik's ale. The drink fizzed for a moment, but settled down in time for the waitress to turn around and pick up the tray. The strange human that had spiked the drink quickly got up and walked out of the tavern.
<br><br>
The barmaid put the foaming drink in front of Worlik. The dwarf had decided that it was time to leave this place and the irritating elves in it. With a quick gesture, Worlik guzzled down the last ale, noting as he did so that the silly elves couldn't even make ale without a slight, bitter aftertaste. With a grumble, Worlik stood and slapped down a few gold coins to cover his drinks. Swift strides carried him towards the door, and the tavern roared in laughter. Worlik decided he would take a lift to the ground. He had told Loralie and Analiea that he would meet them in the Tavern, but they knew him well enough to know he would leave. When he stepped outside he noticed that his peripheral vision seemed a bit blurred. Perhaps the wine was a bit stronger than he had thought. Suddenly he felt flush and lightheaded at the same time, and his limbs seemed very, very heavy - so heavy in fact, that he considered sitting down. Abruptly he shook his head. No, he would make it to the lift if he had to drag himself across the entire city. He needed to get out.
<br><br>
In his determination to escape the home of the wood elves, Worlik never realized just how bad his eyesight had really become. Nor did he realize that he was not walking in a straight line like he thought he was. The dwarf was indeed making to the lift, but in a weaving line that was drawing the attention of the people around him. One of the merchants frowned, and came up to Worlik to ask him if he was Ok. Worlik growled something unintelligible at him and continued his awkward movement to the lift and the edge of the platform in the trees.
<br><br>
Worlik was being overwhelmed by green leaves. It seemed to him that he could not see anything but the branches of the large trees of the forests. How could the elves be so unorganized as to let the branches stop visitors from walking across the platform? Worlik began to wave his arms, pushing the branches aside only to be overwhelmed by more. To the elves, he seemed to be a crazy dwarf waving his arms at nothing but air. Few approached him in fear of being hit, particularly since he carried dual swords at his side. One elf, however, did begin to follow a couple of steps behind him as he approached the edge of the platform. She looked around for any other dwarves that may be accompanying this one knowing he needed help. Soon he was within a couple feet of the lift, which was quickly being cleared to make a path for him. As he was about to go on the lift, Analiea and Loralie were walking across a rope bridge that ended on the platform. They saw their stumbling friend and began to pick up their pace to join him.
<br><br>
Analiea and Loralie were almost in time to prevent Worlik from going off the side of the platform. In a sudden lurch, Worlik moved to get on the platform, but with his distorted sight he ended up missing the lift by a couple of feet. As he fell forward, the wood elf who had been following him dove forward, catching his arm as he pitched over the edge, his momentum dragging her forward. She managed to stop her own descent, but found herself lying on the platform, barely holding on to the hand of a delusional dwarf who was dangling nearly a hundred feet in the air. Analiea and three of the merchants also ran forward catching the wood elf before she too was toppled over the edge. Red-faced and straining they managed to pull Worlik up, dragging him roughly unto the platform. "How can someone so short be so heavy?" the wood elf asked breathlessly.
<br><br>
Analiea ignored the comment of the woman and looked at Worlik carefully. "Drunk?" the wood elf asked.
Analiea shook her head, "No, I don't think so." She felt his forehead and put her hands on his chest. "He is barely breathing." Analiea looked around at the crowd of elves that were beginning to gather around them. Do you know of a place I can take him for a few minutes?"
<br><br>
The wood elf nodded, "He can come to my house It is two platforms away." For the first time Analiea and Loralie really looked at the woman who had saved their friend's life. She was petite in the way of most of her race, with auburn hair and green eyes. She was clad in blue armor that was very much like Worlik's and seemingly made by the same craftsman. She looked to be only a little older than Worlik, and had the characteristic demeanor of someone who had seen a lot of battle. "Come on lets move him." The warrior stood and began to tell the crowd to step back and let them through.
<br><br>
Analiea nodded, first casting a quick healing spell. Worlik was still getting worse. Loralie quickly summoned a pet that floated over and picked him up. At the looks she received from the other two women she shrugged and said, "This is much easier."
<br><br>
They didn't argue. The trio crossed over the rope bridge and crossed the platform to a small hut built in the corner. It was not as fine as many of the homes in Kelethin. The stranger quickly opened the door to reveal a three-room hut. There were no doors between the rooms and they could see an older woman lying in a bed in the sideroom. The stranger pointed to the bed in the second room and said, "You may lay him in there." The pet obliged leaving Analiea to attend their friend. Even in the couple of minutes that it had taken to get to the home Worlik had gotten much worse, so much so in fact that Analiea thought he had died. In desperation she placed her hands on his chest and petitioned to Errolise Marr. Instantly Worlik's color returned to him and his breathing normalized, but the effort left Analiea a little weak.
<br><br>
As the paladin attended the dwarf, Loralie turned to the wood elf and made formal introductions. She didn't notice as she identified Analiea and herself, the elderly woman in the other room suddenly sat straighter and began to stare hard at her visitors. The younger woman said, "My name is Inilia Treeshadow, and this is my mother Immagine. It is good to meet you."
<br><br>
"I am sorry to disturb your home," Loralie replied, "We have been having strange things happen to us lately."
<br><br>
Inilia smiled, "You travel with a dwarf - it is to be expected."
<br><br>
Loralie nodded, "You seem to do a little travelling yourself," as she stared pointedly at the crafted armor.
<br><br>
Inilia grinned, "I have been known to yes. What business brings you to Kelethin?"
<br><br>
Loralie began to explain that they were retracing their father's footsteps when a rather loud curse interrupted them and Worlik demanded, "What is going on here? Where am I? Analiea, you let me out of this bed."
<br><br>
Analiea shrugged, stood up, and turned to walk into the main room with her sister. She stated simply, "I think he is feeling better."
<br><br>
Worlik followed a second later demanding, "You didn't tell me what happened. Why aren't I on the ground yet?"
<br><br>
Analiea rolled her eyes and addressed Inilia quietly, "I think we will be leaving now. Thank you for your time."
<br><br>
Within a couple of minutes the trio left. For a moment there was silence between mother and daughter. Finally the mother asked what happened. After Inilia gave a quick overview, Immagine stated, "It relieved your boredom for the day."
<br><br>
Inilia laughed, "Well, I guess you could say that."
<br><br>
Immagine nodded thoughtfully, "Seeing adventurers like that probably makes to long to go back to that instead of tending your sick mother."
<br><br>
Inilia shrugged, "We each do what we have to, Mother."
<br><br>
"Yes but you don't 'have to' do that. Besides, I saw you muttering to yourself after going to the bank. We are out of money, aren't we?"
<br><br>
"That is my problem, Mother," Inilia snapped as she turned to her room to remove the armor that she had been contemplating selling to make ends meet.
<br><br>
Immagine sighed, "Child listen to me. I'm not stupid. I heard you talking to your old friends about the high elven city in that new territory. I know you are dying to visit it and see what is out there. I think you should go."
<br><br>
"And what about you?" Inilia asked sharply. "You are far from being well. The clerics said it would be a few months before you could travel again."
<br><br>
"We have neighbors, I will be fine." Immagine paused a moment and said, "Come here a minute, I have something for you."
<br><br>
Inilia crossed over to her Mother's room. "There is a false bottom in my wardrobe. Open it and get the bag inside it," Immagine commanded. Inilia frowned but did as she was told. She opened the wardrobe to reveal the relics from her mother's youth. In the wooden furniture was a second set of blue armor, only this was a much deeper shade. Hanging from hooks were a variety of musical instruments including a horn, drum and lyre. Inilia knelt and removed the blue boots to pull up the false bottom of the wardrobe. Inside the revealed cavity was a bag made out of hand painted material that looked like silk but was much stronger. The scene on the bag was a detailed scene of battle, so detailed it was morbid. Inilia couldn't believe the artistry, but found the subject matter odd. She did not stop to examine it carefully however. If she had, she would have seen the now familiar picture of a fight for a sword in its center. She would have also noticed that the picture changed depending on the angle which it was viewed. Inilia was far too intent on what was inside the bag. She opened it to reveal an ornately carved sword. She was stunned that such a weapon should be in their possession. Inilia stood, cutting the air with the sword to try to get the feeling of the weapon.
<br><br>
"This is fantastic," she breathed.
<br><br>
"You should have it. You are a warrior, my child, and you will need such a thing. I think you should go to Kunark."
Inilia just looked at her mother and said, "I will sleep on it." Both women, however, knew that the matter had already been decided.
<br><br>
After she had left, Immagine sunk back into the bed that she had been prematurely bound to and frowned into the distance. Sending her daughter to the outpost solved two problems. It also kept a promise that she had made a long time ago.
