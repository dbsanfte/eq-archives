<b class="heading">War: Royal Knights &amp; Scabrous Raiders</b><br>
<i>by</i> Joshua Reed aka (...Xavier GM of the Royale Knights...)

<br><br>
A faint wind blew threw the trees, stiring the leaves and they fell to the ground. In the distance an owl hooted. A faint cool mist lined the air. It always amazed Stewd how peaceful autumn could be.
<br><br>
He gave a longing sigh and bolstered his confidence. He had never quite got used to going into villages. He was never a confident type. Even after all these years in the Royale Knights, he was still a shy creature. Although the brotherhood did much to boost his self worth, it would never be the same.
<br><br>
Years of torment at the hands of his father would haunt him forever.
<br><br>
He was nearing the edge of the village now. He reminded himself that his mission was important. They must be warned of the danger. The orcs were gathering near here,and soon they would rape and pillage their way across the countryside. This was his last stop before he reache the Royale Knight stronghold to gather the knights and march on the orcs. He was already overdue in his scouting mission and was making the best possible time. This stop though was nessecary.
<br><br>
As he approached the village he noticed something was drastically wrong. Fires were shooting out of the windows. Stewd caught a faint ordor that turned his stomach.
<br><br>
He now found himself running for the village. Not knowing how, his sword was in his hand. He raced past empty and burning houses, past the inn which had already been burnt to the ground.
<br><br>

He reached the town square and stopped dead in his tracks. Bodies were everywhere. Men women and children alike. In his mad rush he barely noticed the perpatrators of this horrible act. Mostly dark elves, but a few other races. And there were also orcs standing around. Could these monsters be in line with the orcs. If this was true things could be worse than he originally thought. The Knights needed to be warned.
<br><br>
Stewd spewn on his heal, hoping that he was not noticed. But luck was not with him this day. As he turned his way was cut off. He was now surrouned. He realized the futility of his situation.
<br><br>
Strangely enough though, knowing he was going to die, he was not afraid. Ever since he joined the Royale Knights he knew this day would come. He felt a strange calm. He know knew what he had to do.
<br><br>
With a prayer to Mithaniel Marr, and a shout of glory for the Royale Knights he plunged into the biggest group of orcs.
<br><br>
What a sight he must have been, here came a screaming human running right at them. Cutting down orcs and humans alike. Suprise was with the human. The closest orc suddenly sprouted a red line across his throught. The suprise however did not last long. The next orc in line brutally thrust his spear at this mad human. But the human was not there. He easily dodged the clumsy attack and severed hte hand with a reverse stroke of his broad sword. Ducking low he dodged the swipe of a long sword and parried the thrusting spear sent his way buy a clumsy human. He followed through with the parry and brought his sword in line with the orcs head. The orc barely got his blade up in time to deflect the blow, but he was knocked off balance. Stewd placed a well aimed kicked to the nether region and sent the orc flying. He spewn on the human and lauched a flurry of attacks meant to take away the length advantage the human had with the spear.
<br><br>
Every warrior posses a sixth sense, and this sense told Stewd to dodge to the left. He flung himself into a roll and came up with his sword in a ready posisiton. The human was on him in an instant, driving his spear straight for Stewd's heart. But instead of blocking the thrust like the human wanted he stepped into it and moved slightly to the left. The spear missed his heart by a hair and sliced his chest open. Stewd ignored the pain and slammed his hilt into the mans face. Out of the battle with the human stewd now faced his new opponent. A dark elf. Unrefutably a group of the finest warriors in all the lands. They faced off and lauched a flurry of attacks and parries that were all but a blur. Neither gaining the upperhand. After several tense minutes of battle they broke apart.
<br><br>
Suddenly with a gleam in his eye the dark elf dropped his blade and turned away, knowing the paladin would not strike. Confused Stewd could only rush for the retreating drow. But that was his mistake. To late the warrior instict again told him to duck. But it came not in time, for he never saw the blade enter his back. Unretutably the finest warriors, but also the most dispecable creatures.
<br><br>
Stewd felt an odd calm as he fell to the ground, but also a great sorrow. He would not return in time to retrieve help. He could only think about the people he had let down. But these living thoughts only lasted a moment as he was gently placed in the arms of his loving god. And Mithaniel Marr looked upon him not with shame, as he had expected, but with honor and pride.
<br><br>
"You have done well for me my son. Come now for your deserved rest."
<br><br>
Xavier and the Royale Knights had ridden for most of the night. Stewd had not returned from his scouting mission and there was something wrong. Being the leader of this bunch brought great responsibility. He felt like a father to them. For they were his family. He was linked to each of these warriors more firmly than anything in the world. When one died he felt his heart being ripped from his chest. And he had that feeling when he walked into the small village at sunrise. The stench of battle was almost sickening. Bodies lay everwhere. Men brutally killed, women violated, and children murdered. Nothing of value was left in the village. They slowly made their way through the ruins. Eventually they came to the square where Stewd had made his stand. If they had not known any better it looked as is ten men had stood here instead of one. But the pride that Xavier felt was quickly put to rest. For in the exact center of the square was the naked body of Stewd. He was pinned spread eagle to what was left on the wall of the town hall. There was one distinguishing mark on the wall. Xavier knew this mark well for it was becoming more prevalent throughout the land. The banner of the Scabrous Raiders. On the spot Xavier vowed for vengenence. Not only for his fallen comrade but for all those that had been killed. He stoled his emotions away and tucked them in a deep corner of his heart. A warrior could not afford to be consumed with grief when the battle came. Singaling his troops they marched for the morning sun. They would catch up with the fiends and then.............
