                Ill Hudson man took own life after long hours on Web<br>
                By STANLEY A. MILLER II<br>
                of the <b><a href="http://www.jsonline.com/">Journal Sentinel</a></b> 
                staff<br>
                Last Updated: March 30, 2002<br>
                Shawn Woolley loved an online computer game so much that he played 
                it just minutes before his suicide.<br>
                <br>
                The 21-year-old Hudson man was addicted to EverQuest, says his 
                mother, Elizabeth Woolley of Osceola. He sacrificed everything 
                so he could play for hours, ignoring his family, quitting his 
                job and losing himself in a 3-D virtual world where more than 
                400,000 people worldwide adventure in a never-ending fantasy.</p>
              <p>On Thanksgiving morning last year, Shawn Woolley shot himself 
                to death at his apartment in Hudson. His mother blames the game 
                for her son's suicide. She is angry that Sony Online Entertainment, 
                which owns EverQuest, won't give her the answers she desires. 
                She has hired an attorney who plans to sue the company in an effort 
                to get warning labels put on the games.</p>
              <p>&quot;It's like any other addiction,&quot; Elizabeth Woolley 
                said last week. &quot;Either you die, go insane or you quit. My 
                son died.&quot;</p>
              <p>In the virtual world of EverQuest, players control their characters 
                through treasure-gathering, monster-slaying missions called quests. 
                Success makes the characters stronger as they interact with other 
                players from all over the real world.</p>
              <p>Woolley has tried tracing her son's EverQuest identity to discover 
                what might have pushed him over the edge. Sony Online cites its 
                privacy policy in refusing to unlock the secrets held in her son's 
                account.</p>
              <p>She has a list of names her son scrawled while playing the game: 
                &quot;Phargun.&quot; &quot;Occuler.&quot; &quot;Cybernine.&quot; 
                But Woolley is not sure if they are names of online friends, places 
                he explored in the game or treasures his character may have captured 
                in quests.</p>
              <p>&quot;Shawn was playing 12 hours a day, and he wasn't supposed 
                to because he was epileptic, and the game would cause seizures,&quot; 
                she said. &quot;Probably the last eight times he had seizures 
                were because of stints on the computer.&quot;</p>
              <p>Woolley knows her son had problems beyond EverQuest, and she 
                tried to get him help by contacting a mental health program and 
                trying to get him to live in a group home. A psychologist diagnosed 
                him with depression and schizoid personality disorder, symptoms 
                of which include a lack of desire for social relationships, little 
                or no sex drive and a limited range of emotions in social settings.</p>
              <p>&quot;This fed right into the EverQuest playing,&quot; Woolley 
                said. &quot;It was the perfect escape.&quot;</p>
              <p>Vulnerable to addiction<br>
                Jay Parker, a chemical dependency counselor and co-founder of 
                Internet/Computer Addiction Services in Redmond, Wash., said Woolley's 
                mental health problems put him in a category of people more likely 
                to be at risk of getting addicted to online games.</p>
              <p>Parker said people who are isolated, prone to boredom, lonely 
                or sexually anorexic are much more susceptible to becoming addicted 
                to online games. Having low self-esteem or poor body image are 
                also important factors, he said.</p>
              <p>&quot;The manufacturer of EverQuest purposely made it in such 
                a way that it is more intriguing to the addict,&quot; Parker said. 
                &quot;It could be created in a less addictive way, but (that) 
                would be the difference between powdered cocaine and crack cocaine.&quot;</p>
              <p>Parker doesn't make the narcotics analogy lightly. One client 
                - a 21-year-old college student - stopped going to class within 
                eight weeks after he started playing EverQuest his senior year.</p>
              <p>After playing the game for 36 hours straight, he had a psychotic 
                break because of sleep deprivation, Parker said.</p>
              <p>&quot;He thought the characters had come out of the game and 
                were chasing him,&quot; Parker said. &quot;He was running through 
                his neighborhood having hallucinations. I can't think of a drug 
                he could have taken where he would have disintegrated in 15 weeks.&quot;</p>
              <p>Common warning signs<br>
                There are several questions people who think they are addicted 
                to computers and the Internet can ask themselves to see whether 
                they might have a problem, Parker said, including whether they 
                can predict the amount of time they spend on the computer or have 
                failed trying to control their computer use for an extended period 
                of time.</p>
              <p>Parker said that any traumatic setback to Shawn Woolley's character 
                in EverQuest could have traumatized an already vulnerable young 
                man.</p>
              <p>It may be that the character was slain in combat and Woolley 
                had trouble recovering him. Or, he could have lost a treasured 
                artifact or massive wealth, or been cast out of one of the game's 
                social clubs, called guilds.</p>
              <p>&quot;The social component is big because it gives players a 
                false sense of relationships and identity,&quot; Parker said. 
                &quot;They say they have friends, but they don't know their names.&quot;</p>
              <p>Elizabeth Woolley remembers when her son was betrayed by an EverQuest 
                associate he had been adventuring with for six months. Shawn's 
                online brother-in-arms stole all the money from his character 
                and refused to give it back.</p>
              <p>&quot;He was so upset, he was in tears,&quot; she said. &quot;He 
                was so depressed, and I was trying to say, 'Shawn, it's only a 
                game.' I said he couldn't trust those people.&quot;</p>
              <p>Sony Online Entertainment declined to comment for this story, 
                but EverQuest fans say the game is a fun diversion that is much 
                better than watching television.</p>
              <p>'It's like an adult playground'<br>
                Donna Cox of Schaumburg, Ill., has played for about two years 
                and enjoys the adventuring and socializing. Cox and her husband, 
                Bob, play together and team up against the game's challenges.</p>
              <p>&quot;It's like an adult playground,&quot; said Donna Cox, a

              <p>Cox played about 40 hours a week at the height of her gaming 
                but now plays only a couple of times a week. &quot;Once you get 
                into the high-end game, it takes a a lot of time,&quot; she said.</p>
              <p>Dody Gonzales of Milwaukee has played the game for about three 
                years and has more than a dozen characters spread across the EverQuest 
                realm. Gonzales, who plays about four hours a night, knows EverQuest 
                has been blamed for people's problems because it's a topic discussed 
                in the online community.</p>
              <p>Said player Vincent Frederico of Rochester, N.Y.: &quot;It's 
                almost like a drug. If you are not happy with your real life, 
                you can always go in. . . . Someone who lacks social skills, they 
                could find it much easier just to play the game instead of going 
                out to a bar.&quot;</p>
              <p>A game without end<br>
                How does it pull people in?</p>
              <p>One key component is that the game can be played indefinitely, 
                and there are always people populating the online world. EverQuest 
                and other online games also have a social structure.</p>
              <p>&quot;The graphics are absolutely thrilling. They just haul you 
                in,&quot; said Parker, who has treated several people for EverQuest 
                addiction. &quot;The other piece is that it takes time to leave 
                the game. You have to find a place to hide to get out, and that 
                makes people want to play longer.&quot;</p>
              <p>For people who are unhappy, socially awkward or feel unattractive, 
                online games provide a way to reinvent themselves.</p>
              <p>Shawn Woolley - who was overweight, worked in a pizza restaurant 
                and lived alone in an apartment the last months of his life - 
                may have depended on EverQuest to provide the life he really wanted 
                to live.</p>
              <p>&quot;People like to create new personas,&quot; Parker said. 
                &quot;You see a lot of gender-bending.&quot;</p>
              <p>Hooked on 'EverCrack'<br>
                Interest in online games grew in 1997 with Origin Systems' Ultima 
                Online, now with about 225,000 players. Microsoft's Asheron's 
                Call, with around 100,000 subscribers, provides a virtual world 
                similar to EverQuest's. Most online games require an initial software 
                purchase plus monthly fees of about $10.</p>
              <p>The games have roots in Dungeons &amp; Dragons, the role-playing 
                game created in 1974 by TSR Games in Lake Geneva. But D&amp;D 
                requires human contact to play; its digital counterparts do not.</p>
              <p>David Walsh, president of the National Institute on Media and 
                the Family in Minneapolis, said many EverQuest players refer to 
                it as &quot;EverCrack.&quot;</p>
              <p>Walsh, who didn't know the details of Woolley's suicide, thinks 
                mental health problems linked to playing online games, especially 
                EverQuest, are growing.</p>
              <p>&quot;Could a person get so engrossed that they become so distressed 
                and distraught that it could put them over the edge?&quot; Walsh 
                said. &quot;It probably has something to do with the game. But 
                your average person or average gamer won't do this. It's a coming 
                together of a number of circumstances.&quot;</p>
              <p>Walsh and Parker both said online games as a whole are not inherently 
                bad, and Walsh compared playing online games to drinking alcohol. 
                Both can be harmful if abused.</p>
              <p>A call for warning labels<br>
                &quot;I've seen a lot of wreckage because of EverQuest,&quot; 
                Parker said. &quot;But they are all the same. It's like cigarettes. 
                They need to come with a warning label. 'Warning, extensive playing 
                could be hazardous to your health.' &quot;</p>
              <p>Warning labels are exactly what Jack Thompson, a Miami attorney 
                and vocal critic of the entertainment industry, wants to result 
                from a lawsuit he plans to file against Sony Online Entertainment 
                for Elizabeth Woolley.</p>
              <p>&quot;We're trying to whack them with a verdict significantly 
                large so that they, out of fiscal self-interest, will put warning 
                labels on,&quot; he said. &quot;We're trying to get them to act 
                responsibly. They know this is an addictive game.&quot;</p>
              <p>&quot;I am sure we are going to find things akin to the tobacco 
                industry memos where they say nicotine is addictive,&quot; he 
                said. &quot;There is a possibility of a class-action lawsuit.&quot;</p>
              <p>John Kircher, a professor at Marquette University Law School 
                and expert in personal injury law, said a negligence action might 
                be won if plaintiffs could successfully argue EverQuest's publishers 
                &quot;should have foreseen an unreasonable risk of harm, that 
                people could potentially hurt themselves.</p>
              <p>&quot;Then there is the issue of First Amendment rights,&quot; 
                Kircher said. &quot;Does the First Amendment right trump the rights 
                of the plaintiff? If the Internet is a form of publication . . 
                . there is a balance the courts try to strike, and it's not an 
                easy question.&quot;</p>

              Well, after yesterday's story on the death of an EQ addict, a lot 
              of you had something to say. Some responses were good, some were 
              bad, and one I got was just plain stupid. Here are some exerpts 
              from some good and bad emails: </p>
            <p><b>Jason Cummings writes:</b> I have only been playing EQ for a 
              couple of months now and from what I have seen and my personal experiences, 
              this game can be like any other drug out there. I have found myself 
              wanting to play while at work, or out with friends. I have even 
              found myself day dreaming of the day when my characters are high 
              level and can go venturing off to those places that I cannot even 
              imagine at such a low level. The thought of being revered by others 
              for your accomplishments and your equipment in such an expansive 
              community is appealing. The one thing that keeps me from going from 
              an EQ gamer and enthusiast to an EQ addict is my family. My girlfriend, 
              whom I live with, keeps me in check by allowing me to play the game. 
              I know that sounds weird, so let me explain. She keeps me from playing 
              too long by allowing me set times that I get to myself to play. 
              So I no longer feel like I am neglecting her, or my real life, by 
              playing, and knowing that I play with real life friends that I had 
              before I new of EQ also helps to ground me in real life. I use the 
              game as a way to relax and have fun, not as a way to escape my real 
              life problems.<br>
              I don't believe that Sony or Verant is, in any way, responsible 
              for what happened. Shawn was diagnosed with problems that were not 
              related to EQ. His EQ addiction, as it seemed from the article, 
              only helped by giving him a safe-haven from the world he so desperately 
              wanted to escape. Instead of EQ, it could have very well been alcohol, 
              drugs, crime, or any number of things that could make him feel better 
              about himself or more powerful that others.</p>
            <p>The last statement I will make on this subject is on the topic 
              of warning labels for video games based on their perceived addictive 
              nature. Now I think that this is a load of crap. Anything and everything 
              can be addicting in the hands of someone who wants them to be. So, 
              are we going to now label everything with warning stating that it 
              is possibly addictive? How about a rating scale similar to the way 
              that we rate movies. That way, we can prevent children from getting 
              their hands on the addictive games like twister and hop-scotch until 
              they have sufficient mental capacities to see these games for the 
              gateway games that they are. Come on! This type of argument is exactly 
              what is driving us to a society that doesn't feel they should be 
              responsible for their own actions. &quot;It wasn't my fault, I was 
              addicted...&quot; People now-a-days need to wake up and take responsibility 
              in life. I agree with keeping violent and sexual content out of 
              the hands of minors, don't get me wrong, but not even my cigarettes 
              have a warning that say they might be addictive.</p>

            <p><b>Michael Haggerty writes:</b> The woman seems so ready to blame 
              a game for their son's suicide, when the information in the article 
              makes it clear that he had other deep-seated mental health problems 
              which apparently went untreated. I mean look at these things taken 
              from the article linked off your web site:</p>
            <p>1. The man &quot;was playing 12 hours a day, and he wasn't supposed 
              to because he was epileptic, and the game would cause seizures.&quot; 
              Is that the sort of behavior a stable, rational person would exhibit? 
              I really don't think so.</p>
            <p>2. &quot;A psychologist diagnosed him with depression and schizoid 
              personality disorder, symptoms of which include a lack of desire 
              for social relationships, little or no sex drive and a limited range 
              of emotions in social settings,&quot; but his mother thinks it is 
              the game's fault that this guy killed himself? Give me a break. 
              The guy was a nut case who happened to play Everquest. The dysfunctional 
              aspects of his game playing weren't the cause of his mental illness, 
              they were merely a symptom of it. It is ridiculous to blame a person's 
              mental illness on a game when it is clear that he had the mental 
              illness before he ever started playing it.</p>
            <p>I sympathize with the poor woman who lost her son, but blaming 
              the game for his death is simply wrong. People seem so needful of 
              finding something other than their loved ones to blame when their 
              loved ones do stupid things like this, but they really need to face 
              the facts. There are hundreds of thousands of people playing the 
              game. The vast majority of them live normal, productive lives. Clearly 
              it wasn't the game that caused the problem here.<br>
            </p>
            <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>

              <b>Josh writes:</b> As I read the article, I felt very sorry for 
              the family and the friends this man left behind on his death. But 
              then that one phrase stuck out at me. &quot;His mother blames the 
              game for her son's suicide.&quot; Games have been blamed for violence, 
              death, and who knows how many other incidents in this country. In 
              my opinion, games have never, ever been the fault of these incidents. 
              It's like saying that if there's a car accident, it's the car's 
              fault, when 99.9% of all accidents are caused by a careless driver. 
              It says in the article that her son had serious mental illnesses. 
              These illnesses were the cause of his death, not EverQuest. His 
              family should of worked harder to address his mental condition and 
              get professional help.</p>

            <p><b>Duane Yates writes:</b> The tragic case of Mr Woolley deserves 
              a considered response. It reminds me of a case which occurred here 
              in Australia several years ago, with a young man who was addicted 
              to playing Dungeons and Dragons. In that case the person took to 
              living out his fantasies and attempted to harm his real life ex 
              girlfriend. At the time, people blamed his actions on that game. 
              In that case as well as this one however, this blame is misdirected.</p>
            <p>It is an understandable reaction for a grieving parent to attempt 
              to seek answers or apportion blame. But what we are dealing with 
              is not a disturbance brought on by a game, but a disturbed person 
              who happens to choose that milieu in which to manifest their disturbed 
              state.</p>
            <p>It would make just as much sense to say that, for example, Christianity 
              is harmful because occasionally a disturbed zealot goes off and 
              kills a prostitute believing that God had instructed to do so. In 
              each case, the milieu is not the cause of the disorder, merely one 
              of innumerable possible expressions.</p>
            <p>For an addiction to occur requires the meeting of an addictive 
              personality with an addictive substance. There are many addictive 
              substances available in our society, some legal such as tobacco 
              and alcohol or gambling, some illegal such as heroin and cocaine, 
              some borderline such as pornography. Most of these are not only 
              addictive but also physically harmful and or financially crippling. 
              Addiction generally can be psychologically based, physiologically 
              based, or both.</p>
            <p>I know something about addictive personalities. My relatives include 
              a heroin addict, a cocaine addict and an alcoholic . It is probable 
              that there is an underlying physical and heritable explanation for 
              addictive personalities.</p>
            <p>When one looks at the range of substances available, it seems to 
              me that if I had to choose between cocaine, alcohol, heroin, tobacco 
              or Everquest for a relative to be addicted to, I would choose Everquest. 
              At least I could hope that typically no long term physical damage 
              was likely to occur to them physically. (The case in discussion 
              being a notable exception). The financial cost of the addiction 
              is also relatively low compared to any of the others, so they would 
              not need to commit theft to pay for their habit thus harming society. 
              Furthemore, I would hazard a guess that the longer term prospects 
              for treatment were considerable brighter than say for heroin.</p>

              I just read your insert on the webpage, and figured I would vent. 
              I am sorry for the parent who lost her son, but suing the game is 
              just ridiculous. People are always lookng for excuses. If her son 
              &quot;offed himself&quot; then he had <br>
              serious problems. Not problems generated from a computer game composed 
              from a graphical representation of a fantasy realm, but from the 
              real problems in his biological life. The mother said herself that 
              she felt he had a problem and tried to get help. So the problem 
              existed before he was playing this &quot;GAME&quot; (and I quote 
              - G.A.M.E). she tries to talk about addiction, so I ask this question 
              ... &quot;Is a food addict eats so much that they get unhealthy 
              and pass away, Can you sue any food industry?&quot; The answer is 
              hell no... You did it yourself. Come on people, face the realities 
              in your life and stop trying to blaim others. Life is not easy and 
              sometimes people give up. But going around trying to sue games, 
              movies, radio is just a cheap human attempt to throw blaim from 
              themsleves. It is this type of action that has lead people to not 
              want to deal with the &quot;real world of excuse givers&quot; and 
              enjoy fantasies such as everquest.</p>

              My heart goes out to Shawn. He obviously had serious problems outside 
              of EQ and was unable to recieve the help he needed. ON the other 
              hand the moter is simply carrying a trend since the days of D&amp;D. 
              How many times have we seen this already? So long as people are 
              willing to place blame on someone other then themselves this kind 
              of thing is going to happen. EQ is no more addicting then television 
              or working out everyday or reading books everyday. If you have an 
              addictive personality not much is going to stop you from picking 
              a 'substance' whatever it may be. There isn't anything else to say 
              about this. As far as I'm concerned EQ lost a small peice of it's 
              community with his death to a real life health problem. The world 
              did not loose him because of an addiction to EQ.<br>
