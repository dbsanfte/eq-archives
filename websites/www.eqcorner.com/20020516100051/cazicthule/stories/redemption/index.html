<b class="heading">Redemption</b><br>
<i>by</i> Corue Deathstalker

<br><br>  
<img src="redemp1a.gif" width=200 height=148 align="right">Corue DeathStalker stood on a sandy hillside in the East Commons and surveyed the undead lair below. He scowled, knowing that he could never vanquish all the inhabitants of that accursed ruin on his own. He also realized that he would probably never be able to stem the ever-growing undead population that harassed Norrath, but he sure was going to try!
<br><br>
As a paladin of Mithaniel Marr, the Lightbringer, he had made a vow to destroy the foul undead whenever possible to the best of his ability. The deity had chosen him specifically for this task, and who was he to oppose Mithaniel?
<br><br>
Corue could still remember that frightful night when he had awoke in a sweat from a horrid recurring dream. In it, he was a small boy from Faydwer and his parents had somehow been made undead and were chasing him. Only, it had not been a dream. It had really happened, and he would relive every terrifying moment of that night for the rest of his life. No matter how fast he had run, they were right behind him, pawing and moaning.  He had cried out for help, but it seemed there would be no one to come to his aid.  Then, out of the darkness had come a Paladin of Mithaniel. He took the crying Corue into his arms and fought off the zombies with his free sword arm, destroying them with the power of the Lightbringer. Unfortunately, the fight had taken its toll on the Paladin, and he fell to the ground, dying from his grievous wounds.
<br><br>
Corue had tried to help the valiant hero, but the man just smiled weakly and asked the boy to stay with him until he died. The young one could only watch as the light faded from the old warrior's eyes. Corue had cried that frightful night, and he always awoke from the dream crying. and angry.

Corue scanned the skies and was relieved that the griffins were not about that morning.  His eyes fell on the Inn not too far away from the ruin and he wondered why someone would build such a structure so close to the corrupted area. At least there were guards there to protect any poor fool who wandered into the cursed territory unheeded.  The wind picked up and billowed Corue's leather cape out, bringing with it the sickening stench of death to the half-elf's sensitive nostrils. Brought out of his reverie, Corue pulled the cape in, covering up as the chill caught him.  For several hours he had stood steadfast, waiting for one or two of the unfortunate creatures to leave their abode and venture forth into the night. Only then could he safely dispatch one of them, for they were much too powerful for him in numbers. His muscles tensed under his leather armor as one of the figures below started to shamble in his direction. He prepared himself to face his fear once again, determined to defeat it as he always had. He would supply redemption to this lost soul of Norrath and put it to rest, as he would for all the lost souls he came upon. This was his pledge.
<br><br>
<img src="redemp2a.gif" width=200 height=149 align="right">
When the skeletal figure spotted Corue, its awkward gate became a powerful charge as it bore down on him. The rusty axe in its hand slashed Corue's right arm, but the young Paladin managed to parry the second attack of his vile enemy. Ignoring the pain, Corue concentrated on the battle. With a mighty swing and a loud battle cry, he brought down his two handed sword, as well as his anger. His first blow struck hard, but the creature only stumbled back a step before renewing its vicious attack. For several minutes the combat continued, each opponent delivering and taking damage. Suddenly, as if out of nowhere, another skeleton joined its brethren in the assault, bashing Corue hard and sending him reeling. A surge of adrenaline ran through his blood as fear and anger started to take over in his struggle for survival. There was no way he would back down. These poor retched souls had to be put to rest and Corue would not be so easily defeated. A mighty blow finally dispatched the first of his foes and he turned to face the other, a look of determination on his face.
<br><br>
Heavily bleeding and soar from several cuts and bruises, a quiet prayer to Mithaniel Marr escaped Corue's lips as he slashed at his second adversary.  If he were to be defeated, it would not be from behind while running like a coward to the local guard. This was his battle alone. There was more at stake than just the destruction of this undead and the redemption of its soul. There was redemption here for Corue as well, and a feeling that perhaps this time, the nightmares would end.  Maybe this would be the amount needed to redeem him in his failure to save his parents. The thought was totally illogical, for he was only a child when his parents were deprived of their lives. Yet, it was there, and the guilt was one of the many things that drove him to his destiny.
<br><br>
Corue came out of his daze as the final blow from his weapon shattered the undead before him.
<br><br>
Smiling weakly, he knelt by the bones saying, &quot;Rest now, poor souls. You are free.&quot; He fell to the ground, glad to have survived another trial as he salvaged whatever the creatures had been carrying. The monies and bone chips would perhaps be enough for him to pay for a meal and lodging at the Inn while he recovered and prepared for the next battle.
