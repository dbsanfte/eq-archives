              <blockquote>06/30/01: We sucked much ass last night and receive 
                a 5 star F for the night. We invite Attekah, Olebass, Ikaria, 
                Asxus, and Marduk to DN and kill like 8 mobs in 3 hours. We couldn't 
                get shit right last night to save our lives, matter of fact, we 
                only killed Marduk twice, however we did have two 30/40 bows drop 
                last night. On a lighter side, came across this funny as shit

                <br>
                06/29/01: We took out Renux again, this time for Twigs, now we 
                just need to kill the f****** general. After killing her, BFD 
                was hit up by a crazed player with visions of free porting. We 
                decided that because of wonderful Friday night and not many members 
                online that we'd hit the King in Sebilis. We camped him for about 
                5 hours, but he never showed. =( It's been awhile since I've seen 
                a full bubble of blue in lvl 59 tho. Also congratz go out to Caymon 
                for being inducted into the Ring of Elders, he has done much for 
                BFD lately and has been there since day one. Gratz bro. <br>
                <br>
                06/26/01: We got started really late so we decided to kill Renux 
                for Camel's epic. Thanks go out to Olebass and Kati for joining 
                us, one more hand iz always nice to have for the downtime. We 
                departed and took six BFD to HS to kill Drus. She was home and 
                we clocked her in the pooper. Checkout footage of tonight <a href="http://members.home.net/blindfaithdivision/62601/62601.htm">here</a>. 
                Tonight we tag Ointment as a lackey into the guild, welcome aboard 
                bro. <br>
                <br>
                06/25/01: Atekah, Kneebiter, and Ginss joined the BFD/BDA team 
                for a little exploring of DN last night. Found some different 
                mobs, but not much lewt wise. =( We did however acquire some badass 
                gems, some of the quest armor BP gems. We finished off the night 
                at Skyshrine, still no goddamn shawl, Kneebiter got haste boots 
                tho.</blockquote>

              <blockquote>06/25/01: Four members of Holy Fire joined allies Clan 
                Blackwatch and Praxium for an ice skating party yesterday in <a href="http://www.geocities.com/holyfireguild/velksraid.html">Velketor's 
                Labyrinth</a> that turned into yet another victory for the forces 
                of good. Upon arriving at the famed skating rink/dungeon, partygoer's 
                ears were assaulted by loud grating sounds being pumped through 
                the loudspeakers. It was immediately apparent that the evil kobolds 
                infesting Velketor's had devised the noisy new tune as a weapon 
                to drive skaters away from the icy dungeon. Their nefarious plan 
                backfired, however, as the "music" enraged the crowd. A furious 
                raid ensued and no kobold was left standing! <br>
                <br>
                06/23/01: Last night in Wakening Lands, <a href="http://www.geocities.com/holyfireguild/CassRol.html">Casseopaeia 
                confronted Rolandal</a> for the first time. This reporter witnessed 
                the exciting event first-hand. Rolandal appeared thoroughly intimidated 
                by the sight of our guild leader brandishing her new Fiery Defender! 
                When asked why a Level 60 dragon would back down from a fight 
                with a lone 59 Paladin, Cass explained, "Rolandal knows uberness 
                when he sees it." <br>
                <br>
                When this reporter asked if there was any significance to the 
                parentheses surrounding Cass's name during this encounter, our 
                fearless leader replied, "Pay no attention to those, they mean 
                nothing. Errr can you remove them in Photoshop before you post 
                this picture on the site?" Unfortunately, this reporter didn't

                a group of our 40+ went to Wakening Lands on Tuesday. We had heard 
                that there existed possessed suits of Sentient Armor walking around 
                terrorizing Tunare's creatures and we decided we must do something 
                about it. We gathered at the north east camp of the strange creatures 
                and began to pull the suits to us. Once we began, it seemed there 
                was no stopping them! For every one we pulled out of the camp, 
                another would appear to take it's place! The one consolation was 
                that since we were keeping them occupied, they did not have time 
                to continue with their reign of terror. Over the course of the 
                evening, the suits and surrounding hostile wildlife dropped a 
                quest gem for each member of the group, except Whakk, who was 
                hoping on of the suits might drop a 1/2 decent pair of pants for 
                him instead. </blockquote>

                Guess what? She's hard. Killing her guard wurms took a bit of 
                time but they coughed up CHAIN LEGS for Ugrenom and PLATE LEGS 
                for Noamuchath!<br>
                <br>
                Lenidara dropped like she's supposed too, upon her corpse were

                dispatching our pal at the door on the first attempt and collecting 
                a nifty Katana for Nochtero that turns shrimpy little inkies into 
                great big fatty tanks.<br>
                <br>
                We then did a few drakes and picked up a ring for Etiena and a

                06/30/01: We started the day dropping Dain and Yelinak, thanks 
                for the patch Verant, you guys are starting to rock, that's 3 
                times this week. Norad got an earring and Ugrenom a hammer. Not 
                to be outdone, the grand assling himself walked home with a Sleepers 
                key. <br>
                <br>
                So, EL was busy helping Cazic level in Fear so we decided to leave

                06/29/01: Well they finally brought the warders back so BFA took 
                a trip to see if they changed them. Kind of a light showing for 
                both us and EOD, only maxed out at 36 I think. Only think worth 
                noting on the way to the warders was the Priceless Spear that 
                Teufle got. So then we got to the warders. #1 up, #1 dead. Grats 
                Raanyar on his staff thingy.<br>
                <br>
                06/28/01: Cazic Thule was the first to fall, it took 2 shots to 
                slay his spikeyness, 10 hrs of patch time apparently got our groove 
                out of whack but fall he did and on we moved. Congrats to Clug 
                on his new bile etched Choker (with a name like that, it makes 
                you wonder where Cazic keeps his loot?)<br>
                <br>
                Yelinak went down like a cheap Nagafen clone, only 5 deaths (including 
                yours truly *grumble*) but that's OK! My new gauntlets more than 
                make up for it.<br>
                <br>
                And next a PJ time raid on Thurgadin to punish the Dain for being 
                short. First attempt ended in tragedy as the Dain did some late 
                night leveling and took us out. Revenge was in the script however 
                and down he went on the second attempt. Congrats to Soel on his 
                belt of dorf butchering! Huweee!! Huweee! <br>
                <br>
                06/27/01: Started the night off with a complete OWNAGE of Zlandicar 
                with 28!! That is our new record. Don't try that at home, we are 
                professionals and you could get hurt. Too bad he dropped nothing 
                of any note. I think EOD got a sleepers key. Still, 28 is pretty 
                sick on that guy.<br>

                coffer and our tightwad banker even spent some money and bought 
                some armour, spells and weapons to upgrade some of our primary 
                members.<br>
                <br>
                We have achieved our initial goal of 40 members in 30 days. It's 
                been a fast and furious time for us. With an attempt to shift 
                our focus onto Dragon killing, we're still looking for 2-3 good 
                members. We're a very strong raid guild - so if your interested, 
                let us know.<br>
                <br>
                Hate was a blast, we rocked through the second floor taking down 
                Shaman, Cleric and Monk mini-bosses and even scoring some fancy 
                armor drops. We're rolling in the loot and proving that you really 
                can share exp on a raid and be successful at the same time. No, 
                the exp split isn't exact - but everyone gets a taste. And with 
                the drops we've gotten, we've managed to give almost everyone 
                a loot item or purchase them a new toy at least.<br>
                <br>
                We're starting to gear up for dragons. We're polishing our resist 
                gear, and sharpening our weapons. We've made a few practice runs 
                with other guilds, mostly successful at this point. We're looking 
                in the next few weeks to take out a few Kunark dragons or at least 
                die trying.</blockquote>

              <blockquote>06/30/01: We waited until Fear was at full spawn before 
                starting up again. It made the day more interesting that way, 
                especially when pulling the temple. Ferkl committed suicide a 
                few times to get rid of the HT's before the mobs were pulled. 
                Grats goes out to Brewall who got an Amy Tendril that is needed 
                for his Bard Epic. Ferkl finally got his TV pants so he can quit 
                looking like he's wearing pajama bottoms. We also had three breastplates 
                drop, so Thar got a long awaited breastplate for one of his characters, 
                Gogatha is almost all green and Sarlaac can make use of that crazy 
                iksar armor that drops. Speaking of one color, Thomdar has a full 
                set of Valorium now. He's one blue little dwarf.<br>
                <br>
                06/29/01: DA/SS/EL cleared out Fear during the day, so we ran 
                into an empty plane Friday night. We all got set up and were going 
                to camp for a couple hours, thinking that's when the respawn would 
                happen, when Jimatra zoned in and found a mob. Good ole Jimz0r. 
                So we stayed and fought things here and there until we decided 
                to call it a night and try again tomorrow. <br>
                <br>
                06/28/01: Rikkir called on the guild to help take down Venril 
                Sathir's Remains that were up in Karnors. The few VG that were 
                online and high enough showed up to help. Rikkir also had the 
                help of Pale Riders for this fight. Only one battle shot was taken 
                before VS died. It was quick. Rikkir looted one stone and PR got 
                the other. Grats! <br>
                <br>
                06/27/01: Kanine was the winner of the book that dropped off of 
                Vox tonight during Brewall's raid. Now Kanine has both books and 
                can get moving on his Pally epic. Grats! <br>
                <br>
                Please welcome Rado and Whachuga officially into the guild. Grats! 
                <br>
                <br>
                06/26/01:We barged into Kael on Tuesday evening to kill some giant 
                guys for their heads that Aegien needed for his Helm of the Tracker 
                quest. A Black Blade of Tormenting and a Dire Wolf-Hide Cloak 
                dropped. Elricky from TS won the roll on the cloak. Aegien won 
                the roll on the sword, but passed to the next highest roller which 
                was Rado. Still need a picture of Aeg in his spaceship helm. Grats 
                everyone!</blockquote>
