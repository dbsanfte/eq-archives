              Lodi down <br>
              Posted by Picket On Apr 16 2002<br>
              early in the AM on monday night/tuesday morning we took out lodi 
              with little trouble and very few people. thanks to all that helped. 
              NIFTY goes out to Varrak on his shield, Meff on his shield, Lohengrin 
              on map piece and Picket on belt of great turtle. Club of the ocean 
              went to bank for funds. good job to all.<br>

              Juggs and bard Trak <br>
              Posted by Ztalten On Apr 14 2002<br>
              Started off the evening stopping by Oasis to take down the big giant 
              Cazel to get Licifed his spoon for enchanter epic. Tried to hit 
              the swamp of no hope to get Devraider's frog for epic, but unfortunately 
              it was killed right as we all zoned in... we'll get him next time 
              bud. We heard that Trakanon was due to spawn sometime that evening, 
              so we all headed to sebilis to get some spells from Juggs while 
              we waited for him to spawn. Turned out to be an incredible supply 
              of spells - almost 100 of them. Unfortunately real Trakanon didn't 
              spawn for us, but the Undead Bard did and after spending a bit of 
              time getting Corus ready to do the trigger we moved to the lair 
              and took him down with a little help from Project Eon. BIG HUGE 
              GRATS to Corus on finishing BARD EPIC. You've been working on that 
              for quite some time now and it makes us all very happy to see that 
              it's finally finished. After finishing in sebilis meff noticed that 
              the scout was up and untriggered so a few of us went and took down 
              the captain to get him a Talisman of Benevolence (7ac 15wis 55mana 
              38hp 12mr 12cr)
            <p> </p>
            <p>Grats to the following people on the spells they recieved: Gabbin 
              on Wake of Karana and Girdle of Karana; Lowkii on Quivering Veil 
              of Xarn; Thooven on Words of Restoration; Bahgoon on Words of Restoration, 
              Mythika on Entrapping Roots; Licifed on Umbra and Forelorn Deeds; 
              Kendera on Bedlam and Torment of Agli; Meff on Upheaval; Draconal 
              on Lagarn's Lamentation; Agilent on Visions of Grandure</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>We also picked up a Blood Ember Helm for Samn (21ac effect: deadeye), 
              a Hardened Clay Bracer for the bank (please post if any MAINS would 
              be interested in this bracer: 5ac 5str 5sta 5agi 5dex 1wt), a Talopmuj 
              Robe for Draconal (14ac 5str 5wis 10int 50mana effect: haste), and 
              a Manarobe for Ztalten. Grats to everyone on a very nice raid with 
              some good drops for everyone.<p>
              ToV <br>
              Posted by Ztalten On Apr 12 2002<br>
              CoG plowed through the Halls of Testing in Temple of Veeshan this 
              evening with a really nice turnout of 45 people at one point. Grats 
              to the following on the nice drops:</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Katalia on chain helm, Blasko on chain boots, Agilent on silk bracer, 
              Licifed on silk boots, Bromm on plate gaunts, Bregga on plate arms, 
              Mancinia on plate bracer, Bahgoon on plate bracer, Naezariit on 
              plate boots, and Liinc on leather legs!</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>After zoning out of ToV a few of us decided it would be fun to 
              kill Tantor the big elephant... Since we were rather unsatisfied 
              from getting nothing off his corpse but coin, we decided to give 
              Esorpa of the Ring a try. After a little bug where she fell off 
              the world and then gated on us... we managed to kill her with a 
              little help from a charmed mamoth with just the 10 of us. No spells 
              this time, but we got a book for the Wreath of Nature (5ac 10int 
              7cha 20mr 40mana) to be MQ'd for a Tunare following Enchanter.
            <p> Wednesday night! <br>
              Posted by Kraelen On Apr 11 2002<br>
              Wednesday night CoG took down Faydedar, and Gabbin became our latest 
              epic wielder!<br>
              Then we hooked up with PE to take down Velketor, followed by Lord 
              Doljornijarnimorinar (aka, Lord Bob). No idea who got what....if 
              anyone does, PM me and I'll update the news...<br>

              APR 16, 2002<br>
              Finished up on the Plane of Sky this evening by decimating bee island 
              and then moving up to the seventh, sphynx island. There, we killed 
              drakes until we had our sought after item - the crown of elemental 
              mastery. Congrats to Immolar for finishing the magician epic!
            <p>APR 12-14, 2002<br>
              Climbing the islands in the Plane of Sky the last few nights and 
              have been clearing each one repeatedly in order to get some quest 
              drops before moving on to the next one. By Sunday, we made it to 
              the Spiroc Lord and defeathered the bird several times to get items 
              for our warriors. Valstorm obtained the last item he needed to complete 
              the warrior epic, and at the end of the evening, dropped down and 
              did the turn-in. Grats to Valstorm! Soon, we will move up and work 
              towards finishing off a magician epic.<br>

              Looking for new victims - Merauk (4/16/2002) <br>
              We are somewhat recruiting again you can find more information here 
              or speak to Zippo in game.<br>
              <br>
              Hmm the board ate it - Merauk (4/15/2002) <br>
              Apparently the news script/database/whatever is acting funky or 
              something because Sarge's BL epic post done disappeared.</p>
            <p>So by demand here is a repost of the first BL epic to arrive on 
              CT. If it was possible to make an epic easier the Freebringer this 
              one is it.</p>

              Another day in the HoT. Yes, I died at least once. 
            <p>First ever leather drops today, so grats druids. Another day without 
              a monk puller and another great success. Gorewyn is now in full 
              Skyshrine so we have our uber tank for fun stuff. <br>
              <br>
              Niklas April 14, 2002<br>
              No monk. No problem. Fates took another trip into the Temple of 
              Veeshan's Halls of Testing and walked out with loads of armor. Suffered 
              a couple of wipes on adds, but for the most part we cleaned house. 
              Best part is it was all done with Gorewyn pulling. </p>
            <p>I've calculated that out of the 26 overall drops we have gotten 
              in there, we have hauled in a grand total of ZERO pieces of leather. 
              Sorry druids and monks. :) <br>

              HZ would like to extend a warm welcome to our newest member, Kcnuc. 
              Kc has been a friend of HZ for some time and finally came to his 
              senses and joined HZ! Kcnuc is a level 55 enchanter. Welcome home 
              Kc!<p>
              Epics<br>
              HZ congratulates Clik on completing his epic quest. Clik completed 
              the final battle for his epic on April 4th. That makes epic number 
              8 for House Zebulun. Congratulations Clik!<p>
              Level Progress<br>
              Many congrats are in order for all of the new level the last few 
              weeks! An excellent job by all HZ on progressing forward with your 
              levels! We are proud of al of you! Keep up the great work!<p>
              Recent Raids<br>
              Last weekend HZ and OGS spent two night on the Halls of Testing 
              in ToV. These two nights proved to be very productive.
            <p>
              This coming weekend HZ will be going back up to the Plane of air 
              for another chance to take down a few epic mobs. Our objective will 
              be to log out on the Pegasus Isle on Friday night after clearing 
              all of the 
              previous islands. We'll log back in on Saturday refreshed and ready 
              to push forward. We've always run out of time on our previous journeys 
              in Sky. Making this a two-day event should give us the opportunity 
              to 
              progress further than we have before. The port up will be promptly 
              at 9pm EST. Please be in WC at the wizzie spires ready for port 
              up. Congratulations to our loyal and dedicated raid leader, Enyon 
              on his new job OOC. Even tho it takes you away from us more, we 
              are still happy for you bro! Hurry up and get settled in so you 
              can get back to the important things! EQ and HZ! We love you bro, 
              and miss you bunches! Get well soon Iillawen!

            <p> 4-13 Grats to Knell on his Leafblower, don't forget to talk to 
              your class leader for yard duty rotations, hehe. :)<p>
              4-16 Went after Vindi with SA tonite, he didn't put up too much 
              of a fight. Grats to Hiyandryad of SA on BP. Tormax must have been 
              out of town or he would have joined Vindi. Since that was over all 
              too quickly, we hopped over to Umbral and decided to take out that 
              big mudpie Rumblecrush. Grats to Artroz of SA on BP and his accidental 
              bracer, and to Shyr of KoL on the other bracer. The party continued 
              long after this poor cleric went to sleep, but heard Sinjun got 
              a nifty 2hb Music Stand/book, grats. :)
            <p>4-17 Grats to Marrius on his Spear of Fate, just be careful where

              weather getting nice, and just overall having RL stuff popping up. 
              We did manage to do couple things of worth while note. We slew the 
              Van Dyn with Second<br>
              age one evening. Killed Doze a few times with Unseen Hand, Killed 
              Vindi couple times, Drooped Trak last night for a guild first. Killed 
              Talendor with UH, Oh and killed some Rage dragon thingy for some 
              shiny trinket that<br>
              some silly cleric wanted. GRATS KAEDIN!! on your click stick. Also 
              finished off couple druid epics Grats to Botani and Taddon.<br>

              &lt;&gt; a Scorn Banshee &lt;&gt; wants to meet Mastah Innoruuk 
              <br>
              Started out early Saturday by making mr. Rumble Crumble. 32 people 
              present, 1 shaman and 3 warriors only.....hard fight indeed, but 
              RumbleCrush fell like his supposed to and dropped the best loot 
              ever seen. Grats to Strit on Ornate Runed Shield, Sangreal on Ring 
              of Ages and Lenila on BP of integrity. Clerics were happy that day. 
              Sleepers was reported at full spawn, so we had to put the place 
              to rest once again...got a 1h primal warsword, so the trip was well 
              worth the time. Now sit tight, next info is extraordinary and will 
              most likely never happen again. We wanted to go kill Trak for a 
              few teeth, but the bugger was out collecting bonechips in FoB. Had 
              to find something to do, and Innoruuk came to mind. Most people 
              have never seen him at all, and even less battled him. We ported 
              to Hate and after wiping 2 times to bad pathing and poor raidleader 
              skills ( sorry guys ), we finally got our act together and cleared 
              a path to 2. nd floor. Now to the fight, the funiest I've anticipated 
              to for a long time, all the Knocks, Dispells, Innoruuk's poor melee 
              skills and his shuehorn of a nose....lmao.... Took us close to 10 
              minutes to bring him to rest, had adds during fight but you all 
              handled easily. Thanks alot all for joining the fight, I hope you 
              got some screengrabs and had a time worth remembering. Grats on 
              earring Hedda, Waveridder on Crown, Redracer on mask, Naggar on 
              Earring, Ragbert on Ring, Saeyara on bp, Grip on pally crown, Tuxy 
              on bard bracer and ......ninjaported Troll Shaman on Belt <br>

              My Advice For Those Who Die, Declare The Pennies On Your Eyes...<br>
              They said we couldn't do it. Thund was outa town, the assling cannon 
              was not firing all barrels, and the AoW was up. The word was out 
              that there was just no way we could handle it. It caused us great 
              concern. There was a firestorm of strategy posts flying across our 
              web board today to determine what we could do with weapon #1 on 
              the fritz. Ta tell you honestly, I was afraid to log in.</p>
            <p>I don't think I was alone in this regard. As soon as I logged in, 
              I was deluged with &quot;Please, hold me!&quot; /tells from Chadd....way 
              more than usual. What were we gonna do? Thank heavens for our newest 
              initiate Herugrim. Dorf stepped up to the plate and swung for the 
              fences, strategy wise. He came up with our newest ELITE strategy 
              when he said &quot;Why don't we just try NOT dying?&quot;.</p>
            <p>Long story short, his plan worked like GANGBUSTERS! Sure, we had 
              like 4 people who screwed up and couldn't follow the plan, but every 
              day is sort of a work in progress, right? So here is the madatory 
              pic we get to post for beasting this bad boy....Hats off to the 
              MT and healer core of SS &amp; DA, the finest folks around!</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Thursday the 11th, 2002 <br>
              When first you don&#146;t succeed&#133; throw a gnome&#133;<br>
              Using our new army of assling rangers, we were able to spot the 
              Burrower Parasite up for once since his loot had been upgraded. 
              Don't get me wrong, the loot is fantastic, but the fight itself 
              is outstanding requiring everyone to be a well-oiled killing machine. 
            </p>
            <p>Our first attempt, we breezed through the waves of wurms with long 
              breaks between each. We were rocking along on Mr. Hanky the Xmas 
              Wurm but with about 40% left we lost a few tanks to pain and suffering 
              and too many others got chewed up in the ensuing chaos. We pushed 
              it down to 20% but that was as far as we could get so we pulled 
              out for regrouping. </p>
            <p>The next attempt was beautful. We decided that the heal bug was 
              not going to be an excuse on why we failed so we adjusted our strat 
              a bit. We lost a few here and there on lag enrages during the wurm 
              waves, but when it came to Mr. Hanky we smoked him carrying most 
              of the fight on non-disced warriors. Loot was two rings, a cap and 
              a ranged item. Not bad, but where's the fricking tunics!</p>
            <p>We haven't been doing much else lately as the spring weather has 
              taken a toll on numbers. We have managed to kill a few odds and 
              ends and had a great fight on the AoW. Considering the lag and this 
              cursed heal bug, I think the below picture speaks for itself. Shame 
              he got away with his loot. </p>
