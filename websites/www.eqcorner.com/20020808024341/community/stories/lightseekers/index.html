<b class="heading">A LightSeeker's View of the War</b><br>

<i>by</i> Wiltan Ryouki of Mithaniel Marr (LightSeekers)
<br><br>
Upon returning from our honeymoon, Takhi and I were startled to see an army forming at the gates of Neriak. Scores of Tier'Dal, Trolls, and Ogres, as well as fearsome officers in shiny armor or mystical robes stood before their dark elven mistress awaiting orders.
<br><br>
Toward the front of the crowd, we saw our friend Histaffu. It was obvious he was caught up in the excitement; a lust for blood showed clearly on his face.
<br><br>
"What's going on, friend?" I asked.
<br><br>
"War!" he replied. "We're going to war! Will you join us?"
<br><br>
"You know I can't do that, Histaffu," I replied. "My guild; we stand on the side of goodness. You could have been with us; you can STILL be with us. Give up this nonesense."
<br><br>
"What? Are you crazy? You won't stand by your own kind?" he asked, astonished.
<br><br>
"You are my oldest friend, Histaffu, and I would never wish to fight you. But I can't join you in the senseless slaughter of innocents."
<br><br>
He pondered for a moment, and then replied, "Wiltan, you are a brother to me, but know this: if you stand with the army of good in this war, I WILL strike you down."

I glanced nervously at Takhi, my new bride. In some ways, it still seemed like yesterday when Takhi, Histaffu, Kaedir, and I were the 'Bone Brigade' - four necromancers who, when together, could take on the world. We were barely more than children back then. In Histaffu's rush for power, he embraced darkness and evil. Still, when we saw each other, there was always a hint of his old self about him; he often came to us with fantastic gifts; artifacts he found in his travels. For a moment, it would be like we were the Bone Brigade again. But I realize now; the Histaffu we knew in our youth was gone.
<br><br>
"So be it." I said.
<br><br>
Takhi and I faded into the crowd and waited to hear more. A rallying cry went up: "To the bridge!" The next sound was like thunder as the army of darkness rushed for the bridge that leads towards the commonlands. War cries were shouted. Wolves and bears were slaughtered simply for being in the way. And an ogre officer in gleaming platemail spoke to me as he ran by.
<br><br>
"How was the honeymoon, Wiltan?"
<br><br>
Takhi and I looked to each other. Neither of us had ever seen the ogre before, and he was leading a battalion of evil forces. How did he know us? And what else did he know?
<br><br>
Just then, the young warrior Chithd spoke through the mystical bond all members of the LightSeekers Guild share. "Whoa! I'm at the first orc camp in the commonlands. I was aiding some humans and dwarfs against the orcs, when suddenly, two Tier'Dal Lieutenants appeared from nowhere. They slaughtered everyone except me! I thought I would be next, but after the last human fell, they just returned to their posts by the orcs."
<br><br>
"Strange. Must be the vanguard of this army. I'm on my way."
<br><br>
Creating a mystical gate is child's play to a spellcaster of my ability. In a moment, I stood beside Chithd at the orc camp. At our feet were seven bodies.
<br><br>
"It all happened so fast. One second we were getting ready to bash the orcs, and the next, I was here alone." He shivered.
<br><br>
"This bodes not well, friend. You were right to contact me. That army can only be headed for the keep at Highpass. I'm going to run ahead and try to warn them. If they don't kill me as soon as they see me, I'll offer the LightSeekers' aid. That army will be passing through here soon; stay alive for now. I'll contact you when I know where we stand."
<br><br>
Chithd saluted me solemnly. I nodded. As an afterthought, I quickly wove a spell of protection upon him. Although for what lay ahead, the armor of spirits would hardly be enough.
<br><br>
It was a long run to Highpass with much danger along the way. I gathered shadows about me so I could travel unseen. And good that I did; the vanguard of the good army had set up a post at the entrance into Kithicor Woods. I easily passed by them. Through the trees I heard shouting as the army of Tunare prepared for the seige. I pushed myself to run even faster when I heard reports that the army of darkness had already reached the western commonlands. Finally, I reached the entrance to Highpass. I dropped my mystical concealment and stepped into view before the masses there.
<br><br>
A hundred swords were drawn like one. Arrows were trained upon me. I could hear magicians chanting, preparing for a magical strike. I did what any brave Tier'Dal necromancer would do. I raised my hands and surrendered.
<br><br>
A burly captain in armor that had obviously carried him through many fierce battles stepped forward. "We don't want your kind here, inkie. I don't know what you're up to, but if you are still here at the count of ten, your's will be the first blood my sword tastes tonight! One, two..."
<br><br>
I had no time. I shouted as loud as I could, "The LightSeekers wish to help the army of Tunare! You call us evil; we say we are not! Surely you won't turn away aid in the hour of your most desperate need!"
<br><br>
"... eight, nine..."
<br><br>
"Hold!" The voice was clearly feminine, yet filled with authority. A shiver went down my spine as she stepped forward, unmistakable even in her regal armor. She represented everything I had been taught to hate and fear as a child, and everything I sought to embrace and support as an adult. "Stand before me, Wiltan Ryouki of the LightSeekers," said Fiona Vie, Princess of Felwithe.
<br><br>
"Here I am," I said humbly as I knelt before her.     
<br><br>
"You seek the light, do you?" she asked, "and your guild as well?"
<br><br>
"We do," I replied.
<br><br>
"This battle is not the place for you to prove your virtue. It will begin soon; I would leave if I were you."
<br><br>
"But we wish to help. We are ready to die by your side, if need be," I offered.
<br><br>
"I feel you speak truly. You say you are ready to die by our sides; are you ready to die by our hands as well? In the frenzy that will undoubtedly ensue, I can offer no protection for your guild. The army of Tunare will slaughter every Tier'Dal, every Ogre, and every Troll they see. There will be nothing I can do to stop them from attacking you as well.
<br><br>
"If that happens, my forces are wasting their energies fighting you instead of the true enemy. Your efforts to assist us will actually distract and hinder us instead."
<br><br>
I bowed my head. I could see that she was right, but had truly hoped that this war was the opportunity I'd been waiting for to make the LightSeekers be recognized throughout Norrath as a force for good.
<br><br>
As if she knew what I was thinking, Fiona spoke again. "Wiltan, if none of your guild interferes in the war ahead, I will entertain the notion of your guild finding the light you seek. But let it be known - if even a single LightSeeker rises up against us, you will NEVER stand before me in Felwithe. Understood?"
<br><br>
I nodded, and then saluted the princess. I wasn't sure exactly what she meant. Was she offering to bring us into the light? There was no time to discuss it, though. I bowed to the captain, who was obviously disappointed he wouldn't be decorating his mantle with my scalp. Then I briskly stepped back into the woods. As soon as I was safely away, I summoned shadows around me once again and headed for home. Just as I was nearing the edge of the forest, I heard Fiona's voice shout to her troops.
<br><br>
"Let it be known to all who fight for Tunare - a group calling themselves the LightSeekers has come before me. If their leader speaks true, they are enemies of darkness..."
<br><br>
The rest of her speech was cut off by the roar of the approaching army. I did my best simply to get out of the way, and then created another mystical portal to the Commonlands. Chithd was still there, burying his friends. With him were most of the LightSeekers, waiting for my orders.
<br><br>
I could see their enthusiasm sink as I told them we were staying out of the war. But after telling the details of my encounter with Fiona Vie, their spirits raised. Perhaps one day we would be outcasts no more...
