            <p><b>News from Guilds Around Cazic Thule:</b> 
            <p><a href="http:/www.anavon.org"><b>Anavon</b></a><br>
              Jan 15 2002 - Well, I could post a lot of things that we have killed, 
              but...thats not fun...<br>
              Instead I give you... 
            <p></p>
            <p>Anavon was lucky enough to get two new lvl 60 members over the 
              past 24 hours ;) </p>
            <p>Grats to Leelidon, Lvl 60 wannabedruid, and Uros, Lvl 60 general 
              wannabe... ;) <p>
              Jan 11 2002 - Hmmm.. Lendinara must like holidaying in Rivervale 
              Regor <br>
              Patches patches.. So the usual post patch massacre with Project 
              EON... </p>
            <p>Rhag's -&gt; Rivervale <br>
              Lend -&gt; Rivervale.. deja vu ? <br>
              I'd post a shot, but one i dont have one.. and two it will just 
              look the same as the others on this page. <br>
              So here is yesterdays again... enjoy :) </p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Telk -&gt; Rivervale <br>
              Only dorfs died on this one.. and there was much rejoicing <br>
              <br>
              Jan 10 2002- Well, yet another patch....<br>
              Lendianara ----&gt; Rivervale </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Grats Wulane on her new ST key ;) And Grats Naggar from PE on his 
              new hammer, oh...And Devor on his new bad ass warrior mask ;) </p>
            <p>So we had some time to spare after killing Lendi, and... </p>
            <p>We went to ST again... </p>
            <p>Grats Blackbadger on the Anavon/PE alliance first Primal weapon! 
              Primal 2h slasher for those of you wondering ;) Thats one warrior 
              less I need to cast avatar on ;) </p>
            <p>Was damn good work by both Anavon and PE yesterday ;) 
            <p> Jan 9 2002- Well...Patch day and...<br>
              We all ran to Ssra Temple with Project Eon, and without much trouble 
              killed boss 1 and boss 2...Except for one little fudge up...Usually 
              when asked to move, you usually do it in an orderly fashion, and 
              moving the same way as the others... Today...That was not really 
              done...Half of raid went one way, other half another way, which 
              more or less resulted in a wee CR for one half :p </p>
            <p>Well, we did kill them though ;) Dropped alot of nice spells for 
              us all and a neckpiece noone wanted... </p>
            <p>Anyhoot, lusting for more spells, we ran, as fast as I have ever 
              seen PE and Anavon run, to the Deep to do some Overfiend slaying, 
              but alas, he hadnt decided to spawn yet...Oh well, no big loss... 
            </p>
            <p>30 mins later we were all in ToV, fully buffed for some Lendianara 
              slaying, and...During a test pull someone peeped out and accidentally 
              pulled her into camp...Well...Was good fight and we got her to 5% 
              despite loosing a bundle of people initially... </p>
            <p>But...Then somehow, I think, Lady Luck shined on us.... </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Was damn good kill by both guilds, only 3 deaths total, and as 
              allaince first, Devor actually lived through entire fight! </p>
            <p>Grats Balak from PE on his Sleepers key, and Andreas on Boots of 
              superiority and Pepi on Truesight Helmet! ;) Good work all ;)<p>
              Jan 6 2002 Great Alliance Day!<br>
              Wasnt a good day to be a First Brood Dragon </p>
            <p>Lendinara ---&gt; Rivervale <br>
              Alliances first go at Sontalak ---&gt; Rivervale <br>
              Zlandicar ---&gt; Rivervale <br>
              Alliances first go at Klandicar ---&gt; Rivervale </p>
            <p>Gratz all PE &amp; Anavon participants! </p>
            
            
            <p><b><a href="http://www.theblacktalons.net/news.htm">Black Talons</a></b><br>
              January 11th<br>
            Another busy evening for the Talons and CC. We headed to Fear and 
              took down Cazic and he graced us with two bile etched obsidian chokers, 
              Grats to Pava and Thamak! Our buddy the Dain was kind enough to 
              spawn and we took him down quite efficiently. Grats to Mnayr on 
              the Dain's head, and Grisham on his crown. Then Skyshrine reset 
              and Yelinak was back in his lair so we ended the night by slaying 
              him. Grats to Druss on Yeli's head, Anachronox on his ST key, Quin 
              on his new Ayillis Aged Stone Shield, and we had 3 Soul Defilers 
              drop. Two went to Avar and Ayukawa of CC and a Talons guest looted 
              the third.
            
              <p>
              January 10th <br>
            With another patch, we decided to re-live Tuesday and headed back 
              to Kael. Vindi up,= Vindi down! Grats to Keely on her new boots! 
              The Statue was kind enough to drop 2 cloaks of falling stars, grats 
              to Woodsing and Shaofung. Karri received the Hammer of Battle and 
              Fely received the Reaver. Tormax once again had to die and his 2 
              horns went to Leonroth and Chryn, his head to Anachronox and his 
              axe to Fely. One King down another to go, Yelinak was next. Loot 
              was: Vanelar on ST key, Sylverblade on whip, Ulthumbra on head for 
              gaunt quest, Gristle on Dragon Blood Earring, Mnayr on Sacrifice 
              and Urgoth on Souldefiler. </p>
            
              January 9th <br>
            Tonight we decided to take an attempt at the boss of the Deep. 
              Was a real adventure with that invisible bridge, but a ton of fun! 
              We downed the Though Horror Overfiend easily for the first attempt. 
              Congratulations to Charmm on his new Veil of Thought. We also got 
              5 level 60 spell drops. Grats to the recipients. <p>
            
              January 8th <br>
            With the patch we decided to go and visit Kael again. The first 
              lucky mob was Vindi, grats to Farun and his head for the glove quest. 
              Next was the Statue of Rallos Zek and congratulations go to Yaphan 
              on his new Cloak of the Falling Stars and Boan on his Iron Scroll 
              of War and to Silkie on her Hammer of Battle. Tormax was then destined 
              to die and his head went to Katraena, his Ring of Lightning to Vaziel, 
              Boots of Storm to Thamak and Folkar received the Axe of Kromzek 
              Kings. After Kael we proceeded to Skyshrine and downed Yelinak with 
              ease. Loot was: Qumin on ST key, Tegian on Dragon Blood earring, 
              Whopper on head, Xaphan on Souldefiler, Uzir on Dragon Eye Sage 
              Ring. <br>
              <br>
              January 6th<br>
            To finish out the weekend we decided to try Yelinak. Fight went 
              very smoothly and he came down on the first attempt. Congratulations 
              to Gukaz on his new gaunts, Murf on his Mask of the Dragon Slayer, 
              Aamaeb on his Dragon Blood Earring, Tenaril on his Sacrifice and 
              Jozz on his ST key.
            <p> January 5th<br>
              This weekend was a busy one for us and CC. We finished up ToVN this 
              weekend and had plenty of time of despair of some SoV mobs.</p>

            <p>We take it deep in the deep and for one party, we pretty much ruled

              O well, still was a blast. After all the goating around, we decide

            <p>CC and Talons went up against the Thought Horror Overfiend in the 
              Deep today, our first venture together into this zone and dealing 
              with a mob that has an AE curse was fun! </p>

              Posted by: Mirax on Wednesday, January 9th, 2002<br>
            </p>
            <p>Even a second patch last night could not stop CC and Talons from 
              killing 2 of the 3 kings of Velious last night. </p>
            <p>First up was Tormax, it was a quick battle. Grats to Vaziel on 
              his Ring of Lightning, and Folkar on his Axe of the Kromzek Kings. 
            </p>
            <p>Vindicator fell next, grats to Farun on the head for the Gloves 
              of Earthcrafting Quest. </p>
            <p>Then Statue of Rallos Zek, grats Boanerges on his Iron Scroll of 
              War and Silkie on her Hammer of Battle. </p>
            <p>The night was still kind of young, so we moved to Skyshrine to 
              give Yelinak a try. With a smaller amount of people than we usually 
              have for him, we still managed to make him dead quite quickly. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Grats to Whopper on the Yelinak head and Uzir on his Dragon's Eye 
              Sage Ring. </p>
            <p>We've certainly grown as an alliance in the past few months, and 
              a big wow goes out to Gukaz and our CH clerics, who managed to keep 
              him alive through the entire battles with King Tormax and Lord Yelinak.<p>

              After NToV, we still had plenty of Saturday left, so we decided 
              to hit Velious and see what havoc we could wreak. </p>
            <p>First, the Dain had to die: </p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>

              Mantheron on the Gaunts, Talons on the Crown and CC on the ring

              Another night with our friends the Royals Jan 09 2002<br>
              Well, was a long night, but in the end we came away with the Prince's 
              head(how nice of him to give it to us) for Draconal. Gratz Drac. 
              Also the note off the King went to a friend of ours, Ointmennt. 
              Our gift to him for his gracious help. Also gratz to Raf on his

              to Allegory(someone get him a new set of dice), and to Mareck on 
              his new SBS. </p>
            <p>Thanks to Ointmennt and also Taiwu for the time and effort they 
              put out for us. We couldn't have done it without them and they were 
              more than helpful in what they did.</p>
            <p>
              Venril Sathir Falls Jan 07 2002<br>
              Well, VS was taken down in house tonight. Gratz to Icar on his new 
              Donal's legs(not a bad pair of pants for a level 50, hehe), Myrlokar's 
              greaves went to Allegory(the real Al, a fine welcome back to EQ), 
              and lastly, GRATZ goes to Khay who finally got the elusive wizzie 
              staff. Now if we could just get Phinny to give us his.</p>
            <p>Gratz also to Barbed for landing that crushing blow that sent VS

            <p>JAN 14, 2002<br>
              Lord Doljonijiarnimorinar of Velketor's Labrynth fell this evening 
              to the forces of Crimson Talon. First time we have attempted to 
              use a rotating cleric CH strategy, and it worked very well on this 
              very hard hitting mob. Drops were: Frozen Turban (25ac 15agi 0.0wt 
              w/ resist cold) [Altus] and a Doljonijiarnimorinar (2hs 33/44 w/Doljons 
              Rage- 140 cold dd). </p>
            <p>JAN 13, 2002<br>
              Acrylia Circle raid today, and it can be summarized in two words: 
              very cool. If you are not familiar with the ring, there is an empty 
              room in Acrylia with a ring of totems sticking out of the ground. 
              Once someone steps inside the ring, a few non-attackable grimlings 
              appear that regularly summon undead mobs to attack you. If you step 
              out of ring, it ends, and if you leave the room, you will get a 
              ton of adds. After about twenty minutes of constant attacks, a boss 
              will spawn, and then the next round begins, this time, even harder. 
              This is absolute non-stop fighting with changing mobs and tactics. 
              We made it up to the third boss and even though the loot wasn't 
              great, we had a great time trying something new and different.</p>
            <p>JAN 12, 2002<br>
              Raid on the Juggernaughts of Seblis for spells. With so many of 
              our casters hitting 58 and 60 and staring at empty spell slots, 
              we decided to do something about it. We fought down and cleared 
              the Juggs a few times and managed to get about a dozen spells. Then, 
              we decided to try a spawned Trakanon. The attack went very smoothly 
              and we had Trak down to 10 percent, when, he started warping all 
              over the place. He was in his lair, down in the hallway, near the 
              bridge, and then just started cycling between all three and sometimes 
              nowhere to be found. A very fustrating fight. We never could get 
              him nailed down to finish him off. Later, we found out this was 
              a bug when you: send someone in to sacrifice, Trak ports them, Trak 
              tries to follow (appears in hallway near bridge where we attacked), 
              and if anyone attacking him steps on the rocks, he starts warping. 
              We are adapting our pull/attack strategy and should own him in the 
              next fight. Brewall is writing up a strategy guide and is looking 
              for input in the guild-only area of forum.</p>
            <p>JAN 10, 2002<br>
              Servers came back up after the emergency patch and we killed Phinny 
              again for chances at epic items. After Phin, we dispersed for an 
              hour until we decided to hit VS. We assembled in record setting 
              time, derailed a few trains, killed just about every mob we could 
              get our hands on, and then moved into staging room. Quickly cleared 
              all nearby mobs, and then took out VS without losing a single person. 
              Great discipline and smart fighting from everyone! Drops were a 
              sshisar staff and a diamond encrusted staff.</p>
            <p>JAN 09, 2002<br>
              Large group of us took up residence in Chardok again this evening 
              at the Iksar Betrayer camp. We killed everything within a massive 
              pull range and descimated the Sarnak forces yielding quite a few 
              minor upgrades. Having spent 8 hours camping this monk epic mob 
              the other day, we were hoping our luck would change. After 18 place 
              holders, and with just two remaining groups by 11:30pm, we decided 
              to do one more spawn and call it a night -- and the Betrayer spawned! 
              Grats to Chiun for finally getting his pipe! He completed the robe 
              quest last night and is just a few mobs away from epic.</p>
            <p>JAN 08, 2002<br>
              Whacked Phinny when the servers came back up from the patch. He 
              dropped a piece of ore that Chadmoe needed for shoulder quest item 
              and a crappy shaman staff. We then decided to hit VS in the hopes 
              of getting another epic piece. There was a small force already there, 
              so we decided to pool together and let each guild roll for dropped 
              items. Killed VS without losing a single person and his drops were 
              pretty poor: just beastlord and bard legs. Tomwin won roll for us 
              and chose the bard legs [Brewall]. Other good developments this 
              evening is Ointmennt got item from Chardok King and is now just 
              an Ixiblat and a Rage from a cleric epic.</p>
            <p>JAN 07, 2002<br>
              Phinny wasn't up this evening so we decided to finish off another 
              epic, this time for Skalee (Rezzie's monk). Very successful kills 
              of epic mobs in Lake of Ill Omen, and there were no deaths (aside 
              from the token ranger). We are all looking forward to finishing 
              off a slew of epics in the coming months. Off to a great start so 
              far this year! </p>
            <p>JAN 06, 2002<br>
              Raid on the Hole with minimal forces, and yet we were still able 
              to defeat Master Yael for the first time. We had a high body count, 
              but with just 16 of us, 2 clerics and 1 insta-killed DT enc, we 
              still managed to kill him. Yael just didn't bite on our ranger sacrifice... 
              Grats to Chadmoe for getting another piece for epic quest! We learned 
              a lot with this first kill and will do much better next time.</p>
            <p>JAN 05, 2002<br>
              Big spell raiding day today. With all our recent high-level caster 
              dings, we decided to try to get some high level spells. Started 
              in Skyfire with guardians and managed to get a few nice spells. 
              Moved on to Juggs in Seblis and got a few other level 60 spells. 
              Easily made our way to Trak's lair and waved at the Undead Bard. 
              With a little more resist gear and a full raiding force, we will 
              be ready for a spawned Trakanon. Brewall can hardly wait!</p>
            <p>JAN 04, 2002<br>
              Decided to kill General V'Ghera in Kithicor this evening to try 
              to finish Muscled's epic. We successfully killed the general for 
              our second time, but we were unlucky on drops. Muscled needs to 
              do a little side quest to finish off his ragebringer. Hopefully 
              see another epic soon now that the hard part is out of the way. 
            </p>

            <p>Loot freaking rocked. In other words, no monk loot. Carrot and 
              Kalorn got Jaelen's katanas, Cerrasu got some Maclear's boots of 
              silence, Apoc got the first Yakatizma's shield of crafting on the 
              server, Jaedan got some drood arms, and these fine people hooked 
              me up with some Do'vassir's gauntlets :)</p>
            <p>And, for old times sake, we popped this gal this week:</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>She went down fast but:</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Grats Orchestra on your white scale!</p>
            <p>That's pretty much it for the past week. </p>

              Sunday - January 6, 2002 - Demana Azulene </p>
            <p>DA and SS Enter the Ring of Fire...</p>
            <p>Acrylia Caverns, home of homely creatures, happens to be the happening 
              dynamic quest spot. This Ring of Fire thing is pretty damned cool. 
              We tried it for the first time on Friday night, and considering 
              we had no clue what we were doing, we did pretty well. And Saturday 
              evening, we went again and kicked some booty. Of course, with all 
              quests in this wonderful game, there are some bugs (where did the 
              boss mob go? Hmm, I think he...poofed), but with some perseverence, 
              we made it through the sixth wave before we succumbed to the mass 
              of undead. </p>
            <p>Anyway, had a blast the past 2 nights, and I think we're all looking 
              forward to doing this again.<p>
              Friday - January 4, 2002 - Demana Azulene </p>
            <p>Due to the holidays, the DA/SS alliance left the year 2001 somewhat 
              quietly. We are starting out the new year with a bang though. Wednesday 
              found our fair alliance in snake town to take out some Rhags, as 
              well as in Fear to wipe out the very large turd known as Cazic-Thule. 
              Loot dropped, people rejoiced, and I napped.</p>
            <p>Last night we went to that snake place again and killed this guy.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>As we were packing up for the night, some green guy in the Deep 
              showed up, so we killed him too (flawlessly I might add.) He gave 
              up a helm for Tangor and an orb for Sumtra. Grats to all who got 
              new toys...</p>

              Killed Tunare again out of lack of anything better to do (though 
              I did vote for naked pool party in Felwithe instead).<br>
              <br>
              Saturday... -1/12/2002<br>
              Killed 1 of the basement mobs in Ssra, then proceeded to make a 
              pretty piss poor attempt at the second. Although Thanks to EOD/TR 
              for the shiny new whip. :)<br>
              <br>
              What we been doing last few days - 1/12/2002<br>
              Killed the basement mobs 1 and 2, third one is giving us trouble(x2). 
              Killed the overfiend. Killed the akheva guy and did some exp inbetween. 
            </p>
            <p>Oh yea, congrats to sinafey on her new cleric epic<br>
              <br>
              Busy day... (1/6/2002 ) <br>
              Started out popping the Deep Thought Horror Overlord, I wasn't there 
              but this big poosae dropped a phat belt and SK/pal hat for The Relentless.</p>
            <p>After that we moved to Akheva and did a nearly flawless victory 
              on Itear Vius, phat l00t was enjoyed by us and our Homies The Relentless.</p>
            <p>Then we Split up, EOD finally got Sonani her bard epic, and some 
              cash for the guild dropping Gorenarie and fake trak, while TR cleared 
              Fear.</p>
            <p>Then we went to fear and killed Cazic, Grats to Mandy Da Barbie 
              on his Cloak of the Fearsome and Sinafay on her l33t halo of clericiness.<p>
              Last few days...(1/5/2002) <br>
              Killed the 5th acrylla ring of fire boss in house on Thursday for 
              some fun and boredom relief. Today we killed Glyphed/Exiled with 
              our homeboyes on the side TR in Ssra for ph4t l00tz!</p>
            <p>Got a super phat FT3 mask from Acrylla, and some other phat l00ts

              Well we ventured down into Sol B for a 2 part mission. The first 
              part was to aquire some spell components for Eraserd which we achieved 
              very successfully. The second phase was to hopefully snag up some 
              GEBs for Alembert. This was going to be a mean task since our group 
              did not consist of high level peeps but instead was comprised of 
              some very brave souls. We did successfully conquer the Golden Boys 
              spawn spot and held it for a long time. Somnus 35 enchanter, Ligoris, 
              42 druid and Katslayer 45 warrior did a great job controlling their 
              aggro and keeping their heads when things got very ugly. Alembert, 
              Charlibroue, and Rhunarc stepped in later and did a splendid job 
              handling multiple mobs. Too bad we couldnt get the Golden One to 
              spawn so we could jack his shoes. A special thanks goes out to Naezariit 
              of Council of Grey for assiting us with the rezzez at the zone in.</p>
            <p><a href="http://www.orderofoblivion.com/"><b>Order of Oblivion</b></a><br>
              1/12 Talendor and Gorenaire <br>
              So the day starts out somewhat slow, everyone doing their own thing 
              exping, aaxping, and questing. But as the day winds on, we start 
              to get restless for real blood, blood that we have not yet tasted. 
              We decided to check on some kunark dragons that we've never really 
              tried. Talendor and Gorenaire. Seeing Talendor up, we started to 
              head that direction. </p>
            <p>Upon ariving there, we prepare for the dragon, as our fearless 
              warder (Palan &quot;DIE NEPH&quot; Crestfallen) goes off to pull 
              the cute lil guy. </p>
            <p>After waiting overly long for the dragon *mumbles about stupid 
              slow rangers* he finally arives and we engage. He died rather fast 
              and easy to us, I think due to the all the cleric nukes. </p>
            <p>Drops were Poxx of Bertoxxulous, Banishment, Demi Lich (Tylerkx), 
              Talisman of the Raptor (Damain), Selo's Drums the March (Jammen), 
              Orb of Tishan, Dragon Bone Bracelet, Red Dragon Scale (Sythezz) 
            </p>
            <p><br>
              After that, we're feeling good about how well we did and start makeing 
              our way to Dreadlands, where the icy cold &quot;immortal&quot;, 
              as she indirectly refers to herself as, Gorenaire awaits us, she 
              had heard of her fellow dragon's death, and so did not kindly welcome 
              us. We buffed and gathered reinforcements, as we prepared to engage 
              her. </p>
            <p>We sent off a lowly sacrificial bard (Kitt) to distract her while 
              we gathered and prepared. Eventually, surprised that Kitt was still 
              alive, we gave him the signal to pull her our way, where we lay 
              in wait to ambush her. Upon seeing us, she was furious, and attempted 
              to lay waste to us, though it was a rough fight, she tried so hard, 
              and got so far, but in the end, it didn't really matter. She died 
              anyway. </p>
            <p>Drops were Aegis of Ro, Flaming Sword of Xuzl (Privar), Pox of 
              Bertoxxulous, 2 Shields of the White Dragon (Heironeous, Illessa), 
              McVaxius' Horn of War (Jammen), White Dragon Scale (Sythez), half 
              of book of scale (Balakin) </p>
            <p>Over all a good day... =) </p>
            <p><br>
              1/7 Trakanon 1/8 Trakanon, Velketor the Sorcerer, and Lord <br>
              So we set up to take down Trakanon on the 7th, Prot was slacking 
              so we waited quite a while for him to be ready for us, then we pulled 
              and killed him and got ready for Trakanon himself, once we rushed 
              him he was confused and so didn't fight well, he managed to take 
              down a few of us out of 30. </p>
            <p>Drops were Donals Breastplate (Eloine), Jaundiced Bone Breastplate 
              (Damain) and 4 teeth </p>
            <p>1/8 <br>
              Trakanon again decided to show his fugly face so we cleared to him, 
              and the prot was completely ready for us this time, so he was pulled, 
              then we waited for the rest of the people to be CoH'd to camp. After 
              everyone was in camp we prepared to rush him, and did so, he didn't 
              even put up a fight this time. </p>
            <p>Drops were Singing Steel Breastplate (Jammen), Deepwater Breastplate 
              (Vigil) 3 teeth, and an Undead Dragon Sinew, which we also got off 
              one of the juggs in the lair... </p>
            <p>Then we heard that Velketor the Sorcerer was talking bad about 
              some of the people hunting spiders in Velketor's Labrynth, so we 
              had to pay him a visit. We prepared for him and pulled his guards 
              without a hitch, then we got ready to take him down. He was no match 
              for us, loseing 4 in the process, one of them the first tank, we 
              showed him what a real wizard should be like (Privar) as we cut 
              his feet from under him. </p>
            <p>Drops were Bone Bracelet of Condemnation (Tylerkx), Crystal Rod 
              of Confusion (Solias), Velketor's Spellbook (Area), Silver Sword 
              of Yalrek (Pyriana) </p>
            <p>Next was Lord Doljonijiarnimorinar, one of Velketor the Sorcerer's 
              cronies, he spends his time with 2 of his spider friends and a few 
              spectre friends, so he's definately no good. Mr. Unpronounceable 
              seemed giddy today as he chased Buhf into the awaiting ambush of 
              people, whereupon we surprised him enough to take him down fast 
              and easy. </p>
            <p>Drops were Icicle Tunic (Buhf) and Glowing Red Stone (Fuddrick) 
            </p>
            <p>Grats to everyone who got drops, has been a great start to a great 
              year thus far... <br>

              Sunday 13 January, 2002 <br>
              Easy day <br>
              Saturday was an easy and slow day for us. Due to a patch in Ssra 
              we went over and killed the 1st boss mob. Didn't have time for more. 
              Dropped Group Aego, Remove Greater Curse, C3, a necro spell and 
              a shaman spell and some arms. All inn all some great spell drops. 
            </p>
            <p>Later we kinda invaded SG with 20 people, setting up groups all 
              over the place. Gems so far when I decided to go to bed: </p>
            <p>11 flawless diamonds <br>
              13 black marbles <br>
              10 pristine emeralds <br>
              + a bunch of other quest gems. </p>
            <p>So gratz now to Darstardly, Tuxy and Lillianan on getting their 
              ToV BP's done. <br>
              <br>
              Friday 11 January, 2002 <br>
              Busy day <br>
              Thursday was another busy day due to the emergency patch. </p>
            <p>First we went to Ssra Temple and killed silly mob 1 and 2 to get 
              more spells. Uros got Earring of Resistance and we got some monk 
              weapon. </p>
            <p>Next we headed to ToV to slay Lendiniara the Keeper - once again. 
              Our 3rd kill in 3 days due to all those patches. Baha got the nice 
              ranger ring and Sangreal got a Truesight helmet. Moi got my ST key 
              so now we will soon have 3 groups ready for ST. </p>
            <p>The it was off for Sebilis to visit Trakanon. Shammy BP, 5 teeth 
              and some shoulders dropped. </p>
            <p>Last on the meny was yet another &quot;hurry 3 groups of people 
              together from all over and kill Naggy&quot; raids. Naggy died and 
              this time he even dropped some decent loot that all the Naggy hunters 
              rolled for. CoF and red scale being 2 of the goodies. <br>
              <br>
              Thursday 10 January, 2002 <br>
              Easy day and 1 more ST key <br>
              Wednesday was mostly exp day. We ended up doing some stoopid CR 
              in DN before we moved to ToV and killed Lendiniara the Keeper again. 
            </p>
            <p>Lendi dropped 1 more ST key that Wulane got, Naggar got a so-so 
              hammer and Devor got the Mask of Superority. </p>
            <p>Anyway, it was our smoothest Lendi kill so far. </p>
            <p>The ST people went back to Sleeper's Tomb and managed to get the 
              first Primal weapon. Not bad for 2 hours work in ST. </p>
            <p>Almost forgot that we had a quick trip down to Trakanon's lair 
              and spawned the Undead Bard too. Gratz to Darstardly on getting 
              his bard Epic done. <br>
              <br>
              Wednesday 09 January, 2002 <br>
              More spells and ST key <br>
              3 targets after patch. First we went to Ssra Temple and slayed 2 
              first boss mobs for spells and fun. Finally 1 Remove Greater Curse 
              dropped and 1 more Group Aego - thanks for the spell I have to say. 
            </p>
            <p>Then it was off to ToV to visit Lendiniara the Keeper again. Gratz 
              to Balak on your ST key. </p>
            <p>Finally some twinks went to Sol B and killed Naggy, but only 30 
              minutes later an emergency patch was anounced, so no Ragefire camping 
              for the cleric this time. <br>

              Tuesday 08 January, 2002 <br>
              First visit to ST <br>
              Today 2 groups from Anavon and EoN went to Sleeper's Tomb for the 
              first time. Since I wasn't there I can't report much. </p>
            <p>No Primals dropped this first time, but gratz to Kianwan on getting 
              a Priceless Velium Spear. </p>
            <p>With the speed we are farming keys we can soon send in 3 groups 
              to explore more of this zone. <br>
              <br>
              Monday 07 January, 2002 <br>
              Speed record <br>
              Sunday we got word that Severilous once again was up in EJ, so we 
              moved fast in to get 1 more green scale. </p>
            <p>Killing Sev is not a big deal, but this fight ended up being just 
              so silly. We had 2 guests with us that never have killed Sev and 
              they both looked forward to doing him for the first time. </p>
            <p>So our bard puller called inc.!!! and 12 seconds later everyone 
              was just laughing of the dead dragon. </p>
            <p>At least our fastest Sev kill so far. </p>
            <p>Gratz to Bushka on the green scale. <br>
              <br>
              Sunday 06 January, 2002 <br>
              4 dragons down = 4 ST keys <br>
              Saturday ended up being 1 of our better days so far. </p>
            <p>First we teamed up with our friends in Anavon and killed Lendiniara 
              the Keeper. Then as already posted, we separated for a while to 
              do some ToV armour farming. After getting those 3 plate BP's and 
              the chain BP it was time to try a new first time mob for us, so 
              out from ToV we went and teamed up with Anavon again. </p>
            <p>20 minutes later the entrance to ToV was once again safe and Sontalak 
              was very dead. A messy fight, but we learned a lot. </p>
            <p>Then we moved over to DN and killed Zlandicar, probably being our 
              best Zlandicar kill so far. </p>
            <p>Last on the menu was Klandicar, also a first try for us, and this 
              fight also got kinda messy, but we won this one too. </p>
            <p>4 ST keys in just 1 day, 2 new dragons we have never killed before 
              and some cool stuff that dropped as well. </p>
            <p>Great work everyone! <br>
              <br>

              Today we went back to ToV to do some more farming inbetween killing 
              Lendiniara, Sontalak, Zlandicar, and Klandicar. </p>

            <p>Gratz to all of you that got new great items. </p>
            <p>Me gonna say thanks a lot for getting my first helmet in the game 
              when we killed Lendiniara the Keeper. My new Truesight helmet was 
              just the helmet I had hoped to get one day. Thanks everyone *s*

              ToV farming <br>
              We started farming more armour in ToV Thursday, and continued on 
              Friday. Lots of drops, and a total of 51 pieces in 2 days. Weird 
              thing is that not 1 single BP or robe dropped at all, but still 
              we got many items that our members needed.</p>

            <p> This old dragon.... 12 January 2002<br>
              As hard as it is to believe, we aren't always chasing down the newest 
              mob...<br>
              The past couple days have been spent reliving memorable fights of 
              the past...</p>
            <p>Homing in on Zlandicar...and mounting a huge raid...only to find 
              out he's not up...</p>
            <p>Omalley tells the guild, &quot;IT WASN'T ME THIS TIME!!!&quot; 
              yeah...right..</p>
            <p>In other news... we took on HoT dragons again...got some great 
              stuff, and twinked our twinks out great with some rotting kael armor... 
              kick ass!</p>
            <p>Also managed to bump off Zland later (when he was there!) and got 
              Kland too! Congrats Magnuss, Coldar and Crestfallen (one from previous) 
              on sleepers keys! </p>
            <p>Otherwise its been quiet, except for the cries of poor Crover, 
              who despite his last news topic, has only made himself a target 
              of FRO jokes...they go on and on and on...<br>
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p> Slow days, slow nights. 10 January 2002<br>
              Took out Zlandicar, Dozekar, and the wussy HoT named last night 
              for phat lewts. We had pretty good drops in HoT including some nice 
              plate / chain pieces. Overall it was a nice relaxing night of raiding, 
              except of course for the new vocabulary created during the evening. 
              All I'm sayin' is... if I ever hear ANYONE use the term &quot;Frovosexual&quot; 
              in a sentence, they're getting slapped. <br>

              Tuesday, January 8th, 2002 <br>
              Another one bites the dust....On Sunday we entered Grieg's End and 
              decided to crawl through the zone and kill as many of the big mobs 
              as we could. Luckily during our crawl a mob was nice enough to provide 
              us with a key to get to the man of the house, Grieg!</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Being gluttons for punishment we decided to take him on with 38 
              people. Let me just say that the fight was &quot;interesting&quot; 
              and we pulled off some amazing out of group healing, AE timing and 
              tanking to get this result and loot! This was a server FIRST and 
              I am extremely pleased that our alliance was able to pull it off.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Congratulations go out to Aliudyen on the Geomantic Focus! Any 
              of you who have watched my /randoming in the past couple years probably 
              know that I can roll lower than anyone more consistantly than should 
              be possible. I ended up seeding two 0 to 1000 /randoms in the sub 
              50s during our Grieg run alone. ;) Needless to say after we got 
              done with rolling on the ground laughing about Grieg dropping a 
              horse (still makes me laugh =P) SS decided to /random instead of 
              send it to the loot committee since we couldnt figure out how to 
              consider usefulness of a horse in the grand scheme of things. Vaclav 
              had the horse in the bag with a 671 when I figured I'd try my hand 
              at it. Much to my surprise and everyone elses amusement I rolled 
              a 956 of 1000! Can I have those when they mean something plsthx! 
              Vaclav I owned you boy! Anyway here I am with my new horse and familiar 
              up. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Just prior to killing Grieg we pitted ourselves against the Servitor 
              of Luclin as can be seen here.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>While he has a very cool looking model the fight with him was a 
              yawner and only lasted a minute or two at the very most. Hes a total 
              putz. He dropped a nice 40cha chanter mask and a dagger though so 
              I'd like to say congrats to Kate on the Mask and Sumtra on the dagger. 
              Way to go!</p>
            <p>While we were in Grieg's I was able to catch a few members with 
              their masks off so to speak. =)</p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>As you can see above our suspicions about Jackedd were right on 
              the money after we heard him screaming like a little girl at our 
              last Vyemm fight. Aliudyen on the other hand completely shocked 
              me, who knew he would be one of those big fat smart bugs. Imrik 
              partied a little too hard the night before the raid and was suffering 
              from a pretty heinous hangover. Tritolus showed us that hes actually 
              even hornier than we initially thought while Maluviani turned out 
              to be one of those Goth chicks. =) Soulvoid pulled off the surprise 
              of the night though when we got his armor off him finally. Seems 
              that armor has carefully been concealing that hes really a female 
              woodie! The SK guildmasters are going to be so upset they taught 
              her all their secrets. =( Lastly we have Dira just after she rolled 
              out of bed. Its amazing what a shower and a shave will do for a 
              female gnome!</p>
