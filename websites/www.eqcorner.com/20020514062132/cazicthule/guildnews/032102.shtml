              Night before Patch Day <br>
              <br>
              Posted by: Mirax on Tuesday, March 19th, 2002 @ 10:44 AM<br>
            </p>
            <p>Day before patch and lots of stuff decided to spawn for us. First 
              off, CC went to Umbral to take a shot at Rumblecrush. Grats Galdorn 
              on his new Breastplate of Integrity. </p>
            <p>Next, we decided to take a shot at spawning Doomshade. First time 
              for us and we nailed it on the first try with a minimum amount of 
              deaths. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Grats Warlor on his Earring of Endless Speed, Bukow on his Bracer 
              of Might and Leonroth and Allar on their new swords. </p>
            <p>Lendi and Zlandicar were up, so CC and Talons split forces and 
              took them both out. Grats Kaylynne on her Sleeper's Key, Parris 
              on his Girdle of Stability and Lorraine on her Frakidar's Talisman. 
            </p>
            <p>Then Dain, the little dorf had to go before the server went down 
              for a patch. Grats Laeamer and Vanelar on their Rings of Winter.</p>

            </p>
            <p>So, I use my handy dandy gate potion to Innothule and run smack 
              dab into the little halfling god Bristlebane yesterday. </p>

            <p>He proceeded to ask me a riddle which I got wrong (/glare guild) 
              and being the funny little guy that Bristlebane is, I got turned 
              into a snake! I slithered over to the druid ring, where my friend 
              Eastwood was waiting to port me out...I saw the hammer and thought 
              he was a ranger for a sec and tried to scare him! Being the druid 
              that he is instead, he just laughed at me. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Bristlebane then travelled all the way to the EC tunnel, where 
              I guess someone finally got his riddles right.<br>

              Well, with Gorenaire and Ssra not satisfying our appetites, we moved 
              to Kith to pay not one, not two, but FOUR quick? visits to General 
              V`Ghera. He was kind enough to hand over 3 quills, and our fourth 
              rogue only has the robe turn in to do, and CoG is 4 rogue epics 
              stronger....wtg all, thx for your patience, it IS a tough break. 
              With minimal suffering on our part, nice job CoG, thx to PE for 
              sending a couple ppl along, thx for yer insight, Red!!<br>

              leadin us down to basment level in temple, Redracer and myself get 
              us all preped for runed serpent only to find we was to damn slow

              5sta 5agil 5dex 10int neg 10 chr 30hps 30mana all all EVILS)..wich 
              went to PE...</p>

              we droped by Gorinare to lay some smake down on her, losing only 
              Redracer who Nuked till omm, died, memed nukes and retunred the 
              favor hehe......Grats to Bank on White scale, Orb of tishan(to be

              Raid on Chardok. Went after the royals and killed the prince and 
              king with ease. Some other nice items dropped in the library off 
              some named spawns.

              Severilous was up this morning and we were lucky enough to see him. 
              We hastily assembled a few groups and killed this wurm. Much easier 
              to kill than some of the other dragons, just unfortunate he is insta-killed 
              on every spawn. Drops were: Green Dragon Scale [Valstorm], McVaxious 
              Horn of War [Devaberiel], weight bag [Barelil], and 5 spells (2 
              spirit of raptor, spirit of oak, word of redemption, visions of 
              granduer). As a guild, we can now say that we have killed all the

            <p>Yeah, I can live with that.</p>
            <p>I missed the fight--once again I was keeping the future doctors 
              of the world from burning their eyebrows off in chem lab. Heard 
              it was nearly pure ownage (first successful takedown, and my mom 
              Calyssa wasn't there to help) so the 6 or so deaths don't really 
              bother me. Grats to Galar, Kerlen, and Tritolus on your new belts, 
              and grats Haley on your new earring. And while we're not the first 
              to do it, it feels damn good to say Velious is done.</p>
            <p>Tormax and our bud the Arch Lich took dirt naps as well. You know 
              what giants and snakes look like, and if you don't, use your imagination. 
              I can't remember loot either. I suck, just ask Chadd.</p>
            <p>We spent some time playing with ye old Ring of Fire in Acrylia. 
              It had been a while since we last tried, and we were interested 
              in its latest incarnation. If anyone cares, it's not impossible. 
              However, it's still not popular:</p>

              Many thanks go out to Accapella and Faerus for agreeing to take 
              on the added tasks within this comittee. Alot of work goes into 
              keeping the loot distribution fair and coordinated during raids. 
              Not only during raids but alot of oganization is needed to keep 
              track of all of the details after the raids as well. With these 
              two new members in the loot committee, HZ is bound to thrive even

              his epic. While in the Plane of Fear, Dunston looted the last item 
              needed to complete his quest. Dunston, who is played by our Guild 
              Leader is now the proud owner of his Epic Weapon. The name of this 
              piece is called the Spear of Fate, and he wields it proudly. Also 
              Tmol, who has recently joined HZ, is also the proud owner of his 
              Spear of Fate, which makes Epic number 7 for HZ. Well done HZ, and

              on the Plane of Fear. Sweet revenge it was. We took the portal by 
              the reigns and pretty much owned the plane. The only setback was 
              that one of the three nights that we had planned, the zone was previously 
              cleared. All in all we had a great success.</p>

              PE/Anavon go on a roll in NToV! <br>
              After messing around with Roy yesterday we decided to get our act 
              together today and come back with a vengeance. Things worked out 
              well for us as Ikatiar the Venomed fell first. Grats to Zarkoril 
              on his new Ancient Wyvern Hide Tunic and Teeleaf of Anavon on his 
              Ikatiar's Stinger. </p>
            <p>Then Eashen of the Sky fell next dropping some Twisted Steel Gaunts 
              for Surreall and a Cloak of the Sky for Infestalia of Anavon.</p>
            <p>After Aaryonar's guards were dispatched, Roy took a nice dirt nap. 
              It would have been a flawless kill were it not for some rogue that 
              decided to die. Loot was an Amulet of the Dreadgazer to Iegweian 
              and as well as a Katana of Pain to Blackbadger and another Amulet 
              of the Dreadgazer to Darkfan, both of Anavon.</p>
            <p>Then it was time to have fun with the flurry drakes and fun we 
              had with warriors, enchanters, and shamans getting free TLs to their 
              bind spots. It was good practice for Ramoen's tanking abilities, 
              I expect we'll see him as the MT in NToV soon. After that it was 
              on to Lord Feschlak. He dropped a Thunderstone for Lillianan and 
              an Amulet of the Storm for Deacis of Anavon.</p>
            <p>Dagarn the Destroyer fell and monks everywhere rejoiced. Grip and 
              Volkaran(Anavon) each received a pair of Ancient Wurm Hide Greaves 
              and in addition to that, Ttizzi received a pair of Wurm Claw Pauldrons. 
            </p>
            <p>After that we killed Lord Nagafen with an army of monk twinks and 
              he dropped a Flame Etched Short Sword for both Surreall and Stibitz(Anavon). 
            </p>
            <p>As we grew weary from all the dragon slaying we needed a lift so 
              we decided to give Lord Vyemm a try. He gave us all the lift we 
              wanted and then some as several of us ended up in the lava moat. 
              It was a fun fight although we didn't win but in the end we decided 
              to find a smaller fish to fry. </p>
            <p>We noticed something fishy around the corner and decided to check 
              it out. It turns out Lord Koi'Doken decided to invite us over for 
              some fish rolls. He dropped a Net of the Deep Sea for Radiation(yours 
              truly) as well as a Siren Song, Dagger of the Sea for Wulane of 
              Anavon. </p>
            <p>And to finish up the night we killed Lady Mirenella who dropped 
              a Shawl of Perception for the boss, Blasphemy, and an Ebony Headband 
              for Volkaran of Anavon. </p>
            <p>A great day of dragon killing in which we redeemed ourselves and 
              were able to change our name back to Project Dragonkill rather than 
              Project CR. More action tomorrow! And people doubted us, pffffft!

            <p>Well today we had a little better luck with the AOW spawning. We 
              assembled a fearsome squad of pipe toting mfkers and went to town 
              on us. First try the AOW used his server lag discipline and about 
              6 tanks vanished off the face of the earth after 5 seconds of lag.<br>
              But being relentless we gave it another shot, this time it was personal.

              Nothing has pained us more than Tunare. At first the Tunare v1.0

              her. Being that it was 3am and 90% of us are working stiffs, we 
              gave up.</p>
            <p>A few weeks ago, I spotted the Real Doll v2.0(tm) herself in the 
              zone late one night. We started clearing at 8pm and didn't get done 
              till 5am which resulted in only 48 people - 5 of which were non-KOS 
              and a few more twinks. We made two attempts at it only getting her 
              to 30% even when our strat worked perfectly. We realized that we 
              didn't have the manpower to do her so we crashed hoping to get back 
              at her the next day reenergized and with normal daylight manpower. 
              Wrong. She was poached. </p>
            <p>Fast forward to this weekend. She was killed a week before this 
              past Friday which meant she was due by Saturday at the latest right? 
              SS/DA spent all day Saturday finishing a partially cleared zone. 
              We even had time to stop by the Arch Lich and Tormax and come back. 
              She refused to show which is strange because most high elves will 
              show you a little if you stuff an orange down your pants, right 
              Vaclav? Anyway, I digress. So we came back to the miserable hellhole 
              called the Plane of Growth and began clearing a second day. Any 
              guesses? Still no show. Nothing like clearing that place twice just 
              for fun. </p>
            <p>This morning we get the call that she spawned. Early afternoon, 
              we start clearing the partially spawned zone (still not done from 
              the previous nights clearing). A bit later we had to defend the 
              zone from some poachers. Finally after the rest of the zone spawned 
              we had Tunare all to herself. We lined her up in the Assling Cannon 
              crosshairs and fired with reckless abandon. Sending lumpy ass-breathed 
              hair-foot ear-encrusted asslings at her one after the other. She 
              was felled easily. FINALLY.<p>
              Drops included three belts (Galar, Tritolus, Kerlen) and one earring 
              (Haley). I think with a bit more refinement to the strat we could 
              take her with less than fifty, but we'll see if it ever comes to 
              that. As for those that compare her to the Avatar of War? Pllllease... 
              put the crack pipe down. Tricky, yes, but most of Tunare's problem 
              is just coming up with the strat that works, kinda like the Arch 
              Lich. Performing after that is quite easy. Avatar of War takes absolute 
              perfection from everyone to win and is still our favorite fight, 
              though Burrower ranks a close second for me.</p>
            <p>In other news, we felled the Arch Lich again. The first time we 
              tried the Arch Lich, I thought - &quot;This mob sucks!&quot;. Now 
              he's a snoozer. Can't wait to get a key so we can try Creator or 
              High Priest. </p>
