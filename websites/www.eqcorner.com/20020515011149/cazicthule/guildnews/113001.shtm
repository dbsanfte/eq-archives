              Uros got his ball. Killed Dracho with some help from PE and Kiv

              Anavon and Project E O N took on Dain Frostreaver IV for the first 
              time, and after a long fight defeated his squinty eyed dorf butt 
              !!! 
            <p>After an infuriating session of guard pulling, the Dain finally 
              deemed us worthy of a visit. At which point we unleashed our full 
              fury at being left waiting. </p>
            <p>What a fun fight :) hectic.. bodies falling .. the battled ebbed 
              and flowed, but finally the Dorf gasped his last breath. A kill 
              on first attempt, and first pull.. the first of many...grats E O 
              N on Hammer and Crown, grats Sicon on belt, Volkaran on crown.</p>

              useful but Uros got another step to his lightsabres <br>

              First off, welcome to more new members..I'll try to list at those 
              I can remember : Cielest, Kordal, Ainily, Fedil, Hilar, Mbik ( not 
              really new, but I ain't getting bitched at for forgetting someone! 
              ), Dezgar, Celiel, Dorinn. Please if I forgot anyone don't hurt 
              me, I'm just a warrior who is trying to do his best :)
            <p>Well, we held our first raid..went to Guk. Good turnout for our 
              small but growing guild. We discovered Dorinn's hidden talent for 
              making Frogloks angry at him. We managed with little disruption, 
              not too bad for our first organised raid, it ain't ToV but all in 
              due time peeps. We camped the Ancient Croc, but wouldn't you know 
              it, damn bish wouldn't spawn for us. Placeholders after placeholders 
              ARRGH!!! Well, we can chalk it up to a learning experience, grats 
              to Blarny on doing a great job of running the raid! </p>
            <p>And grats to our member/non-member ( don't ask ) Sparty on getting 
              his Fiery Avenger, yet another flaming Pally joins the ranks. Grats 
              Sparty!</p>

              November 29: We adventured into Veeshan's Peak last night with CC 
              and had a ton of fun. It was a new zone to many of us and the last 
              zone to see before SoL comes out next week. We quickly dispensed 
              of the dragons in VP and received some great loot to boot. Maldisdain 
              looted a Robe of Smothering as well as Lariadel of CC. Anachronox 
              received a Robe of Azure Sky as well as Flareon of CC. Kinson is 
              2 steps closer to his epic as Hosh dropped a green dragon scale 
              and on the way to VP, Talendor dropped a red one for him. Kamilie 
              looted a Hammer of Dragonborn, one more buff for her to add to her 
              mighty collection. Of course the most uber loot of the night when 
              to Shar when she was forced to loot a Shissar Protection Staff, 
              get in your SoW requests now!</p>
            <p>November 27th: We started early after the patch today and decided 
              it was time we took down our giant buddy Tormax. Congratulations 
              go to Sharmian as she was blessed with Tormax's head and grats to

              over to make quick work of Zlandicar, grats to CC on their Sleeper's 
              key. It was still early, so we went to Fear and got the broken golem 
              for Soltane. Some nice drops came off of Terror and Fright- Grats 
              to Sharmian on her Bone Clasped Girdle and to Kinson on his epical 
              balls and to Amanrah on his Slime blood.<br>

              November 29th: CC and Talons ventured into Veeshan's Peak last night 
              and set out to clear the zone. First, Norrath had to be rid of Talendor...for 
              a few days at least: </p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Drops were a Cloak of Flames and Shield of the Red Dragon to CC 
              and a Red Scale and an Orb of Tishan to Talons. </p>
            <p>Then it was time to zone into Veeshan's Peak and get to work! Grats 
              to Kamilie of Talons on her Hammer of the Dragonborn (/tell Kamilie 
              hammer plzthx), Laraidel of CC and Maldisdain of Talons on their 
              Robes of Smothering, and Tanarra of CC on his Lyran's Mystical Lute. 
            </p>
            <p>Then Hoshkar, our very favorite Dragon of them all! He gated once 
              of course, can't be a trip to VP without at least one mass death 
              experience, but he died shortly afterwards: </p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Grats to Talons on their Green Scale and Boanerges, Darrak and 
              a cleric from Talons on their Shissar Protection Staffs. </p>
            <p>It was late, but we couldn't call it a night without at least one 
              attempt at Phara Dar. Turned out to be a great idea: </p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Grats to Flareon of CC and Anachronox of Talons on their Robes 
              of the Azure Sky and Darrak of CC on his Shield of Elders. </p>
            <p> November 29th: Dain was dead, we were still out for blood. Next 
              target: Sontalak! Grats to Grisham of Talons on his Sleeper's Key, 
              see you on the inside! <br>
            </p>
            <p>So, you've killed the King of the giants, and your guild is on 
              giant faction..what to do now? Kill the King of the Dorfs and make 
              everyone like you in Kael again! CC/Talons (or was it SoD? Damn 
              guild changes in the middle of the raid!) took down the little rascal 
              yesterday. </p>
            <p>Grats to Flareon on her Dain head for the Belt of Dwarf Slaying. 
              Grats to Chryn on her Dain Hammer. Grats to Talons on the Aegis 
              of Ice and Frostweaver's Velium Crown.<br>
            </p>
            <p>CC was up on the Trak rotation last night. We were still pumped 
              up and ready for action after the successful Tormax run, and who 
              wants to wait 20 minutes for the big guy to reset in his lair when 
              we can just pull him to the SS? So that's what we did! </p>
            <p>Singing Steel and Tolan's BPs and 5 teeth were the haul. <p>
              November 28th: Another first for our CC/Talons..err..Shade of Darkness 
              alliance. We got together and killed King Tormax (and a lot of people's 
              giant faction as well ) last night. </p>
            <p>Grats to Cueina on her Axe of the Kromzek Kings. Also a Horn of 
              Hsraga and Velium Encrusted Gauntlets dropped for CC, recipients 
              to be announced. </p>
            <p>Grats to Talons on the Head of King Tormax and Horn of Hsraga. 
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>November 27th: CC/Shades of Darkness (the guild formerly known 
              as Talons) took down Zlandicar last night. Grats to Pava on his 
              Sleeper's Key!</p>
            <p>Grats to Cueina on her Jagged Blade of War!</p>

              help.<br>

              Talon</a></b><br>
            <p>NOV 29, 2001<br>
              Raid on Kael to push into King's area for some armour drops. Decided 
              to kill Dlammaz Stormslayer (100k+ HP that quads 500s, flurries, 
              rampages, etc) and one of toughest mobs we have ever faced as a 
              guild. We slayed him with only a few deaths, and fought him again 
              later that evening with zero deaths. CT is getting stronger as a 
              guild, which combined with our smart playing is a lethal combination. 
              Drops this evening were: Plate Bracer [Hawkien], Leather Bracer 
              [Tippe], and 2 Cloaks of the Malestorm [Zoranna, Chadmoe]. In addition 
              to Dlammaz, we were easily able to slay Sentinel Drag / Yeljorn 
              / Demek.</p>
            <p>NOV 28, 2001<br>
              Joined KoT raid for Dragon Necropolis. Very late start this evening 
              minimized ability to get deep within the zone. Although, killing 
              at zone-in did allow us to pick up a Phase Spider Carapace [Barelil]. 
              Numerous spell drops as well; if you need spells when they drop, 
              just call for them.</p>
            <p>NOV 27, 2001<br>
              Crimson Talon dove deep into the heart of Siren's Grotto for our 
              first major guild raid on that zone. We were able to slay many a 
              mermaid and walrus within the main chamber at the bottom of the 
              well, and held the camp for several hours. We came away with several 
              nice gems and some BP quest gems. Now we just need to get some armour 
              to drop in Kael! Other drops were some netted kelp armour, conch 
              horn [Brewall has McVaxious (much better) and will hold in guild 
              vault], and a walrus skin drum [Brewall has Selo's (much better) 
              and will hold in guild vault].</p>
            <p>NOV 26, 2001<br>
              Hit Howling Stones a second night in a row hoping for more haste 
              belts. Set up multiple camps within the zone and even did some AE 
              style clearings. This is the first time we have combined both tactics 
              on a raid and it definitely has future use. Came away with a Bloodpoint 
              dagger, a set of nice int bracelets, and numerous other loots. We 
              are going to hit a number of different zones in the coming days 
              prior to SoL release next week.</p>
            <p>NOV 25, 2001<br>
              Major raid on Howling Stones this evening. Set up three different 
              camp spots within the zone and killed everything in sight. Grats 
              to Valstorm for winning the Dragon Sash, a nice upgrade from his 
              FBSS. Also came away with some Kylong items that were randomed out. 
              Randomed out some other loot from prior raids: Tribal War Boots 
              [Aorthin] and Spider Fur Collar [Hawkien].</p>
            <p>Dunskye also got the last item she needed from the corrupted seahorses 
              for druid epic, and is now ready for Faydedar. Another epic is close 
              at hand!</p>
            <p>Grats to Chadmoe for getting a shiny new BP from Fear.</p>
            <p>NOV 24, 2001<br>
              Chardok raid. Raid on the royal area, but repawns and roamers appeared 
              at last possible moment. Although we were unable to kill the royals 
              on this raid, we learned a lot and will make a second attempt soon.</p>
            <p>Be careful with triggered mobs on the server. DA/SS were waiting 
              for Trakanon to spawn and were a bit bored. They were exceedingly 
              gracious to offer to kill a spawned Trakanon for Brewall to finish 
              his bard epic. Brewall turned in the mystical lute head to the undead 
              bard, who babbled about it being nice to hold the power one last 
              time, returned the lute head, de-spawned, enraged form spawned and 
              agroed on the group, and upon his death -- Trakanon did not spawn! 
              Everyone was completely baffled as to why the script did not work. 
              Trakanon should definitely have spawned at this point, and everyone 
              was ready for the kill. I have also heard that other triggered mobs, 
              such as the giant war (4x the number of giants spawned!) have not 
              been working properly either. Hats off to DA/SS for taking the time 
              to help, even though the spawn was bugged.</p>
            <p>NOV 22, 2001<br>
              The forces of Crimson Talon came together to kill the General and 
              his thugs in the Kithicor Woods this evening. Grats to Zoranna for 
              completing the rogue epic and obtaining a Ragebringer!</p>
            <p>NOV 19, 2001<br>
              Helped Fenier (KoT) complete druid epic with another Faydedar slaying. 
              Grats to Fenier for obtaining an epic!</p>
            <p>NOV 16, 2001<br>
              Grats to Greymask for finally getting an Essense of Vampire. Took 
              an incredible number of clearings to finally get one. Also killed 
              the Maestro, who dropped monk mask [Altus]. Finally left Hate this 
              evening, but will return again soon to work on some other epics.

            <p>11/25: Klandicar: Third time was the charm on our half ass attempts 
              on beating Klandicar today with The Relentless. Short on some key

            <p>Drops were nice with Zlandicar's Talisman, Zlandicar's Heart, and 
              Gauntlets of Mortality going to Eon with First Brood Talisman and 
              Frakadar's Talisman going to Anavon. </p>

            So then it happened - decided spontaneously to give Dain a go, and 
            gathered Eon and Anavon in Icewell Keep. 
            <p>And down he went - first attempt and first kill ever for us! </p>

            November 26: After camping Ragefire for 41 hours non-stop he finally 
            decided to show his chicken face. A fast gathering of troops and some 
            great help from Anavon = Ragefire died fast. Redracer decided to die 
            as he always does. Drops were: 3 red scales. 1 to Anavon and 2 to 
            us. 
            <p>Gratz a lot to you Hillil!!!!! </p>
            <p>Also, 2 hours after Ragefire we all decided to celebrate Hillil 
              so fresh turtle soup was served in Iceclad. Dessert today was a 
              shell piece, a belt and 4 cool spells. Map piece was handed to Maulder 
              from Council of Grey. </p>
            <p>Good work all *s*</p>
            <p>November 26: Congratulations to Astaroth on hitting level 57 and

              everyone please try to put in time during Saturday and Sunday so 
              we can keep it going without loosing the camp. We hope to see as

              with Epic. </p>
            <p>November 23: Gratz to Crunzh on level 60. Welcome to Gavan as our

            <p>November 22: Velketor the Sorcerer Aye, your eyes are not failing 
              on you. We mustered troops, together with Anavon we ventured into 
              his Lab and killed the big mofo floating giant. </p>
            <p>Splendid work all of you. Special thanks to Otik and Darkonas for 
              'not' being there and securing the life line. </p>
            <p>Have in mind, that with Velketor dead, we proved our ability to

              Well, despite low Turkey Day numbers(don't you hate people that 
              say that?) we were able to get a few things done this week early 
              on. We cleared ToV North with our allies, Element of Darkness. Grats 
              people on lots of loots, fun, stuff, yeah. <br>
              We also were able to drop the Dain, Trakanon, Yelinak, and Klandicar 
              at various points. Lets see, Grats Ephron on Maclaer's Boots of 
              Silence, Grats Ephron on a Yelinak's Talisman for your Sleeper's 
              Key and Grats Grizumpy on Solist's Earing of Insight. Everything 
              else was mostly butter with other various nice drops.
            <p>One more week of farming loots before everything becomes antiquated 
              and all our 'boss' mobs look like moss snakes in east commons. Or 
              at least we can hope so, here is to hoping Luclin offers up some 
              challenge.</p>

            <p> <b><a href="http://www.shadowedsoul.com/" target="_top">Shadowed 
              Soul</a></b><br>
              Nove. 28 Today, Shadowed Soul &amp; The Divine Alliance completed 
              clearing NToV. 2 weekday clear on our second attempt ever, not bad 
              eh?
            <p>For the whole run, we only had a hiccup when JorJor gated, otherwise 
              every named got set up one time and dropped straight away (sometimes 
              even with adds). It was impressive as hell to see us handle everything 
              the game had with style and speed. I am getting anxious to see what 
              Luclin has waiting for us...whatever it is, we are ready.<br>
            </p>
            Nov 27: Today we stepped up to the plate for our second ever attempt 
            at the North wing of the Temple of Veeshan. We absolutely rolled. 
            It was awesome.<br>
            <p></p>
            <p> Ikatiar - Dead<br>
              Eashen - Dead<br>
              Aaryonar - Burned to the ground<br>
              Lord Feshlak - Returned for insufficient postage<br>
              Dagarn - Folded, spindled, *AND* mutilated<br>
              Lord Kreizenn - Sent to the reactor for shielding duty, citizen.<br>
              Jorlleag - Fell over, burned down, THEN sank into the swamp<br>
              Lady Nevedria - Banished from Castle Anthrax
            <p>Felt really good to really roll through some of the toughest mobs 
              in the game. Gratz to everyone who was there tonight, you all did 
              a great job....except for Thund...the PoTG was way too slow, buddy.</p>
