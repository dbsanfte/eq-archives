                Quest for myself. We will have a CT raid for all those interested 
                20+. Also Arrynean needs a 50 mob killed in Kithicor to finish 
                his Call of Flames quest. Blarny needs a giant killed in EW I

                Relentless" last night was great fun with some great ppl. Grats 
                to Shar on her Necro epic weapon... "the duck". And bad luck to 
                choter who was inadvertantly killed Sirran and couldnt complete 
                his when he went LD for a period of time :/.<br>
                <br>
                Chardok This evening at 8pm est for our chanters epics (hopefully 
                2 princes will fall). Tommorow will be "the Hole" raid for shamans 
                Guruk and Shamy who have been patient in waiting for thier epics. 
                Sunday will see the follow up for the shaman epics, also we will 
                try for some mage + enchanter and all who need parts from City 
                of mist for thier epics.<br>
                <br>
                Last night our alt crew killed Nagafen got some Drums gaunts and 
                some Cleric thing. Lunarnia now has her epic after the Slaying 
                of Faydwer (congratz). Anlashok has the first part to his ranger 
                epic and waiting on the PoA raid for the other half (congrats). 
                <br>
                <br>
                PoG was a complete sucsess gaining over 20+ spells and 3 bps (plus 
                one SK rotted) and multiple other pieces grats to those who got 
                loot.<br>
                <br>
                VS remains has been conquored several times and were awaiting 
                the fix for the druid epic b4 we can aquire more epics on the 
                druid front, ranger we will need to more work in PoA and one raid 
                to the Hole (planned this weekend) b4 we can outfit more epics.<br>

              <blockquote>We were assembling at the Hole and noticed that several 
                other groups were planning on raiding the zone as well. We decided 
                to form a small army and Altus lead us on a crawl through the 
                dungeon. Other groups were excellent companions and payed close 
                attention to Altus's instructions. We laid waste to all that we 
                encountered (screenshots in scrapbook). Among the drops were: 
                Imbued Granite Spaulders (ac20 resists10 wt19.4) [Brewall], Ranger 
                Epic Piece [Rutgereos-his last piece! congrats!], Shaman Epic 
                Piece [Khallin], Enchanter Epic Piece [Greymask, Zhyr, Mysyn, 
                and Saleel], and Loam Encrusted Lined Shoes (ac4 agi8 cha8 dex8 
                mana15 pr10 0.4wt) [Greymask]. I'm certain we will returrn again 
                soon to help the other shaman's who were with us that needed their 
                epic items. <br>
                <br>
                Vox dies again at the hands of Crimson Talon, allies, and comrades- 
                in-arms. A hearty group of adventurers braved the cold of Permafrost 
                Keep and dispatched Lady Vox. Drops were: Dragon Bone Bracer [Ciladin], 
                Dragon Bone Bracer [Riverwake], Pouch [Brewall], Horn [Ensis], 
                and Eyepatch [Aprisle]. Perhaps next time, Vox will grace us with 
                books & scales (she is overdue on those books). Congrats to Chadmoe 
                for kill shot. Special thanks to all buffers and Atlus for pulling. 
                Full write-up of event, loot numbers, and raid points, can be

                should be proud of yourselves. We did what we were told we were 
                not able to do. We will be going back in a couple of weeks, so 
                level up, and try to get some cold resist gear, b/c all the AoEs 
                and things are cold based, no matter what they say they are. It

                Well it is a tale of two cities. Chardok, home of the sarnaks, 
                and freeport...which is where most of us spent the night last 
                night.<br>
                <br>
                We arrived at chardok planning on defiling the little buggers 
                get in get out sort of thing. The sarnaks had other plans. We 
                got down to the Royals, which is where we were headed, but we 
                had no monk to pull so our plans were stopped there and we spent 
                the rest of the night summoning corpses. I must say great job 
                everyone, having a chanter pulling and getting that far is not 
                easy. Also thanks for showing up to all who did, we will rock 
                that place once we get a full scale scheduled raid. A few drops 
                were Sarnak Arcane Fetish, which was given to Svenia(grats). Also 
                we had a Staff of Shielding drop, which went to Nepharite(grats 
                bud). A silverswift blade, which went to Tadrian, and a symphonic 
                sabre, which will go in the guild fund...we also had some various 
                crap drops, and a few spells...again thanks for showing up everyone.</blockquote>

                learning and dying we took this monster of a dragon down. Drops 
                were a 10 ac ring and a whitestone shield. Congratz to everyone. 
                Other notable drops were a sheild of the halfshell, a damn nice 
                cleric only shield, onyx sleeves, and the yalp claw of doom.<br>
                <br>
                First off, congratz to Shar on a brand new duck staff!!! QUACK!!!<br>
                <br>
                Tonight's sleepers raid was a great success. The Final Arbiter 
                went down easy along with Nanzata and Tukaarak. Congradulations 
                Jekhar on his primal hammer and Zith on our first primal bow, 
                F zith!!. <a href="http://members.theglobe.com/decoyy9/KRAKZPICZ/HRAASHMA1.JPG">Hraashna</a> 
                was a mighty foe but couldnt withstand us. No primal off our first 
                kill of the 3rd warder but a white resist stone and some books 
                dropped, gratz Feral and Kobad. <br>
                <br>
                However durring our celebrating of a flawless sleepers run we 
                must have made too much noise. I blame zith. We somehow missed 
                all the warrning signs and we awoke <a href="http://members.theglobe.com/decoyy9/KRAKZPICZ/AWAKE.JPG">the 
                sleeper</a>. We were in luck though!! He slapped the snooze bar, 
                mumbled something about 10 more min. and went back to sleep.<br>
                <br>
                Been awhile since the last update, so I figured I'd post up a 
                summary of all the stuff we'd done since the last update. Obviously, 
                we did some ToV, killed Cazic and Dain a few times, Zland and 
                Kland coughed up a bunch of keys. Yelinak went down twice I believe. 
                And we even smacked Gore up for a white scale. Got a bunch of 
                new epics, Jipp got the first guild mage epic, Bodmerian got his, 
                and Shar is one fight away I believe. Kobadshaw should be there 
                soon too.<br>
                <br>
                We did a couple of new stuff too - we went to ToV north wing and 
                started testing out the waters. Ikatiar the Venom died pretty 
                easily, but his drops were pretty bad. Then we kill Eashan of 
                the Sky a few times, netting us a Cloak of the Sky and a Mask 
                of the Sky. We even tried out Aaryonar, who completely whupped 
                us up, but we'll be trying him again sometime. </blockquote>

                Trueth wrote this update of the Dalnir raid held Wednesday evening: 
                Well, we went to Dalnir and got what we were after, and that was 
                xp. We started out at the first floor zone, and shortly after 
                moved down to the second floor, just past the big drop. I think 
                the whole group except Tagniz got a full level's worth of xp. 
                We went until about 9pm PST when we had a bad pull and took a 
                few casualties (who Dolfar promptly ressed) and we called it a 
                night. Here is what dropped: Trueth - Ancient Coin, Carnor - Two 
                Handed Practice Sword, Drazils - Crescent Arm Wraps and Tagniz 
                - tons of chanter pages.<br>
                <br>
                This Chardok raid update comes from Kinjate: Well, this was a 
                very successful raid! While waiting for people to show up we cleared 
                some spawns and actually got the named to spawn twice, each time 
                dropping the Runic Carver. <br>
                <br>
                After everyone had arrived at the Sarnak fortress, we headed inside. 
                It was a bit busy, with the Talons and The Taken having a few 
                people hunting there. After a couple quick checks of where they 
                were hunting I had to give up on getting my pipe for the night, 
                they covered all the spawn areas we could reach. So we decided 
                to just go dungeon crawling. We wound ourselves down the tunnel 
                to the bridge of death. Just over the bridge we set up our camp, 
                and began enjoying our trip to Chardok. <br>
                <br>
                I pull all the critters around the area, and finally cleared to 
                a big man named Korocrust. Level 62 warrior mob. Beat us around 
                a bit but fell in the end. First time we got him he dropped the 
                Worn Crescent Axe - went to Aegien who passed it to Iamfree. Everyone 
                was up for another try so we pulled him again shortly after and 
                he dropped the Jaid Inlaid Crescent Axe - went to Falconian. <br>
                <br>
                Other loot to drop was a Golem Tear Ring - going to Rikkir, 3 
                wooden staves for the VP key went to Kaysa, Aineril, Aegien. All 
                in all it was a good turnout. Had to get Daeven in to do some 
                rezzes, so hopefully next week we will have a 49 rezzer around. 
                And maybe we will get some better loot! Thanks for coming all!
