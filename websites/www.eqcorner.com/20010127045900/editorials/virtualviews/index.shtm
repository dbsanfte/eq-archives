                            Story by <a href="mailto:sorsja@rpgplanet.com">Sorsja</a></p>
                          <p class="news">Ah, the other side. I must say that 
                            my original post was about a Guild being disbanded 
                            on our server but some of you didn't quite open your 
                            eyes to that and demanded to hear what BoTB (Bloodline 
                            of the Bear) had to say in response to BoTS side.<br>
                            <br>
                            Rogfear (GM of BoTB) was kind enough to grant me his 
                            side of the story. Here is what he had to say on that 
                            nights events:<br></p>
                            
                          <blockquote class="news"> <b><i>Sorsja: &quot;What exactly happened in your eyes?&quot;</i></b><br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Rogfear: </b>&quot;We had the plane of fear reserved 
                            for Thursday of November 16th. On Wednesday night 
                            we had the majority of our team members camped out 
                            at the north wall SS. I was aware that the servers 
                            would be coming down on Thursday again before our 
                            raid and I was going to use this to our advantage 
                            because the plane would be free of mobs for a time 
                            after the servers came back up. Basically, I logged 
                            on my druid, who was parked at the SS at about 5pm 
                            CST to see if the mobs were still clear and if we 
                            could get some more people to the SS safely. Upon 
                            logging on I witnessed 4 members of BoTS entering 
                            the plane of fear. One of them was an officer of BoTS, 
                            whom I have known since the very first weeks of the 
                            Rathe server, a person who has helped me in the past 
                            and a person whom I trust and respect. I asked BoTS 
                            officer &quot;Whats going on bro?.&quot; He replied 
                            to me that BOTS was planning on clearing the plane 
                            of fear. Now we have had the plane of fear on reserve 
                            for over a month now on EQraid. Naturally I told him 
                            this (along with who I actually was-Rogfear), he told 
                            me to hold on a sec as he talked to Mistabone (GM- 
                            of Bots). He replied to me that BOTS would be coming 
                            up to clear the plane of fear and that we would be 
                            given all the loot MINUS all loot from Draco, CT, 
                            and some *carmine* and *blighted* pieces that they 
                            needed. I told the Officer that we didn't want any 
                            assistance in the raid, I added that we have looked 
                            forward to this raid for a long time now, its not 
                            everyday that we get to do the plane of fear, it wasn't 
                            about the loot-it was about FUN and doing something 
                            that we haven't had a chance to do in the past. BoTS 
                            Officer was very receptive in this, he understood 
                            where I was coming from and began to discuss again 
                            with the rest of BOTS. He replied to me that they 
                            were afraid that it would take us too long to clear 
                            the plane and they wanted to get some sleep. Around 
                            that time we all got the message that the servers 
                            were going to come down for 2 hours for maintenance......&quot;<br>
                            &quot;I want to state again that we did NOT ask for 
                            help from Brotherhood of the Spider. They were concerned 
                            about getting some epic quests completed and I guess 
                            they just didn't want to wait. Our planes raids are 
                            under an alliance of Bloodline of the Bear (20 planable 
                            members) with the Legends of Marr (20+ planable members), 
                            that night we had 35 people in the plane, there is 
                            no way we could come close to matching the power of 
                            BOTS.&quot;<br>
                            <br>
                            <i>Rogfear then told me what happened when the servers 
                            came back up 2 hours later...<br>
                            </i><br>
                            &quot;Servers come back up and we begin to log on 
                            our members and form up parties again. During the 
                            downtime a member of our raid called Verant and pleaded 
                            our case. We were informed that they would not allow 
                            larger guilds to bully smaller ones and that we would 
                            be watched to make sure that nothing happens.&quot;<br>
                            <br>
                            &quot;The Officer and I continued to talk, BoTS were 
                            going to come in whether we liked it or not, it was 
                            only a matter of time. There was nothing that I or 
                            anyone else could do to stop it, even The GM, whom 
                            I was chatting with throughout the night said there 
                            was nothing he could do to prevent BoTS from entering 
                            the plane. The Officer told me that BoTS would be 
                            willing to give us a few hours before they came up. 
                            We had some trouble with CRing a body and that took 
                            up quite a bit of time. The Officer had logged on 
                            his druid to aid us in clearing and soon realized 
                            that we were going on no pace that would allow us 
                            to clear the plane in the time we were allotted. BoTS 
                            wanted to get in, clear the plane and go to sleep. 
                            Realizing that BOTS was going to come in and begin 
                            to clear and there was nothing that could be done, 
                            The BoTS Officer and I started to negotiate a final 
                            deal on the loot. After a long discussion we came 
                            up with the following plan. We would receive all the 
                            loot that dropped, including Cazic and Draco loot 
                            MINUS the possibility of a BCG and some uber Robe, 
                            as well as all the epic pieces. Again I told BoTS 
                            Officer that this was wrong, under the &quot;Big Brother&quot; 
                            system that I believed we were going under, the BB 
                            guild would only take the epic pieces. As we were 
                            discussing this, the Officer informed me that another 
                            member of BoTS just said &quot;They have 3 minutes 
                            before we come in and take everything.&quot; Later 
                            I was told this was taken out of context, but from 
                            my point of view it was a direct threat from that 
                            BoTS member that we would lose the plain in it's entirety 
                            unless we made a decision soon. I asked the Officer 
                            for his word that he would hold this deal true for 
                            us, not BOTS, I wanted HIS word. He gave it to me 
                            and the deal was done.&quot;<br>
                            <br>
                            &quot;Then informed me that they would be doing a 
                            WW break in, I asked him if we would need to camp 
                            out, he told me no and assured me that we would be 
                            safe at the north wall camp. Minute's later BOTS began 
                            to break in, we were sitting at the north wall safe 
                            spot.........and hit by a massive train, 35 people 
                            went down in 30 seconds more or less. GM later said 
                            that it was the biggest train that he had ever witnessed. 
                            Needless to say, we were very angry. We did not ask 
                            BoTS to be there, we did not want their help, but 
                            we had no way of stopping them from taking what they 
                            wanted. Also, BoTS claim that an alleged Bard-invite 
                            trained us. I just want to state that we saw 1) No 
                            Bard coming at us either before the massive death 
                            or as a corpse in the aftermath. 2) No Bard sent an 
                            apology to me or any other member of our guild.&nbsp;<br>
                            I think if I was responsible for the death of 35 players 
                            in PoF as well as a contributor to the break up of 
                            the largest guild on the Rathe, I think I would say... 
                            something.&quot;<br>

                            <b>Rogfear: </b>&quot;Everquest is a game; the nature 
                            of a game is to create &quot;fun&quot; or &quot;joy.&quot; 
                            The Brotherhood of the Spider admittedly did not check 
                            the calendar to even see if someone had the Plane 
                            of Fear reserved. They realized that there were people 
                            up there, they knew that we wanted to try something 
                            new and have some fun, I explained to BoTS Officer 
                            that it would not be fun to sit back and watch them 
                            clear the plane even if we would be given the majority 
                            of the loot. BoTS has killed Trakanon 22 times as 
                            of this day; I have yet to even enter Sebillis-fear 
                            was something SPECIAL to my guild and our allies. 
                            It was just a 3-hour clear to BOTS. With BoTS planning 
                            on coming to the Plane of Fear, clearing it and leaving 
                            us with no choice in all reality, they ruined the 
                            &quot;fun&quot; that we were having at the time.&quot;<br>
                            <br>
                            &quot;If this was one incident, then yes, the GM was 
                            way out of line. However, this was not an isolated 
                            incident, there are others that have received grief&nbsp;<br>
                            from the actions of the Brotherhood of the Spider. 
                            After the guild was disbanded, I was in tell hell, 
                            I still am when I log on. I think that the GMs have 
                            sent out a message across Norrath, power guilds will 
                            not be allowed to hinder the play of the other people 
                            that choose to play Everquest.&quot;<br>

                            personal opinion on this matter would be biased, because 
                            from what I have seen he has used square judgments 
                            to decide the outcome of other situations and I have 
                            been pleased with other decisions that he has made

                            to be a GM. I play this game for fun. I cannot say 
                            whether or not his decision was the right one because 
                            I do not know what he knows. HOWEVER, if he had the 
                            reasons to do so, and if this was the topping to a 
                            cake of malice that BoTS has baked, then more power 
                            to him. I thank him for keeping our server a fun-filled 
                            place to hang out and play the game for what it was

                            to help us with CT. After BOTS left, and after all 
                            the events that transpired because of this, it was 
                            getting fairly late. Some from Knights of Eternal 
                            Good as well as some from Tindi Losi both contacted 
                            me&nbsp;<br>
                            and offered to help us clear the entire plain and 
                            hand us EVERYTHING due to what happened to us. I then 
                            DECLINED, I told them we wanted to try this out on 
                            our own and both guilds wished us the best of luck. 
                            We spent about 2 hours clearing until we had our first 
                            mishap, which resulted in a lot of deaths . At this 
                            time it was getting close to 2:30 am CST, and everyone 
                            was all for getting some assistance. The Knights of 
                            Eternal Good as well as the members of Tindi Losi, 
                            gladly came to our aid. And here is &quot;the kicker,&quot; 
                            it was still our raid, they let us have our fun and 
                            were the &quot;Big Brother&quot; that they should 
                            have been. I want to send special thanks out again 
                            to Tindi Losi, and to everyone from KEG who stayed 
                            up late to help us kill Cazic Thule. ALSO, I want 
                            to add another thank you to that Officer of the former 
                            Brotherhood of the Spider, he took time to listen 
                            to me, but he could not stop the overwhelming opinion 
                            of this guild. I respect him and always will.&quot;</blockquote>

                            stories extremely interesting to read about. Maybe 
                            it's because we know those involved, maybe it's because 
                            we have had a similar situation happen to us or maybe

                            with BoTS or BoTB over what happened here. The countless 
                            flames in their forums only proves that we are leading 
                            our way with our eyes shut and our mouths wide open.</p>

                            would be Rogfear and the Officer from BoTS, and they 
                            obviously still respect one another greatly.</p>
