                Flawless Diamond for Alquiras' BP. We only lacked one, so we hammered 
                that out, along the way Taeenea snags herself a Seahorse cloak. 
                We then kickit back to Kael and finish the night with some mediocre 
                drops, gratz to Kati on her bracer, Baull on his gloves, and a 
                few more small drops. Gratz also go out to Mustaffa for stepping 
                up and assuming the role of Resist Gear Coordinator, there are 
                still a few jobs left to fill if anyone is interested. On a side

                his Runed Protector BP, Baull on his silk crown drop for his Beguiler's 
                crown. Other drops included 2 sets of leather arms, leather boots,

				08/01/01: Early on we hit Sirens for a good block of time and 
                just farm the shit outta the bitches for gems. After getting enough 
                for each type of BP we decide to call it. A lot of peeps still 
                looking to do something so take off for HS to knock on Drus's 
                door. We fuck up and let a runner go early on which falls down 
                to the bottom level and we don't clear aggro, pretty much figured 
                we were big and bad enough to kill the whole zone. I was sadly 
                mistaken, east wing dropthru fucked us hard, mob came outta the 
                woodwork when we were about 15 mins from killing the bitch and 
                we bite it, I wish I'd taken a pic off all the shit we mezzed 
                and killed, my god I swear we had engaged the entire zone at one 
                point. Still a badass day tho. Tonight we welcome Rado and Nhadya 
                as the latest BFD lackeys, welcome to da family, please hand over 
                your death certificates to Izzu for notarization. </blockquote>

              <a href="http://crimsontalon.gleinig.com/"><b>Crimson Talon</b></a> 
              <blockquote>08/03/01: Lady Vox was catching up on some late-night 
                reading when the dragon slaying team swarmed into her lair last 
                night. She finally graced us with a few books to make up for the 
                absolute lack of drops recently. No enchanters were present at 
                the raid to seive, so made due with bards singing mana drain. 
                The plan worked perfectly, and Vox went down with not so much 
                as a whisper. Loots were: 3 Frost books [Ixnus, Tularane, Rizzhogg] 
                and Ice Comet [Infernostar]. 41 book points gone in one kill and 
                thins out the numbers considerably for the other longtime paladin 
                attendees.<br>
                <br>
                I apologize to anyone that was turned away. It is difficult to 
                get everyone into each raid with so much demand for dragon killing 
                out there. <br>
                <br>
                Brewall led dragon raids now 17-0 (11-0 on Vox, 5-0 on Nagafen, 
                and 1-0 on Faydedar).<br>
                <br>
                08/02/01: Lord Nagafen falls for a fifth time to a Brewall led 
                dragon raid. Interest in dragon raids remains high and at least 
                15 people were turned away. All those that did not make raid are 
                given an attendance point to make it easier to get into future 
                raids.<br>
                <br>
                EL cleared out the giants prior to the raid, dramatically shortening 
                the total raid time. Lot of new buffers this evening and took 
                a little bit to get all the kinks out. Excellent job pushing Nag 
                to back of lair and grats to Tularane for the kill shot. Loots 
                were: Cloak of Flames [Lumper], Gauntlets of Firey Might [Chiun], 
                Treasure Hunters Satchel [Kirby], Orb of Tishan [Niewlut], Orb 
                of Tishan [Brewall], Prayers of Life [Lisner], Fire Emerald Ring 
                [Alianora], and a Diamond [Azumar].<br>
                <br>
                Brewall has also posted his Guide to Fear in the "Raid Information" 
                section of the site. Please read it over and give feedback prior 
                to our upcoming raid.<br>
                <br>
                07/31/01: Two words, absolutely bizarre. Raided CoM this evening 
                to get a few epic items. We believed someone ninja looted a jade 
                reaver during our fight with the golems (petitioned a GM to investigate). 
                Then, during the assault on Lord Rak'Ashiir with 4-5 fire pets 
                and at 50% health, the pets pushed him into the water somehow. 
                Rak'Ashiir vanishes along with a couple of the pets and continued 
                to fight somewhere out of sight within the zone. Pets eventually 
                die and Rak'Ashiir summons a couple people and just when are beginning 
                to evac, he pops right in the middle of the raiding party and 
                kills a bunch of us with his 2000AE dmg spell (petition again 
                regarding the pathing and lost epic piece). Perform corpse recovery, 
                but a couple summoned bodies are hopelessly stuck in walls (petition 
                yet again). GM comes by after a while, gets corpses, ignores questions 
                on ninja looter and Rak'Ashiir pathing. Instead, he decides he 
                has nothing better to do than to change the name of a 57 wizard 
                in our guild from "Gooveit Allnight" to "Groovie"!?! He would 
                not respond as to what naming rule was violated. Grooveit has 
                7 days to get his name fixed, and hopefully, he can get his original 
                name back. Absolutely bizarre, no resolution on ninja looter or 
                the pathing problem and loss of epic piece. We have very rarely 
                ever petitioned anything and this was a truly horrible experience.<br>

                a druid..got no buffs so as you can imagine I didn't last very

                started to take out the top spiders. Well we were hunting and 
                we hear a frenzied velium broodling casting. So the druid sees 
                it and pulls it with a snare. Naturally I start tanking it but 
                as it gets to around 30% health...ACK! My computer crashes. I 
                come back to find myself dead in West Freeport. I /tell the cleric 
                and he says that when I went LD the mob just raped me and he couldn't 
                heal. Anyway I get rezzed and come back to find that the broodling 
                had dropped <a href="http://www.celestialknights.com/wrist.jpg">this</a>.<br>
                <br>
                Needless to say, I was a bit pumped lol. So the druid decided 
                it isn't fair about NBG and he decided to roll. Just for your 
                info the druid was Kendyen or something so you know who rolled.

                As I logged in today Tuffy was trying to get a group started up

                found ports and went over for a little fun and xp. Eventually 
                Bathory, Wally, Oblagon, Halbern, Dyngo all came over as well. 
                We were having a great time just hanging out together and killing 
                mobs, even managed <a href="http://celestialknights.com/Tal/Velk1.jpg">a 
                pic</a>. Unfortunately we had a curious Shadow Knight along who 
                wanted to take a closer look at some stuffed dragons...well, as 
                the saying goes, curiously killed the cat, or wiped out 3 groups 
                in under a second in this case. Sorry, happened so fast that no 
                one was able to snap a shot off. We are checking with the officials 
                at Genus yet, but we believe that flash flood of mobs may be the 
                largest train in EQ history. Needless to say that Drakkimor will 
                be on KP duty for the rest of the week. <br>

                07/29/01: This was definitely our roughest day up there this weekend. 
                We got wiped out a couple times, though we did figure out how 
                to CR with little problems. Got some more haste belts and quest 
                items. Killed the Keeper of Souls again, this time he had the

                an amazing turnout, and think it was a pleasing site to all. Hopefully 
                we can all look forward to more such gatherings. Speaking of which 
                just to cover a few things that went on at the meeting: 
                <ul>
                  <li>We will be taking a more aggressive stance on recruitment. 
                    Requirements for joining are still the same, but will be actively 
                    promoting and recruiting. 
                  <li>Officer positions are available to those who wish to start 
                    as a recruiter. It is again a serious undertaking, not just 
                    cause you want the power, nor coolness. You will have to do 
                    some work. 
                  <li>No one member or position is more important than the next. 
                    We are all important as we all make up this guild. We work 
                    together and not for ourselves. Selfishness is intolerable. 
                    Personal strength and devotion are honored. 
                  <li>Our 'rules' and hard work make us stand out from the rest 
                    of Norrath and it's guilds. Because of those we are unique 
                    and stronger. 
                  <li>Strong communication shall reinforce our ties and strength. 
                    Ill-informed comrades are ill-prepared and unlikely to be 
                    very effective. 
                </ul>
                We are young in accomplishment but not in desire or experience. 
                You can expect the most from our members, your family. All who 
                are with us should always stay informed of happenings and information

                There will be some events planned soon. Currently Runnyeye and 
                Cazic-Thule are being scouted. Our meeting was followed by a romp 
                through Nektullos where some hapless Dark Elf guards and guardians 
                were sent to Innoruk. And then onto Najena where we terrorized 
                the denizens for some time, all for the sheer fun of it.</blockquote>

                we moved on to Kill Phinigel with only 3 groups. Great job on 
                pulling once again Georg who got every one of the seahorses solo. 
                Bard backbone was picked up by Sanbian for Multiquesting and wand

                Green Stone for his Swiftwind blade. All he needs now is Shattered 
                Emerald from Hate to complete his epic totally. Thx all who helped

                We've had a blast in WW killing dragons, and the 15 dragons that 
                fell Friday the 20th is just a shape of things to come as we soon 
                move forward to the larger and harder dragons.<br>
                <br>
                The faction vote is now done and we will all be positive to giants 
                and kill all those ugly and nasty dragons we can find.<br>
                <br>
                The collecting of quest gem is moving forward pretty nicely, and 
                we are now getting closer to enter ToV to start farming those

              <blockquote>08/04/01: It appears Friday we were pretty busy. First 
                we popped into Skyshrine to smack our favorite Dragon king around. 
                Yelinak dropped on the first try, something to do with a brain 
                tumor.<br>
                <br>
                Then we were off to WW to lay the smack down on Sontalak for the 
                first time for us. He took a couple tries but we eventually kicked 
                his ass without using any haxoring via silencing dragon lameness. 
                It was a straight up beat down.<br>
                <br>
                Then we went inside and beat the crap out of Lend the keeper on 
                our first try. After fighting Vyemm and Vulak, all other dragons 
                are pretty much a let down.<br>
                <br>
                Oh ya, loot dropped, congrats to whomever got the phat lewtage.<br>
                <br>
                At this point in EQ the only target we have left is the 4th warder. 
                We won't be wasting our time on Tunare or the AoW ever. Let the 
                pre-rok same old same old commence! <br>
                <br>
                08/02/01: Screenshots and more info will follow later, but for 
                now, here's the quick info:<br>
                <br>
                Vyemm died first, and he's a true badass. Dropped two Silver Whips 
                of Rage and Onyx Gauntlets.<br>
                <br>
                Vulak died afterwards, and was easier than Vyemm. We had about 
                6-7 deaths and got him on the first try. I'm not allowed to post 
                the stats on any loot from Vulak for some unknown reason (F Zith!). 
                But I see no reason to hide the names: Jaelen's Katana, Abashi's 
                Rod of Disempowerment, and Boots of Silence or something like 
                that.<br>
                <br>
                Congrats to all the EoD and Relentless people as well as invites 
                who made this great server first a reality.<br>
                <br>
                07/31/01: I wasn't around, but I hear we killed Zlandicar and 
                did some other stuff before I logged on. I'll take their word 
                for it.<br>
                <br>
                It's been awhile since we've killed anything new, so we headed 
                back to the Forbidden Shrine of ToV North and killed three new 
                dragons. All of them seem like they were transplanted straight 
                from VP.<br>
                <br>
                First up was Zlexak, who's like Hoshkar on crack. He's a pretty 
                insane fight, but we've killed Hoshkar, and we've done crack, 
                so we managed to kill him. Zippe got some nice slippers of silence 
                off of him.<br>
                <br>
                Then came Cekenar, who is like Druushk. Only weaker. And Druushk 
                is pretty weak. Except he's got more hitpoints. But he's still 
                got that stupid Druushk model. One thing I've noticed about the 
                dragon models in the game - they almost all suck. Oh well. Thundre 
                got some sword off him.<br>
                <br>
                Last was Sevelak, who was something of a Silverwing clone. Well 
                sorta a cross between Silverwing and Von I guess. Maybe not. He 
                hit hard, but come on - he looks like Silverwing. I don't think 
                we've ever lost to a dragon that looks like Silverwing. Ianin 
                scored an Axe of Resistance.<br>
                <br>
                Only two dragons remain to kill in ToV North - Vyemm and Vulak. 
                We'll see how they stand up to the might of the BFA. <br>
                <br>
                We used this evening to try an all out assault on the 4th warder, 
                Ventani. We at least wanted to learn some strategies and figure 
                him out. We did manage to do that, but our goal of getting a server 
                wide first was thwarted by our friend Mistabone's guild on the 
                Rathe, Brotherhood of the Spider. Congratulations to them on killing 
                Ventani and waking the Sleeper. Looks like the script is still 
                a little broken though. Hopefully when we finally kill Ventani, 
                the script will be working again.<br>
                <br>
                Anyway, this marks a sad day for Clug, because he can never, ever, 
                make fun of Mista again. <br>
                <br>
                07/30/01: ...What is best in life? "To crush your enemies, see 
                them driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of the women!"<br>
                <br>
                Yes, it is true. The best thing in life is crushing your enemies 
                and seeing them driven. Unfortunately, EQ is missing the "women's 
                lamentation" feature that I've been asking for for so many years, 
                but I trust that EQ2 will have EAX support for it in the future.<br>
                <br>
                Anyway, what did we do yesterday? Obviously, we crushed our enemies. 
                In this case, our enemies happened to be those annoying dragons 
                of the Guardians of Veeshan. This was definitely one of our better 
                runs through the North Wing. By the end of the night, er... evening 
                (we finished far earlier than expected after killing way faster 
                than I thought), seven lovely dragons fell to the fury of the 
                BFA.<br>
                <br>
                The first to be driven before us was Xygoz. I mean Feshlak. What 
                is it with dragons using the Xygoz model? It seems they are required 
                to be wusses. Falli got Beldron's Vambraces of Impiety, and Naela 
                got the Staff of the Silent Star, thus reducing her chances of 
                getting an epic any time soon even farther.<br>
                <br>
                Dagarn was next. I'll spare you my Dagarn rant this time. For 
                some reason, what all the other dragons failed to do, Dagarn succeeded 
                in. He managed to wipe us out once. We had some bad luck on resists 
                and it just got ugly. But he died on the second attempt. Browny 
                recieved a Belt of the Destroyer from him.<br>
                <br>
                Kriezenn was next. I don't think we've ever died to Kriezenn. 
                And he claims to be a badass. Sha right. I'll give all y'all a 
                hint about fighting Kriezenn: If you can resist his AE alot and 
                do lots of melee damage and get off some dragonsbanes, you can 
                kill him. Trystar got a set of Shiny Metallic arms off of him, 
                giving him 2 pieces of shiny metallic stuff. If anyone has a SMR 
                for sale, please send a /tell to Trystar, he said he wants to 
                complete his set!<br>
                <br>
                We then moved on to the west si-ide to take on Mirellena and Koi 
                Doken. Both of these dragons were mispulls and we ended up fighting 
                them + their guards. Not that it matters at all, we had little 
                trouble killing them and their guards at the same time. Mirellena 
                gave an Orb of the Crimson Bull to Etiena, an Ebony Headband to 
                Soel, and Koi Doken gave a Bracer of the Deep Sea to Dorilys.<br>
                <br>
                We then headed to the far north reaches for some Jorlagg/Nevederia 
                fun. I think Dorilys got a Kael quest robe somewhere around here 
                - I think that's like the second robe in the guild, we have horrible 
                luck with them. Jorlagg died quickly and painlessly. Valde got 
                an Earring of the Icecaster. Nevederia was last, and as usual, 
                was the most difficult fight. People actually died. But not enough 
                people died, and she went down. Teufle got a nice Girdle of Dark 
                Power off of him. Now, is it just me, or is the thought of a Half-Elf 
                with "Dark Power" just too odd to contemplate. I guess the only 
                thing worse would be a Wood Elf Bard with one. Oh well, I guess 
                everyone can enjoy the benefits of Dark Power!<br>
                <br>
                That capped off the night as a bunch of freaks headed into PoM 
                for fun and frolic. But we shall return to ToV North later in 
                the week for more news. Stay tuned. </blockquote>

                guilds came up to get the monk epic. They killed the thunder spirits 
                and we looted the keys to the azarack island. A Stein of Flowing 
                Ichor dropped and was awarded to Zaske. We ported over and this 
                time fought in the port area. It worked like a charm. All little 
                imps quit flying around. The Protector of Sky dropped Bracelet 
                of Distortion and Belt of Transience. Zindak was awarded the bracelet 
                and Greyy got the belt. We also had a Treant Tear drop but no 
                druids to loot it.<br>
                <br>
                We all moved over to Gorgalask island next. The mobs were rude 
                to us when they dispelled some and killed others but we beat them 
                up in the end, even if Aegien never successfully pulled a taco. 
                Random mobs dropped a Belt of Iniquity and a Bracelet of Quiescence. 
                Slashim got the belt and Tagniz got the bracelet. Then we killed 
                Gorgalask and she dropped another Belt of Iniquity, Bracelet of 
                Cessation and Feathered Cape, which is needed for the Mage Quest 
                of Clarification. Sarlaac got the belt, Nuni got the bracelet

                <br>
                Then the biggest news of all is Ferkl and Kanine headed to Harvester 
                island where he turned in his goodies and was presented with his 
                Fiery Avenger. He's one step away from his epic now. Yeah!<br>

                08/03/01: Got the new people keys on first island. Thunder Spirit

                Next everyone moved over to the Azarack island where things went

                ensued. After it was over, we called it a night. <br>
                <br>
                08/02/01: Tad slow in people getting online and porting up but 
                things went well. First island was cleared and everyone got keys. 
                Stein of Flowing Ichor dropped from Thunder Spirit Princess but 
                no shamans were around to loot. :( Everyone camped out to get 
                more keys for everyone else heading up to Sky for the weekend. 
                <br>
                <br>
                08/01/01: A crew of VG ventured into Castle Mistmoore late Wednesday 
                night. When we came up to the castle entrance we noticed a lone 
                adventurer wandering in. Next thing we knew, half the castle was 
                pouring out the front gates. Mobs were everywhere, but when the 
                smoke cleared all that was left were mob corpses (and Trueth's 
                too. oops.) <br>
                <br>
                We headed inside and Kinjate pulled the rest of the castle to 
                us until he got the Advisor. We killed him to get the Black Dire 
                to spawn. We rolled on the robe since no one needed it for a character 
                there but we could all use it for alts. Voompa won.<br>
                <br>
                Then we all ran outside, down the ramp and into the pit. Kinjate 
                pulled the Black Dire, Zaske scratched him behind his ears and 
                then he rolled over to play dead. He looted the Black Dire pelt 
                which he later turned in to recieve Black Fur Boots. Grats Zaske!<br>
                <br>
