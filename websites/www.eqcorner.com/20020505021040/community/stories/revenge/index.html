<b class="heading">Revenge</b><br>

<i>by</i> Kakarott (Quellios server)
<br><br>
Perched on a rock overlooking the entrance to BlackBurrow, the vile pit of the gnolls, Orion tightened his cloak about his neck. Next, he looked down at his hands, which were wrapped in glowing silk cloth. He tightened the knots by which they were held together at his wrists to assure them from slipping off. "Vile dogs," he thought, "they will pay for their attack on the city." Clossing his eyes, he ran the memory through his mind of the attack on the city walls just 3 days ago. He remembered the horrified faces of the good citizens of Qeynos as the gnolls stormed the gates. The guards were little help, most of them were on break, and the few that were on post had been easily overthrown. In the chaos of it all, Orion did what he could against so many attackers. He had gotten a good look at the commanding gnoll leading the onslaught, the malicious look in his eyes as inocent men, women, and children were cut down by arrows and steel. He swore vengance on the gnolls for this attack, for the daughter of his best friend and his fiance' had been killed, hacked to pieces by the gnoll commander. Her name was Meridith, and she had never done any wrong other than be in the wrong place at the wrong time. He vowed that he would avenge her death.
<br><br>
 Orion was a very highly skilled monk of Qeynos, although he received his training in Freeport. After mastering the techniques taught to him by Paub Closk, Guild Master of the Ashen Order, Orion had become a wandering monk, going from town to town aming a little money. When he arrived in Qeynos 4 years ago, he met a man named Turin in his inn and they had become fast friends. He had joined the Order of the Silent Fist, the Monk guild in Qeynos and worked himself up to second head guild master. Later still, Orion and Turin's daughter, Meridith, had fallen in love. They were to be married 3 months from the time the gnolls attacked.
<br><br>
 Orion whispered to himself a silent prayer to Quellios, the Tranquil. Though his current guild masters followed no path of beliefs, he still felt a strong spiritual connection to Quellios, the Tranquil. It gave him a sense of security, to think that perhaps in some small way, he might be protected by the goodness of Quellios.
<br><br>
As the day slipped into night and gave in to darkness, Orion felt more comfortable. He preferred the blanket of shadow over the warmth of the sunlight, especially now, for it made his task at hand much easier.
<br><br>
 Finally, the sun died down over the rocky horizon, and Orion could faintly see his own breath in front of him as the air grew colder. He knew that the guards would change post soon, and after that would be the time to strike, he must remain as stealthily and as silent as possible. He knew that he must move fast, because he had perhaps only seconds after he was seen until the guards would call for others from inside.
<br><br>
 He saw movement from below, the gnolls started to stand tall as their superior came to change their post. "After the officer leaves," he thought to himself, "that will be the time." Through years of training he had developed keen senses, almost to the extent of the Elves. He could plainly hear the gnolls speaking in their ugly, guttural toung, though he could not understand the words. However, he did not need to know their language to understand what was said. "The officer is telling them to go inside when the new post comes out."

The gnolls stopped their talking and went inside, a few moments later 5 different gnolls took post outside the entrance. "Now is my chance!" Orion quietly leapt from his perch 30 feet above the ground, took stance, and landed on the hard packed ground with perfect silence. He moved quickly, taking from his belt a small steel star and threw it with a mere flick of his wrist. A moment later the nearest gnoll fell dead instantly with the star imbedded into the back of his head. Orion took stride, closing the distance between him and the remaining gnolls in a matter of moments, his steps completely unheard even by the dog-like senses of the gnolls. He jumped, coiled his leg back toward his body, and as fast as the eye could see kicked it outward and into the side of the gnoll guardsman's head. He had taken careful aim to hit the temple so the dog would fall instantly unconscious. By now he had made his pressence known to the 3 remaining gnolls, who were just reaching to grab their spears. The gnolls were fast, but Orion was much faster. Just as the clossest gnoll had taken his spear in his hand, he dropped it again as Orion's opened hand jabbed the gnoll's windpipe, severing it. The gnoll fell gasping and gurgling just as the last 2 lunged forward. The two were right next to each other both lunging with their spears. Orion easily dodged every strike, and as one of the spears came thrusting at his head, Orion reached up and caught the spear, and returned the attack with a fast punch to the gnoll's chest. The last gnoll, stopped in it's movements by the shear ferocity of the human attacker, dropped his spear and ran toward the opening to the lair. Orion jumped forward and kicked his foot out in a sweeping kick, causing the gnoll to fall flat on his face. Orion stepped over to the fallen gnoll, raised his hand above his head, and brought it slamming down into the gnoll's spine. The entire attack from the time he jumped from his perch had all happened within a matter of 4 seconds. Orion, realizing that he had indeed been fast enough to keep the gnolls from calling for others, took a breef rest; standing up and walking over to a nearby rock, he sat down and began to brush himself off gingerly. "My enemy's weakness is my strength, where my enemy fails I succeed, think not of killing, but allowing others to live." He repeated the familiar words of his guildmaster quitely to himself. "For the love of Quellios, let my faith be my power! Peace, tranquility, and honor." He whispered the words quietly under his breath, these words gave him comfort.
<br><br>
Standing up from his breather, he now stood in front of the entrance to the stinking hole of the gnolls. He breathed a long sigh as he entered into the pit. It was not a sigh of fear, it was a sigh of exhileration.
<br><br>
 He was far down now, he could tell by the lack of light that was in the reaking cavern. This lack of light did not hinder him, for his handwraps glowed with a warm, white, ambiant light. He had passed many gnolls on the way down, but he did not attack, instead, he kept perfect stealth. Jumping from cover to cover, shadow to shadow not making even the faintest noise. He could tell that he was nearing the heart of the gnolls' lair, he saw a faint red glow of torch light in the caverns up ahead and could hear noises from the filthy beasts barking and yelling at each other. "Such filthy dogs, they are," thought Orion. "When I find that bastard gnoll officer, he will breath his last at my feet." Thoughts of the gnolls running people down ran through his head, and of the gnoll officer with his minions gathered around him while he slowly ran a rusty sword through the heart of Meridith and licked his sword clean with his long, red toung. He pushed these thoughts out his mind, for he had to focus on his mission.
<br><br>
 He went deeper into the cavern. The smell of the stinking beasts was almost unbearable, and he closed his eyes for a moment to block out the smell from his mind. All monks are taught from a very early age to be able to block out physical sensations; pain, sickness, heat, cold, and in this case, distracting stimulis, in this case, a foul smell. He finally found what he was looking for, the master quarters. It must have been beuatiful to gnoll standards, adorned with bloody standards by each door with a different marking on it, and instead of the crude torches that filled the lesser caverns, the halls were illuminated by fine lanterns that burned foul smelling oils. Hearing a noise, Orion looked up, jumped 7 feet staight up into the air and caught hold of a support beem and held his body flat against the ceiling by pressure holding with his feet on an other beem 6 feet behind him. He looked down the coridor and saw 2 gnolls walking down the hall with shining swords in their belts, talking to each other in their wolfish speech. They were much taller and darker of fur than the other gnolls, they were high ranking commanders. By the way they held themselves with there slight arrogance in their step, and proud visage, he could tell that they considered themselves good fighters, and he should be warry of them. By their relitive size and the way they walked, he could also tell they would be much harder to fight than the guardsmen he faught at the gate. He held his breath, for it was his personal experiance that higher gnolls had better sences than lower gnolls, and these were very high. "If I could get them into a wider area, I could easily take care of them both. In these condifed spaces, they have the upper hand with their swords. I just hope they don't see..... BLAST!!!!" They had smelled him, despite his stealth of sight and sound, there is no way to cover up smell, even in these musty halls. Both gnolls had drawn their swords and were about to call for others to come. Orion knew that if they yelled, more wuold come and he would be outnumbered. He let loos his grip on the beem and fell from the ceiling. As he fell, he kicked out his foot and hit the taller gnoll in the face before it could say anything. Orion stepped donw onto the floor just as the other gnoll was swinging his sword at him. Thoughtlessly, smoothly, Orion stepped back out of the way of the swinging steel, stepped forward again and let loose a flurry of concusive force punches, about five of them in a matter of two seconds. Before the gnoll could get off another swing of his sword, he was dead, knocked into oblivion by the fury of the inspired young monk. Praying to Quellios that what had just happened had not attracted the attention of the other gnoll commanders, Orion was about to take another step down the corridor, when suddenly, all the doors in the hall oppened and out stepped over a dozen gnoll comanders. Orion cursed under his breath and turned on his heals to run the other way, but as he turned, a dozen more gnolls appeared in the hall in front of him. He knew that gnolls did not usually take prisoners, they just killed anyone they saw. So, Orion, gathering his wits and all his power about him, took a deep breath, and did the only thing he had left to do, fight his way out! He ran back down the corridor he had come in from, straight for the advancing gnolls, and jumped, 10 feet into the air over the heads of all the dogs slashing at him with their spears and swords. He landed smoothly on his feet far behind them, leaving them as well as himself surprised at what he had just done, and ran into the main hall, the heart of BlackBurrow. He ran into the middle of the most open area he could find and turned to fight the advancing gnolls running fiercely behind him. They were about to all attack him at once, when suddenly they all stopped. They grew quiet and parted around a rather large gnoll, infact, a very large gnoll; THE gnoll! This was the one Orion had been looking for, the gnoll who lead the attack on Qeynos, the same bastard dog that slaughtered Meridith! The leader of the gnolls in BlackBurrow.
<br><br>
 The gnoll yelled out a great bellow, and on command, the gnolls formed a circle around Orion. This gnoll wanted to make sport of the human who had so valiantly penetraited his lair. He called for an other large gnoll, probably his second in command, gave him a long spear, and sent him out in the middle of the circle with Orion. The gnoll suddenly lunged forward with the spear. Orion knew that he had no time for stealth, no time for honor or for restraint. This was a time for pure, unbridled rage. A fire burned in Orion's eyes, and he blocked the spear with his right arm, stepped up, and kicked with his left leg. At the same time, he chopped the gnolls wrist, which caused the hand to let go the spear. Orion held the spear in his hands, and letting loose his rage, broke it in half and pummeled the yaulping gnoll unrelentlessly. The gnoll was dead, covered in blood and pockmarked full of holes. This greatly angered the head gnoll, and he sent in three more of his underlings. Within moments, all three were dead. Then, all the lesser gnolls in the circle attacked at once. Giving in to the fighting spirit within himself, Orion seemed to move with a magical speed. He attacked every single gnoll untill they were disabled in a matter of seconds, his hands a mere blur, he attacked with an unnatural speed. He jumped, turned over in the air, landed on his right hand, and let loose a barrage of kicks so powerful, that each one went right through the armor the gnolls were wearing as if it was not even there. Now, the head gnoll was enraged, he stopped the attack by his underlings and pulled out his sword. To the surprise of Orion and indeed the other gnolls he spoke in the common language "I will deel with this human myself!"
<br><br>
Orion stood up defiantly, this was the moment he had prepaired himself for. The head gnoll walked up to Orion, stopped, and spoke to him in a very deep and muffled voice, but his words would still be heard. "You have done well, human, I am indeed impressed. It is not every warrior that can hold up against so many of my finest fighters with hardly a scratch. I commend you." "Orion holding back his urge to rush forward and kill the foul beast on sight, said, "I am no warrior, I am Orion, devout Monk of the Silent Fist, and follower of the Tranquil. My mission here is to kill you. And by Quellios, you bastard slime, I will kill you! You WILL suffer for the death of my love!!" Orion was so worked up that tears started to well in his eyes. But they were quickly washed away by the fire that now burned in his heart. The gnoll's face became wicked as a toothy smile spread over it. "So, that is why you are here, you plan to kill me and avenge the death of some girl? Please, you will have to exuse my absent mind, but I have killed so very many human girls that I seem to forget most of them. Would you remind me exactly WHICH girl this was and when?" This only enraged Orion even more, but he still held back the urge to kill the mocking gnoll before him. He knew that an angry fight is a clumsy fight. "Three days ago, you and your men.....dogs, attacked the city of Qeynos. I saw you during the battle, surrounded by your minions while you ran a poor girl through. her name was Meridith, and she and I were to be wed!" Orion's words did not effect the big gnoll at all, and he simply said, "Oh yes, her, the peasent girl who was thrown out of the city gates durring all that commotion. You should be greatful that I killed her there, usually I take them with me and kill them slowly. That is, of course, after I have had my way with them!" With this, the gnoll raised his sword and rushed at the angered monk. This was the moment Orion had been waiting for.
<br><br>
 Burning with a fire the likes of which he had never felt before, Orion dodged and ducked past every swing the master gnoll swung at him. It was taking all he had just to keep from loosing his head. "Now I know why he is the master gnoll, I would have had an easier time fighting the rest of his underlings!" The sword swung at Orion's head, he ducked, but just barely, he felt the cold steal graze upon his hair, and cut some off. He did not have time to counter strike, the gnoll was so much faster than any other he had faught. All he could to fo rnow was try to stay in one peice and wait for a moment when his enemy was open for attack. That moment came sooner than Orion thought it would, as the blade passed by his torso, it left the gnoll's back open for attack, not close enough to punch or strike, and not enough room to do a flying kick, the just tried to roundkick the gnoll's back. It worked, and the gnoll yaulped and recoiled. Orion was holding back screaming out in pain, kicking that monster was like kicking a brick wall, exept when Orion kickes a brick wall, it usually breaks! Distracted by his pain, the gnoll strunk him with the back of his sword and sent him flying into the rock wall. This knocked the wind out of him, and he fell to the floor gasping for air. The gnoll, seeing that he had scorred a winning blow, walked over to his fallen opponent, reached down and picked him up by the throat. "Now, filthy human, you will share the same fate of your beloved Meridith" Squeezing Orion's neck harder and stopping his breathing, the big gnoll touched the tip of his sword to his chest. All of the sudden, memories of Meridith filled Orion's mind, walks along the ocean side, talks of having children and what they would look like. Nights of music and dancing at her father's inn. A warm bed, and her beuatiful face smiling at him in the lamplight. Her sweet voice, like music, whispering in his ear. Then, thoughts of her being run threw by the cold steel of the gnoll who held him by the neck now. His anger swelled, and he felt within himself a new strength, as if Quellios herself had granted him her very power. "NO!!!!" With seemingly superhuman strength, Orion reached up, took hold of the big gnoll's arm, and crushed it, crushed it until the bone had turned to dust. The gnoll howled in pain and let go. Filled with a power bordering on the magical, the jumped up, and kicked the gnoll's head three times. He landed, grabbed the vile moster by the throat, and punched him in the chest as hard and as fast as he could, again, and agian, and again! Blows that would have gone through stone, one after the other. He kicked the gnoll's knee and sent him to the ground, cowering on his knees. Terified, the gnoll said in a strained voice filled with pain and suffering, "Please, have mercy, oh mighty Monk of Quellios. PLEASE!!!" Orion, knowing that any mercy he could show to this creature wuold just be a quicker death said,"You don't are not deserving of my mercy!" He slowly raised his hand above his head, and sent it slamming down into the gnoll's heart. The gnoll spat blood, a lot of blood. and died. He let go of the gnoll's arm and stood up. Looking down, he brought his hands together in front of his chest in the honerary fasion of the Monks of Norath, and bowed.
