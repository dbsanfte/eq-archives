            <p>Dec 28: People are getting back from holiday ... Deacis Killed

              dragon and some loot for Anabank...Where are those cloaks??? </p>
            <p>Well, anyhoot...We made it to SolB and after a quick gathering

              First off, thanks to Crimson Talon for allowing our people to join 
              them in Hate over this past weekend! Alot of nice things happened 
              to drop, and a few of our fellow guildmates went home with them. 
              Ceeni received a cleric bracer, Kilwean the bard bp and Machedor 
              got warrrior gloves, boots and a bracer. Nice job! Also, many of 
              us in the guild are relocating our characters to the moon so that 
              guild groups will be easier over the next week or so. We look forward 
              to seeing everyone!</p>

              days. Raiding was cut back for the holidays but we managed to sneak 
              in a few mobs tonight. First up was Tormax, Congratulations go out 
              to Tirram on his new belt, Nalfien on Tormax's head, Delila on her 
              new gaunts and Oniar on his new ring. Next to die was the Dain,

              GUILD ALLIANCE!!!<br>
              Posted by Catabrie on January 3, 2002 <br>
            </p>
            <p>Your illustrious leader *cough* *cough* has spent some time working 
              with Tevaryen of Path of Valor and Ailyei of Praxium to hammer out 
              an alliance which will see us all going on to bigger and better 
              things! The following are just an outline of the plans we have jointly 
              made, we are going to need every members cooperation in full to 
              make this alliance work. Initially it will be a trial but i see 
              no reason why it cant continue indefinately. Raids will be organised 
              regularly and in turn by each guild so as to lighten the burden 
              on individual guilds. Our priority at the moment are epic raids 
              more importantly getting at least one cleric epic for each of the 
              three guilds in the alliance.</p>

              <br>
              December 21st: Patch day rolled around again, so CC/Talons decided 
              to take a shot at Vindicator, Statue of Rallos Zek and King Tormax. 
            </p>
            <p>First we took down Vindicator </p>

            <p>Grats to Sehria on the head for the Gloves of Earthcrafting quest, 
              and grats to Woodsing on his Chestplate of Vindication. </p>
            <p>Statue of Rallos Zek was next, the first time CC and Talons took 
              him out together. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Grats to Whopper on the Breastplate of Eradication, and Catch on 
              the Hammer of Battle. </p>
            <p>Last, but not least, time for King Tormax. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Grats to Angturil on the head for the White Dragonscale Boots quest, 
              Serenity on the White Dragon Scale Sash, Tegian on the Horn of Hsraga, 
              and Talons on Boots of the Storm. </p>
            <p>This was the last raid for us before the upcoming holidays, so 
              thank you to everyone that showed up and put in the effort to make 
              it another success for both guilds.</p>

              ToV can be fun and educational <br>
              Dec 22 2001<br>
              Well, CoG and PR ventured into the depths of ToV yet again and came 
              away with plate boots for Mareck(welcome to CoG, still working on 
              that deguilding, having trouble) and also someone to be named later 
              on leather arms. PR got plate boots that went to Damlador and cloth 
              arms I believe, that went to Hachi. Gratz to those guys also! Not 
              too bad a night actually, considering the limited time we spent 
              there. Thanks goes out to Nem of CC for coming out and helping us, 
              without whom, none of this would have been possible. /cheer Nem. 
              I'd put your full name here, but couldn't spell it if I tried.<br>

              JAN 01, 2001<br>
              Raid on City of Mist to finish off Marick's epic. Pets made mincemeat 
              of Lord Rak'Ashiir, and after slaying many Black Reavers, we managed 
              to obtain a Jade Reaver [Yazz] and an Atramentous Shield. Grats 
              to Marick for our first epic of 2002!
            <p>DEC 30, 2001<br>
              Eager to punish Hate again today, we restarted our raid. Drops: 
              Cleric Gauntlets [Awll], 2 Cleric Bracers [Ceeni-guest, Aorthin], 
              Cleric Shield [Rezzie], Cleric Arms [Lumpey]. Rots: Shaman legs, 
              Warrior gloves, bard arms, rogue arms, rogue spear. Within a couple 
              hours, we managed to clear the first floor yet again, even with 
              a minor crew and the decided to leave Hate for a while.</p>
            <p>DEC 29, 2001<br>
              Another day in Hate and completely cleared the first floor of every 
              single mob. Cleared almost entire second floor, except for Inny 
              himself. Best part of raid was whacking the Evangalist upside the 
              head to stop the spamming. Loots were beyond incredible: 2 Warrior 
              BP [Valstorm, Uggabugga], Bard BP [Kilwean-guest], 2 Rogue BP [Muscled, 
              Zoranna], Druid BP [Dunskye]. SK bracer [Sylvanna]. Theologian Claymore 
              [Ryaku]. Enormous number of rots as well: Cleric Helm (3), Cleric 
              Shield, Mage Boots, Shaman legs, Enchanter BP, and a Warrior BP. 
              This is on top of bd/d that were quickly turned into resist gear 
              and distributed.</p>
            <p>DEC 28, 2001<br>
              Broke into Hate again tonight to clear out all the mini-bosses. 
              Loot drops were very nice: Bard: Imbrued Legs [Brewall], Necromancer: 
              Innoruuk Eye [Fenik], Essense of Vamprire [Mysyn], Warrior Legs 
              [Lisner], and over 25 bd and almost 20 d.</p>
            <p>DEC 27, 2001<br>
              Raid on hate again. This night Dodja got hate stone for ranger epic! 
              Chiun also got uber monk haste item and passed down his RBB.</p>
            <p>DEC 23, 2001<br>
              Impromptu raid on Hate. 15 of us decided to head up to Hate for 
              a couple days. Managed to get some nice drops: Cleric Legs [Johansmith], 
              Cleric Arms and Gloves, Warrior Bracer [Uggabugga], Cleric Shield 
              [Aorthin], and 5 blue diamond/diamond. Will be returning on the 
              24th for more killing.</p>

              We have officially ended our merger with the Inner Light peeps. 
              I know some of you are very excited by this and I can understand 
              your excitement. We have a smaller group of people to draw upon 
              but we can still take down some rough and tough mobs. Let us now 
              concentrate on us expanding this guild in both members and our bond 
              of friendship. With a little effort I know we can create a fun atmosphere 
              and positive gaming experience. We will flush out our ranks in the 
              near future for sure. </p>

              Welcome to the new year and a new look/attitude for KoT. We have 
              been kicking ass lately. We finished Sader's epic - (GRATS SADER!) 
              in an epic battle that stretched from the Plane of Air, to Nurga, 
              to Illomen and finally to the corpse of Voresh. </p>
            <p>
              After popping the Presence in PoA, (Can I say that with a straight 
              face?) we moved down to Nurga to find the sleeping Giant. Well, 
              Carmon woke him with a nuke, and next we know, we had giant guts 
              everywhere. So Sader sat on the corpse and waited for him to spawn 
              again before doing the handin. </p>
            <p>
              On the following day, we went to kill his accomplises in Illomen. 
              Only Surj, Teakgirl, and Mouson bought the farm in this battle. 
              After we prevailed and moved to Emerald Jungle to turn it in. In 
              the end, Sader walked with his epic. </p>
            <p>
              On Tuesday morning, we got together in Kael. We moved in, and begin 
              pulling the arena, until I pulled a Protector train to end our arena 
              career. We managed to find some corroded bracers (Grats Begravia) 
              during the time we spent there though.
            <p> Other raids of note recently. We zoomed through Dragon Necropolis, 
              managed to find some decent weapons for the guild. We went through 
              Kael, finished Sader's epic pipe, had some fun in Chardok. In general, 
              we have been kicking ass all the way around. </p>

            <p>The Relentless<br>
              Due to the manner in which the new rotation of ToV North is set 
              up, we were able, like DA and SS, to get two clears within our 5 
              days. We had the good fortune for a patch to occur and so once again 
              we made our way into ToV to try and take it out in one day. Our 
              course ahead of us was clear. Knowing what had to be done we rallied 
              the troops and hopped into our carts to get a move on. All that 
              remained to be seen was if we had what was required to clear out 
              the Temple in under 10 hours. And did we ever, taking out the temple 
              in one of our best times yet we cleared it down to its toes. We 
              also got some nice loot, as seen here, Talzok and his Solist's Earing 
              of Insight and me and my Akkirus' Mask of War. Thanks to my guild 
              for the mask and congrats all others on the phat lewts we got through 
              out the long night.</p>

            <p>Well, we were running around Ssra Temple last night, killing some 
              p00sae baddies and in general having a good time. We decide to go 
              for a mob we havent killed yet, and unfortunatly, not everyone was 
              moving with the group. Basically, we trained ourselves a few times. 
              I arrived at the end of the fight just in time to get a picture 
              of Ratskeller taking it raw. Here is a picture of the carnage for 
              those who were already dead at that point:</p>

              Posted By: Lovern Merrilon on 27 December 2001, at 06:33 PM </p>
            <p>Well, the day started out early. Vulak had been spotted a few days 
              earlier and it was decided we couldn't let his drunked debauchary 
              go on much longer. We had to put a stop to this.<br>
              <br>
              I wasnt on for the start of the day but from what I've been told 
              we got a great early start due to the scouting abilities of Crover, 
              Soel, Mintern, Teufle and Faolan. Our crew is pictured here in full 
              battle regalia:</p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Eventually we were able to clear our way to the beast and were 
              able to put him out of his misery. We were thanked most profusely:</p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>In the end, there was much rejoicing and the Lovern, Fflewdeur, 
              Luzz, Sonani and Songhalo band played on:</p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>In other words, we cleared ToV North in one day, go us, rah rah, 
              go team! <br>
            </p>

              Friday, December 21st, 2001: In the past four days, Shadowed Souls 
              and The Divine Alliance have cleared the north wing of TOV twice. 
              Has been a total blast. We lined up the zone, cleared it from stem 
              to stern, then VI was kind enough to patch for us and so we lined 
              em up and did it iagain. Drops were nice the whole way through, 
              and Replay set a new personal best for corpses left around in a
