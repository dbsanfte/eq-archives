<b class="heading">The First Skirmish... The Army Emerges</b><br>
<i>by</i> Sachant Velg'larn, Lanys Army (Undead Lords)

<br><br>
It had been several days of training and I could sense the growing anxiousness of my kin and those of my race. We had been told time and time again that our day would come to wipe the light blighted from this land and stain it with their blood. I could see the gleam of bloodlust in their eyes as I knew it was gleaming in my own. I had hoped to serve a higher station in the army but alas found I had missed the calling due to other obligations, but nothing would stop me from serving the best I could. There was more than my own petty ego to attend. War was imminent and I would not stand to see my kin slain when it should be their rotting corpses left to seed the land.
<br><br>
Then it happened. The call to war was risen up over the lands and echoed in every shadow calling me to come. I was quick to send word to those of my allies that could attend. It was not long before I stood within my beloved city of Neriak before the dark daughter herself. When she spoke of severing all current ties, I felt a sickness deep in the pit of my belly. I would be cutting myself off from my kin to serve. I swallowed down the nausea and did as she bid, determined that I would be there for the first bloodletting. It was not long before my other kin began to join the ranks, lightening the burden on my heart. The shouts of "Blood and Soulz" echoed through the city and rang in my ears. I knew that with these at my side victory would be ours.

Slowly our army began to mount as those from far and wide gathered to the whisperings of war. I could smell the musty swamp on the trolls and could smell the salty sweat of the ogres permeate the air as they stood waiting in the wings. Their great hulking bodies were blocking out much of the already dim lighting of the flickering flames that served as the minimal lighting our kind need. Mutterings and shouts rang out from time to time as the Oloth Vlos (Dark Blood, as I like to call them) began to work themselves up into a frenzy. We had been told that their forces were great but we cared nothing of numbers for all it would mean is more for us to kill.
<br><br>
"They are in the West Commonlands! Send a our first strike forces now!" Came the call. We were ready and began to move toward the destiny that called us. We went as quickly as we could knowing the route we must take and keeping ourselves as organized and together as we could to present a force worth fearing. Our first steps were into the Eastern Commonlands where I could hear the shouting of the weak light blighted as they called out for fear of seeing our great army. Then the world spun and I was wrenched out of it, as I knew many of ours would be as well. It seemed that the forces of light tried to stop us even before we could touch their precious "children". We prevailed and I found myself back in the world. Many more began to conquer the force that had severed them from the rest of the army as well and we began to reform for battle.
<br><br>
It was not long that the shouts of "Blood and Soulz" rang once more. I knew that soon the blood of the light would drip from my blades. We met up at the desert cave and began preparation for battle and began to move toward where we had been told the enemy had taken up holding. Chaos had yet to take control so we waited in the wings muttering our prayers to the Dark Lord we serve, knowing he would be at our side and feed off of the blood and souls of our victims.
<br><br>
After what seemed an eternity of staring at the enemy and unable to lay blades on them our commander spoke. "Meet at Kidzean Gix! We will rally here!" We moved quickly to join our forces and stand strong beside them. I could hear the labored breathing of my squire as he ran nearby. His excitement to serve in the bloodletting evident. 
<br><br>
Shouts once again rang though the air as the light saw us gather. "Lanys' Army gathers! Quickly we must do something they are gaining strength and gathering even now!" Ah, music to my ears. They might as well have squealed in terror it would have sounded much the same.
<br><br>
Then the darkness grew thicker around us. I looked up from my preparations and realized what the darkness was, Chaos was let loose upon the land! Battle had begun! We began to sweep out looking for those of the enemy. I had not far to go before I saw my first victim, a frail human ripe for the slaughter. His death was quick I fear. I would have liked it more if he had suffered more but alas, there were many more where he had come from. One of my own went out to scout and though I bid him return quickly to us he did not listen. He was felled to bleed on the ground and my anger was twofold, part at his disobedience and part at the death of one of mine at THEIR hands. I growled deep in my throat and set out to slay more.
<br><br>
We continued our movement toward their stronghold, the wizard teleport. I could see the battle already and could not help my mouth from watering at sight of the blood. We entered the fray and began to do battle as best we could. Our movements seemed slow and cumbersome and the enemy from time to time seemed as to move out of our sight but we kept on them, weeding them down.
<br><br>
Then I spied a prime target. Cybsled was in the fray and doing battle, his soft exposed back to me. I leaped to lay in a quick stab and my other kin saw what I was about and joined in his slaughter. I will say this now to clear something up. Another claimed his death but I know the true slayers. It was a team effort and that is the way of armies.
<br><br>
I jumped in where I saw I was needed. As I fought I felt steel rip through my flesh and turned to see Twinpeaks swinging her blade at me. I smiled to myself knowing I had been waiting for this. I began to fight her as I could and soon others saw where my target lie and assisted. She was dead within moments. She made an error in judgement if she thought I was alone in that place. My kin was all about me and they would not stand by to watch me fall to the hands as one such as she.
<br><br>
The chaos continued as bodies began to litter the ground. More of theirs fell than ours. Before long though, many of ours found themselves without strength to cast and we began to move back to safer ground where we could protect them in their meditations. Then something happened that I will NOT forget. My personal squire was being attacked by one of their commanders. I felt the helplessness as I watched his health fall and then saw his life extinguished. I heard her shout to the land, "Rayven has been slain! I have killed Rayven!" "NOOOOO," I shouted. "I WILL HAVE YOUR HEAD!" Vengeance would be mine.
<br><br>
I fell back to our stronghold to do what I could having slain another along the way. Blood was dripping from my blade and still I wanted more. Immortalis stood near bleeding and injured and I bade him come to the stronghold to heal. We started and saw the commander that had slain my squire. She began to beat on Immortalis, his already fragile lifeline growing dimmer. I tried to get in the damage I could succeeding a few times in piercing her soft human flesh but alas I lost her and failed Immortalis at the same time. My blood was boiling and I knew I must return to guard the others.
<br><br>
Once back at our stronghold, I saw many more gathering to regroup. Calls continued to ring out shouting the deaths of the enemy and from time to time shouts went up of one of ours falling, but their shouts were less frequent than ours.
<br><br>
A commotion caught my ears as suddenly the commander that had just slain my squire and Immortalis sprang over the rise. She would not escape me again! I ran after her, feeling the heat of the blasts from my kin as they scorched her flesh. I chased all through the west commonlands and into the east commonlands and still she ran as a coward. It was not to be. Hatred boiled inside me, as I knew I could not catch her. She was gone before I knew it. Once more I entered the west commonlands looking for blood to spill.
<br><br>
It was not long before I came across a young human monk. I began to smile, as I knew another victim would be mine. I began to carve on him little by little feeling his flesh peal back from my blades and watching his warm blood dribble from his wounds. Then he got lucky and disarmed me once. I must say this; he was brave and stood his ground. I was almost impressed. Then I watched as surprise lit up his face as he searched for where he was being hit from for it was more than my blades that bit him. He turned about to see a high elf casting at him. "TRAITOR!" he shouted. I knew the truth of the situation even if the human was too dull witted to notice. I could not help but laugh at my ally's deception. Then the human monk began to run for his life. He was quick but I was quicker. I chased him down as any beast and finally laid him dead at my feet. "Another one has been slain!" I must say now that human blood is quite satisfying when warm and still, my bloodlust was not quenched.
<br><br>
Once more I returned to the stronghold readying myself with the others to continue on, but alas, it was not to be. Order was restored. The light claimed victory but we knew the truth. For every one of ours 3 had fed the soil with their blood. This was only the emergence of our army and we had proven ourselves worthy. Beware light blighted. We come to claim victory and will march the Dark Daughter to it over your rotting corpses. This is my solemn vow. BLOOD AND SOULZ!!!
