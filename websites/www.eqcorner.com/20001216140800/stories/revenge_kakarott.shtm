        by Kakarott (Quellios server)</span> 
        <p class="whitetext9">Perched on a rock overlooking the entrance to BlackBurrow, 
          the vile pit of the gnolls, Orion tightened his cloak about his neck. 
          Next, he looked down at his hands, which were wrapped in glowing silk 
          cloth. He tightened the knots by which they were held together at his 
          wrists to assure them from slipping off. "Vile dogs," he thought, "they 
          will pay for their attack on the city." Clossing his eyes, he ran the 
          memory through his mind of the attack on the city walls just 3 days 
          ago. He remembered the horrified faces of the good citizens of Qeynos 
          as the gnolls stormed the gates. The guards were little help, most of 
          them were on break, and the few that were on post had been easily overthrown. 
          In the chaos of it all, Orion did what he could against so many attackers. 
          He had gotten a good look at the commanding gnoll leading the onslaught, 
          the malicious look in his eyes as inocent men, women, and children were 
          cut down by arrows and steel. He swore vengance on the gnolls for this 
          attack, for the daughter of his best friend and his fiance' had been 
          killed, hacked to pieces by the gnoll commander. Her name was Meridith, 
          and she had never done any wrong other than be in the wrong place at 
          the wrong time. He vowed that he would avenge her death. </p>
        <p class="whitetext9"> Orion was a very highly skilled monk of Qeynos, 
          although he received his training in Freeport. After mastering the techniques 
          taught to him by Paub Closk, Guild Master of the Ashen Order, Orion 
          had become a wandering monk, going from town to town aming a little 
          money. When he arrived in Qeynos 4 years ago, he met a man named Turin 
          in his inn and they had become fast friends. He had joined the Order 
          of the Silent Fist, the Monk guild in Qeynos and worked himself up to 
          second head guild master. Later still, Orion and Turin's daughter, Meridith, 
          had fallen in love. They were to be married 3 months from the time the 
          gnolls attacked. </p>
        <p class="whitetext9"> Orion whispered to himself a silent prayer to Quellios, 
          the Tranquil. Though his current guild masters followed no path of beliefs, 
          he still felt a strong spiritual connection to Quellios, the Tranquil. 
          It gave him a sense of security, to think that perhaps in some small 
          way, he might be protected by the goodness of Quellios. </p>
        <p class="whitetext9">As the day slipped into night and gave in to darkness, 
          Orion felt more comfortable. He preferred the blanket of shadow over 
          the warmth of the sunlight, especially now, for it made his task at 
          hand much easier. </p>
        <p class="whitetext9"> Finally, the sun died down over the rocky horizon, 
          and Orion could faintly see his own breath in front of him as the air 
          grew colder. He knew that the guards would change post soon, and after 
          that would be the time to strike, he must remain as stealthily and as 
          silent as possible. He knew that he must move fast, because he had perhaps 
          only seconds after he was seen until the guards would call for others 
          from inside. </p>
        <p class="whitetext9"> He saw movement from below, the gnolls started 
          to stand tall as their superior came to change their post. "After the 
          officer leaves," he thought to himself, "that will be the time." Through 
          years of training he had developed keen senses, almost to the extent 
          of the Elves. He could plainly hear the gnolls speaking in their ugly, 
          guttural toung, though he could not understand the words. However, he 
          did not need to know their language to understand what was said. "The 
          officer is telling them to go inside when the new post comes out." </p>
        <p class="whitetext9">The gnolls stopped their talking and went inside, 
          a few moments later 5 different gnolls took post outside the entrance. 
          "Now is my chance!" Orion quietly leapt from his perch 30 feet above 
          the ground, took stance, and landed on the hard packed ground with perfect 
          silence. He moved quickly, taking from his belt a small steel star and 
          threw it with a mere flick of his wrist. A moment later the nearest 
          gnoll fell dead instantly with the star imbedded into the back of his 
          head. Orion took stride, closing the distance between him and the remaining 
          gnolls in a matter of moments, his steps completely unheard even by 
          the dog-like senses of the gnolls. He jumped, coiled his leg back toward 
          his body, and as fast as the eye could see kicked it outward and into 
          the side of the gnoll guardsman's head. He had taken careful aim to 
          hit the temple so the dog would fall instantly unconscious. By now he 
          had made his pressence known to the 3 remaining gnolls, who were just 
          reaching to grab their spears. The gnolls were fast, but Orion was much 
          faster. Just as the clossest gnoll had taken his spear in his hand, 
          he dropped it again as Orion's opened hand jabbed the gnoll's windpipe, 
          severing it. The gnoll fell gasping and gurgling just as the last 2 
          lunged forward. The two were right next to each other both lunging with 
          their spears. Orion easily dodged every strike, and as one of the spears 
          came thrusting at his head, Orion reached up and caught the spear, and 
          returned the attack with a fast punch to the gnoll's chest. The last 
          gnoll, stopped in it's movements by the shear ferocity of the human 
          attacker, dropped his spear and ran toward the opening to the lair. 
          Orion jumped forward and kicked his foot out in a sweeping kick, causing 
          the gnoll to fall flat on his face. Orion stepped over to the fallen 
          gnoll, raised his hand above his head, and brought it slamming down 
          into the gnoll's spine. The entire attack from the time he jumped from 
          his perch had all happened within a matter of 4 seconds. Orion, realizing 
          that he had indeed been fast enough to keep the gnolls from calling 
          for others, took a breef rest; standing up and walking over to a nearby 
          rock, he sat down and began to brush himself off gingerly. "My enemy's 
          weakness is my strength, where my enemy fails I succeed, think not of 
          killing, but allowing others to live." He repeated the familiar words 
          of his guildmaster quitely to himself. "For the love of Quellios, let 
          my faith be my power! Peace, tranquility, and honor." He whispered the 
          words quietly under his breath, these words gave him comfort. </p>
        <p class="whitetext9">Standing up from his breather, he now stood in front 
          of the entrance to the stinking hole of the gnolls. He breathed a long 
          sigh as he entered into the pit. It was not a sigh of fear, it was a 
          sigh of exhileration. </p>
        <p class="whitetext9"> He was far down now, he could tell by the lack 
          of light that was in the reaking cavern. This lack of light did not 
          hinder him, for his handwraps glowed with a warm, white, ambiant light. 
          He had passed many gnolls on the way down, but he did not attack, instead, 
          he kept perfect stealth. Jumping from cover to cover, shadow to shadow 
          not making even the faintest noise. He could tell that he was nearing 
          the heart of the gnolls' lair, he saw a faint red glow of torch light 
          in the caverns up ahead and could hear noises from the filthy beasts 
          barking and yelling at each other. "Such filthy dogs, they are," thought 
          Orion. "When I find that bastard gnoll officer, he will breath his last 
          at my feet." Thoughts of the gnolls running people down ran through 
          his head, and of the gnoll officer with his minions gathered around 
          him while he slowly ran a rusty sword through the heart of Meridith 
          and licked his sword clean with his long, red toung. He pushed these 
          thoughts out his mind, for he had to focus on his mission. </p>
        <p class="whitetext9"> He went deeper into the cavern. The smell of the 
          stinking beasts was almost unbearable, and he closed his eyes for a 
          moment to block out the smell from his mind. All monks are taught from 
          a very early age to be able to block out physical sensations; pain, 
          sickness, heat, cold, and in this case, distracting stimulis, in this 
          case, a foul smell. He finally found what he was looking for, the master 
          quarters. It must have been beuatiful to gnoll standards, adorned with 
          bloody standards by each door with a different marking on it, and instead 
          of the crude torches that filled the lesser caverns, the halls were 
          illuminated by fine lanterns that burned foul smelling oils. Hearing 
          a noise, Orion looked up, jumped 7 feet staight up into the air and 
          caught hold of a support beem and held his body flat against the ceiling 
          by pressure holding with his feet on an other beem 6 feet behind him. 
          He looked down the coridor and saw 2 gnolls walking down the hall with 
          shining swords in their belts, talking to each other in their wolfish 
          speech. They were much taller and darker of fur than the other gnolls, 
          they were high ranking commanders. By the way they held themselves with 
          there slight arrogance in their step, and proud visage, he could tell 
          that they considered themselves good fighters, and he should be warry 
          of them. By their relitive size and the way they walked, he could also 
          tell they would be much harder to fight than the guardsmen he faught 
          at the gate. He held his breath, for it was his personal experiance 
          that higher gnolls had better sences than lower gnolls, and these were 
          very high. "If I could get them into a wider area, I could easily take 
          care of them both. In these condifed spaces, they have the upper hand 
          with their swords. I just hope they don't see..... BLAST!!!!" They had 
          smelled him, despite his stealth of sight and sound, there is no way 
          to cover up smell, even in these musty halls. Both gnolls had drawn 
          their swords and were about to call for others to come. Orion knew that 
          if they yelled, more wuold come and he would be outnumbered. He let 
          loos his grip on the beem and fell from the ceiling. As he fell, he 
          kicked out his foot and hit the taller gnoll in the face before it could 
          say anything. Orion stepped donw onto the floor just as the other gnoll 
          was swinging his sword at him. Thoughtlessly, smoothly, Orion stepped 
          back out of the way of the swinging steel, stepped forward again and 
          let loose a flurry of concusive force punches, about five of them in 
          a matter of two seconds. Before the gnoll could get off another swing 
          of his sword, he was dead, knocked into oblivion by the fury of the 
          inspired young monk. Praying to Quellios that what had just happened 
          had not attracted the attention of the other gnoll commanders, Orion 
          was about to take another step down the corridor, when suddenly, all 
          the doors in the hall oppened and out stepped over a dozen gnoll comanders. 
          Orion cursed under his breath and turned on his heals to run the other 
          way, but as he turned, a dozen more gnolls appeared in the hall in front 
          of him. He knew that gnolls did not usually take prisoners, they just 
          killed anyone they saw. So, Orion, gathering his wits and all his power 
          about him, took a deep breath, and did the only thing he had left to 
          do, fight his way out! He ran back down the corridor he had come in 
          from, straight for the advancing gnolls, and jumped, 10 feet into the 
          air over the heads of all the dogs slashing at him with their spears 
          and swords. He landed smoothly on his feet far behind them, leaving 
          them as well as himself surprised at what he had just done, and ran 
          into the main hall, the heart of BlackBurrow. He ran into the middle 
          of the most open area he could find and turned to fight the advancing 
          gnolls running fiercely behind him. They were about to all attack him 
          at once, when suddenly they all stopped. They grew quiet and parted 
          around a rather large gnoll, infact, a very large gnoll; THE gnoll! 
          This was the one Orion had been looking for, the gnoll who lead the 
          attack on Qeynos, the same bastard dog that slaughtered Meridith! The 
          leader of the gnolls in BlackBurrow. </p>
        <p class="whitetext9"> The gnoll yelled out a great bellow, and on command, 
          the gnolls formed a circle around Orion. This gnoll wanted to make sport 
          of the human who had so valiantly penetraited his lair. He called for 
          an other large gnoll, probably his second in command, gave him a long 
          spear, and sent him out in the middle of the circle with Orion. The 
          gnoll suddenly lunged forward with the spear. Orion knew that he had 
          no time for stealth, no time for honor or for restraint. This was a 
          time for pure, unbridled rage. A fire burned in Orion's eyes, and he 
          blocked the spear with his right arm, stepped up, and kicked with his 
          left leg. At the same time, he chopped the gnolls wrist, which caused 
          the hand to let go the spear. Orion held the spear in his hands, and 
          letting loose his rage, broke it in half and pummeled the yaulping gnoll 
          unrelentlessly. The gnoll was dead, covered in blood and pockmarked 
          full of holes. This greatly angered the head gnoll, and he sent in three 
          more of his underlings. Within moments, all three were dead. Then, all 
          the lesser gnolls in the circle attacked at once. Giving in to the fighting 
          spirit within himself, Orion seemed to move with a magical speed. He 
          attacked every single gnoll untill they were disabled in a matter of 
          seconds, his hands a mere blur, he attacked with an unnatural speed. 
          He jumped, turned over in the air, landed on his right hand, and let 
          loose a barrage of kicks so powerful, that each one went right through 
          the armor the gnolls were wearing as if it was not even there. Now, 
          the head gnoll was enraged, he stopped the attack by his underlings 
          and pulled out his sword. To the surprise of Orion and indeed the other 
          gnolls he spoke in the common language "I will deel with this human 
          myself!" </p>
        <p class="whitetext9">Orion stood up defiantly, this was the moment he 
          had prepaired himself for. The head gnoll walked up to Orion, stopped, 
          and spoke to him in a very deep and muffled voice, but his words would 
          still be heard. "You have done well, human, I am indeed impressed. It 
          is not every warrior that can hold up against so many of my finest fighters 
          with hardly a scratch. I commend you." "Orion holding back his urge 
          to rush forward and kill the foul beast on sight, said, "I am no warrior, 
          I am Orion, devout Monk of the Silent Fist, and follower of the Tranquil. 
          My mission here is to kill you. And by Quellios, you bastard slime, 
          I will kill you! You WILL suffer for the death of my love!!" Orion was 
          so worked up that tears started to well in his eyes. But they were quickly 
          washed away by the fire that now burned in his heart. The gnoll's face 
          became wicked as a toothy smile spread over it. "So, that is why you 
          are here, you plan to kill me and avenge the death of some girl? Please, 
          you will have to exuse my absent mind, but I have killed so very many 
          human girls that I seem to forget most of them. Would you remind me 
          exactly WHICH girl this was and when?" This only enraged Orion even 
          more, but he still held back the urge to kill the mocking gnoll before 
          him. He knew that an angry fight is a clumsy fight. "Three days ago, 
          you and your men.....dogs, attacked the city of Qeynos. I saw you during 
          the battle, surrounded by your minions while you ran a poor girl through. 
          her name was Meridith, and she and I were to be wed!" Orion's words 
          did not effect the big gnoll at all, and he simply said, "Oh yes, her, 
          the peasent girl who was thrown out of the city gates durring all that 
          commotion. You should be greatful that I killed her there, usually I 
          take them with me and kill them slowly. That is, of course, after I 
          have had my way with them!" With this, the gnoll raised his sword and 
          rushed at the angered monk. This was the moment Orion had been waiting 
          for. </p>
        <p class="whitetext9"> Burning with a fire the likes of which he had never 
          felt before, Orion dodged and ducked past every swing the master gnoll 
          swung at him. It was taking all he had just to keep from loosing his 
          head. "Now I know why he is the master gnoll, I would have had an easier 
          time fighting the rest of his underlings!" The sword swung at Orion's 
          head, he ducked, but just barely, he felt the cold steal graze upon 
          his hair, and cut some off. He did not have time to counter strike, 
          the gnoll was so much faster than any other he had faught. All he could 
          to fo rnow was try to stay in one peice and wait for a moment when his 
          enemy was open for attack. That moment came sooner than Orion thought 
          it would, as the blade passed by his torso, it left the gnoll's back 
          open for attack, not close enough to punch or strike, and not enough 
          room to do a flying kick, the just tried to roundkick the gnoll's back. 
          It worked, and the gnoll yaulped and recoiled. Orion was holding back 
          screaming out in pain, kicking that monster was like kicking a brick 
          wall, exept when Orion kickes a brick wall, it usually breaks! Distracted 
          by his pain, the gnoll strunk him with the back of his sword and sent 
          him flying into the rock wall. This knocked the wind out of him, and 
          he fell to the floor gasping for air. The gnoll, seeing that he had 
          scorred a winning blow, walked over to his fallen opponent, reached 
          down and picked him up by the throat. "Now, filthy human, you will share 
          the same fate of your beloved Meridith" Squeezing Orion's neck harder 
          and stopping his breathing, the big gnoll touched the tip of his sword 
          to his chest. All of the sudden, memories of Meridith filled Orion's 
          mind, walks along the ocean side, talks of having children and what 
          they would look like. Nights of music and dancing at her father's inn. 
          A warm bed, and her beuatiful face smiling at him in the lamplight. 
          Her sweet voice, like music, whispering in his ear. Then, thoughts of 
          her being run threw by the cold steel of the gnoll who held him by the 
          neck now. His anger swelled, and he felt within himself a new strength, 
          as if Quellios herself had granted him her very power. "NO!!!!" With 
          seemingly superhuman strength, Orion reached up, took hold of the big 
          gnoll's arm, and crushed it, crushed it until the bone had turned to 
          dust. The gnoll howled in pain and let go. Filled with a power bordering 
          on the magical, the jumped up, and kicked the gnoll's head three times. 
          He landed, grabbed the vile moster by the throat, and punched him in 
          the chest as hard and as fast as he could, again, and agian, and again! 
          Blows that would have gone through stone, one after the other. He kicked 
          the gnoll's knee and sent him to the ground, cowering on his knees. 
          Terified, the gnoll said in a strained voice filled with pain and suffering, 
          "Please, have mercy, oh mighty Monk of Quellios. PLEASE!!!" Orion, knowing 
          that any mercy he could show to this creature wuold just be a quicker 
          death said,"You don't are not deserving of my mercy!" He slowly raised 
          his hand above his head, and sent it slamming down into the gnoll's 
          heart. The gnoll spat blood, a lot of blood. and died. He let go of 
          the gnoll's arm and stood up. Looking down, he brought his hands together 
          in front of his chest in the honerary fasion of the Monks of Norath, 
          and bowed. </p>
