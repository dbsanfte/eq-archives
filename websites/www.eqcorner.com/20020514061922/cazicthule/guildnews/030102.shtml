              Well, we had slightly more success today than yesterday ;) 
            <p>First off we went back to DN to finish something we left yesterday... 
            </p>
            <p>Zlandicar &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Rivervale! </p>
            <p>Grats to Hoen on ST key, Kiviran on Heart, Torut on First Brood

            <p>Grats Cyule from Unseen Hand on Frakadars Talisman, and a happy 
              SK in Unseen Hand on Massive Shard ;) </p>
            <p>And thanks to Unseen Hand for tagging along, good show ;) </p>
            <p>After that wee bundle of joy, we swooped over ST for some nameds 
              ;) </p>
            <p>We had 1 warrior, 1 rogue, 2 bards, a ranger and a monk, 3 clerics, 
              2 shamans, 1 wizard and a chanter, so not the best turnout, but 
              still got the job done ;) </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Grats Wulane on Primal Spear ;) </p>

              I am not going to say it out loud, because it was simply too embarassing... 
              :p </p>
            <p>Dont even ask... </p>
            <p>Wee sidenote, Grats Stibitz on Willsapper. ;) <br>

              Project EON &amp; Anavon were a little low on numbers,so we invited 
              a couple of NoN groups <br>
              Result was, Cazic-Thule === &gt; Rivervale.. His head is still MIA.. 
              maybe we lost it when we removed his brain.. </p>

              Magi P'Tasa Destroyed <br>
              Posted by Agilent On Feb 26 2002 At 05:02:47 AM <br>
              Just so happens Magi P'Tasa was up in Hate tonight so we sent a 
              few groups to pay him a visit. Congratulations to Ztalten on his 
              Staff of Elemental Mastery. Only one more item to go until he gets 
              his epic! We also killed a couple of the Mini bosses just for kicks. 
              Congrats to Marique on his new druid bracer, Gisele on her cleric 
              helm and to everyone else who got drops; especially Drokaten and 
              his phat new robe . </p>

            <p> <b><a href="http://www.crimsontalon.com" target="_top">Crimson 
              Talon</a></b><br>
              FEB 26, 2002<br>
              Grats to Klaminar for obtaining his first epic, Swiftwind! Crimson 
              Talon's 8th epic this year!
            <p>Talendor was happily surveying his territory of wurm-infested lava 
              calderas of Skyfire, when Crimson Talon decided to do some landscaping. 
              We sent Devaberiel out to pull the beast to our trap, and slayed 
              him losing only a couple people to the DoT not being dispelled in 
              time. Brewall was a little dissapointed anyone died, but there is 
              no greater glory than being slain by a dragon. Drops were Burnt 
              Book [Chadmoe], Gauntlets of Firey Might [Ippit], and about six 
              spells.</p>
            <p>FEB 22, 2002 <br>
              Congrats to Gilthanus for obtaining his first epic, Swiftwind!</p>
            <p>FEB 21, 2002<br>
              Spawned Faydedar this evening and cut him into some nice dragonfish 
              steaks so Yazz could finish his epic. Venril Sathir was up as well, 
              so we killed him to get Wiz epic staff, shaman legs, and a cleric 
              weapon. From there, we moved on to kill mob for enchanter epic. 
              Overall, a very good epic night. Congrats to Yazz for obtaining 
              the Nature Walkers Scimitar!<br>

              WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PALLY/SK WEAPONS! - Xate (3/1/2002) <br>
              In what turned out to be the most fun encounter I've had in awhile, 
              the Shei Vinitras script decided to work as it was intended. </p>
            <p>Not only was I saddened when the loot was discovered and there 
              were NO palladin / shadow knight 2 handed weapons, but so were all 
              the casters who had logged their sk/pally twinks at the zone in, 
              only to find out that they had wasted time running them over :-(. 
            </p>
            <p>I guess tomorrow when we hit up Ssraezha we'll get back on track 
              with the ph4t sk/pally 2handers! Raath and Ghuandan can hardly wait.<p>
              More snakes... - Zippo (2/28/2002) <br>
              Dropped Arch Lich again tonight, few pretty shitty attempts, but 
              got him flawlessly on last attempt. After that moved to Creator 
              and dropped him with 2 deaths, GOTTA LOVE MAGE ONLY AND PAL ONLY 
              WEAPONS! THX CREATOR OF CRAPPY LOOT. Only took 1 pic =/</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Fun night<br>
              Tunare = Dead - Merauk (2/26/2002<br>
              Four deaths I think, nuff said.<br>
              <br>
              I am not a beta tester - ShadeStorm<br>
              Because I sure felt like one when we killed 3 Rune Covered snakes. 
              None gave any loot, hell everytime we killed one, another one would 
              spawn. Can we fix this zone once and for all Verant?<br>
              <br>
              Koolaid to the rescue - Merauk<br>
              Xate heard the Emperor was dying of thirst, so he broke on through 
              the wall and gave him a big Kool Aid hug.</p>

            <p>HZ and OGS together went to Temple of Veeshan, Halls of Testing 
              this past weekend in hopes of upgrading everyone's armor drops. 
              I am happy to announce that we did succeed two out of the three 
              nights that we were there. This zone is becoming very popular and 
              it was hard to get a spot to conduct a full raid. But we did mangage 
              to walk away the first night with several nice items for HZ. These 
              items were awarded to the following people:</p>
            <p>Tattered Silk Crown - Tayzia<br>
              Tattered Slik Gloves - Tayzia<br>
              Leather Arms - Clik<br>
              Chain Tunic - Fiver</p>
            <p>Congratulations! Saturday night we were not as fortunate. We ended 
              the raid early that night and didn't get any drops either. Sunday 
              Night we went in there and had a much more productive night. These 
              items were awarded to the following people on Sunday night:</p>
            <p>Chain Boots - Rivka<br>
              Plate Breastplate - Kharmen<br>
              Leather Bracer - Morts<br>
              Leather Gloves - Jasaine<br>
              Plate boots - Faerus</p>
            <p>Overall the drops were lower than the first trip there. HZ is going 
              to concentrate on higher levels, and epic hunts over the next few 
              weeks, so when we go back to ToV, it will be with a vengeance!<br>

              DN.......why oh why <br>
              We moved to DN late night to kill Zlandicar, but wanted to make 
              a left turn and kill Vaniki fast..........bad pull and mass adds 
              resulted in a 2 hour cr. Good work keeping morale up and grats Anavon

              VI patch hell <br>
              Again, again, patch gone wrong. We were heading for Derakor the 
              Vindicator and Statue of Rallos Zek monday after patch, but no. 
              Half our crew couldn't log in, the other half were playing on 30 
              secs delay, and servers were taken down again for emergency maintenance. 
              Yay. <br>

              Posted By: Krak Kyllz on 27 February 2002</p>
            <p>Been a few days since the last news post so here goes.<br>
              Monday we battled with the login server after sitting around waiting 
              for the post patch server down time. When some people finally logged 
              in some stuff died. Some of these mobs were in Sleepers Tomb and 
              had Primal. Gratz to Crestfallen (who now looks even more like a 
              ranger), Duron, and Coldar on their primal weapons.</p>
            <p>Tuesday went a little better since the servers were a bit more 
              cooperative. Tormax went down thanks to the amassed healing power 
              of our shaman corps. Gratz Hierl on a white dragonscale sash, eti 
              on getting head, and shizda on the crown of the kromzek kings.</p>
            <p>Next Tunare went down, which meant pog had to be cleared. Most 
              of this was done by 14 people and only 2 clerics, nice work guys. 
              Gratz twinks and people missing kael armor on their POG armor drops. 
              Tunare2.0 went down without a hitch gratz Thornsong on his Golden 
              Leaf Earring.</p>
            <p>After Tunare we made a fast trip to visit the rhags in ssra temple. 
              Snakes died, people got loot, people got spells, nuff said.</p>
            <p>To finish the night off the guild went to the Halls of Testing 
              and power leveled Dozikar. Gratz everyone on looting their own corpses.<br>

              Here We Are, Born To Be Kings....<br>
              NICE couple days.<br>
              Moved in yesterday to take a look at the new Thought Horror Overfiend. 
              The THO now sports VI's trendy new idea to make life hard, the ROOT. 
              Ah well....dumb ideas are meant to be overcome, and overcome they 
              were. The new, faster respawn time on the elders really makes sure 
              to keep the pace moving and keep the blood pumping. Seeying 5 and 
              6 and sometimes even 7 or more of these things in the camp made 
              for a whole heap of chaotic fun. Add our mass charging to positions 
              that we really couldn't stop in...what ya had was a fight that we 
              made up as we went. Was heavily fun. When the smoke cleared, the 
              overfiend called for momma and ran screamin.</p>
            <p>Then tonight we set our sites on a mob that has yet to die on our 
              server, the Burrower Parasite. How did it go? But for Darious, who 
              is pretty convinced we are always going to die (well, at least him), 
              we knew we had the stuff to take this encounter, and we showed it 
              nicely. Worm -&gt; Freeport. The THO dropped a nice belt and the 
              worm dropped a FT3 range item, and NEITHER one had a pony! What 
              gives?<br>

              Hello There Ladies And Gentlemen......Hello There Ladies And Gents<br>
              Greetings programs!<br>
              I have had a movie stuck in my head this week. That movie is Tron. 
              WHY would Tron be stuck in my head? As is often the case, one silly 
              little line. It's the last line Sark says to the captured programs 
              before they are lead away to play in the game grid. &quot;Failure 
              to comply will result in the standard 'sub standard' treatment which 
              will result in you eventual deresolution&quot;. Or at least, that 
              is how I remember the line. Why is this line stuck in my head? Because 
              I am constantly dealing with a company that is pushing the envelope 
              and redefining &quot;Standard 'sub standard' treatment&quot;. If 
              slow response, inflexible application of vague guidelines, and ransoming 
              reasonable service for usurious rates were an olympic medal sport? 
              Ok, the French judge would have scored it differently, but VI would 
              be walking away with all the medals.</p>
            <p>
              In regular news...in the past week we cleared NToV and took a swing 
              at the &quot;Ring of Vulak&quot; encounter. The fight was pretty 
              hectic and lots of fun. We didn't come out on top, but have some 
              good ideas for our next time through. We took a swing by Kael and 
              met up with the Avatar of War. Lag was a bit harsh, and he got away. 
              We stopped by SSra, VP, Seb....hell we went everywhere this week. 
              After all my time in this game, I was getting jaded about ever seeing 
              anything really different...well, here's an image I call &quot;When 
              different strikes!&quot;<br>
              And one last thing....</p>
            <p>I give up. Weeks and weeeks of tryin to get every &quot;oh, I might 
              use this one day&quot; item OUT of my bank and IN to EC to grow 
              the &quot;Kyrthor pony fund&quot; nest egg. I concede, you bastages 
              in EC are too damn cheap for me. So now, I am selling endorsements! 
              Toss me 10k and I will intersperse some in the news for you. I came 
              up with the idea as I was taking a trip on Thund airlines. Ya know, 
              that Thund takes such good care of you, you get a full service buffing 
              and he STILL gets you there on time and for half of what those other 
              'name brand' Druids cost. What a way to fly! (no checks this time, 
              Thund)<br>
