			Two huge events to report today.  The Avatar of Prexus, Lady Damali Arcanus, was coerced by Innoruk into joining the Army of the Dark.  Innoruk kidnapped 
			the last of the kedge, the only living child of Prexus, and threated to kill him if Prexus did not give in to his demands.  Prexus, seeing no other way, oblidged.  Before
			entering the abysmal pit of hell that Innoruk was dragging Prexus into, the Avatar told the council of light that she was depending on them to carry on the fight 
			and to destroy Innoruk so she may return to the light.  The child of Prexus is still being held captive and is closely guarded by Lanys T'Vil, the daughter of Innoruk.<BR>
			<BR>
			The Blood Lord of Hate himself, Quinne Polaris, was taken captive by a small, elite group of the Army of the Light last night that included none other 
			than the Avatar of Mithanel Marr.  Quinne Polairs is being held captive at an undisclosed location.  Intelligence within the Army of the Dark has reported that
			they are mounting forces on the continent of Odus to plan for their next attack.<BR>

			I would have to say that we have seen both some success and failure thus far with this event.  The general consensus has really enjoyed participation. 
			There have been, however, quite a few violations of rules being broken and feelings hurt.  A select group of GM's and officers from the guilds 
			involved are working very, very hard to  iron out all of the wrinkles that we have seen thus far.  We have already seen much improvement between
			the events that transpired on saturday and on sunday.<BR>
			<BR>
			I would like to remind everyone once again that this event is intended to be a mixture of both a roleplaying and PVP event.  The ultimate goal is to promote
			roleplaying of The Rathe server while providing a forum for all of you to meet new people and generally have a lot of fun.  Adherance to the rules and  keeping
			yourself up-to-date on the storyline and events are crucial in order for this event to be succesful.  Again, I greatly appreciate the time, interest, and effort 
			that everyone involved in this event has given.  Have some patience with the coordinators, and we will deliver you a very successful, fun event.<BR>

			My head is still swimming from the sheer volume of tells and tags which I passed out and answered last night. 
			The respone for this event has been far greater than what I had anticipated.  After reading an email from 
			Kathia this morning, it turns out that we are both missing quite a few people still, including Avatars.  I really 
			REALLY want everyone who showed interest to get signed up today.  I will be in North Ro handing out tags today.  It is 
			IMPERATIVE that one of the officers tag you today. <BR>
			<BR>
			The sheer volume of people involved has posed a few problems as far as control of the event.  I will be calling a meeting with 
			the officers and Avatars of both sides to discuss how best to handle this.  There will be ABSOLUTELY no roleplaying at the time of the
			meeting.  This is a very serious matter, and we are scheduled to start the war today, so this must be resolved.<BR>
			<BR>
			The war will begin this evening, after all of the Avatars and Archons have been tagged, as well as many, MANY other people who 
			took the time to send me their information recieve their tags.<BR>
			<BR>
			The Army of the Dark has already begun the trash talking and flexing their puny muscles.  War is eminent...take us to DEFCON 3.<BR>

			Today is the day for the Army of the Light to be officially created!  I will be in the East Commons from about 6pm PST until I can no longer keep my
			eyes open to hand out guild tags.  All Avatars and Archons  will given officer roles, so they will be able to tag you as well.  If there is anyone else that
			you know who would like to be involved in the event, please get them on board immediately, for one the event starts tomorrow, we will not be able 
			to add any new participants to the armies.<BR>
			<BR>
			I believe that all of the Avatars have been assigned.  If you can think of one that was missed, and you have the desire to play the role of that Avatar, 
			please let me know as soon as possible.<BR>

			I spoke with a GM last night on getting the guild created for the event.  Unfortunately, we will have to wait until friday to have that done.  I know 
			that it is cutting it close, but our hands are tied at the moment.  I was kinda left with the impression that Zatozia is the only one who is 
			capable of creating the guilds for us.  I am sure that once friday roles around, Zatozia will act quickly, as she always has, to get us up and running.
			Thank you to all who did seek me out yesterday for your tags.  I am sorry I was unable to give them to you.<BR>
			<BR>
			Based on the encounters that all of you have had with the Army of Innoruk (currently know as The Fallen One), we have gathered quite extensive 
			intelligence on who and what they are.  We have begun to profile many of their members...what are their strengths, their weaknesses... Thank you
			to all of you who have taken the time to email me with this information.  I am sure glad that we are on the same side!!<BR>

			So far, the response for this event has been amazing!  I would like to thank Kathia du Lac and Katinka Lightstrider for all of their
			hard work, as well as each and every one of you for your support.  I would also like to send a VERY special thanks to Zatozia The
			Torturess (pictured below) for having our idea approved with the Verant staff.  I encourage you all, when you see her, to let her
			know how much we appreciate her assistance in all of this.  Hats of to you, Zatozia!!<BR>
			<BR>
			The "Army of the Light" guild was approved this morning by Verant.  It should be created, with any luck, this evening. The "Army of Innoruk" 
			has also been approved.  Kathia and I are feverishly working to prepare for the upcoming event/war, which is scheduled to officially begin 
			this Saturday, December 4th.  Those of you who wish to be inducted into the Army of the Light before saturday, please give me a tell in-game 
			so that I may seek you out and tag you.  It is my hope that this will be a great number of you, so that it will be easier in the future to communicate, 
			as well as plan our strategies, meetings, officers, etc...<BR>
			<BR>
			There has been much interest shown thus far for becoming Avatars, particularly for that of Tunare.  I am leaving it up to the guildmasters to decide 
			what Avatar they will chose to represent, as well as whom is to be the Avatar.  The only two that I am somewhat confident with thus far are Toythunder 
			from the Dragonslayers who has requested to be the Avatar of Errolissi Marr, and Olorin from the Order of Light who has seemed to have chose to become
			the Avatar of Brell.<BR>
			<BR>
			I would like to call one last and final meeting, before we get started on saturday, just to clarify, once again, the rules of the event.  It was brought to
			my attention that people left the meeting monday evening a little confused on what was happeneing.  I would like the GM's for the guilds involved for
			both armies to email me with a time later in the week that they can adhere to.  The official rules will be posted at that time.  There was a lot of debate 
			over a few of them, and I can honestly say that I was not sure if a resolution was ever agreed upon.<BR>
