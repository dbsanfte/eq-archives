		If you are considering taking residence in our hallowed halls and amongst our noble members,
		you must be willing to abide by and protect a series of rules and guidelines.  If you feel that
		the responsibilty to uphold our laws may be too much of a burden, or if you find them to be
		far too stringent for your tastes, then we wish you well in your search for a guild that will
		suit you.  Be warned that violation of these laws is a serious offense by the council and members
		of the Order of Polaris.  These laws must not be taken lightly...

				<LI>There will be no in-guild dueling, unless it is sparring or an officer/guild leader approved event.
				<LI>Players in the guild may have no more than two charecters in the guild.  For a guild function, the players primary charecter is to attend, unless otherwise specified.
				<LI>Guild meetings/events are mandatory.  We are not, however, unsympathetic to RL issues.  If you cannot attend a guild event/meeting, you can be excused if you send a message (email) to the guild leader, stating the reason for the absence.
				<LI>Any disputes in the guild must go through an officer first.  If the dispute is with an officer, however, the guild leader should be contacted as soon as possible.
				<LI>No officer shall disband from the guild without the approval of the guild leader.
				<LI>No one shall be forcibly removed from the guild without A) a majority vote of 2/3 B) a trial C) except when other guild laws override this one.
				<LI>Treason and sharing guild information is grounds for immediate dismissal from the guild upon receipt of concrete evidence proving the act.  Any officer is empowered to do the dismissal, but the guild leader must be provided with the evidence beforehand.
				<LI>Guild members shall pass down their equipment to lower level members first before attempting to sell.
				<LI>Guild members that have a trade skill may sell to guild members, but only at the cost of the materials used.
				<LI>Members may not charge anyone for buffs, heals, etc...  Donations, however, may be accepted.
				<LI>In the absence of the guild leader (offical absence), the guild shall fall back to a council style of leadership.  In this case, a 51% or better vote of the council is required to make decisions.  In the event of a split, the most senior guild member online shall cast the deciding vote.  <I> NOTE: No guild laws can be altered or bent by the council, except in EXTREME emergencies.  Council refers to all officers, online or not.</I>
				<LI>No officer shall openly provoke, verbally attack, or disrespect another.  If a decision, action, or behavior is questioned, the matter should be immediately and privately brought to the attention of the guild leader.
				<LI>No guildmember shall ever show sincere disrespect for an officer or the guild leader.
				<LI>Any breach of these laws will cary with it a punishment deemed appropriate by the guild leader and his officers.

				<LI>All members are expected to play in-charecyer, whenever possible, unless using the /ooc command.
				<LI>Memebers are expected to refrain from using profanity, especially outside /groupsay or /guildsay.  (ie, anyone outside our group should not hear someone from OoP yelling out profanity.)
				<LI>Members are expected to not commit senseless acts of murder of any NPC that is not considered to be a threat.
				<LI>Members are expected to pay homage to their deity, unless agnostic, for no less than one hour per year, Norrath time.  A religious retreat could be taken to fufill this requirement.
				<LI>Members are expected to assist, whenevr possible, any charecter that is in need of assistance or in a life-threatening situation.
				<LI>Members are expected to participate in a trade or skill that will benefit the guild in some way.  This includes languages and brewing, and should be roleplayed.
				<LI>Members are expected to show the appropriate amount of respect towards other players, other Members and Guild Officers and Master.  This means /bow /wave /kneel or /hug (if this is your way and is appropriate to the situation.)
				<LI>Members are encouraged to group with non-OoP guildmembers from time to time to build repoire and kinship between us and other guilds.  They should also read other guild's messageboards for information that could be both useful and entertaining (ie, a guild event we might want to attend).  Members are also expected to read and post to OUR messageboard from time to time, if not daily.
				<LI>Each member should make a contribution (ie, weapons, armor, money) to our guild treasury/armory.  This does not have to be a set item or amount of money...whatever the charecter can afford, or is reasonably able to obtain.
				<LI>No member shall twink ANY charecter, either their own or someone else's, to a ridiculous point. (ie, a level 10 warrior in full rubicite.)
				<LI>Members are expected to seek out and obtain an apprentice, preferably of the same class, once reaching lvl 25 and no later than lvl 30.  This apprentice will be inducted into the guild only when the member and the guild master feel he/she is ready to join our family and has acquired the appropriate amount of knowledge.
