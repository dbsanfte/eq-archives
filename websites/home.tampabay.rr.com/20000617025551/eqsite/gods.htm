<p>According to an early chat with the EQ design team on EFnet, the choice of worship<strong>
<font color="#FF0000"><em>will</em> </font></strong>influence gameplay.&nbsp; In practice,
this is reflected by the inherent Factions of the game, the intricate web of NPC's who
judge a character initially by their race and profession, and continuously judge a
character by their ongoing actions.&nbsp; Tread carefully.<br>
<br>
The history of Norrath tells of the great dragons, great godlike beings who were among the
first races. Consider this quote from the history, which describes the rulership of the
Plane of Sky by <font color="#FF0000"><em><strong>Veeshan:</strong></em></font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>It is said that thousands of years ago the world known as Norrath was
  &quot;noticed&quot; by Veeshan, the great Crystalline Dragon who rules the Plane of Sky.
  Pleased with the conditions on Norrath , Veeshan deposited her brood onto the frozen
  continent of Velious. Then, with one swipe of her mighty claws, Veeshan opened several
  great wounds on the surface of Norrath, thus staking her claim to this promising new
  world.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is also the Plane of Underfoot, which is ruled by <em><strong><font
color="#FF0000">Brell Serilis, Duke of Underfoot</font>, </strong></em>who used a magical
portal to bridge the mystical gap between Norrath's underground expanses and his home
plane. Through this magical gate, he begat the underdwelling races and creatures that call
the darkness their homes. It is a commonly told tavern tale that the magical gate might
still exist, protected by a labyrinth or Living Stone...</p>

<p>Other <em>Planes of Power &amp; Influence</em> exist, and thus far we have been
enlightened as to the existence of these beings: 

<ul>
  <li><font color="#FF0000"><em><strong>Innoruuk, Prince of Hate</strong></em></font>, who
    rules a dark, cruel, dangerous kingdom of the Plane of Hate. He is accredited with (or
    blamed for) the creation of the Dark Elves.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#FF0000"><em><strong>Fennin Ro, Tyrant of Fire</strong></em></font>, who
    rules the plane of Fire, which is the blackened, burning home of the fire elementals and
    other fiery denizens.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#FF0000"><em><strong>Solusek Ro</strong></em></font>, the son of Fennin Ro,
    who rules the Plane of Flames. It is not known whether this being is merely a
    &quot;demigod&quot; or how much influence over the domain of heat can be called his own.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#FF0000"><em><strong>Brell Serilis, Duke of Underfoot</strong></em></font>,
    who is credited with creating all underground dwelling races, such as the Dwarves and
    Gnomes. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#FF0000"><em><strong>Rallos Zek, the Warlord</strong></em></font>, whose
    Plane of War is in constant flux, reflecting the eternal battles being waged. His
    attributes include jet black skin, &quot;lava-like&quot; bulging veins, and the iron
    fisted rulership of a tyrant of the battlefield.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><em><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Bristlebane, King of Thieves</strong></font>, </em>whose
    free-spirited followers strive for the witty mischief that their deity embodies. &nbsp;
    Bards, jesters, individualistic gypsies, and many other festive folk emulate Bristlebane's
    pranks and antics.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><em><strong><font color="#FF0000">Cazic-Thule, the Faceless</font>,</strong></em> who
    exists only for to inflict horror, misery, fear, and torturous violence, destroying hope.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><em><strong><font color="#FF0000">Karana, the Rainkeeper</font>,</strong></em> whose
    followers respect the might of the storm, from both the nourishing rain to the destructive
    sandstorm.&nbsp; Many are nomadic, following the winds, besides the settled ranchers and
    farmers.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><em><strong><font color="#FF0000">Erollisi Marr, the Queen of Love</font>, </strong></em>whose
    worshippers are devoted to the passion of love, but who are more than willing to die to
    defend those places, people, and ideals which they so dearly love if the need arises.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><em><strong><font color="#FF0000">Rodcet Nife, the Prime Healer</font>,</strong></em>
    instills humility and kindness in his followers, who seek to combat disease and death at
    all costs.&nbsp; The symptom is not merely to be treated; they seek to eliminate the cause
    of an outbreak.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><em><strong><font color="#FF0000">Prexus, the Oceanlord</font>,</strong></em> whose
    followers feel an affinity for being near large bodies of water, such as many sailors and
    fisherman&nbsp; They believe that the powerful ocean once spawned all life and that one
    day it will re-take its creations.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><em><strong><font color="#FF0000">Quellious, the Tranquil</font>, </strong></em>whose
    enlightened followers seek internal peace, often living nomadically to better learn of the
    world and thus themselves.&nbsp; Many a monk walks the path of Quellious.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><em><strong><font color="#FF0000">Tarew Marr</font>,</strong></em> one of the three
    Lords of the Plane of Water, of which little is known.&nbsp; He apparently is connected to
    Erollisi Marr and to Mithaniel Marr in some debated manner.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#FF0000"><em><strong>Mithaniel Marr, the Lightbringer</strong></em></font>,
    brother to Erollisi Marr. Many Paladins follow Mithaniel, who personifies the ascension of
    &quot;Good&quot; and the absolute destruction of &quot;Evil.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#FF0000"><strong><em>Bertoxxulous, the Plagebringer</em></strong></font>,
    whose followers often include Necromancers, and who embodies the spread of death, decay,
    and disease to the lands of Norrath.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#FF0000"><em><strong>Tunare, the Mother of All</strong></em></font>, who is
    believed to have been created by the living entity of Norrath by her followers, and who in
    turn created all of them.&nbsp; Many Elves, Druids, and Rangers follow this deity.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#FF0000"><strong><em>The Tribunal, the Six Hammers</em></strong></font>, a
    beloved deity of the hardy Barbarians, and the embodiment of Justice.&nbsp; The followers
    of the Tribunal are sometimes seen as mercenaries, because they follow no court's
    decisions, but the words of the Tribunal in the dispensing of Justice.</li>
</ul>
