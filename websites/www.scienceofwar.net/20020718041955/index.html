The bard epic (like most epics) represents hours and hours of questing. It's a huge piece of work. Actus has just ONE fight left in his epic (the spawned Trakanon) and was performing a pre-final hand-in when disaster struck -- <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forums/showthread.php?threadid=883">he lost it all</a>. Those who helped Actus with his epic fights are encouraged to <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forums/showthread.php?threadid=884">submit testimonials, emails and petitions</a> to the effect of, "Yo -- this guy's legit -- I've watched him work on his epic for months now. He's honest. He did the quest. Please just give him his stuff back." Put it in your own words, please. Say something original and (hopefully) moving.

After overcoming a number of minor of technical glitches that spell death on a mob like Venril Sathir, we finally triumphed, earning us a spot at Tier One on the Legends ladder. This is only the first step and there are 7 more tiers to go, but we did it on our own terms -- by never giving up on our very high standards for what it means to be a guildmember of Science of War. We did more with less and we'll continue to keep moving up the ladder.</P>

<p>We also gave Tier Two (Zlandicar clone) a shot with our new and improved AE DR resist song, but it seems we experienced a wraparound effect -- most participants report being feared / dotted much more frequently at 350~ MR / DR than they were at 240 MR / DR (our previous attempt). We're scheduling our next tier trial (versus the Statue of Rallos Zek - Tier 3) a week from now.</p>

<p>Many thanks to the SoW guildmembers who made the trial a success: [Tue Jul 09 21:00:18 2002] Channel sowtt(21) members: *Vova, Loathexx, Uhnak, Actease, Koichi, Boond, Ladred, Quiksand, Shroomio, Keisha, Craniul, Mymic, Ordieth, Srob, Leatherneck, Talicat, Redsin, Zabanily, Resolute.<br>

Because raiding Hate-plane with 20-odd people you don't know (joint-raid) isn't difficult enough, we decided to zone in at the same time as an open raid, just to keep everyone on their toes. We lived JUST long enough to regret that decision. Once we escaped the choo-choo trains making regular stops at the zone-in and "safe" spots, we really got into a groove and tore up the first floor's mini-bosses including a brand new mob for a Legends-only <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/ranger/showthread.php?s=&postid=68153#post68153">Jaggedpine Quest</a>. We obtained epic parts for the Mage, Warrior and Rogue epics and a number of drops rotted. Oh, and a bard got jiggy with a spoon of mayo and a disembodied hand...<br>

Members should read <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forums/showthread.php?s=&threadid=318">this thread</a> and <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forums/showthread.php?s=&threadid=503">this thread</a> in preparation for the raid.</p>


<p><b>Verant Impliments Name-Change Service</b><br>
As you probably know by now, Verant has <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=1521">done a 180</a> by implimenting a <a href="https://store.station.sony.com/eq_char_renames/">name-change service</a>. For $50, regular server players can change their name, while it's going to be free to Stormhammer folks. Predictably, this had much of the EQ community up in arms. Here's a <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=4354">question-and-response</a> that gets to the heart of the issue. Still, this is going to hurt Stormhammer. Why pay $50 for a name change when you can pay $40 and enjoy a month of Gold-server goodness, get a name change, learn to play your ebayed toon, and THEN go back to your old server? This is only going to increase Stormhammer churn and increase the number of undesirables that come to the server for illicit purposes. I feel for guilds that invite people based on level and gear alone -- this is going to bring a whole new slew of seedy players into their rosters.</P>

<ol><li>Make sure that your entry on the guild roster table is up-to-date. If it's not, post a response to the <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forums/forumdisplay.php?s=&forumid=13">guild roster</a> so that those responsible can make changes.
<li>Make sure that you are keeping your Magelo profiles up-to-date. If you don't see your name linked to a Magelo profile in the <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forums/forumdisplay.php?s=&forumid=13">guild roster</a> then please post to the roster forum with your magelo links. At a minimum, please try to have a resist profile and an xp profile. For bonus points, you can make a wish list profile.
<li>Please make sure you <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forums/forumdisplay.php?s=&forumid=15">read and give feedback on prospective guild members</a>.
<li>Get your extra spells and Gems and Items to Shads for the <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forums/forumdisplay.php?s=&forumid=12">guild bank</a>. Please only do this if you feel completely comfortable with having a gnome oversee our assets.
<li>Make sure that all guilded toons that you control are meeting the <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forums/showthread.php?s=&threadid=99">level requirement calendar</a>. If your alt can't keep up, then guildremove him and concentrate on your main (be sure to let the roster folks know of changes like this).

Second, new and old guild members alike should check the <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forums/showthread.php?s=&threadid=418">member to-do list</a>. There are a number of items that require the attention of every guild member, not least of which is <b>recruiting</b>.</p>

<p><b>Recruiting Update</b><br>
We've got about twice as many applications as we have open remaining slots for the month of June, and we're only three days into the month. Applicants are asked to please make an effort to group with us in xp groups and to attend our raids whenever possible. Applicant status is listed <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forums/showthread.php?s=&threadid=82">here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Hail, Ithiosar the Black</b><br>
Many in the guild -- indeed, <a href="http://pub116.ezboard.com/flegends11114frm1.showMessage?topicID=548.topic">many on the server</a> -- participated in an awesome GM event. Here's a <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/images/20020603_ithiosar_montage.jpg">photo montage</a> of some of what went on. I need someone to post a picture of the dragon to our forums so that I can add that to this update. Basically, here's what went down: GMs spawned a big mean dragon as the finale to a series of events that had been occurring for a couple of weeks. This dragon was red to level 60 and was situated in a cave in the Swamp of No Hope and was surrounded by level 50 drakes, level 55 and 56 black ravagers and level 60 guardian drakes.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.scienceofwar.net/images/20020603_have_fun_vedan.gif"></p>

<p>We assembled a very large pick-up and cross-guild force and managed to drop (Ithiosar the Fallen) who upon death spawned yet another (also red to level 60) dragon named Ithiosar the Black. Ithiosar the black quadded for nearly 900 and had an AE breath that dotted players for eight game hours at 100hp/tick. He could not be slowed and had a TON of hitpoints.  Needless to say, in our weakened state after Ithiosar the Fallen, he wiped us out. The open raid lost about 60 people to attrition because of the late hour and because of demoralization, so Township Rebellion came in to give it a shot -- with 25 people. They were wiped out on the first attempt (they got him to about 80 percent). They called in the rest of the guild (bringing their number to just under 50 players) and with the help of the remaining 25 pick-up participants, they wiped again. The dragon then despawned. </p>

<p>Players will be gathering at 8.00pm ET on Monday, June 03 for another attempt at Ithiosar, if he can be respawned.</p>

<p>In what (I believe) was a significant milestone for the guild, we keel-hauled that great big named Turtle in Iceclad. The challenge with Lodizal is finding him up and getting to him fast, then fending off the inevitable KS attempts. Lodizal dropped two Knotted Turtlebone Rings (AC 5, STR 3, HP 25, MANA 35, Effect: Enduring breath) -- one each for Dhyna and for Growller -- Cannibalize IV (shm) for the guild bank, Focus of Spirit (shm) for the guild bank, Composition of Ervaj (brd) for Devendar, Monster Summoning 3 (mag) for the guild bank, the quest piece of Lodizal's shield for Elim, and the quest piece for the Eyepatch of Plunder for Growller.</p>

<p>Guild members can and should read and comment on the <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forums/showthread.php?s=&threadid=301">Lodizal post mortem</a>.</p>
