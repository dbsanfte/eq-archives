<h3 class="title">Fire, Fire! Everything but Fennin Ro Downed</h3>

<P>The debate about skill versus gear in Everquest has run long and will never be settled, and the fact that undergeared but <A HREF="http://www.scienceofwar.net">skilled players</A> can handle content that their better-geared peers cannot speaks well for the design of this game. Skill, raid discipline, ability, and training go a <I>long</I> way in mitigating the lack of gear. Of course, there wouldn't be much of a carrot if gear and experience didn't also play a very important part in guild success. The designers have struck an excellent balance between the two poles. Guilds that have never farmed VT are able to fight their way into the Elemental Planes with lots of determination and skill, while guilds with far better gear fail in the same encounters. Add another bit of <A HREF="http://www.scienceofwar.net/images/20030626_azazele.jpg">anecdotal evidence</A> to this tale of exceptional game balance. Makes you go, "omgwtf."</P><P>I've also included some of the obligatory kill shots of fire minis. We've now killed every mini in fire (most of them twice) and gotten some <A HREF="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=17">wonderful upgrades</A> in the process. It's widely known that the fire minis were made much more difficult recently. It's encouraging that we dropped six out of seven of them on our first attempt. Fennin Ro dies soon. Oh hey ... did you see the picture of Resolute at the SF fan faire? More smokin' than Blazzax. <P>And finally, <I>thank the lawd for legends service</I>! On a recent backflagging, Agnarr's corpse poofed to zone-in seconds after we killed him. I petitioned, and a GM answered less than four minutes later. It turns out the corpse had poofed to just above the zone-in stairs. Sensing an opportunity, an enterprising young ninja immediately trained zone-in with approximately six giants. I was killed quickly, and <A HREF="http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=6512">Crystallized Rain</A> was ninja-looted before the GM could 100-percent rez me back to the corpse. Immediately, Tilol was on the case: <BR><P><B><TT>[Wed Jun 25 21:01:51 2003] Tilol says, 'I hope you didnt just loot that corpse'<BR>[Wed Jun 25 21:01:52 2003] Someone is already looting that corpse.<BR>[Wed Jun 25 21:02:07 2003] Tilol says, 'don't say you were a noob'<BR>[Wed Jun 25 21:02:17 2003] You told tilol, 'someone just looted crystalized rain'<BR>[Wed Jun 25 21:02:24 2003] Tilol says, 'Ok'<BR>[Wed Jun 25 21:02:27 2003] Tilol says, 'This is how it works'<BR>[Wed Jun 25 21:02:34 2003] Tilol says, 'Somebody looted the crystalized Rain'<BR>[Wed Jun 25 21:02:39 2003] Tilol says, 'if you do not tell me who'<BR>[Wed Jun 25 21:02:49 2003] Tilol says, 'you will be suspended for Ninja looting'<BR>[Wed Jun 25 21:04:58 2003] Tilol shouts, 'Who ever looted the crystalized rain, I suggest you come clean immediately'<BR>[Wed Jun 25 21:05:13 2003] Tilol shouts, 'unless you would like me to remove it from you and suspend you'<BR></TT></B><P>Now that's what we pay the big bucks for! Can you imagine the nightmare on a normal server? Agnarr corpse poofs, someone ninja's the whole damned thing, it takes years to petition and get everything back. Instead, just 10 minutes after the ninja-looting incident occurred it was resolved. Balky says, "Cousin Larry, I love this country!" <P><B><TT>[Wed Jun 25 21:11:12 2003] Tilol has offered you a Crystallized Rain.</TT></B><P><BR><A HREF="http://www.scienceofwar.net/images/20030626_babnoxis.jpg"><IMG WIDTH="226" SRC="http://www.scienceofwar.net/images/20030626_babnoxis_thumb.jpg" HEIGHT="200"></A><A HREF="http://www.scienceofwar.net/images/20030626_blazzax.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.scienceofwar.net/images/20030626_blazzax_thumb.jpg"></A><A HREF="http://www.scienceofwar.net/images/20030626_magmaton.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.scienceofwar.net/images/20030626_magmaton_thumb.jpg"></A><BR><A HREF="http://www.scienceofwar.net/images/20030626_pyronis.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.scienceofwar.net/images/20030626_pyronis_thumb.jpg"></A><A HREF="http://www.scienceofwar.net/images/20030626_quavonis.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.scienceofwar.net/images/20030626_quavonis_thumb.jpg"></A><A HREF="http://www.scienceofwar.net/images/20030626_reparm.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.scienceofwar.net/images/20030626_reparm_thumb.jpg"></A><BR><A HREF="http://www.scienceofwar.net/images/20030626_yozanni.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.scienceofwar.net/images/20030626_yozanni_thumb.jpg"></A><A HREF="http://www.scienceofwar.net/images/20030626_resolute.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.scienceofwar.net/images/20030626_resolute_thumb.jpg"></A><A HREF="http://www.scienceofwar.net/images/20030626_agnarr.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.scienceofwar.net/images/20030626_agnarr_thumb.jpg"></A>
