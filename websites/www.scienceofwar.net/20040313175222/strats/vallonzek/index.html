<ul>

<p><li><b>Event Summary:</b> Here's something most people don't want you to know: Vallon Zek is cake. This mob is entirely too easy. If you can field five tanks, five healers for those tanks, and some DPS, then you can beat Vallon Zek. Two groups of well geared toons should be able to do him, but given the quality of his loot, it seems he's been designed as a raid-level mob. The secret's out.

<p><li><b>Spawn Tracking</b>: Vallon Zek spawns about every 36 hours. He can ONLY be tracked by a rogue who walks up the northern path and visually identifies him (see map). Rangers cannot track him without first clearing some mobs in the way.

<p><li><b>Flagging</b>: The Vallon Zek flag is required for access to the Tower of Solusek Ro and is also required for access to all elemental planes. 

	<ul>
		<li>Complete a PoJ trial
		<li>Hail Giwin Mirakon inside the factory in the Plane of Innovation and say 'I will test the machine'
		<li>Kill the Manaetic Behemoth in the factory in the Plane of Innovation. Hail Giwin Mirakon again
		<li><b>Kill Vallon Zek in the Plane of Tactics and Hail the Planar Projection</b>
	</ul>

<p><li><b>Duration of Raid</b>: This raid typically takes Science of War thirty to forty minutes from the time we zone into Tactics. The hardest part of the raid is getting to Vallon Zek.

<p><li><b>Getting There</b>: See the map below. From zone in, your raid will take the first right at the intersection and wend its way north until they're at Vallon Zek's room. If you are careful as you move, you can leave about four to six trash mobs untouched. You don't have to kill everything on the way there. Once you get to Vallon Zek's room, hug the LEFT wall and clear the trash mob at the first corner and at the second corner you come to. Keep the raid against the wall, and move all the way up to the third and final corner before Vallon Zek. This is your fight spot. It is marked on the map below.

<p><li><b>Buff Strategy</b>: In clearing to Vallon Zek you'll be fighting mobs that AE dispell and AE knockback. Buffs are therefore really important for this raid. Every member of your raid party needs to lay down one to two junk buffs (shrunken goblin skull earring is an example of an insta-cast junk buff item). After junk buffing, layer on the rest of your typical raid buffs but make sure that you bury the really important ones (VoQ, Kazad, Bot9, Fot7) just in case you end up with two dispelling mobs in camp at once. Buff DMF dead last -- this is a buff that you absolutely do not want to lose. Every member of your raid party must be levitating at all times. After you've completely buffed, hit your junk buffs AGAIN so that they're the most recent buffs in your list. During the course of clearing, whenever you face a Hendin Shadow Master, be prepared to reclick your junk buffs over and over. 

<p><li><b>Melee</b>: Vallon Zek's melee is weaksauce. His maximum damage is a quad 841. But since you're facing up to five instances of him at once, it can add up. The key is to make sure you've divided his attention. More on that in the "Triggered Events and Scripts" section below. 

<p><li><b>Spells</b>: 
<table>
	<tr><td valign="top"><img src="http://lucy.fnord.net/gfx/gem_139d.png?1"></td><td><a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=2446&source=Live">Vallon's Precision</a>: This spell is unresistable. Just plan for it to be on everyone. This spell will essentially increase the aggro of anybody who's got it by 40% but it IS curable by a single cast of level one "Radiant Cure" (priest AA ability). Once this AE hits, your clerics will generate 40% more aggro. Your druids and chanters will generate 40% more aggro. Everyone in the raid will generate MORE aggro -- everyone except the main tank, that is. See the next spell below!</td></tr>
	<tr><td valign="top"><img src="http://lucy.fnord.net/gfx/gem_56d.png?1"></td><td><a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=2447&source=Live">Vallon's Subversion</a>: This spell is also unresistable. However, it's a single-target proc, so it will land ONLY on the object of Vallon Zek's attention. The effect is to DECREASE the aggro generated by the main tank by 60%. Combine this spell effect with the effect listed above, and you'll see that it's going to be pretty difficult for your tank to keep aggro on Vallon Zek. Luckily, in each batch of clones, only ONE of them procs Vallon's Subversion and AEs Vallon's Precision. How do you know which one? Have one person in your raid start each pull without ANY mobs in his target box. Once the AE hits, this person will have the "real" Vallon Zek (the one that AEs) in his target.</td></tr>
</table>

<p><li><b>Triggered Events and Scripts</b>: Once your raid force gets to the fight spot, you'll pull Vallon Zek from his spawn point and attempt to kill him. You won't actually be able to kill him, because at 40% he despawns and five copies of him spawn out in the middle of the room. So long as your raid is careful to stay near the corner, these clones will not aggro until you pull them. So now you've got five copies of Vallon Zek out in the middle of the room, spread out and just standing there. Have a SINGLE member of the raid party (we'll call him the spotter) creep up to them and target them one at a time. Once the spotter targets one, he should tell the raid channel, "Vallon Zek for MT" and the designated MT should respond to the effect of "Vallon Zek is mine, hands off." The MT should then KEEP THAT TARGET until the mobs are pulled. Here's an example from a SoW raid to illustrate how the spotter and tanks work together to dole out all five of the Vallon Zek targets:<br>

<p><blockquote>
<tt>
[Wed Apr 30 20:35:13 2003] You tell sowpl:3, 'Vallon Zek is for MT'<br>
[Wed Apr 30 20:35:15 2003] Thug tells sowpl:3, 'Attempting to gain aggro on [ Vallon Zek ]'<br>
[Wed Apr 30 20:35:22 2003] You tell sowpl:3, 'Vallon Zek is for 2T'<br>
[Wed Apr 30 20:35:29 2003] Savagesid tells sowpl:3, 'offtanking [ Vallon Zek ] offtanking'<br>
[Wed Apr 30 20:35:33 2003] You tell sowpl:3, 'Vallon Zek is for 3T'<br>
[Wed Apr 30 20:35:41 2003] Elrek tells sowpl:3, 'offtanking [ Vallon Zek ] offtanking'<br>
[Wed Apr 30 20:35:45 2003] You tell sowpl:3, 'Vallon Zek is for 4T'<br>
[Wed Apr 30 20:35:48 2003] Kulvar tells sowpl:3, 'offtanking [ Vallon Zek ] offtanking'<br>
[Wed Apr 30 20:35:57 2003] You tell sowpl:3, 'Vallon Zek is for 5T'<br>
[Wed Apr 30 20:36:03 2003] Simwean tells sowpl:3, 'offtanking [ Vallon Zek ] offtanking'<br>
</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>After this is done, the spotter then gains the attention of all five Vallon Zeks (as a Shaman, I simply pull the farthest one with Malos) and pulls them to the corner where the five tanks quickly gain aggro. For this to work, you need to have designated a healer or two to watch the health of each of the tanks. So long as the tanks gain aggro quickly, and so long as the healers heal, and so long as the Shaman, Bards, Enchanters, and Beastlords get all five of the Vallon Zeks slowed, you cannot lose. It would take an act of extreme stupidity to lose. Assist order does not matter either. Keep your raid in the corner and it doesn't matter whether you kill the trigger Vallon Zek or one of the clones first (even though the trigger version of Vallon Zek is the only one that AEs and hits for about 200 max MORE per hit). You will repeat this process four times until, finally, no more Vallon Zeks appear. Easy loot. After you have killed the final Vallon Zek, a planar projection will spawn. After flagging, you can use the door behind Vallon Zek's original spawn point to move right back to zone in.

<p><li><b>Healing Strat</b>: As mentioned above, you'll want one designated healer per offtank. A druid or cleric is the best choice, because Shaman will be busy slowing all five mobs on incoming, and won't have time to heal at all. On the first few pulls plan to have an MGB SoTW or EE hit just before the pull -- this will buy you some time and will give you a larger margin for error until you're more sure of yourselves.

<p><li><b>Risk Management</b>: The raid fight spot is actually 100% free of spawns and roamers. If things go poorly and a wipe is imminent, instruct the raid to train the MIDDLE of the room and die there while necros FD in the fight corner. If you do not train Vallon Zek away from the corner his AE will break necro FD and you'll be in for a graveyard recovery.

<ul>
<li>We know that some people actually attempt to split out the real Vallon Zek from all of the fake Vallon Zeks and spend a long time working on splitting and identifying the "real" Vallon Zek. We don't think that this is a good use of raid time, especially considering how easy it is to tank all five simultaneously. Nevertheless, we feel compelled to mention this strategy.
