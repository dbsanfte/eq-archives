<h3 class="title">Squashing Bugs and Killing Snakes</h3>

 <p>[Wed Jan 29 20:02:69 2003] We got the notification early. Swarming to our location we entered that ugly pyramid with unease of what was to become of us later that night. There was constant whispering about a known bug that was terrorizing this ancient temple. Some whispers mention that this bug had taken out more than a hundred adventurers in the last day. Poised in the antechamber we learned that there was another bug in the midst of this pyramid, and it was nastier than the one in the rumors. This one supposed makes your wounds invisible to those around you, and prevents you from being able to heal yourself. Things were looking fairly grim, until we heard Vova's patented mangina rally call to arms. This pumped our spirits up, and into the High Priest's lair we rushed. Through an almost flawless victory, Vova the banshee Iksar died early on in the battle, we defeated that snake and humbly said farewell to the bug until.....</p> <p>...The guild roamed the halls behind the noblemen and women of Storm Isle, awaiting any second for the first of the two evil Rhag twins to come into view. Ressurecting their dead, healing their wounded, and buffing the adventurers we were hoping to speed up their slaying of these two adversaries. They plowed through them like true champions, and walked away with some pretty decent equipment upgrades. As the second of the Rhag twins fell, a scream echoed through the structure, and we knew it was our turn. The Arch Lich wanted pay back, and Science of War was just the guild to give it to him. In little time we ascended the pyramid and entered his room. Set up our positioning and flawlessly killed this ugly serpent in record time! What can we look forward to tonight in the buggy lair that is Ssra? Will our adventurers overcome these bugs once again to walk away victorious?</p>
