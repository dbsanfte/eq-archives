<h3 class="title">Big Recruiting News: Time Is Running Out</h3>

<p><B>Applicants</B>: You have three days to <A HREF="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forum/app_form.php">submit</A> a completed written application to SoW. As of midnight (eastern time) on Monday, June 23rd, we will be ignoring all applications from people who are NOT flagged for PoEarth, PoAir, PoWater and the tower of Solusek Ro. On Tuesday, June 24th we're making a list of people who have submitted an application and over the course of the next 10 to 14 days (depending on mob availability) we'll flag those people for the Elemental planes. <A HREF="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forum/app_form.php">Submit an application now</A>! <P><B>Questions?</B>: Our <A HREF="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forum/app_form.php">application form</A> is very specific about our requirements. We've also spent a ton of time describing the guild <A HREF="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=23">rules and culture</A>. If you read these resources carefully, most of your questions will be answered. Even so, here are some questions that are germane to this post. <UL><LI><I><B>How many more people will you be inviting?</B></I> If we can find 20 SoW-quality players, we will invite them during this period. We have seven more spots for invites in the month of June and 12 spots opening up in the month of July. We'd love to fill them all. <P><LI><I><B>How are you different from Stormhammer's other two Elemental guilds: Township Rebellion and Leviathan?</B></I> There are many fine guilds on this server and you'll need to determine which guild best fits your lifestyle. The key difference between SoW and just about <B>every</B> other Elemental-level guild on any server is our set raid times. We raid between 8pm ET and 12am ET five days per week, with Sundays always off. Do the math. That's just 20 hours per week of raiding and we expect all members to be present for 80% of it. Most other guilds at this level of the game raid twice as many hours per week. We're looking for players that desire a sane balance between gaming and everything else that happens in life. We treat our in-game time very seriously and as a responsibility, but we have deliberately limited our raiding hours so that people would still have time to tend to other responsibilities. As a result, when you're raiding with SoW you can expect every raid to start within five minutes of 8pm ET. You can expect most raids to end 15 minutes before or after midnight eastern time. And you can expect to <B>bust your ass</B> during every minute in between the start and stop times. <P><LI><I><B>What's with the Scions of War guild?</B></I> Scions of War is a guild tag. It's also a holding pen for Science of War applicants. All SoW applicants are expected to join Scions of War during their application period because it allows us to get important raid information to you via a guild MOTD and it also allows us to evaluate your play times more closely via the guild management tool. Plus, it's nice to have other people to talk to when you're not raiding. Finally, it shows committment to our application process and that's important to us. We don't like to do anything half-assed, and we expect our applicants to show a similar level of drive. </UL><A HREF="http://www.scienceofwar.net/images/sowrecruit.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.scienceofwar.net/images/sowrecruit_thumb.jpg"></A>
