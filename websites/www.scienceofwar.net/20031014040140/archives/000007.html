<h3 class="title">Integrity Online DOA</h3>

<p>Integrity doesn't exist in online environments yet.</p> <p>What is integrity? What does it mean to have it? The usual definition for it is "Moral soundness; honesty; freedom from corrupting influence or motive (used especially with reference to the fulfillment of contracts, trusts, and the like)." Or, in a less high-falutin' definition that comes directly from a private message sent to me by a guild member, "I gave my word, and try to keep my word. It's all I have that will really ever be totally mine. No one can take it away from me, and only I can make it worthless."</p> <p>Unfortunately, integrity doesn't exist in Everquest. Too many people consider the promises that they make in this game as ethereal and easy to break as an End-User License Agreement (EULA) and too many people treat the relationships that they develop with others in this game as easy to ditch as uninstalling the Everquest client software.</p> <p>Examples are numerous. Here's a recent example. We have one dude who writes, "You are all the coolest, smartest, and fun to be around individuals I have ever met in my life, and I truly consider you friends." (Dec. 2002) but who silently guildremoves and puts in a server movelog without telling a soul. Is that how you'd bid "friends" goodbye if you had been out drinking with them five nights per week for eight months in a row? That's not integrity. That's cowardice and dishonesty of a level that's only possible in an online game. I could list numerous examples here, but the theme is the same: people making promises that they do not keep.</p> <p>It's a primal flaw in the social fabric of the game. At *any* time someone who has promised to pay back that loan, return that favor, or simply stay with your organization for a minimum term may go back on that promise and slink away in the darkness, secure in his anonymity. There are exceptions to this rule, but unfortunately they're a rare breed that becomes increasingly jaded (and less likely to trust anyone) as each subsequent liar abuses the natural tendency of humans to believe a statement when the words "I promise" precede it.<p> <p>PS: Just found <a href="http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/current_issue/jordan/index.html">this paper</a> on Augmented Social Networks that addresses the issues I raise above. Here's an interesting and pertinent quote from the paper. It talks about what might happen if we all had persistent online identities that travelled with us from virtual world to virtual world and that was linked to our real-world identity securely. <blockquote> In this new world, you will have an online identity that remains constant, allowing for continuity between your experiences in separate online environments. As in real life, when you go from one virtual social milieu to another your identity will acquire a history. But because this will take place in a digital realm, designed by code and made of data, information will be attached to your identity in ways we are only now beginning to appreciate. Who decides what that capability will be, and most important, whether it contributes or not to civil society? What will your "persistent identity" online say about you, and what shouldn’t it say? <br> .... <br> In the near future, you will build an online identity through an accretion of your actions and expressed affinities — whether you are aware of it or not. Every online choice you make could potentially contribute to your digital profile. </blockquote>
