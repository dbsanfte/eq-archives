<h3 class="title">Sunmoon Scam Drive: Won't You Help Buy Me Some Beer? Or Maybe Some Jewelry?</h3>

<p>Sunmoon is at it again. The owner of the Shaman Crucible and Ranger's Glade message boards has sent out emails to the registered users of both boards soliciting funds. This is the guy who spent hosting money sent to him by donors on beer and who will ban anyone that calls him out on this sort of activity. This is the guy who begged members of both boards for funds to <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=11619">buy his bitch an engagement ring</a>. Does he know no shame?<br> <p>Apparently not. Check out his threats to the Shaman community in an email sent early this morning: "I haven't been feeling the love from the shaman lately.. not sure why they aren't helping. Maybe you shaman don't want a site anymore? I had to drop the SK's awhile back because they were eating up too much bandwidth and not helping defray the costs. Hopefully, shaman will balance it out more this time." Not sure why? Perhaps it's because you've used funds donated for site hosting to buy yourself beer. Perhaps it's because you have used the goodwill of the community to buy your girlfriend luxury jewelry. And last I checked, the <a href="http://forums.shadowknight.org/">Shadowknight message board</a> was doing fine. As of 10.30 AM ET: 86 active users, 168,630 posts, 7,789 members. Hate to break it to the prick, but communities CAN survive without your thieving, conniving ass. What's more, they have their own cool URL and not some gimp "interealms" bullshit. What do you think? Save your money and send him some <a href="http://www.dogdoo.com">dogdoo</a> instead.
