<h3 class="title">Phinny Downed</h3>

<b>Recruiting Update</b>
<p>Thanks to some tremendously successful raids against Umbral Plains, the City of Mist, and Kael Arena, potential applicants have started to take notice of our "less is more" strategy for doing difficult encounters with tight-knit, well-controlled groups. As a result <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forums/forumdisplay.php?s=&forumid=4">applications to be in the guild</a> are coming in at a nice clip. The maximum number of people we'll take in any given month is twelve, however, so guildies should encourage top applicants to apply sooner rather than later. Applicants who are certain that they want to be a part of this guild should get their applications in ASAP. Next month, we'll be taking twelve more.</p>

<p><b>Phinigel Downed</b></p>

<p>Actus led the guild in a raid against Phinigel Autropos. The hardest thing about Phinigel is fighting him without his damned complete-healing guardians participating. <b>Plan A</b> was to pull him to zone via aggro+CoH, but that plan failed when CoH seemed to successfully clear all of Phinigel's aggro, returning him to his home point. <b>Plan B</b> was to have Rixalin, sexy Iksar she-monk, single pull him. We ended up with perhaps four complete-healing mobs on this single-pull because it is a very tricky monk pull. For <b>Plan C</b> we drew on the experience of Sopita, a level 60 wizard who had done Phinny many times in the past. Alas, hers was not a single-pull either, but we still managed to down him despite having two complete-healing seahorses in the mix as well. All guild members (whether you were there or not) should check the "post mortems" forum and give feedback on the raid so that the next time we do him our first plan will be our most successful one. Yaki (a raid guest) was awarded the <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=525">Staff of Elemental Mastery: Water</a> for his epic quest, Leatherneck was awarded the <i>Fusible Ore</i> for the <a href="http://www.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics9/rodofmalaise.JPG">Fusibility Research Quest</a> and Vova (being the only Shaman on the take-down) was awarded a <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=79">Rod of Malisement</a>, but she first had to spam a Sailfish with the remaining seven charges on the Rod already in inventory.</p>
