<img src="http://www.scienceofwar.net/albums/raids/TerrisThule.sized.jpg" height="300" width="400">

<ul>
	<p><li><b>Summary</b>: Terris Thule on her own isn't particularly difficult. She's level 70, unrooted, magic-slowable, and probably only has between 100k and 200k hitpoints. But don't think you can just go in there and burn her down. Her lair is trapped and any raid force that tries to win by brute force will die and suffer a long graveyard recovery. You MUST play along with the script if you hope to win. She can probably be killed with 20 skilled, superbly-geared players, but guilds that need her for flagging reasons are going to want approximately 40 to 60 players.

	<p><li><b>Prerequisite Flagging</b>: In order to raid this zone, the majority (85%) of your raid party needs to have completed the Hedge Maze quest with Thelin Poxbourne. One of the biggest challenges in beating Terris Thule is simply getting your guild or raid group flagged for her lair, and then getting them INTO the lair safely. Don't underestimate the difficulty of actually getting into the zone safely. See the section below about getting to the hedge. 


<p><li><b>Getting There</b>: 
	<ol>
	<li>You need levitation, DMF, SoE or something to get your feet off the ground. If you are not levitating you will cause problems. Invisibility isn't necessary but you can get it if you'd like. 

	<li>From the zone-in, travel NORTH along the zone wall. Stay high on the wall. Stop at Point 2 listed on the map. If you can see the water, STOP -- you went too far! If you can see the Hobgoblins, STOP -- you went too far! Ideally you'll stop about 30 feet before the drop-off.

	<li>From this point, turn right, and head SOUTH along the edge of the cliff. Not too close or you'll aggro the goblins below! This area should be pretty open and free of mobs but occasionally has a single raven there. Just kill that raven if you're one of the first to pass by. Don't train hm if he sees you. You'll stop at a rectangular notch in the cliff face. See images below for a photo of what the notch looks like.

	<li>Stop at the notch and face EAST. If you are not in First Person view, switch to it. Then use your Page Up key (or however you have it mapped) and look up. It is very important that you look up at about a 45-degree angle as you run. While looking up, run EAST for 10 seconds. Aim for the gap between the rocks on the other side of the water (see map). 

	<li>Instruct your raid force to meet up at the hedge once they've traveled through the zone. This is a great rendezvous point for dealing with any mobs that may aggro on the raid, and a good spot to finish buffing for the encounter to come.

	<li>Once buffs are done and everyone is ready, move to the entrance of PoNb, kill the guards there, then zone in. The reason you want to do this as a raid is because those guards respawn relatively quickly -- you don't want stragglers dying to them after the main raid body is inside and halfway through the zone -- this will just create more delay and someone will wind up missing a flag. Get everyone inside all at once. 

	<li>Once inside PoNb, you can't really go wrong. From the zone-in point the path winds and twists like a snake all of the way up to Terris Thule's Terror Dome. Clear EVERYTHING in the zone (you can't really miss any mobs on the way there since they have such large aggro radiuses) but sometimes raids forget to clear all of the mobs around the dome, and this can create adds later in the fight. None of the mobs on the way to Terris Thule are slowable, and the best method of clearing them is not to pull, but to crawl the raid and take them out two by two. Stop at the rock formation just outside the entrance to the dome and make final preparations here.
	</ol>


<p><li><b>Duration of Raid</b>: Expect your first run to take an hour or more, depending on how successfully you move to the hedge safely. Veterans of the fight should be able to handle the entire script within 40 minutes from zone-in of PoNa to loot.

<p><li><b>Melee</b>: As mentioned above, Terris Thule's melee capabilities are weak. She quads for about 620 max per hit and has a single-target proc. However, there is one point at which her melee powers are very dangerous. Right after the MT is debuffed, she can do approximately 3K damage in a single round -- that's very dangerous on an unbuffed tank. 

<p><li><b>Spells</b>: 
	<table>
	  <tr>
	  	<td><a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1618&source=Live"><img align="top" src="http://lucy.fnord.net/gfx/gem_161d.png?1" /></a></td>
	
	<td><a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1618&source=Live">Proc: Touch of Night</a>: This is a single-target lifetap proc that hits for up to 720 damage. It's not easily resisted since it checks against your magic resistance minus 200.</td></tr>

	<tr><td><a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3150&source=Live"><img align="top" src="http://lucy.fnord.net/gfx/gem_161b.png?1" /></a></td>
	<td><a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3150&source=Live">Direption of Dreams</a>: This is the KILLER spell in Terris Thule's repertoire. An AE dispell that will cancel at least 12 buffs on EVERYONE within 200 range of her. It is not interruptible. Luckily, she only casts it once in the script when she's at 50% health. If your raid happens to be blessed with bards, have them hit their group DA song at 50% health (so long as they're not in the MT group!) and they'll be able to keep an entire group from getting debuffed.
</tr>
</table>

<p><li><b>Triggered Events and Scripts</b>: During the fight there are three important events. First, tons of adds spawn and must be dealt with. The preferred method is to AE them. Next, Terris Thule debuffs the entire raid force. Finally, four mean adds spawn and must be handled. If you control the speed with which you drop Terris's health, you control the timing of these events and you win. If you indiscriminately damage her in an attempt to "win" before the scripted events can kill too many of your raid force, you lose.

<ul>
<p><li><b>Start Fight!</b>: (100% of Health) Terris Thule is happy. She will swat at your main tank and you will heal him. Nothing scary at all. Don't fall for it. She's luring you into a false sense of confidence.

<p><li><b>Attack of the Killer Butterflies</b>: (75% of Health) Ruh oh! About twenty small butterfly-shaped beings called "a dream defiler" spawn. These hit hard and fast and will wipe your raid out if you are not prepared to deal with them. We've heard that some guilds mez them, but we find it easier to simply AE stun them and AE nuke them. Note: you MUST use magic-based AE spells. They're essentially immune to fire-based spells. The key to dealing with them is to make sure that everyone in the raid is actively killing butterflies until no more of them exist anywhere. They must be killed first. Terris Thule is unimportant while any single butterfly is alive. Resist the temptation to continue damaging Terris Thule. To do so will wipe your raid. The best spot to AE these bugs is right under her skirt. Cluster everyone close and make sure that your melee understand that they need to push the bugs towards the spell casters during this portion of the fight. None of the butterflies have loot on them, but looting the corpses will clean up the battlefield and make everyone feel more relaxed, so why not?

<p><li><b>Butterflies Squashed, TT Gets Some Lovin'</b>: (65% of Health) By now, you should have killed all of the butterflies. Terris Thule has taken some splash damage from your AE spells. You can now instruct the raid to take her down to 50%, the next script trigger. Make sure that everyone understands that at 50% 

<p><li><b>Mass Dispell! Danger!</b>: (50% of Health) This is the make-or-break point for the raid. You must quickly MGB all missing buffs (HP buffs and haste are most important). While people are unbuffed, everyone in the raid MUST stop attacking Terris Thule. If you damage her during this phase, you risk dropping her health to the next trigger point, and without buffs, that would surely mean a wipe. Make sure clerics are ready to overheal the Main Tank. His hitpoints will rise and fall rapidly because he's unbuffed at this point. Within a few seconds, all MGBs should be taken care of, and you should be ready for the next phase of the script.

<p><li><b>All Buffed - GO GO GO</b>: (45% of Health) Once your raid is buffed completely, give the order to burn Terris to the ground. Show her no mercy. Have melee go offensive (if the MT has been stable and has a good aggro lead). BUT make sure your off-tanks and healers are positioned at their posts BEFORE you give this order (see below for strategies on this). 

<p><li><b>Gargoyles</b>: (30% of Health) At this point, the Gargoyles atop the pillars awaken. They quad for 1100 damage but are fully slowable by a shaman (they do not mitigate slow). Your raid has two options for dealing with them, and you should have already chosen one of them in advance. (a) Kite: We don't prefer this method for dealing with the Gargoyles. They run slow, and are easily stunned by Paladins, but they have funky pathing if the kiter gets too far away and they'll come hit on your clerics. Furthermore, if a kiter dies, it's hard to tell right away whether the mob is running around killing people or actually still being kited. (b) Off-tank: This is our preferred method for dealing with the Gargoyles. Before the fight begins with Terris, choose four off-tanks and four healers who will be responsible for healing them. Pair them up, and make sure each pair understands which of the four pillars they'll be standing at. Rehearse this. Make 100% certain that you have four off-tanks and each off-tank knows who his healer is. Make sure you have four healers and each healer knows who his off-tank is. When the Gargoyles wake up, they stretch at the top of their pillars for a few seconds before coming down. During this period, the off-tanks acquire their targets, and the raid shaman, enchanters, and beastlords target the Gargoyles to malos, tash and slow them. Once they are slowed, a ranger could tank them. Prior to being slowed, they're a pain in the ass.

<p><li><b>Cleaning Up</b>: (0% - 30% health) Once you've got your Gargoyles off-tanked (or kited) drop Terris. There are no more script events. Just go full-out damage on her and once she's down, have your main tank rotate around the dome and call assist on the off-tanked gargoyles one by one. Hail the planar projection, collect loot, and you're done!

</ul>

<p><li><b>Buff Strategy</b>: This should really be at the top of this strategy spoiler, because it's key to the fight. You *must* conserve MGB until you reach the point in TT's script where she dispells your entire raid force. Without quick, swift application of important spells via MGB, you may wipe. When you are setting up the raid, frequently remind everyone not to use MGB unless you've simply got a surfeit of classes with MGB present. Even then, druids and clerics should conserve MGB just in case your raid could use a boost from MGB EE (cleric group HoT) or MGB SoTW (druid group HoT).

<p><li><b>Healing Strategy</b>: Terris doesn't hit hard at all -- so you should opt for a smaller rotation (three to five clerics or druids) and make sure you have dedicated healers on off-tanks for the Gargoyle portion of the fight. As long as TT is kept slowed, she's a non-issue except right after she dispells. At this point, the main tank is particularly vulnerable and will need extra healing.

<p><li><b>Risk Management</b>: If you wipe you will probably need to recover in the graveyard since Terris must be fought in her dome. It's not likely that you'd be able to recover inside of it, but (1) if a necromancer thinks fast and (2) if a rogue or three survies and (3) if you cleared fast and engaged TT shortly after clearing the last mobs around the dome then (4) you may manage to get corpses dragged to the rock formation outside the TT door and recover from there. Chances are you will not have the time to do this. The graveyard here is rather fast. In the event you do need to graveyard, be very, very careful when looting corpses there -- one wrong click and you'll zone into PoNa where you'll be promptly killed by the two guards on the other side of it. Instruct the raid to type "/target myname" and then "/loot" when they are rezzed and ready to loot their corpses. This will save you time having to CR idiots in another zone.

<p><li><b>Flagging</b>: This is probably one of the most complicated parts of the PoP storyline for flagging purposes. To flag here, you need to follow a very specific sequence of events. Here's the flag sequence.
	<ol>
	<li> Go to the sick bay in the Plane of Tranquility (loc neg246, neg1427).
	<li> Hail Elder Poxbourne.
	<li> Hail Adroha Jezith and say 'tortured by nightmares'. 
	<li> Complete Thelin Poxbourne's hedge maze event (3-group event) in the Plane of Nightmares. 
	<li> Return to the sick bay in the Plane of Tranquility (loc neg246, neg1427). 
	<li> Hail Elder Poxbourne. 
	<li> Hail Adroha Jezith.
	<li> <b>Kill Terris Thule in PoNB (Lair of Terris Thule).</b>
	<li> <b>Hail the Planar Projection that spawns when Terris Thule dies.</b>
	</ol>

<p><li><b>Loot Table</b>: Terris always drops two items and up to four spells, mostly ethereal.<br>
