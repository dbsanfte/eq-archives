The results have been pretty fantastic. We saved 900G in guild funds in a very short period of time and have begun purchasing epic mounts for our members. Junckey is the first recipient of an epic mount via the SoW-Warren-G "Regulators, Mount Up!" program.

PVP participation will go up across the board as a result of this change. It's huge!
<br />

<br />
The cynic in me says that they've done this because they're further behind in development of PVE content than they reckoned they would be and that they need SOMETHING to mop up all the spare time their level 60 players have. 
<br />

<br />
In the short run, this change will mean many more players participating in PVP as everyone attempts to achieve a high rank for gear. If you're a more casual player, now is NOT the time to jump into PVP, as you'll be competing for rank with just about everyone else.
<br />

<br />
In the long run, this change will accellerate game mudflation. Overall, it has become easier to obtain gear. This buys the company a few months to make detailed announcements about a significant PVE expansion.

  <legend><font color="CC9900">Guild Recruiting Is a Classic Funnel</font></legend>
  <table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
    <tr> 
      <td>People frequently misunderstand how recruiting processes work. Even our own guild members sometimes get confused when they see us kick out an applicant who seems like a nice, upstanding guy. Just today, in fact, a guild member lamented that we had booted another applicant who was focusing on PVP instead of leveling to 60.
<br />

<br />
So here's an explainer.
<br />

<br />
A healthy recruiting organization applies a series of filters to the applicant pool. Generally, an organization like ours starts with a huge pool of potential guild members then gradually narrows that pool down until they're left with the best people.
<br />

<br />
This filtering process is commonly known in the sales process and is often represented as a giant funnel. 
<br />

<br />
<img src="http://www.firewhite.com/cms/images/salesfunnel.gif">
<br />

<br />
The top level of this funnel represents all of the people who we might like to have join our guild. So to start out with, we might say, "well, we'd like to look at everyone on planet earth as a potential member."
<br />

<br />
EVERYONE ON PLANET EARTH = 6 BILLION PEOPLE
<br />

<br />
Clearly, though, to play WoW with SoW, a player needs to meet a few basic requirements. As we layer on those requirements, we apply filters that narrow down the total pool of people from 6 billion to something a little more reasonable.
<br />

<br />
EVERYONE ON THE PLANET EARTH = 6 BILLION PEOPLE
<br />
LIVES IN CANADA OR THE USA = 300 MILLION PEOPLE
<br />
OWNS AN ACTIVE WORLD OF WARCRAFT ACCOUNT = 700,000 PEOPLE
<br />
ACTIVELY PLAYS ON AZJOL NERUB, HORDE SIDE = 2000 PEOPLE
<br />
IS UNGUILDED = 800 PEOPLE
<br />
IS LITERATE ENOUGH TO FILL OUT SOW'S APPLICATION: 600 PEOPLE
<br />
IS MOTIVATED/INTERESTED ENOUGH TO FILL OUT SOW'S APPLICATION: 30 PEOPLE PER MONTH
<br />

<br />
You can see how, gradually, we apply filters to gradually narrow down the list of potential guild members to the point where we have 30 viable written applications per month.
<br />

<br />
The filtering process doesn't end there. We quickly weed out people who don't fit with the guild for one reason or another. For instance, an applicant that refuses to level up and who wants to remain level 49 forever (in order to PVP) will be kicked because PVP is not a guild focus. Or we might kick someone for poor conduct. Rejecting apps who don't buy into guild goals is expected. That means that the application process is working to keep people out of the guild who don't belong here. 
<br />

<br />
In the end, out of those 30 apps per month, I expect maybe 5 to be invited to join the guild as a full member.
<br />

<br />
Sure, these people that we're booting may be very good people. They're probably managers at work, and they're probably quite smart and attractive and so on. But we're not in the business of inviting all the nice people on the server to join SoW. 
<br />

<br />
We're looking for capable players who are as focused as we are on beating the game's top PVE content. Science of War will kill Ragnaros on the Azjol Nerub server. We'll be one of the first guilds on the server to do that. But not if we dilute our efforts by letting nice people with no sense of focus into the guild. We filter out people who don't meet our requirements, and that's just common sense.

<i>I stand atop a cold peak, far above the battle that rages below. The feint cries of dying elves reach my ears and my mind’s eye briefly envisions one of my Forsaken brothers taking a head as a symbol of his triumph. The snow at my feet is a slushy pink. Pools of blood steam under the glare of the afternoon sun. I am watching a horrible thing: an ancient elemental of ice rips into fleeing ranks of human soldiers with hate cold and eons old. What is this thing we have bound to our service? See how it seems to rip souls from flesh even before the victims fall lifeless to the earth? Such idle thoughts slip away as easily as they come. I do not care what pacts the Orcish warlocks have struck, nor the price: it shall not be paid in </i>my<i> blood.
<br />

<br />
I tighten my grasp on my frost-kissed sword and turn my thoughts once more upon the enemy. The Alliance is shattered. They do not even pause in their flight to recover their dead, much to my hungry brothers’ delight. Final victory in this wasteland is only a matter of time. They flee north to the keep that will soon become a charnel house. For a moment I feel a tinge of anticipation in my dead fingers, but perhaps that is merely the cold.
<br />

<br />
No matter, for now I ride. To the north. To victory.</i>

<b>Battlegrounds pwn.</b>
<br />

<br />
Despite all of the pre-release blogs touting a flawed design, horrible wait times, and crashing servers, Blizzard got Battlegrounds right. Predictions of failure proved to be nothing more than wishful thinking of the fatalist die-hards. After all, if those blogs and guild pages didn’t have something to bitch about they might not get a chance to become game designers would they? (A discussion for another update: why do so many WoW players want or expect to see Blizzard fail?)
<br />

<br />
Prior to Battlegrounds, Science of War had taken only tentative steps into the world of PvP. Our primary motivation is beating the PvE game and we center our guild efforts on learning and mastering PvE encounters. Battlegrounds, however, has given us something new to sink our teeth into and so far the dogs of war are pleased. In fact, we’ve had to ask several of our “younger” members to make sure they aren’t losing too much focus on the task of leveling to 60. It’s a great system, full of charm and challenge and uh-something alliterative that means “thematic.” Battlegrounds hits fun on all cylinders.
<br />

<br />
So what makes BG work? I don’t really want to completely dissect Battlegrounds. Well, I do…it would be fun…but I don’t want to do it right now. Let’s look at the broad picture.
<br />

<br />
<b>Class Interaction &amp; Teamwork:</b> Tanks lead the charge, rogues stealth behind enemy lines, warlocks call down demons: World of Warcraft’s class roles really shine in Battlegrounds. The most successful CTF teams utilize strategies that emphasis class roles. For example: Druids make good flag carriers because of their ability to move fast, Hunters make excellent screens for the flag carrier because of their ability to snare pursuing enemies, Rogues make excellent recon because of their ability to survey the battlefield undetected, and so on. Similarly, the Alterac Valley scenario relies on large groups of players cooperating in a way that maximizes their class effectiveness. Tanks backed by healers carve a wave of death into the ranks of unorganized defenders. Playing your class well and being rewarded for it is fun. Knowing you just did something through a genius moment of teamwork is crazy fun.
<br />
 
<br />
<b>Lots of Variety:</b> I’m blown away by the amount of variety in the two Battlegrounds scenarios. Alterac Valley is brimming with quests and roles within roles. Any class can choose to perform supporting quests, such as clearing a nearby mine of Kobolds and then providing the army’s smith with supplies. You can capture enemy fortifications, escort sorcerers to raise fell allies, or rescue key military advisors to bolster your selection of weapons. Alterac Valley could easily have simply been “take and hold locations A, B, and C FTW!” but instead it’s a dynamic storyline that unfolds a different way each time it’s played. Warsong Gulch, the CTF scenario, lacks the variety of Alterac, but has an extremely well designed map. There are many strategies for mounting an effective offense or defense and that alone will provide for many hours replayability. 
<br />

<br />
<b>Thematic Content:</b> Battlegrounds is full of “Warcrafty-ness.” In Alterac Valley, each side has to mine and collect resources to equip NPC soldiers with upgraded weapons. Warlocks demand blood sacrifices. Wolf riders patrol the valleys and gryphon riders patrol the skies. Due to the large numbers of weaker NPC soldiers involved in the scenario, the battles feel epic and your character's role feels significant. With so many of us playing MMOs to briefly escape the real world or indulge in our romantic side, the strength of theme in battlegrounds really helps make the experience exciting. If I had envisioned playing Warcraft 3 from the point of view of one of the heros I probably wouldn’t have come this close to hitting the mark.
<br />

<br />
<b>Endless Slaughter:</b> Let’s face it: taking out another player is fun. Few opponents of PvP dislike it because they don’t like killing another player. What they don't like is getting killed. They don’t like getting ganked when they’re focused on some quest. They don’t like the idea that their skills might not be as good as another player and they don’t want to be reminded of that fact. Battlegrounds helps take the sting out of PvP. First, the penalty for dying is nil. You die and within 30 seconds you are back in the action. Second, the battle takes place in a fixed area on straightforward terms. You can easily leave and remove yourself from PvP. Third, you are surrounded by allies. If you play smart, you’ll always have someone to watch your back. Getting unexpectedly ganked is rare. Essentially, Battlegrounds puts control over the PvP experience in the hands of the player.
<br />

<br />
Those are just a few reasons why I think Battlegrounds works. There are a lot more. This really is the patch you’ve been waiting for. Get it, get in, get to the killing.
<br />

With this raid, we became the second guild on the horde side to enter Molten Core (some alliance-type raids have entered, but those have been a mix of players from a number of random guilds).
<br />

<br />
I'll be honest: right now, Ragnaros is laughing his molten anus off at us. We're not yet fielding a full raid force of 40 players, so we're having to crunch our way through the zone with a smaller group of people. It's not easy, but it is honing our raiding.

This zone is going to be <b>easy</b> once we find a few more able level 60 players to fill out our roster.

<br />
First, he introduced TeamSpeak to the guild. He set it up, he paid for a year of TeamSpeak out of his own pocket, and he continues to provide troubleshooting and support for it. TeamSpeak has increased the quality and fun factor of our raids and has taken raiding with us to the next level. It's also increased the bonds between guild members and has helped humanize everyone a little bit.
<br />

<br />
Second, he's lead all of our UBRS raids and many of our raids in other areas as well. At first, he started doing these raids to give our faster-leveling members something to do, and for that I'm grateful. It wouldn't do to have people get bored before the guild really even started the official raiding game. I'm thankful that he did this. 
<br />

<br />
Third, he spent about 25 hours with me in LBRS one weekend to marshall a ton of guild members through the Warlord's Command quest. Even more impressive was the run with a certain unskilled former applicant that would have had me tearing my hair out if I had to lead it. His patience for unskilled players far exceeds my own, and that makes him a pretty good coach.

Fourth, he just donated 200g to the guild bank to help the bank save up to provide a lucky guild member with an epic mount. He could have received DKP for doing this, but he declined the DKP. He could have P2P'ed the gold and received DKP, but he didn't. This was very generous and selfless of him.
