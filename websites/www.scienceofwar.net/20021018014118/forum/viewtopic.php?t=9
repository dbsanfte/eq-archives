<li><b>The test of communication</b>: We are sick of half-assed events that start an hour late and where nobody really knows what's going on. Too many guilds operate that way but not Science of War. To combat this disorganization endemic amongst many guilds, we ask members to propose raids in a format that answers the big "who, what, where, when why and how" questions. We want an event proposal from you. If you're at a loss for ideas, try writing up a proposal for one of the boss mobs required for your epic. After all, you can't expect people to help you with your epic if you're not willing to tell them HOW to help! Write that proposal here: 
<br />

<br />
<li><b>The test of humor</b>: Be creative and have fun with this one! Basically we ask you post something humorous and original. (You could perform a standup comedy routine in a busy zone, pester some granny from Witchita, Kansas for Cyber on IM, troll a message board dedicated to gardening, smurf collectibles or bridge, manipulate an EQ screenshot, or string a series of screenshots together with hilarious narrative. It's up to you.) This part is supposed to be fun and it would be really hard to fail it, so don't stress. Paste your URL / story / Joke / screenshot / whatever here: 
<br />

<br />
<li><b>Test of Strategy</b>: Go to the online text of "The Art of War" by Sun Tzu at <a href="http://www.sonshi.com/learn.html" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://www.sonshi.com/learn.html</a> and select a short quote for interpretation. Select anywhere from one to four lines of text and then explain what that particular snippet of text means in the context of the Everquest experience on Legends. Post your quote and your interpretation here:
<br />

<br />
<li><b>Test of Patience</b>: After you've completed your application we'll move it to a private forum for discussion. We'll generally try to post  a decision within one week to four weeks (depending on how much you group with us!), so please be patient and seek us out in game for groups and raids while we discuss your app. The more you group and raid with us in game, the faster we can make a decision about your application.
<br />
</ol>
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<b>How We Decide on Your App</b>
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />

<br />
Applications are reviewed by taking into account two factors, both equally weighted. These factors are:
<br />

<br />
1. <b>Strength of online application.</b> We expect top applicants to put forth a good deal of effort in completing the application to demonstrate to us their knowledge of their chosen class, their concepts of teamplay, and that they can have fun with it. If you find yourself bogged down while completing the application, having no fun, and cursing at your computer screen, then we suggest that perhaps this isn't the guild for you. We can tell when an application has been hastily written, and sloppily completed.
<br />

<br />
2. <b>Personal recommendations from current guild members.</b> It is <b>your</b> responsibility, once your application is submitted (and ideally before), to actively seek out SoW members for experience groups and for raids. We are delighted to send out your LFG over guildchat, and to include you on our raids when they arise. Join our raid channel even if you are not able to make it on the raid to get a feel for how our raids are run (just communicate in tells if you have to). 
<br />

<br />
We balance these factors when making the decisions to admit at the beginning of each month. It is unlikely that you will gain admission, even with a brilliant application, if you have never grouped or raided with us. It is equally unlikely that you will gain a place in the class even with several recommendations if your application is substandard. 
<br />

<br />
In short: we want to meet you in-game, too! It is only then that you will discover why my wife thinks I'm crazy for laughing at my computer monitor at night.</span><span class="gensmall"><br /><br />Last edited by soupypoopy on 07-02-2002 12:11 AM, edited 1 time in total</span></td>

I like some of the changes you've made to the app, even though I think more abstract questions would serve your purpose better.   For any who don't realize it, this app is not a test of how good a fighting machine your character is, it's a test of YOU, the player, and your personality, creativity, resourcefulness and dedication.

Anyway, on to the app.

I'm a tradeskill junkie and given my low Int/Wis even the moderate levels I've attained in the arts I consider an accomplishment. 
<br />
Baking - 136(I make my own fish rolls!) 
<br />
Brewing - 46(high enough for Heady Kiolas for cured silk, probably won't take much higher until ready for Coldain Rings) 
<br />
Tailoring - 50(got eight stacks of silk swatches, various HQ pelts and other supplies sitting in the bank ready for me to get some more int/wis gear for practice sessions!) 
<br />
Fishing - 61 (and a lot of beer went into this one I can tell you!) 
<br />
Planning on starting work on smithing so I can make Antonian Javelins with human cultural smithing. Need 118 skill. I'm gathering some of the supplies, bricks of Velium, etc. Have a few stacks of various stackable smithing supplies in the bank but it's mighty tempting to sell them off while the prices are still sky high due to increased demand for the new high-end crafted items.

Arrrg!  Don't mention that damn earring! Stupid Goblin Earring Camp kicked my butt. That goblin pit fighter has a nasty DoT. 2hp/tick lasts FOREVER. I feigned and went AFK about two hours after getting dotted, had nearly Full Health at the time, to deal with bathing the kids and when I came back that damn owl in Firona Vie was taunting me. I died in a newbie zone, Kurns Tower where I was farming bone chips for Cabilis faction. Not only that, I scrolled up and some newbies had tried to help me, but since I was AFK they didn't know what they could do to help. People probably think I died to a decaying skeleton. /rude Goblin Pit Fighter

Now I just gotta find those FUCKING GNOLLS!

After that the four fights and I'm bubbly.  Really Raster is the bottleneck in this quest, and I got him /cheer  [Valley Girl]Go me![/Valley Girl]

<span style="font-weight: bold">What are you looking for in a guild? If you are currently in a guild or just left one, why are/were you dissatisfied?</span> 
<br />

<br />
All I want from a guild, and all I've ever wanted from a guild, is to never have to type /lfg on ever, ever again.  I promise I will make every effort to find room for/start a group if I see a guildmate LFG, and I expect the same from guildmates if I'm LFG.  Raids and stuff are all well and good, but I log in to play, and have fun.  Groups are the best way to ensure that, and guild groups even moreso.

I understand battle spam(I'm a monk, you should see my combat spam) and being busy, but out of two dozen or more guildmates online at a time I certainly expect someone to pipe up when I say I'm LFG or to joke with me in Guildchat occasionally.  I certainly am not interested in having questions about things like starting times/meeting places for raids ignored.  If I ask "could you use me on the raid?" that means I want an answer damnit.

<span style="font-weight: bold">What is Soylent Green?</span> Lots of opinions on this, but I think it's yummy.

<span style="font-weight: bold">Ender Wiggins, Paul Atreides, Harry Potter or Holden Caulfield?</span> All yummy.

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">There is a hole with a ball in it. You have a stick. How many ways can you think of to get the ball out of the hole? List them. (The sizes of the stick, ball and hole are unspecified -- you are free to make whatever assumptions you like about their dimensions and construction.) </span>
<br />

<br />
Heh, this is the fun one, probably the one that made me want to fill out this app in the first place. Can you think outside the box? 
<br />

<br />
First, the classic "outside the box" solution. I say the hole is very shallow, about the size of a golf hole, and the ball is about the size of a golf ball. I pick up the ball with my hand. Then I toss the ball in the air and bat it with the stick. 
<br />

<br />
Secondly. The hole is fairly deep and in soil that is very rocky. I gently nudge small rocks out of the sides of the hole one by one so they fall to the bottom. Very much like the crow filling the pitcher with pebbles to drink the water, the large ball is displaced by the small rocks and it rises, eventually, to the top of the hole. I can prod the ball if necessary to make the rocks shift and settle under it. Then, after it has been raised enough, I pick the ball up toss the ball in the air and bat it with the stick. 
<br />

<br />
Thirdly. The ball is lightweight and made of a rubbery substance and is just out of arm's reach in the hole. The stick is a piece of PVC piping. I place one end of the stick firmly against the surface of the ball and apply suction to the upper end, forming a vacuum inside the pipe. Then slowly stand up and draw the ball out of the hole. I pick the ball up toss the ball in the air and bat it with the stick. 
<br />

<br />
Fourthly. The "stick" is a piece of semi-rigid PVC piping and the hole is a watertight. Find a source of liquid and fill the hole with the liquid until the ball floats. Depending on available choices of liquid, either pick the ball up toss the ball in the air and bat it with the stick, or prod it off the top of the liquid onto firm ground and walk away. There are some choices of liquid that I just wouldn't touch something after it's been in  
<br />

<br />
Fifthly. This is a cheap shot, but hey I had a minor in mathematics. I define the size of the ball to be infinite and the size of the hole to be finite. Taking the limit of this system we see that the ball is the only thing that matters and the hole is irrelevant. Why are you bothering me with trivialities? I bat the ball with the stick. The gravitational pull from the infinitely large ball sucked the stick into it and then collapsed into a black hole. D'oh! 
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">The test of knowledge: To demonstrate that you know your class well, you choose ONE of the following three tasks.
<br />

<br />
(Option A) Post a class-specific "guide" to a class board. For instance, monks might post a "Guide to Pulling Kael Arena" to <a href="http://www.monkly-business.com." target="_blank" class="postlink">www.monkly-business.com.</a> Shaman might post a "Guide to Shaman Levelling Spots, 40 to 50" to <a href="http://www.eqshaman.com," target="_blank" class="postlink">www.eqshaman.com,</a> Enchanters might post a guide to "Charming Mobs for Solo XP" and so on. Once you have posted your guide, past the URL here:</span>
<br />

<br />
Wrote a guide to Feign Death for Monkly-Business.  <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showMessage?topicID=668.topic" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showMessage?topicID=668.topic</a> I've also contributed to a money-making guide, several pulling guides and equipment tips. 
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">(Option B) Answer the following questions about your class in detail (at least two-three paragraphs per question). What is a common misconception about your class? How does your class's role change as you move from the 40s into the 50s and upper 50s? What's a bug that currently affects your class and how would you recommend that Verant fix that bug? </span>
<br />

<br />
Common misconception?  That we're always the best puller.  Perhaps always the safest as far as the raid is concerned, but not always the best.  Actually in a great many situations Bards are as good.  Also the misconception that monks are not good tanks.  A monk is a good enough tank for 90% of exp groups due to their high avoidance skills and the Block skill.
<br />

<br />
How do we change?  From the 40's to the low 50's we're excellent pullers.  The monk discipline at level 51, Stonestance, gives us the staying power we need to pull even the toughest mobs reasonable distances.  From the mid-50's to 60 and into AA monks can, depending on their choice of AA, become even better pullers(spending points on Run Speed, Rapid Feign, Durability and Avoidance), AMAZING damage dealers(Improved Damage tables at 55 and again at 60.  Triple Attack at 60, AA Critical Hits, Innerflame Discipline at 56, Ambidexterity) or better tanks(Durability, Regen, Avoidance, Stability).  A 55+ monk should choose one of these paths if they can't dedicate time to getting them all.
<br />

<br />
Bug?  Heh, easy one.  The Feign Death Group bug.  In some situations, hard to repeat, but mostly with KoS to all mobs, when multiple PCs are on a mobs hatelist Feign Death fails without a failure message.  If the monk feigns the mob simply continues to beat on them.  Some uber mobs are designed this way, but I shouldn't have problems feigning off a Stonegazer Cockatrice.  /rude 
<br />

<br />
Fix this!  Your code is so spaghettified that I won't even venture to tell you how, you've known about and promised to "fix" this bug for nearly a year now.  If you can't figure it out in a year I certainly can't help you do it.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">(Option C) A friend of yours just purchased a high-level character of your class, and before he embarasses himself by making stupid mistakes and getting people killed, you want to get him up to speed. Put together a reading list for your friend. List five must-read URLs that everybody of your class should read at least once. Do NOT list general sites such as <a href="http://www.eqshaman.com." target="_blank" class="postlink">www.eqshaman.com.</a> List SPECIFIC links to really good threads on class message boards, guides, and so on.</span>  
<br />

<br />
I've already answered two of the three when I was only supposed to answer one, so I'm not going all out on this one, but here are some tips. I would not recommend anything for my friend to read on how to play a monk.  I would write something for him or teach him personally.  I would search the OTHER CLASS SITES for their "required reading."   Maybe pick a flame on the warrior board on how that stupid monk didn't control his aggro and got himself killed.  Or a post from a Shaman board on what buffs stack with what buffs so our new monk doesn't ask for stupid stuff like Dex when they have Focus.   A link to a rant on the druid class boards about how to properly ask/compensate for a port.  Tips on how to sit still and not be a pain in the ass on a raid.  If they want to be a powergamer, maybe some references to the formulas determined through ShowEQ or Magelo on the combat engine.  It just depends on my friend, but one thing I do know, I would write the "how to play the monk class" myself.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">The test of communication: We are sick of half-assed events that start an hour late and where nobody really knows what's going on. To combat this disorganization endemic amongst many guilds, we ask members to propose raids in a format that answers the big "who, what, where, when why and how" questions. We want an event proposal from you. If you're at a loss for ideas, try writing up a proposal for one of the boss mobs required for your epic. After all, you can't expect people to help you with your epic if you're not willing to tell them HOW to help! Write that proposal here: </span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: red">RAID CRUSHBONE! </span> 
<br />

<br />
Ok, need about 42-48 players to take this zone, it's horribly unbalanced. Level ranges on the mobs run from level 4 to level 25 or so with the top creature in the zone, Ambassador D'vinn, being a HORRIBLE UNDERCON. Our goal is Ambassador D'vinn's Black Heart. 
<br />

<br />
All players should be between levels 1 and 4 with basic newbie gear. Newbie tunics and rusty weapons. If you can get a scythe or worn great staff off one of the mobs in the zone and you can use it then by all means do so. 
<br />

<br />
Everyone bind in Greater Faydark just outside the zone line. We will have two dedicated pull groups. These will be comprised of the players with the most HP. We will pull using "Superior Feign Death" to tag pull the named mobs and split them. 
<br />

<br />
Upon zone in we will clear the Orc Centurions at the entrance and set two groups to be the "wanderer" clearers. This should leave three to four groups to be the "killer" groups. During time periods of no wanderers the "wanderer" clearer groups should mem any spells they have and heal or give support damage to the fighting groups. During the fights the pull groups will be setting up for the next pull. Understand that the pull groups and the wanderer control groups are expected to assist the kill groups if there are problems.  There will be raid channels set up for each group of groups, (Pull, Wanderer Control and Kill) and an emergency channel where group members from the kill group can send messages to the pull/wanderer control groups for assistance.  
<br />

<br />
The basic path we will take is to the right of the entrance, around the "trainer hill" and across the bridge into the citadel. We will pull back to the clear spot almost directly in front of zone in, to the immdiate south west of the trainer hill. This gives us close proximity to the zone, not so we can run, but so those who are bound at the zone line can re-join us as soon as possible. 
<br />

<br />
The key to success in this raid is the pull groups. With careful aggro radius management it will be possible to single pull the mobs guarding the citadel, then the orc emissaries, the prophet or Emperor Crush and finally D'vinn. Each tagger in the chain will use rusty weapons or spells to tag with depending on their class. The primary puller will be the person with the most HP.(maybe an Ogre with all their points put into sta). Each puller will move to their designated spot if they have multiples on them, or as far as possible before dying if they have singles. Once a puller dies, the next puller will move into position to tag the mobs once they split to wander back to spawn points. Using this method of splitting we should be able to hold single pull all the named mobs from the throne room. A quick kill rate is imperative, don't go for fast damage weapons, go for high damage weapons. At these levels, fighting mobs that are much higher level than you and without strong healing/buffing spells to back us up, any tank won't last long. Make your hit count and start running back to fight again as soon as you respawn. 
<br />

On bigger mobs casters are to melee and use DD ONLY. No debuffs(will probably be resisted) and no heals. No tank will live a significant amount longer regardless of the heals. Buffing will only be done in downtime and only by the pull groups because the fighting groups will need their mana. The pull groups will probably die on every pull so their mana is expendable.

<span style="font-weight: bold">The test of humor: Be creative and have fun with this one! Basically we ask you post something humorous and original. (You could perform a standup comedy routine in a busy zone, pester some granny from Witchita, Kansas for Cyber on IM, troll a message board dedicated to gardening, smurf collectibles or bridge, manipulate an EQ screenshot, or string a series of screenshots together with hilarious narrative. It's up to you.) This part is supposed to be fun and it would be really hard to fail it, so don't stress. Paste your URL / story / Joke / screenshot / whatever here: </span> Still don't like the whole troll/pestering thing.  Not behavior I condone, but considering the popularity of things like Howard Stern and Candid Camera-type shows(did I just date myself? Oh my!) it may be me that's the freak.

<span style="font-weight: bold">Test of Strategy: Go to the online text of "The Art of War" by Sun Tzu at <a href="http://www.sonshi.com/learn.html" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://www.sonshi.com/learn.html</a> and select a short quote for interpretation. Select anywhere from one to four lines of text and then explain what that particular snippet of text means in the context of the Everquest experience on Legends. Post your quote and your interpretation here:</span>

I wield a Baton of Royal Stature. I took it from a named Sarnak in Chardok after I had slain him. Much of my equipment came from mobs, not something I produced myself. In this way I am using the resources my enemy provides to fortify myself and to defeat further enemies.

<span style="font-weight: bold">Test of Patience: After you've completed your application we'll move it to a private forum for discussion. We'll generally try to post a decision as soon as you've grouped with us about 5 to 10 times, so please be patient while we discuss your app.</span>

<br />
Well I didn't have to wait at all!  I checked the application status sticky thread and I KNOW I've been rejected.  No patience needed here!
