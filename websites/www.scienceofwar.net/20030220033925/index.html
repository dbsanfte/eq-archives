<p>I got a tell last night from a former sow applicant who had seen the zone-wide GM announcement about SoW's ascent to Tier 8. The person told me, "Took ya a year to do what [my guild] is about to do in 2 months, quite a feat. :)" First of all, <a href="http://www.gargoyles.org/images/7%20Envy.jpg">envy</a> is so unbecoming. Second of all, we did this our way. We never guilded someone we wouldn't want representing the Science of War tag. We never let go of our standards in our quest to move up the tier ladder and into Vex Thal. We did this without compromising our core values, and for that reason it was a very satisfying victory for all of us who had persevered while other guilds flashed in the pan. Is it possible to select 89 quality people in a single month? Doubtful. Our victory was our vindication.</p>

<p>Hell, even the snakes of Ssra were <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/images/20030205_commanderZ.gif">talking smack</a> as our team burned a path through the temple to the throne of its leader, the Emperor. We subdued his guards and quickly declared martial law, forcing him to surrender his <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=4719">riches</a>. We've now got 40 people keyed and ready to enter Vex Thal which represents more than half of the guild. We'll have to let some planar rifts rot on our next kill of him (apps finish those rings!). It's pretty nice not having a roster of 100 folks. Oh, and Vex Thal? Here's the <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/images/20030205_vexthal.gif">first glimpse</a> of the promised land. Exciting, ne?<br>

<p>[Thu Jan 30 - Sun Feb 02 2003]<br><i>Thursday:</i> Having squashed the bugs in the 
previous night, the guild felt confident in their ability to overcome what new 
obstacles Mr. The Cursed had in store for us. We lay the smack down on Mr. The Cursed's friend Glyphed and Exiled then proceed to plow into him. Wow! What a 
challenging fight. Going into the battle with no previous knowledge of what to 
expect from this bugged event, we lost a couple of clerics and a few other key 
class members. It didn't take us long to get a grip on what was up. We got a 
handle on it, and quickly put this fellow in the grave. After owning Mr. The 
Cursed, we proceeded to take out Grieg once again. How many times do we have to 
own this fool before he stops taunting us? You can find the loot

piled into ToV. With only one shaman in tow, we ended up taking out not only 
Aaryonar, but also four other dragons. Some great loot dropped that you can

<p>[Wed Jan 29 20:02:69 2003] We got the notification early. Swarming to our 
location we entered that ugly pyramid with unease of what was to become of us 
later that night. There was constant whispering about a known bug that was terrorizing this ancient temple. 
Some whispers mention that this bug had taken out more than a hundred adventurers in the last 
day. Poised in the antechamber we learned that there was another bug in the 
midst of this pyramid, and it was nastier than the one in the rumors. This one 
supposed makes your wounds invisible to those around you, and prevents you from 
being able to heal yourself. Things were looking fairly grim, until we heard 
Vova's patented mangina rally call to arms. This pumped our spirits up, and into 
the High Priest's lair we rushed. Through an almost flawless victory, Vova the 
banshee Iksar died early on in the battle, we defeated that snake and humbly 
said farewell to the bug until.....</p>
<p>...The guild roamed the halls behind the noblemen and women of Storm Isle, 
awaiting any second for the first of the two evil Rhag twins to come into view. 
Ressurecting their dead, healing their wounded, and buffing the adventurers we 
were hoping to speed up their slaying of these two adversaries. They plowed 
through them like true champions, and walked away with some pretty decent 
equipment upgrades. As the second of the Rhag twins fell, a scream echoed 
through the structure, and we knew it was our turn. The Arch Lich wanted pay 
back, and Science of War was just the guild to give it to him. In little time we 
ascended the pyramid and entered his room. Set up our positioning and flawlessly 
killed this ugly serpent in record time! What can we look forward to tonight in 
the buggy lair that is Ssra? Will our adventurers overcome these bugs once again 
to walk away victorious?</p><br>

This update is not chronological. It's been a week since we ventured into NToV, but ever since our most recent Aaryonar kill, I couldn't shake this feeling of deja vu that hit me when I saw Aaryonar whip his snapping jaws about on a long neck as he ravaged our womenfolk and defiled our poor tanks. A couple days later I was trying to find that Brittney Spears CD that Torelorm had loaned me and came across an old VCD for <a href="http://www.moviesforguys.com/sci-fi/reviews/overfiend.shtml">Urotsukidoji: Legend of the Overfiend</a> and it all clicked.
