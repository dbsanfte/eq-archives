<h3 class="title">GM Letter</h3>

Below is the text of a GM letter sent in return to a query about a particularly unfair GM ruling in which a second guild trained the PoAir zone in and then ran to the first tunnel to die. GM Kimbial assumed that since the second guild had corpses that were farther into the zone than we had that they were therefore first to enter the zone. Not a safe assumption. Sort of like GM Desilious's decision that this same guild must have been down in CoD(b) to get experience when they deliberately killed the Specter of Corruption (Bertox trigger) with 16 toons. Right. However, it's said that recognition is the first step on the road to recovery, so here's to hoping we'll see more fair GM decisions in the future. I don't want all decisions to fall in our favor, I simply want to be able to look back and say, "That was fair and given the evidence presented, the only way to handle the dispute." <blockquote> <p>Greetings, <p>I am sorry that there is some discrepancy with how GM Kimbial resolved the dispute in the Plane of Air on 8/7/2003. This incident occurred during my regularly scheduled day off, thus I was not available to guide the GM during this issue. After reading logs of GM Kimbial's conversations regarding this incident, I will agree that the decision was not made in a fair way. While we can not prosecute Vexare for the accused training because it was not witnessed by a GM or reported in a way that we could see without a doubt that they did, the resolution of the dispute over the npc you were both heading for should have been handled in a better and more fair, unbiased way. I will be discussing this with not only GM Kimbial but with all the Stormhammer staff to ensure they are all following the same procedures when handling disputes over zones or mobs. <p>I can only apologize to you and your entire guild that this was handled in such a poor way. Unfortunately I know that an apology will not fix it all, but it is the best I can offer along with my assurances that I will work this out with the Stormhammer team to hopefully not occur again. <p>This of course does not mean we will automatically be able to give the rights to a zone or npc to one particular group of people. There will be a fair and unbiased method used for this. <p>Sincerely, <p>Christina Delzer <br> CS Supervisor <br> Sony Online Entertainment <br> cdelzer@soe.sony.com <br> www.everquestlive.com <www.everquestlive.com> </blockquote>
