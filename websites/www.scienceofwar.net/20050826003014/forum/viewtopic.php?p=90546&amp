World of Warcraft Patch Notes 2005-03-22
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />

<br />
Diremaul
<br />
  Diremaul, a new dungeon for players level 56-60, is now open and
<br />
  ready for business. Diremaul is populated by a fierce tribe of ogres
<br />
  and is located in the western region of Feralas. Diremaul will be
<br />
  limited groups of no more than five players each.
<br />
 
<br />
New Outdoor Raid Bosses
<br />
  Two new outdoor raid bosses have been introduced to Azeroth. 
<br />
  Azuregos, a monstrous blue dragon, has landed in Azshara, while
<br />
  Lord Kazzak the demon can be found in the Tainted Scar of the Blasted
<br />
  Lands. 
<br />
 
<br />
Meeting Stones
<br />
  Meeting Stones are located outside of each dungeon to help players 
<br />
  find a group to adventure with in the dungeon. The meeting stone will 
<br />
  try to find you a viable five-person group by looking for a tank, a 
<br />
  healer, and so on. As time passes and you are unable to find a group, 
<br />
  the meeting stone will become less picky about who it groups you with.
<br />

<br />
Dungeon Player Caps
<br />
  All dungeons now have a cap on group size to limit the number of 
<br />
  players that may enter the dungeon. It was necessary to add this cap
<br />
  as raiding these dungeons trivialized much of the content. Because of
<br />
  this change we can now look to adding better loot to them during future
<br />
  content patches.
<br />

<br />
  With that in mind, the dungeons below now have the following caps:
<br />
  Onyxia/Molten Core - 40 members
<br />
  Blackrock Spire - 15 members
<br />
  Diremaul -  5 members
<br />
  All other dungeons in the game will be capped at 10 members.
<br />
  Several dungeons will be re-examined for balancing in light of this
<br />
  change.  In addition, will have their loot improved significatnly for
<br />
  the next content patch.
<br />

<br />
 General
<br />
- Previously, in many cases, a Block, Parry, or Dodge was translated 
<br />
  into a "Miss," thus causing confusion over actual miss rates.  We've 
<br />
  made the following changes in an attempt to be more clear as to what 
<br />
  is  actually happening in combat:
<br />
   * Block: All creatures will now report a Block on attacks from the 
<br />
     front, reducing damage caused instead of converting the attack into
<br />
     a "Miss." Creatures will no longer be able to Block attacks from 
<br />
     behind.
<br />
   * Dodge: Every time a creature Dodges, it will report a Dodge. We 
<br />
     will no longer translate a creature's Dodge of a rear attack to a 
<br />
     "Miss."
<br />
   * Parry:  All creatures will now report a Parry on attacks from the 
<br />
     front instead of translating them into a "Miss." Creatures will no 
<br />
     longer be able to Parry attacks from behind.  
<br />
- Blocking an ability that takes place on the next swing now blocks the
<br />
  normal amount of damage instead of all of it.
<br />
- Skill-up rate improved for bows, crossbows, guns, thrown, and wands.
<br />
- Improved line of sight for large creatures.
<br />
- In-game mail sent from GMs will now use official Blizzard stationery.
<br />
- The Drunk effect has been greatly enhanced.
<br />
- If you resurrect without releasing your spirit, your resurrection 
<br />
  timer will decrease normally.
<br />
- You can no longer accept a warlock summoning while you are in combat.
<br />
- Increased stun resistance will now also help resist some non-melee 
<br />
  based stun spells from creatures.
<br />
- Mounts now are Horde or Alliance restricted in the tooltip. We do 
<br />
  not intend to allow Horde players to ride Alliance vendor-purchased 
<br />
  mounts and vice versa.
<br />

<br />
 PvP
<br />
- Most humanoids NPCs have gained the ability to swim.
<br />
- Numbers and punctuation will not be passed through chat communication 
<br />
  to members of the opposing faction.
<br />
- Spells in PvP now have a slight increase in range and area of effect 
<br />
  when targets are moving. This should improve the overall usability of 
<br />
  spells and ranged attacks.
<br />
- Priests can no longer kill players with Shadow Word: Pain and Mind 
<br />
  Control in duels.
<br />
- Certain key NPCs (such as bankers and auctioneers) in the cities and
<br />
  main outposts are now harder to kill. Additionally, when they die, 
<br />
  they will respawn more quickly.
<br />
- Patrolling scouts that can see through stealth and invisibility have 
<br />
  been added to both Orgrimmar and Ironforge.
<br />
- Players under Mind Control pass reputation changes due to kills to 
<br />
  the controlling player, and do not receive the reputation
<br />
  changes themselves.
<br />
- You cannot see your enemies' buffs while you are charmed.
<br />
- Dueling players can now cast helpful spells on their allies 
<br />
  (but not vice versa).
<br />
  
<br />
 Druid
<br />
- Training costs adjusted. Total training cost was decreased.
<br />
- Rebirth - Casting time and mana cost reduced; now ignores 
<br />
  resurrection timers.
<br />
- Swiftshifting - Talent changed. When leaving a shapeshift form, the 
<br />
  next shapeshift form you take will have a 20%/40%/60% mana cost 
<br />
  reduction if used within 6 seconds.
<br />
- Gift of the Wild - This spell is now cast on the target's party.
<br />
- Cat Form - DPS increase at levels 40-60.
<br />
- New Ability (Cat Form): Ferocious Bite (available at level 32) - 
<br />
  Finishing move that causes damage per combo point and converts each 
<br />
  extra point of energy into additional damage.
<br />
- New Spell: Barkskin (available at level 44) - The druid's skin 
<br />
  becomes as tough as bark.  Physical damage taken is reduced. While 
<br />
  protected, taking damage will not cause spellcasting delays, but 
<br />
  non-instant spells take longer to cast and melee combat is slowed.
<br />
- New Ability (Bear Form): Frenzied Regeneration (available at level 
<br />
  36) - Converts an amount of rage into health every second for a 
<br />
  short duration.
<br />

<br />
 Hunter
<br />
- Training costs adjusted. Total training cost was decreased.
<br />
- Sandfury Guardians are no longer tameable.
<br />
- Fixed a bug where Hunter pets were sometimes unattackable by opposing 
<br />
  faction players.
<br />
- Fixed a bug where creatures were keeping their innate resistances 
<br />
  after being tamed.  This was unintentional and the fix will affect 
<br />
  all existing pets.
<br />
- Distracting Shot - Is now properly improved by the Efficiency and 
<br />
  Hawk Eye talents.
<br />
- You can no longer use Eyes of the Beast to leave a flight path.
<br />

<br />
 Mage
<br />
- Training costs adjusted. Total training cost was decreased.
<br />
- Improved Blizzard - Chill duration reduced to 1.5 seconds (4.5 
<br />
  seconds w/ Permafrost) and refreshes with each damage tick rather 
<br />
  than at the beginning of the spell. In addition, a target that 
<br />
  resists the damage will also resist the chill effect.
<br />
- Blink - Using this spell should no longer cause you to fall through 
<br />
  the world.
<br />
- Blink can now be used to escape more of the stun effects used by 
<br />
  creatures in the world.
<br />
- Blink is no longer useable on boats or zeppelins.
<br />
- Blast Wave damage radius fixed so damage properly extends to 10 yd.
<br />
- Dampen Magic - Duration and mana cost increased. Now castable on all 
<br />
  raid targets.
<br />
- Amplify Magic - Duration and mana cost increased. Now castable on all 
<br />
  raid targets.
<br />
- Frost/Ice Armor - Mana cost reduced.
<br />
- New Spell: Mage Armor (Available at level 34) - Allows for 30% of 
<br />
  mana regeneration to function while casting and increases resistance 
<br />
  to all magic schools. Does not stack with Frost/Ice Armor.
<br />
- New Spell: Conjure Water (Rank 7) (Available through quest at 
<br />
  level 60).
<br />
- Arcane Missiles: Fixed a bug where the spell would not function 
<br />
  properly against spell-reflecting targets.
<br />
    
<br />
 Paladin
<br />
- Training costs adjusted. Total training cost was decreased.
<br />

<br />
- Blessing of Sacrifice - Now castable on all raid targets.
<br />
- Blessing of Salvation - Now castable on all raid targets.
<br />
- Divine Intervention - Now castable on all raid targets.
<br />

<br />
 Priest
<br />
- Training costs adjusted. Total training cost was decreased.
<br />
- Holy Fire - Fixed a bug with the bonus damage gained from +fire 
<br />
  damage items. Such items now have a greater effect on this spell.
<br />
- Prayer of Fortitude - This spell is now cast on the target's party.
<br />
- Power Word: Shield - Now castable on all raid targets.
<br />

<br />
 Rogue
<br />
- A number of areas in the world now have footlockers in them.  
<br />
  These areas are in place for rogues to visit to increase their 
<br />
  lockpicking skills. The contents of these footlockers are only token 
<br />
  amounts of treasure, but they should allow for a more interesting 
<br />
  experience while increasing lockpicking skill. The difficulty of the 
<br />
  locks in the area correspond to the level of the zone, so if your 
<br />
  lockpicking skill is around 100, you would go to Durnholde Keep in 
<br />
  Hillsbrad. But if your skill is 250, you might head to Tyr’s Hand in 
<br />
  Eastern Plaguelands.
<br />
   * Hillsbrad Foothills - Durnholde Keep
<br />
   * Redridge Mountains - Lake Everstill
<br />
   * Ashenvale Forest - Zoram Strand
<br />
   * Stonetalon Mountains - Windshear Crag and Associated Mines
<br />
   * Wetlands - Murloc Camps
<br />
   * Desolace - Sar'theris Strand
<br />
   * Badlands - Angor Fortress
<br />
   * Swamp of Sorrows - Pool of Tears
<br />
   * Searing Gorge - The Slag Pit
<br />
   * Tanaris Desert - Lost Rigger Cove
<br />
   * Azshara - Bay of Storms
<br />
   * Eastern Plaguelands - Tyr's Hand (elite)
<br />
- Very high-end gems will no longer be acquired from junk boxes or 
<br />
  pickpocketing.
<br />
- Added a visual to Sword Specialization "proc" that will now show up 
<br />
  in the combat log as well.
<br />

<br />
 Shaman
<br />
- Training costs adjusted. Total training cost was decreased.
<br />
- Tremor Totem - Now creates the appropriate looking earth totem; 
<br />
  tooltip updated to clarify what effects it counters; radius of effect 
<br />
  increased; now pulses more frequently.
<br />
- Astral Recall - The tooltip now includes the home point the spell 
<br />
  will recall you to.
<br />
- We've changed the spell icon of several totem spells. They should now 
<br />
  all be unique.
<br />
- Searing Totem - Damage slightly increased.
<br />
- Reincarnation - No longer causes resurrection sickness.
<br />

<br />
 Warlock
<br />
- Improved Drain Mana - Will now report to the combat log all damage 
<br />
  caused.
<br />
- Inferno - The duration the Infernal is enslaved when first summoned 
<br />
  has been increased. The area of effect damage caused by the Inferno 
<br />
  spell, and all threat generated by it, will now originate from the 
<br />
  Infernal. The Infernal will now immediately attack targets within the 
<br />
  radius of the spell.
<br />
- Enslave Demon - Is no longer dispellable.
<br />
- Curse of Agony - Now benefits from items that increase shadow damage.
<br />
- Nightfall - Fixed a bug where the Shadow Trance effect was lost 
<br />
  without benefit. Previously, the talent had a 3%/4% chance of 
<br />
  triggering. It now has a 2%/4% chance of triggering, and the tooltips 
<br />
  have been updated to accurately reflect this change.
<br />
- Ritual of Doom - The death caused at the completion of the ritual no 
<br />
  longer causes durability loss.
<br />
- Firestone - Equipping Firestones will now increase damage caused by 
<br />
  fire spells.
<br />
- Spellstone - Equipping Spellstones will now improve your chance to 
<br />
  get a critical strike with spells.
<br />
- Fear - Mana cost changed to a percentage of base, which results in an 
<br />
  increase in cost.
<br />
- The Shadow Trance buff granted by the Nightfall talent will no longer 
<br />
  be used up by a shadowbolt that was in mid-cast.
<br />
  
<br />
 Warrior
<br />
- Training costs adjusted. Total training cost was slightly increased.
<br />
- Battle Shout - Rage cost reduced.
<br />
- Bloodrage - Health cost reduced.
<br />

  then reputation adjustments for killing creatures go to the 
<br />
  controlling player. 
<br />
- Larger factions (Horde, Alliance, Steamwheedle Cartel, etc.) now 
<br />
  report reputation increases and decreases across the board if so 
<br />
  affected. 
<br />
- Rivern Frostwind’s death no longer gives reputation adjustments for 
<br />
  Horde and Alliance factions. 
<br />
- Winterfall Pathfinders in Winterspring now give Timbermaw reputation 
<br />
  adjustments when killed. 
<br />
- The loss of overall reputation when a player loses reputation at the 
<br />
  higher tiers of a faction (Friendly, Honored, Revered, Exalted) has 
<br />
  been substantially reduced.  
<br />
    
<br />
 User Interface
<br />
- You can now have multiple action bars onscreen at the same time.   
<br />
- You can activate the additional action bars through the Interface
<br />
  options menu.
<br />
- You can now have quest completion criteria for the quests you are 
<br />
  currently on display on the game screen as well as in the quest log.   
<br />
  If you shift-click on a quest in the quest log, it will display the 
<br />
  completion criteria on the main game screen underneath the mini-map.
<br />
- You will now be able to tell how many other players in your group 
<br />
  have the same quest you do.  When you are in a group, it will display 
<br />
  the number of other players in the group who have the quest in 
<br />
  parenthesis to the left of the quest name.  If you mouse over the 
<br />
  quest name, it will display the names of the other players in the 
<br />
  party who have the quest in the bottom right hand corner of the 
<br />
  screen.
<br />
- Chat bubbles have been added to the game.  Now when a player or NPC 
<br />
  uses a /say or /yell chat command, it is displayed in the game screen 
<br />
  by default as a chat bubble as well as in the chat log. It displays 
<br />
  above the head of the character talking, but only if you can see the 
<br />
  character. This functionality can be turned off should you desire. 
<br />
  This functionality also exists for party chat, but is turned off by 
<br />
  default. Both options are turned on or off in the "Interface" options
<br />
  window.
<br />
- The /bug and /suggest commands have been removed from the game.
<br />
  This functionality was mainly for beta test purposes and not intended
<br />
  for our live audience.  To submit bug reports, please petition a GM.
<br />
  To make a suggestion about the game, please use the Suggestions forum
<br />
  on the WorldofWarcraft.com website.

<br />
- If the current round robin looter closes the loot window without 
<br />
  looting money, other players may loot the money.
<br />
- Targeting with the tab key has been fixed so hitting tab will acquire 
<br />
  creatures in a cone up to 30 yards in front of you or a circle 10 
<br />
  yards around you. It no longer only hits targets off to your left.
<br />
- When you are using group loot or need before greed looting systems 
<br />
  and are looting a bind on pick up item, the "This item will bind to 
<br />
  you" yes/no dialog box pops up after you click the "roll dice" 
<br />
  button, but before it accepts your roll.
<br />
- You can now lock your action bar so spells cannot be dragged out of 
<br />
  it while it is locked.  This functionality can be assigned to a 
<br />
  hotkey toggle in the keybindings UI.
<br />
- Trading with a player no longer closes his auction interface (you 
<br />
  get a busy message).
<br />

  item roll.
<br />
- An "unbind" button has been added to the key bindings page.

<br />
  inviting players into groups.  
<br />
- The guild interface remembers whether or not to show offline members 
<br />
  between sessions.

<br />
  backwards key, you will stop moving.

<br />
- You will get informative feedback if you try to share a quest with 
<br />
  someone who is already on the quest or has completed it.
<br />

<br />
  is available to the scripting system.  
<br />

<br />
  that it can't find a path to.

<br />
  turning.  
<br />
- Riding Kodos have new icons for when you are mounted.
<br />
- NPC chat log color changed to light yellow by default instead of gray, 
<br />
  which was not very readable.
<br />
- If you have files in the Interface\FrameXML folder, they will be 
<br />
  moved to Interface\FrameXML.old after a patch.  
<br />
- After the game is patched, you will be prompted to disable addons 
<br />
  that are out of date.  
<br />
- Added IsMovable(), SetMovable(), IsResizable(), SetResizable() member 
<br />
  functions to frames in the scripting system.  
<br />
- Added the "pcall" and "xpcall" functions to the UI scripting system.
<br />
- The .toc file for addons supports a new keyword: "DefaultState," 
<br />
  which can be enabled or disabled, and specifies whether or not an 
<br />
  addon is enabled or disabled by default when first installed.
<br />
 
<br />
 World Environment
<br />
- The bridges in northern Stranglethorn Vale are now fixed so they will 
<br />
  not dismount you when you ride across them.
<br />
- The names of many more points of interest have been added to various
<br />
  area maps.
<br />
- The Ashenvale, Felwood, and Azshara Crater areas are using a new 
<br />

<br />
  objects.

<br />
- Characters dying in the instanced portions of Blackfathom Deeps, 
<br />
  Scholomance, Maraudon, Onyxia's Lair, and Ragefire Chasm will now 
<br />
  correctly receive a corpse marker in the minimap and see the message 
<br />
  letting them know that they need to enter the instance before they 
<br />
  will be able to resurrect.
<br />
- The Argent Dawn base at the southern edge of the Western Plaguelands 
<br />
  is now named Chillwind Camp.
<br />
- Quartermaster Miranda Breechlock in Eastern Plaguelands is now in a 
<br />
  more accessible position. 
<br />
- Krinkle Goodsteel in Gadgetzan no longer repairs durability damage.

<br />
  durability repair services.
<br />
- Reagent Vendors have been added to Feathermoon Stronghold and Camp

<br />
  buttons.
<br />
- Hunter pets immediately gain training points when they level up.
<br />
- Creatures that are quickly respawning to repopulate an area will 
<br />
  often wait a few seconds after they spawn before attacking 
<br />
  players.
<br />
- Fixed bug where Seal Fate and Blood Frenzy were giving two combo 
<br />
  points instead of one.
<br />
- You can no longer disenchant an item while you have the disenchant 
<br />
  loot window open for another item, which caused you to lose the 
<br />
  original item and its loot.
<br />
- Fixed bug where Primal Frenzy was giving 10 rage instead of five.
<br />
- Fixed bug where melee weapon abilities were causing durability 
<br />
  damage to ranged weapons.
<br />
- Fixed a bug where abilities that give extra attacks, like the paladin
<br />
  Reckoning talent, could cause the following swing to take longer than 
<br />
  it should.
<br />
- Fixed a bug where instant melee attacks were not blockable.
<br />
- Fixed a bug where "On Next Swing" melee attacks (e.g. Heroic Strike)
<br />
  that were blocked were fully blocked instead of having their damage 
<br />
  reduced by the block amount.
<br />
- Fixed a bug where off-hand attacks were being skipped when using 
<br />
  "On Next Swing" melee attacks.
<br />
- Fixed a bug where Ammo Pouch and Quiver bonuses were stacking 
<br />
  together.  Now only the better bonus should be considered.
<br />
- Fixed a bug where Quivers and Ammo Pouches were granting a larger 
<br />
  haste bonus than intended in some cases.
<br />
- Items like the Eye of the Beast will correctly increase your spell 
<br />
  critical hit chances.
<br />
- Players will no longer become stuck behind a structure in the Ruins 
<br />

<br />
  have to get a replacement signature.
<br />
- Turning in a guild charter with the same name as an existing guild 
<br />
  will no longer destroy the charter.  You can then rename your charter

<br />
  monitoring your auctions at the auction house.
<br />
- The auction interface now displays the gold, silver, and copper 
<br />
  values for all items, even if those values are zero.  This should 
<br />
  make it more difficult to "hide" an item that costs several gold 
<br />
  among items that only cost several silver, for example.
<br />
- Items with charges now work properly from the action bar.
<br />

<br />

<br />
- World of Warcraft Client Patch 1.2.4 (2005-02-22)
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
 
<br />
- We have deployed a client-side change that should improve 
<br />
  performance when large numbers of players are gathered in a small 
<br />
  area of the world. No other changes are included with this emergency 
<br />
  patch.
<br />

<br />

<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />

<br />
  PvP Duels
<br />
  Dueling across factions remains intact in the patch, in consideration
<br />
  of players' desires to duel members of the opposing faction.
<br />
  
<br />
  *This is a minor patch to address localization issues discovered 
<br />
  during the European beta test. These changes affect localized text 
<br />
  strings for French and German versions of the game only, and players 
<br />
  in other regions will not see any changes to the game.
<br />
  
<br />

<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
- World of Warcraft Client Patch 1.2.2 (2005-02-15)
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />

<br />
  
<br />
  Paladin
<br />
  Seal of the Crusader: Fixed a bug where damage per swing was 
<br />
  increasing instead of decreasing when Seal of the Crusader was active.
<br />
  This resulted in a dramatic increase in damage per second (DPS) that 
<br />
  was unintended.  The tooltip for the spell displays the intent of 
<br />
  the spell:
<br />

<br />
  "Fills the Paladin with the spirit of a crusader, granting additional 
<br />
  attack power.  The Paladin also attacks faster, but deals less damage 
<br />
  with each attack."
<br />

<br />
  The overall increase in DPS from Seal of the Crusader should only 
<br />
  result from the increase in attack power and not from the increase in 
<br />
  attack speed.  We understand this is a significant decrease in the 
<br />
  power of this spell, but was a necessary bug fix to ensure both 
<br />
  overall game balance and the viability of different Paladin Seals.
<br />

<br />

<br />
  Localization
<br />
- Various text strings and audio have been corrected for the French and
<br />
  German versions of the game.
<br />

<br />

<br />
  Macs
<br />
- Fixed a bug that incorrectly enabled the vertex animation shader 
<br />
  option on some GPU's that do not support it. This bug was causing 
<br />
  player character models in-game and in the character selection screen 
<br />
  to appear invisible or distorted.  The fix should benefit users with 
<br />
  NVIDIA GeForce 2MX or 4MX GPU's and ATI Radeon 7000/7500 GPU's.  It 
<br />
  should no longer be necessary to manually turn off the vertex 
<br />
  animation feature on these systems - it should now be off and 
<br />
  disabled automatically.
<br />

<br />

<br />
  Bug Fixes
<br />
- Group loot has been fixed to work as originally intended. It will now
<br />
  work exactly like round robin does, with the exception that when an 
<br />
  item of threshold level or above drops, it will use the auto-rolling 
<br />
  system. (Prior to this fix, when in group loot mode, the round robin 
<br />
  system was only being used for items (all players could loot coins), 
<br />
  which was rather confusing).
<br />
- Fixed a group loot permission bug that was telling players they did 
<br />
  not have permission to loot.
<br />
- Fixed a bug that was causing the game to freeze when scrolling 
<br />
  through auctions in the Auction House.
<br />
- Murlocs play the drown animation when they die underwater now.
<br />
- Onyxia correctly hovers instead of standing in midair.
<br />
- You can target vocal emotes again.
<br />
- Pets and summoned creatures attacking enemies will now tap the 
<br />
  enemies for their owners.
<br />
- Fixed a bug with Troll Shamans and the Berserk ability. Troll Shamans 
<br />
  can only go Berserk when they are in the wounded state.
<br />
- Rogues now correctly gain Lockpicking skill from items picked in the 
<br />
  trade window.
<br />
- Quests that require you to follow/escort an NPC will only complete 
<br />
  when you arrive at the designated area.
<br />
- Horde and Alliance members cannot duel with each other regardless of 
<br />
  realm type.
<br />
- Herbs and mineral nodes will remain active if they are not fully 
<br />
  emptied.
<br />
- Fixed a bug that was giving higher damage-per-second (DPS) to 
<br />
  Steelarrow Crossbow and Blackcrow than was intended.
<br />
- Sell prices on Hypnotic Blade, Illusionary Rod, Mantle of Doan, and 
<br />
  Robe of Doan have been lowered.
<br />
- Players who have completed the quest to summon Kirtonos may now 
<br />
  obtain the Blood of Innocents from Doctor Theolen Krastinov.
<br />
- The tooltip for the Warrior's Intercept ability has been updated to 
<br />
  reflect the proper rage cost. Using Intercept now requires 10 rage, 
<br />
  not 15 rage. The tooltip now accurately reflects that.
<br />

 Happy Holidays!
<br />
  The holidays are here and the citizens of Azeroth are celebrating the 
<br />
  occasion with festive decorations and winter time activities.  Keep an
<br />
  eye out for some fun and exciting surprises throughout the world!
<br />

<br />

<br />
 New Dungeon - Maraudon
<br />
  In the vast gray of Desolace lies the earthen tomb of Zaetar, fallen 
<br />
  Keeper of the Grove and son of Cenarius.  Zaetar rejected his Keeper 
<br />
  heritage when he joined with the princess of the chaotic earth 
<br />
  elementals, Theradras. Their unholy union gave birth to the misshapen 
<br />
  and cursed centaur, who promptly slew their father for his part in 
<br />
  their misbegotten creation. Fearful of Cenarius' wrath, the 
<br />
  grief-stricken Theradras sequestered her dead lover's body in her 
<br />
  secret sanctuary, the Crystal Caverns of Therramok, where she watches 
<br />
  over him to this day. Travelers who come to Desolace have little 
<br />
  trouble spotting Zaetar's tomb, for the blessing of nature that 
<br />
  permeates his being transformed his resting place into a verdant 
<br />
  paradise of flora and tranquil pools. Today, this tomb is now trodden 
<br />
  by the hooves of Zaetar's children, who have claimed this great cavern 
<br />
  as their sacred stronghold Maraudon.
<br />

<br />
  Maraudon, a level 40-49 dungeon in Desolace, is now open and ready for
<br />
  business.
<br />

<br />

<br />
 Cloak &amp; Helm Graphics
<br />
  There are now interface options that let you not display your helm 
<br />
  and/or cloak on your character. These options will allow a player to wear a 
<br />
  cloak or helm, but not have it show up in the game world. The check 
<br />
  boxes to control this functionality are in the Options menu under 
<br />
  "Interface Options."
<br />

<br />

<br />
 General
<br />
- Players will now receive credit for killing a monster even if 
<br />
  they die during battle.
<br />
- Players will now be able to purchase and train mounts from other 
<br />
  races in their faction.  However, you will first need to obtain 
<br />
  "exalted" reputation status with that race in order to do so.  
<br />
  Mounts of the opposing faction are not available for purchase.
<br />
- A "Looking for Group" channel has been added. Additional improvements 
<br />
  in looking for group functionality will be added in future patches.
<br />
- Daze chance has been reduced in degrees depending on the level of the 
<br />
  monster versus the level of the player.  Thus, a monster will have a 
<br />
  better chance to Daze a player equal in level than it would Dazing a 
<br />
  player five levels higher.
<br />
- If you die in Molten Core, you will now be able to retrieve your 
<br />
  corpse at the Blackrock Depths instance line.
<br />
- Several instance bosses and sub-bosses have had their levels slightly 
<br />
  lowered.
<br />
- Giant Clams in the Vile Reef now drop Blue Pearls.
<br />
- Spell Reflection no longer reflects abilities.
<br />
- You can initiate a trade by dropping money onto a player.
<br />
- You can no longer select targets while under the effects of charm.
<br />
- Most non-elite creatures in non-instanced areas of the world have had 
<br />
  their hit points slightly increased starting from level 20.
<br />
- Messages in the chat window provide feedback when you are getting 
<br />
  drunk or sober.
<br />
- Skill gain messages will no longer appear for auto-ranking class 
<br />
  skills when you gain a level.
<br />
- Training costs for all classes are in the process of being rebalanced.  
<br />
  For this patch, training costs have been adjusted for the Rogue and 
<br />
  Warlock classes and we will be making similar adjustments to all 
<br />
  classes in the future.
<br />

<br />

<br />
 Talents
<br />
- Damage bonus for the Warrior's One-Handed Weapon Specialization 
<br />
  (Protection tab) increased to 2% per rank.
<br />
- Amount of threat generated by Shield Bash when Shield Discipline is 
<br />
  active has been increased.
<br />
- Mortal Strike changed to deal weapon damage + a flat amount (85, 110, 
<br />
  135, 160) instead of percentage-based damage.  Additional ranks 
<br />
  available on Warrior trainers.
<br />
- A bug causing the Hurricane talent to not require channeling has 
<br />
  been fixed. This spell now correctly requires channeling.
<br />

<br />

<br />
 Player versus Player
<br />
- Gurubashi Arena - The arena in Stranglethorn Vale has been changed so 
<br />
  that free-for-all PvP will only take place on the floor of the arena, 
<br />
  and no longer in the stands or on the entrance ramp.  Please keep in 
<br />
  mind that on PvP realms, members of the opposite faction can still 
<br />
  attack you anywhere in the arena because Stranglethorn Vale is a 
<br />
  contested area.
<br />
- There is now a short countdown before a duel starts.
<br />

<br />

<br />
 Professions
<br />
- Fishing for high-level zones has been restored.
<br />
- Monetary value of fished items sold to vendors has been significantly 
<br />
  reduced.
<br />
- Chances of acquiring green weapons and armor from fishing have been 
<br />
  reduced.
<br />
- Fishing profession now requires a minimum character level, like the 
<br />
  other professions do.  Any character who already has a fishing 
<br />
  profession past the intended level will not be affected.
<br />
- The recipes for Heavy Mageweave Bandage, Runecloth Bandage, and Heavy 
<br />
  Runecloth Bandage can be learned by visiting your faction's Artisan 
<br />
  First Aid questgiver.
<br />
- Sell prices on Runecloth Bandages and Heavy Runecloth Bandages have 
<br />
  been reduced.
<br />
- Expert First Aid books moved to a more appropriate vendor for the 
<br />
  Horde. New vendor is still within the same general area as the 
<br />
  previous one.
<br />

We don't have any native way to shake hate when we deal too much damage or incur too much from healing...  But it doesn't really matter now.  I can reincarnate with a clean hate rating, and maybe even some extra mana to boot.

I'm sure there will be nerf cries soon about it-  I'm already reading stories from PvP land where someone finally manages to kill a shaman and they just pop back up and kill their attackers.</span><br /><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

				<td colspan="2" height="100%" valign="top"><span class="postbody">The fear nerf for warlocks was unfortunate.  Fear went from a relatively low cost (~85 mana) to a relatively high cost (~190, roughly equivalent to howl of terror).  
<br />

<br />
While subjectively, the increase isn't large, I only use fear as an Oh SHIT situation where I am out of life and mana (hp &lt; 10%, mana = 1%).  The low cost before meant that I could usually get off one fear and give myself half a chance of escaping even when I was almost completely out of mana.  
<br />

<br />
That option has been removed.  Now, in order to cast fear, I would have to life tap to have enough mana to cover the cost.  If I am in the situation to cast fear, I can't afford the HP cost of life tap.  Life Tap takes roughly 10% of available HP and converts this to mana.  In the situation described above, when I am already at or near 10% HP, to do so means death.  And since as a warlock, I rarely soul stone myself anymore (only when soloing), I will be doing a lot more CR’s in the near future. This change has made fear a much less viable option for escape, and warlocks have very few viable escape options as it is.  
<br />

<br />
The enslave demon change is very nice.  It removed one of the deadlier counters to enslave demon.  
<br />

<br />
The Curse of Agony change is very nice indeed - will up DPS of warlocks considerably.  I routinely use +shadow damage potions and items to great effect.  I am very happy about this change.  My only concern is how it will affect agro generation.
<br />

<br />
The shadow trance change could very nice - will have to test to make sure.  Theoretically, it should now be possible to cast two shadow bolts in a row if you were casting and nightfall procs.</span><br /><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<br />

<br />
Before the patch, reincarnate was almost completely useless for anything except for wipe recovery, as it was immediately followed by 10 minutes of rez sickness...  Resulting in 20% HP and MP from an already reduced mana pool (because of sickness).
<br />

<br />
Post patch, not only do I reincarnate with no horrible side effects, but the HP and MP recovered can be sizeable...  At level 44, my HP is around 2500, and my MP is sitting at a little above 5000.  If you do the math, I come out of reincarnate with 1k mana- roughly enough to heal about 3k HP, or toss around 5 totems.  2 times in the last week, I reincarnated with more mana than I died with.</span><br /><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
