A guild run to clear Scholomance tonight resulted in an interesting new drop. The Ancient Bone Bow. This looks like something added in the recent patch. Maybe a server first? Either way, this thing is STYLISH.

I've managed to come by some nice armor shots from the Test Center server. This stuff is looking good. Unfortunately, I only have the Alliance faction armor, but there are a few shots of the tier 1 and 2 Epic armor as well.

This stuff looks really good. Particularly the leather. I can only hope the Horde gear is as impressive.

MMOs are gonna be the death of me. Haven't eaten since noon yesterday. 5 hours in Blackrock Spire tonight straight through dinner time. That's the lower part of the spire, by the way.  We're working hard on getting keyed up for UBRS. Tonight was a 10 player run. A little more than half SoW and the rest Hordish Behavior. The guys from HB played a solid game and we all had a blast. I'm looking forward to raiding with them again. We saw two set pieces drop (<A HREF="http://www.thottbot.com/?i=22067">Bracers of Valor</A> and <A HREF="http://www.thottbot.com/?i=18268">Beaststalker's Mantle</a>) and a host of blues and an endless list of green fodder.
<br />

<br />
Here are a few action shots:

Gizrul the Slavener comes running down the hall after you take out his mate.

This guy is huge, but Stomphoof is ready for a fight.

Mmm...wolf steaks would be mighty tasty right now.

<br />
The boss man himself. He died pretty fast.
<br />
I bet there are some juicy slabs you could carve out of him.
<br />
Wyrmthalak with Texas gravy. Wyrmthalak with bearnaise.
<br />
Grilled Wyrmthalak with pepper sauce. Wyrmthalak filet.
<br />
Or just a couple slices of wheat bread and mustard...oooh....
<br />

<br />
<IMG SRC="http://www.scienceofwar.net/flatline/images/dead_spiders.jpg">
<br />
A cathartic moment for the arachnophobes in the raid.
<br />
Man I could go for a...ah, no I guess that shot isn't really that appetizing.
<br />

<br />
Alnn did a fantasic job leading the raid force and handling pulls. Our clear time will improve with more repetition and believe me...there's gonna be repetition. We're looking at a lot more of these raids in the future. An endless stream of orcs and trolls and ogres and carnage and slaughter. Bring it on.
<br />

<br />
(Now to dig up some chow. All that raiding is hungry work.)

A lot has happened since the last guild news update. We have a new site banner (visible in the forums...the front page hasn't been updated yet), a <A HREF="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=9">new recruitment process</a>, <A HREF="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=11865">several new officers</A>, and a <A HREF="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=12134">big game patch</a>. Intrepid professors of the SoW <I>School of Advanced Tactical Studies</I> have ventured deep into Dire Maul and have emerged with bags of loot and stories aplenty. Meanwhile, the remainder of the guild has been leveling up rapidly. It looks like a large portion of the guild will reach 60 by the early half of April, way ahead of schedule. Larger guild raids aren't far away.
<br />

<br />
<B>New Members</B>
<br />

<br />
The guild has adopted changes to the application review process, based on our experience with handling apps so far. Applicants are now given a membership interview by guild officers after two weeks of initiate status. Based on the results of the interview, the feedback of the guild membership, and the involvement of the initiate we then decide to boot the player, give them another two weeks, or promote them to full member. This has helped us move through applications at a faster pace.
<br />

<br />
Since the last news update, we have promoted <strike>four</strike> five players to full member status:
<br />
<UL><LI>Razorr - <FONT COLOR=#777777>Hunter</FONT>
<br />
<LI>Najira - <FONT COLOR=#777777>Priest</FONT>
<br />
<LI>Figleaf - <FONT COLOR=#77777>Druid</FONT>
<br />
<LI>Junckey - <FONT COLOR=#77777>Rogue</FONT>
<br />
<LI>Ireg - <FONT COLOR=#777777>Warrior</FONT></UL>These new members have all demonstrated adaptability, intelligence, and skill. Congratulations and welcome to the ranks!
<br />

<br />
<B>New Officers</B>
<br />

<br />
Science of War is proud to announce the promotion of two members to the officership:
<br />
<UL><LI>Phobeus - <FONT COLOR=#7777FF>Recruitment Officer</FONT>
<br />
<LI>Softwinna - <FONT COLOR=#7777FF>Recruitment Officer</FONT></UL>Professors Phobeus and Softwinna have been assigned the task of recruiting new applicants, receiving applications, and monitoring initiates. So far their results have been fantastic and there are a lot of new names in our applicant channel.
<br />

<br />
Being an officer in SoW is a bit different from your standard guild. We don't grant officer status as a reward for long service or to favorite members. Each officer fills a specific role defined by a job description and a set of monthly requirements. Any member can volunteer for an office, but they are responsible for meeting certain goals and quality standards to retain the position. Officers are then "paid" for their duties (usually through a periodic DKP bonus). This system forms an officer corps that shares the work involved in building and running a top tier guild.
<br />

<br />
<B>Membership Requirements</B>
<br />

<br />
We are now under phase 2 of the <A HREF="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=12021">Guild Level Calendar</A>. Applications will be accepted for players of any level, but initiates must be at least level <b>35</b> in order to qualify for full membership. There's still plenty of time for applicants from other servers to create a character on <b>Azjol-Nerub</B> and play with us!

Maraudon loot is on the menu. Click the image for a nice shot of the fallen corpse of the #1 bitch. Does that thing even qualify as female? Guest appearance by the Ninja Turtles on this run, where we managed to shell out an ass kicking on four inner Maraudon bosses for more loot than you can fit in Kraang's Technodrome. Or something.

We've been busy. The sacred coffers of the Scarlet Monastery have been pilfered, the ravaged city of Stromgarde has been invaded, and the crumbling depths of Uldaman have been pillaged. Loot and experience have flowed into our hands like water from the Southfury and the name "Science of War" is spoken with hushed tones in dark corners. Indeed, more than one centaur has spoken fearfully of "a woman named Lare who turns men into sheep" and other such legends of our might.

<br />
Applications are being accepted for all classes. Check out the <A HREF="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=11863">SoW Recruiting FAQ</A> for information on how to apply. We are currently under phase 1 of the <A HREF="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=12021">Guild Level Calendar</A>, so you must be at least level 20 for your application to be considered. We are a friendly, achievement focused guild with an emphasis on camaraderie and skill oriented play. We are a raiding guild and expect a certain level of attendance, but we also believe in maintaining the game-life balance.

APPLICANTS: You will need to keep up with the level calendar to earn a guild invite. If you are behind the calendar we cannot invite you but will instead allow you to remain an "initiate" until you catch up with us.

<br />
GUILD MEMBERS: If you are below the level calendar at any given date, you will not be able to participate in guild events. For instance, if you are below level 45 on or after May 01, you won't be invited to any guild raids that might happen after that date. This means that you will not earn DKP either.

      <td>It looks like the recruiting season is off to a great start. Here are a few frequently asked questions.
<br />

<br />
<b>Q</b>: Why do you require a written application? 
<br />
<b>A</b>: <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=9">Read the first section here</a>
<br />

<br />
<b>Q</b>: What phat lewt can you give me?
<br />
<b>A</b>: Unfortunately, many WoW players seem to have come from the game of Diablo and lack the circumspection required for true MMO loot-whoring. The proper way to ask this question is "do you do DKP or loot council?" The answer is neither. We're not yet to the point where we're raiding regularly. The focus right now is on recruiting good people and levelling all of them to 60. You have gotten better at loot whoring! (1)
<br />

<br />
<b>Q</b>: What is the guild tabard? 
<br />
<b>A</b>: We heav a rilly big mean DRAGONZOR on teh taburd he kix ur azz!!! OMG WTF STOMP DRAGON STOMP! But really, we have a gay, (and by that I mean very happy) <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=11895">hot pink heart</a>. It's just a reminder that not everything should be taken seriously and that we all need to show each other a little more love every day. 
<br />

<br />
<b>Q</b>: What is the guild theme song?
<br />
<b>A</b>: It changes by the moment, but presently, it's "<a href="http://wm.warnermusic.com/Sweden/Svenskt/gunther_dingdongsong_hi.wmv?">You Touch My Tra La La</a>" (caution, mild male nudity)

      <td>Now that the website is set up (mostly), we're beginning to kick recruiting into overdrive. Here's an overview of the SoW recruiting process. 
<br />

<br />
<b>How a Recruit Becomes a Member</b><ol>
<br />
<li>The recruit should read as much as possible <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=23">About Science of War</a>. Recruits need to understand who we are and what we're about. We're definitely not the right guild for everyone! We tend to attract focused, mature players who want more out of their gaming experience.</li>
<br />

<br />
<li>If you're still interested, stop by the forums and <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=9">read the application instructions</a>.</li>
<br />

<br />
<li>Fill out an application!</li>
<br />

<br />
<li>After you have filled out an application, get in touch with SoW in the game. We'll invite you to the guild as an "Initiate" immediately. As an initiate, you will have no access to guild chat, but you will have a Science of War tag. Your evaluation period begins once you become an initiate. (For more information about how the guild is run, <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=11865">see "Who's running the show around here?"</a>.</li>
<br />

<br />
<li>We then observe your behavior and try to get to know you to see if you'd be a good fit. You will be invited to guild events and in general should make every effort to be there.</li>
<br />

<br />
<li>If we like you and you like us, you will be invited to the guild as a full member. This is where the fun starts.</li>
