<h3 class="title">The SoW Milkshake Brings All the Boys to the Yard</h3>

<p>Kelis welcomes all the boys to the yard -- 380 of you have registered on the forums in the past few days just to view (and presumably copy) the wonderful strats located there. Enjoy.</p>

<p>(Tangent) In mathematical terms, a vector is a quantity in which both the magnitude and the direction must be stated. The vector of a car is therefore its speed (usually expressed in terms of miles per hour) and its direction (usually a compass direction).</p>

<p>What is the vector of guild progression in Everquest, and how does that vector's magnitude and direction correlate to the publication of strategy guides? Clearly, if the stewards of the game had their way, spoiler sites would not exist because they speed up the rate at which players chew through the content that they have paid salaried employees to create.</p>

<p>For example, if a designer in San Jose is paid $70,000 per year to create levels and encounters, a developer is paid $80,000 per year to write the triggers and so on behind those levels, and a QA person is paid $45,000 per year to make sure everything's working (this is theoretical, we all know that Sony is too cheap to pay for proper QA), these people are expected to produce content that is going to keep people playing the game for longer than the total sum of money Sony paid them to create that content. To put it another way, if Sony spends $2 million creating and marketing an expansion called Gates of Discord, they expect it to bring revenues (consisting of new sales, subscription renewals, and character transfers) equal to roughly $3 million. This is how they make money.</p>

<p>Of course, these calculations depend on a certain content consumption vector. How long will it take players to consume the content that's produced? As many of us know, players in early Everquest reached the "end game" far faster than designers thought they would, and the first instance of the dragon called Lord Nagafen to fall was unitemized. The designers had underestimated the player content consumption vector.</p>

<p>And so, with the publication of such a massive library of strategies, what happens to this vector? It certainly speeds up, but by how much? What are the monetary implications of this? On most servers the Elemental Planes are already too crowded. This may make them more so, but may also force some of the guilds that currently farm the planes into the next expansion, where they will eat through the content that much faster, hastened by the newcomers nipping at their heels.</p>

<p>Vectors and milkshakes, oh my.</p>
