      <td>It looks like the recruiting season is off to a great start. Here are a few frequently asked questions.
<br />

<br />
<b>Q</b>: Why do you require a written application? 
<br />
<b>A</b>: <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=9">Read the first section here</a>
<br />

<br />
<b>Q</b>: What phat lewt can you give me?
<br />
<b>A</b>: Unfortunately, many WoW players seem to have come from the game of Diablo and lack the circumspection required for true MMO loot-whoring. The proper way to ask this question is "do you do DKP or loot council?" The answer is neither. We're not yet to the point where we're raiding regularly. The focus right now is on recruiting good people and levelling all of them to 60. You have gotten better at loot whoring! (1)
<br />

<br />
<b>Q</b>: What is the guild tabard? 
<br />
<b>A</b>: We heav a rilly big mean DRAGONZOR on teh taburd he kix ur azz!!! OMG WTF STOMP DRAGON STOMP! But really, we have a gay, (and by that I mean very happy) <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=11895">hot pink heart</a>. It's just a reminder that not everything should be taken seriously and that we all need to show each other a little more love every day. 
<br />

<br />
<b>Q</b>: What is the guild theme song?
<br />
<b>A</b>: It changes by the moment, but presently, it's "<a href="http://wm.warnermusic.com/Sweden/Svenskt/gunther_dingdongsong_hi.wmv?">You Touch My Tra La La</a>" (caution, mild male nudity)

      <td>Now that the website is set up (mostly), we're beginning to kick recruiting into overdrive. Here's an overview of the SoW recruiting process. 
<br />

<br />
<b>How a Recruit Becomes a Member</b><ol>
<br />
<li>The recruit should read as much as possible <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=23">About Science of War</a>. Recruits need to understand who we are and what we're about. We're definitely not the right guild for everyone! We tend to attract focused, mature players who want more out of their gaming experience.</li>
<br />

<br />
<li>If you're still interested, stop by the forums and <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=9">read the application instructions</a>.</li>
<br />

<br />
<li>Fill out an application!</li>
<br />

<br />
<li>After you have filled out an application, get in touch with SoW in the game. We'll invite you to the guild as an "Initiate" immediately. As an initiate, you will have no access to guild chat, but you will have a Science of War tag. Your evaluation period begins once you become an initiate. (For more information about how the guild is run, <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=11865">see "Who's running the show around here?"</a>.</li>
<br />

<br />
<li>We then observe your behavior and try to get to know you to see if you'd be a good fit. You will be invited to guild events and in general should make every effort to be there.</li>
<br />

<br />
<li>If we like you and you like us, you will be invited to the guild as a full member. This is where the fun starts.</li>

Breaking records and going strong two months after release, everyone seems to at least know someone who's playing it. Not really a surprise, being situated in the popular Warcraft universe and being a product of Blizzard. But it's also pretty gentle with those of us who could never get into MMOs before, who don't like spending hours in front of the computer to get any sense of in-game accomplishment, and enjoy a colorful environment over something somber and Important.
<br />

<br />
With running on 88 servers located all over the nation, containing hundreds of thousands of players and providing thousands of quests, you need a lot of well-designed content to keep the masses happy. Blizzard is taking its reputation for post-release product support full-bore into WoW and has more than a few caves and monsters up its sleeves in the coming months. Sure, you've likely heard about Battlegrounds, the free PvP add-on we'll be seeing later this year, but since it's not just a simple arena, there's a lot to talk about. Even though they've written a lot about it already, there are always some new questions that will pop up. Instead of torturing ourselves with endless speculation, we asked them about a few things, and Tom Chilton, one of the designers, was kind enough to provide some answers. Of course, there are details they can't reveal yet because some things just haven't been finalized yet, but what can you do.
