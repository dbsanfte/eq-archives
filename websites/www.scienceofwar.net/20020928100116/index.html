We have reached a new nadir in SoW guild history. I am embarrassed to report that guild rangers have been throwing themselves with wonton abandon at the latest EQ Celebrity to get involved with the guild. First came all the Rallos Zek griefers who tried to cyber innocent guildmembers as a way to get into SoW after Vova stopped leading the Flowers of Happiness, and now Resolute is tearing his chainmail shirt open and begging Sunmoon of Ranger's Glade fame to autograph his sleek, hairless chest. Lucky for Resolute, Sunmoon's a good sport. Unluckily for Sunmoon, Resolute tends to spill his soup rather freely when anything touches his chest. You ever try to <a href="http://www.restassured.com/app.html">clean soup out of chainmail</a>?<br>

For the second time in a row SoW waltzed into the Arena at Kael Drakkal like we owned the place and we did own it. Well, we killed Vindicator anyway. In a near-perfect kill we took Vindi down with about 30 toons, a few factioners, and two bots. Here's me taking the screenshot too early. His health did reach zero percent at some point, I assure you. Grats to Uhnak on his Vindi BP.<br>

<p><b>Nathyn Illuminous and an Obligatory Ranger Joke</b><br>
Fun fight, no challenge from the Vampire dude in Katta, but check out that robe! I would say something about how that charisma might help Falrinth finally get laid or something, but it's been a while since we ragged on a ranger. Though rangers have come a long way as a class, making huge leaps in power with the SoL expansion, people still like to crack jokes about them being paper-tanks and so on. Old habits die hard, I reckon.<br>

Way back when we the guild was started we recruited people who were level 46+ and we set an aggressive levelling calendar that looked comfortably far-off: 60 by December 01. Now, months later, guildmembers are dinging 60 at a comfortable clip. Major congrats to Aubic (60 Wizard!), Ladred (60 Druid!) and Leoh (60 Warrior!) and Sturmwulf (60 Wizard!) for dinging 60 very recently. Average guild level now stands at 58.675675675675675675675675675676, more than a level ahead of our goal for October first. <br>

The guild's been doing lots of rings lately. I don't know if it's just a healthy interest in circular symbolism or what. Maybe Goldynstar can clue us in on the psychological implications of ring fixation, since she seems to have some experience.<br>
<img src="http://www.scienceofwar.net/images/20020901_krate_ros.gif"><br>
Anyways, the <i>other</i> Ring of Slime is a fun fight in Cazic Thule ... involving some high-HP mobs that drop some nifty loot. The final mob in the ring has so many HP, in fact, that he'll be at zero percent (but not dead) for a good 20-30 seconds, even with decent, non-zerg DPS.<br>
<img src="http://www.scienceofwar.net/images/20020901_ros_zeropct.gif"><br>
Grats Reynn on his new shoulders. Grats guildbank on the bracer. Would you believe that we had no guild warriors present who could use the bracer? Guess we'll have to give it to one of our rockin' new recruits as soon as they get in.<br>
<a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/images/20020901_ros_loot01.gif"><img src="http://www.scienceofwar.net/images/20020901_ros_loot01.gif" height="100" width="209"></a>

<p>The Ring of Gnome is yet another scripted event that takes place in Cazic Thule. I'll be doing a public spoiler for it since I'd like to see others trying this out with more frequency. I want to know if <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=13115">these very special gloves</a> ever drop, or if they've been moved to another mob's loot table. And finally, <a href="http://www.beproud.com/images/adult-cock-ring-redd-devil.jpg">we had one of these drop for us</a> when we were camping Loathexx's mom. Anybody know what it does?<br>

Naked barbarian lures a fish into his room, throws a few logs on the fireplace for romantic effect, grabs her by the gills and gets a bit of head. Kind of reminds me of a joke... An English taxidermist is sweating his way through the Australian outback when he comes across a bar. He staggers in between the beer swilling locals and in a well-educated voice asks the bartender, "May I have a gin and tonic, please, my good man." 
<p>One of the locals hears this and says to his mates, "Geez, cobbers, what kind of a fucking man's drink is that?" Then, turning to the Englishman the local yells, "Hey! You! Yes you, you fucking Pom! Gin and fucking tonic are you some fucking kind of a poofter or something?"
<p>"Ac...actually," the englishman, terrified, replies, "I'm a taxidermist."
<p>"Oh yeah? And what's a taxidermist, then?"
<p>"I mount d..d..dead animals."
<p>"It's alright, cobbers," says the local, turning to his mates, "he's one of us!"<br>

We run around blowing into our lutes and prancing about nimbly - it's no wonder most think Bards are quick to run from a fight. The truth is, Bards can sport HP and AC that rival our tankly brethren. The evidence is <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1405">here</a>.

Very recently, Srob, Boond, Koichi, and Resolute have all completed the legendary task of finishing their epic quests. Congratulations, guys! Pimped out and posing:<br>

Well ... I had a big update all typed out and then the browswer crashed and it was lost. Plus I can't sit down for long periods at a time after <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1202">the operation</a>. Got to keep the circulation going. So isntead of my usual novella, I'll tell you the story through pictures!<br>

We suspect that GM Vedan was paid to make concentration-breaking wisecracks during the trial:<br>
<img src="http://www.scienceofwar.net/images/20020808vedanwisecrack1.gif"><br>
We also suspect that certain mages had it in for certain clerics:<br>
<img src="http://www.scienceofwar.net/images/20020808rodstrategy.gif"><br>
We also suspect that Science of War will keep moving up, slowly but surely. We're no flash-in-the-pan guild that recruited 30 people all in one week, if you know what I'm saying:<br>
<img src="http://www.scienceofwar.net/images/20020808tier3.gif"><br>

<p>And finally... have we got a story to tell you about Hate ... but I'll save that for another update.<br>

GMs held <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1074">an event</a> a few nights ago to "re-open" the Sleeper's Tomb zone. At the event a number of players received "artifacts" (one-of-a-kind GM-crafted items). Congrats to Ladred on his Tunic of the Disciple!<br>
<img src="http://ladred23.homestead.com/files/DiscipleTunic.jpg"></p>

<p>According to folks at the <a href="http://www.stormhammer.org">Stormhammer community forums</a> the ST revamp is full of quests and new items. One poster wrote, "The revamped ST is predominantly a quest zone. NPC's have been re-itemized and now drop Velious armor gems (flawless diamonds, etc) as well as high end spells and, of course, Primal Weapons (now known as Prismatic Weapons). Old warder loot is not dropping from the new Dragons which have replaced them. A lot of the encounters seem to have been set up differently (for example: with the use of untargettable guard NPC's who activate as the bosses get lower in health). From early reports the many new quests in the zone are still being worked on but are nearing completion. One confirmed quest requires 10 different items to be collected within the zone for the reward. First appearances would indicate that this zone will be a hefty time-sink with the number of quests available. Despite this though the revamp does provide new content and playability to a zone which is currently under-played on servers who have awakened the Sleeper. It appears to be a good change to at least make Sleepers Tomb a fun zone both before and after waking the Sleeper."<br>

Found a couple of okay posts on the subject of guild failure and thought that I'd highlight them here, since it's a topic near and dear to the heart of anyone who has been on Stormhammer for more than a month. First, before you apply to be a guildmaster, please <a href="http://www.the-combine.net/articletemplate.asp?articleidentity=224">get a license</a>. Not saying I agree with the article, but it makes good discussion fodder and I like the point he makes about "rigorous" application processes. The article I really liked was <a href="http://www.the-combine.net/articletemplate.asp?articleidentity=216">this one on startup guild failures</a>.</p>

<p><b>Guild News... In One Breath</b><br>
Talicat Epic. Resolute Epic. Two triple-baggers in UP in two weeks. Halls of Testing broached (repeat tomorrow night). Actus' epic parts recovered. Vova and Leatherneck hit their three-month anniversaries! Mass guild wedding being planned. Tier-3 test date coming. Guild Epic Night 01. Guild Epic Night 02. The list of good news goes on.</p>

<p><b>Recruiting Update</b><br>
We've grown to the point where we are able to list the relative desireability of each class to us as a guild. Please see the <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=9">application thread</a> for an updated summary of our needs.<br>

The <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forums/forumdisplay.php?forumid=4">application process</a> to get into Science of War involves a "Test of Humor" that yields some real gems now and then. We'll be pulling some of the best ones out of applications and putting them here on the site. While we're working on that, here are a few to whet your appetite:</p>
<ol>
<li>From Vova's application: <a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/fhappyflowersfrm3.showMessage?topicID=415.topic">Gay Wookiz</a>
<li>From Actus's application: (members only for now!) <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forums/showthread.php?threadid=127">Poppers the Tragically Gay but Even More Tragically Sober Bard</a>
<li>From Sssakmakiel's application (members only for now!) <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forums/showthread.php?threadid=316">Toof an Toof's Nu Hat by Toof</a>
<li>From <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forums/showthread.php?threadid=887">Ahliana's application</a>: A couple choice quotes: (1) "The other day I was licking Jelly off some guy's cock and I thought to myself, "My God I am turning into my mother." and (2) "There is nothing as over rated as bad sex and nothing as under rated as a good shit."

The bard epic (like most epics) represents hours and hours of questing. It's a huge piece of work. Actus has just ONE fight left in his epic (the spawned Trakanon) and was performing a pre-final hand-in when disaster struck -- <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forums/showthread.php?threadid=883">he lost it all</a>. Those who helped Actus with his epic fights are encouraged to <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forums/showthread.php?threadid=884">submit testimonials, emails and petitions</a> to the effect of, "Yo -- this guy's legit -- I've watched him work on his epic for months now. He's honest. He did the quest. Please just give him his stuff back." Put it in your own words, please. Say something original and (hopefully) moving.

After overcoming a number of minor of technical glitches that spell death on a mob like Venril Sathir, we finally triumphed, earning us a spot at Tier One on the Legends ladder. This is only the first step and there are 7 more tiers to go, but we did it on our own terms -- by never giving up on our very high standards for what it means to be a guildmember of Science of War. We did more with less and we'll continue to keep moving up the ladder.</P>

<p>We also gave Tier Two (Zlandicar clone) a shot with our new and improved AE DR resist song, but it seems we experienced a wraparound effect -- most participants report being feared / dotted much more frequently at 350~ MR / DR than they were at 240 MR / DR (our previous attempt). We're scheduling our next tier trial (versus the Statue of Rallos Zek - Tier 3) a week from now.</p>

<p>Many thanks to the SoW guildmembers who made the trial a success: [Tue Jul 09 21:00:18 2002] Channel sowtt(21) members: *Vova, Loathexx, Uhnak, Actease, Koichi, Boond, Ladred, Quiksand, Shroomio, Keisha, Craniul, Mymic, Ordieth, Srob, Leatherneck, Talicat, Redsin, Zabanily, Resolute.<br>

Because raiding Hate-plane with 20-odd people you don't know (joint-raid) isn't difficult enough, we decided to zone in at the same time as an open raid, just to keep everyone on their toes. We lived JUST long enough to regret that decision. Once we escaped the choo-choo trains making regular stops at the zone-in and "safe" spots, we really got into a groove and tore up the first floor's mini-bosses including a brand new mob for a Legends-only <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/ranger/showthread.php?s=&postid=68153#post68153">Jaggedpine Quest</a>. We obtained epic parts for the Mage, Warrior and Rogue epics and a number of drops rotted. Oh, and a bard got jiggy with a spoon of mayo and a disembodied hand...<br>
