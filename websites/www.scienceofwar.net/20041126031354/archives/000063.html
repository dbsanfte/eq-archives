<h3 class="title">Housekeeping, Housekeeping? Can I Jerk You Off?</h3>

First, some guild housekeeping updates need to be made. Actus is now keeping the <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forums/calendar.php">guild calendar</a> up-to-date. Please check it. Second, new and old guild members alike should check the <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forums/showthread.php?s=&threadid=418">member to-do list</a>. There are a number of items that require the attention of every guild member, not least of which is <b>recruiting</b>.</p>

<p><b>Recruiting Update</b><br>
We've got about twice as many applications as we have open remaining slots for the month of June, and we're only three days into the month. Applicants are asked to please make an effort to group with us in xp groups and to attend our raids whenever possible. Applicant status is listed <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forums/showthread.php?s=&threadid=82">here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Hail, Ithiosar the Black</b><br>
Many in the guild -- indeed, <a href="http://pub116.ezboard.com/flegends11114frm1.showMessage?topicID=548.topic">many on the server</a> -- participated in an awesome GM event. Here's a <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/images/20020603_ithiosar_montage.jpg">photo montage</a> of some of what went on. I need someone to post a picture of the dragon to our forums so that I can add that to this update. Basically, here's what went down: GMs spawned a big mean dragon as the finale to a series of events that had been occurring for a couple of weeks. This dragon was red to level 60 and was situated in a cave in the Swamp of No Hope and was surrounded by level 50 drakes, level 55 and 56 black ravagers and level 60 guardian drakes.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.scienceofwar.net/images/20020603_have_fun_vedan.gif"></p>

<p>We assembled a very large pick-up and cross-guild force and managed to drop (Ithiosar the Fallen) who upon death spawned yet another (also red to level 60) dragon named Ithiosar the Black. Ithiosar the black quadded for nearly 900 and had an AE breath that dotted players for eight game hours at 100hp/tick. He could not be slowed and had a TON of hitpoints.  Needless to say, in our weakened state after Ithiosar the Fallen, he wiped us out. The open raid lost about 60 people to attrition because of the late hour and because of demoralization, so Township Rebellion came in to give it a shot -- with 25 people. They were wiped out on the first attempt (they got him to about 80 percent). They called in the rest of the guild (bringing their number to just under 50 players) and with the help of the remaining 25 pick-up participants, they wiped again. The dragon then despawned. </p>

<p>Players will be gathering at 8.00pm ET on Monday, June 03 for another attempt at Ithiosar, if he can be respawned.</p>
