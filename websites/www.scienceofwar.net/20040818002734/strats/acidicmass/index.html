<ul>

<p><li><b>Event Summary</b>: Here's another one of those events with crazy risk versus reward. With just six to 10 people you can obtain FTIV gloves for casters or a 100HP bracer for warriors. A nice rogue piercer drops too, and all of the drops are, in fact, droppable, meaning that this is a nice cash farm for a group of dedicated friends. You'll face four mobs as a part of this event. First you'll have to defeat a rooted trigger mob that's as easy as any other mob that an average experience group kills when in the sewers of Cazic Thule. Then you'll face a bubbling ooze. Then you'll face a boiling ooze, and finally you'll face an Acidic Mass.



<p><li><b>Spawn Tracking</b>: This is the easy part. Anybody can track this by invising up and swimming down to the location of the trigger. If you see two slimes stacked on top of eachother, the ring of slime is good to go! (See images below for an example of a RoS that is ready.) Caution: On the way to the trigger for the Ring of Slime several named mobs can spawn randomly -- the named will see invis. If no named are up (and most of the time none are) then it is 100% safe to track this by using invis. It respawns every five days.

<p><li><b>Duration of Raid</b>: This depends greatly on the size of your "raid" force and their gear and experience. If you're trying to single-group this, expect to take an hour and a half. With a raid of thirty people, this will take about 45 minutes to an hour if you make no mistakes.

<p><li><b>Getting There</b>: Take the Ogguk book to Feerrott and head south to the Temple of Cazic Thule. Once inside, make certain that there are no named alive on the way to the trigger (if there are you'll have to clear) then instruct your raid to invis up and move to the last torch before the green pool (see map below). 

<p><li><b>Buff Strategy</b>: You'll need to buff your magic resistance in order to resist the AE effects of the Acidic Mass. Everyone in the raid should aim for at least 250 MR buffed (and before bard song). Healers in particular need to take care to buff resistances. One unlucky AE at the wrong time and you'll lose your tank. 

<p><li><b>Melee</b>: 
	<ul>
	<li><b>A swirling ooze</b>: This is the rooted trigger for the event. It's cake. 
	<li><b>A bubbling ooze</b>: This is the second mob in the event. Unrooted. Fully slowable and easily healed by a single cleric. It has 30 to 50k hitpoints.
	<li><b>boiling ooze</b>: This mob is rooted, unslowable, and has about 150k hitpoints. You'll want a couple of healers watching your tank's health for this mob. 
	<li><b>Acidic Mass</b>: The final mob of the cycle. He's actually not that difficult to heal once slowed, and since he's rooted, you can and should slow him before engaging him. He triples for 850 max per hit. He's got 800k hitpoints so he'll take a while if you're trying to small-force him.
	</ul>

<p><li><b>Spells</b>:<br> 
<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><img src="http://lucy.fnord.net/gfx/gem_85d.png?1"></td><td valign="top"><a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=2132&source=Live">Acidic Current</a>: This AE spell is cast by the Acidic Mass. It's easily resisted at 250 MR on a level 65 toon -- so strive for AT LEAST that level of resistance. Send members of your raid force away if they do not have the requisite MR -- they'll just be a liability and soak up too much damage every time the AE goes off. Don't try this raid without appropriate resists on every member of the raid party. You will regret it.</td>
</tr>
</table>


<p><li><b>Triggered Events and Scripts</b>: There are a number of ways to approach the event. This is just one way to do it. If you've got an alternate method, feel free to <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=63749#63749">share it on our forums</a>. To use this method, you MUST have a mage and someone who can cast a disease dot (shaman, necro, or shadowknight). If you do not have one, you'll need to devise an alternate strategy (see the "Reader Tips / Alt Strats" section).

<ol>
<li>Make sure that you warn the zone that you're about to trigger the Ring of Slime event and that anyone who's near the zone-in will NOT be able to move out into Cazic Thule without clearing to their destination because the AE from the event will break their invis. This is really important -- broadcast the warning every five minutes if there are people in the zone with you. 
<li>Invis your raid and move down to the start point (see map).
<li>Begin clearing. You'll face two mobs immediately upon breaking invis with the potential for a roaming add. After you've cleared these begin clearing the green pool. If your puller is not experienced with pulling this, he's going to die or overpull -- expect up to six mobs at once depending on your puller's touch.
<li>Once the green pool is clear, make sure your dotter, slower, cleric and tank are grouped with the mage, then swim your dotter, slower, cleric and tank down to the trigger mob. Have everyone else INVIS and move to the "CoH point" marked on the map. 
<li>Kill the rooted trigger mob. A bubbling ooze pops. Slow him immediately and have the tank taunt him, but DO NOT DAMAGE him. You're going to CoH this mob.
<li>Begin to CoH the crew that's at the bubbling ooze. Once you're ready to pull the ooze to the CoH point, have the dotter cast his lowest-level disease dot on the ooze (the reason it must be a disease dot is because it lasts a long time and does relatively little damage).
<li>CoH the dotter and wait. Even though the dotter's removed from the mob's hate list on CoH, the next tick of his dot will stick him right back on there and the mob will attempt to path all the way from the depths of the green pool up to the CoH spot. It won't be able to figure this out, so some 30 to 45 seconds later it will warp right on top of the dotter. Why do all of this? Because there are NO MOBS in this section of Cazic Thule! That's a huge bonus when you're fighting a mob for 30 to 45 minutes.
<li>Kill the bubbling ooze. When it's low on health it will RUN! You need to nuke it down fast -- before it reaches the "fight spot" on the map below. if it gets too far up the ramp you'll be fighting other mobs at the same time. The whole reason we use the CoH strat is to avoid having to fight other mobs in the middle of our fight with the Acidic Mass. You COULD skip this whole CoH rigamarole and simply select a relatively unpopulated fight spot up in the tunnel between the green pool and the blue pool -- but you WILL have to crowd-control adds that spawn during the fight if you choose do to this.
<li>Back off when the boiling ooze spawns. This mob is rooted and you have some time to prep, rebuff, and make sure you're ready. The boiling ooze isn't slowable so you want to make sure you're ready to tank him. Once ready, kill the boiling ooze. As mentioned above, he's got about 150k hitpoints.
<li>Back off when the Acidic mass spawns! The Acidic Mass is rooted and hits pretty hard. You need to debuff him fully before you engage. When ready, hunker down for a long fight. He's got 800k hitpoints but isn't much of a challenge so long as he stays slowed and you keep your resistance to magic up.
<li>Loot up!
</ol>

<p><li><b>Healing Strategy</b>: This fight can be single-grouped with a (1) cleric, (2) druid/cleric, (3) shaman/enc, (4) warrior (5) mage and (6) DPS. That says a lot about what sort of healing you can expect to do: a single warrior will absorb all of the damage and two healers can keep him alive without too much trouble provided the healers have good mana regeneration and the warrior has taken care of his defensive AAs. If you aren't very well geared, you'll want to bring more people into the fight.

<p><li><b>Risk Management</b>: Single-grouping this fight is risky -- every member of the group is required to do a lot of healing, a lot of tanking, or a lot of damage. If you aren't well geared you'll want to double up on healers and tanks (4 healers, 2 tanks) and add more damage to reduce the risk of a mistake causing a wipe. 
<p>In the event you do wipe, you've got about thirty minutes to recover before the ring despawns. CR is pretty easy here becaues the named mobs do not see invis and because you can drag many of the corpses up in the tunnel right through the floor to the zone-in for rez and rebuff. Like wow. That's just another benefit of the fight spot chosen. Furthermore, none of the mobs in this ring see invis and this makes CR quite easy by any member of your raid party with reliable invis. Whatever you do, don't try to recover within line of sight of the Acidic Mass. If it sees you, it'll AE. If it AE's a newly-rezzed person, that person will die. It can get quite nasty, so make sure you've chosen a safe CR spot such as the zone in or the other leg of the tunnel. 

<p><li><b>Loot</b>: Here's why this event is worth doing. There are three nice pieces of loot and the rest of this is mostly junk. The top three pieces are listed first, and the junk is listed below. The good news is that all of the drops are droppable. If your raid party can't use them, they can be sold.

<p><li><b>Reader Tips / Alt Strats</b>: If you've got a tip or suggestion or correction to make, please <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=63749#63749">respond to this thread</a>. Here are a few alternate strategies. 
<ol>
<li>Instead of a CoH, a necro or shadowknight with a pre-nerf CoS can aggro the bubbling ooze and pull him safely through the tunnel and blue pool up to your waiting raid. He'll just need to cast on the mob from a distance and take off for the "CoH spot" marked on the map. Make sure he doesn't get so far ahead that he causes the mob to warp -- if this happens it'll likely warp onto him when he's surrounded by lots of KoS mobs and break his invis.
<li>Also instead of CoH, an SoS rogue should be able to toss a dart at the bubbling ooze and walk it back to the raid. The trick will be maintaining the right distance between the ooze (which walks rather slowly) and the rogue.
<li>If you don't want to CoH, use a necro or SK, or use a rogue, you can simply pull the mob up into the tunnel between the green and blue pools and fight him there. You'll need to devise a CC strategy however because you'll have to fight respawn once or twice during the long and tedious fight.
