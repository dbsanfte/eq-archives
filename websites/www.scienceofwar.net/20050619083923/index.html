<i>I stand atop a cold peak, far above the battle that rages below. The feint cries of dying elves reach my ears and my mind’s eye briefly envisions one of my Forsaken brothers taking a head as a symbol of his triumph. The snow at my feet is a slushy pink. Pools of blood steam under the glare of the afternoon sun. I am watching a horrible thing: an ancient elemental of ice rips into fleeing ranks of human soldiers with hate cold and eons old. What is this thing we have bound to our service? See how it seems to rip souls from flesh even before the victims fall lifeless to the earth? Such idle thoughts slip away as easily as they come. I do not care what pacts the Orcish warlocks have struck, nor the price: it shall not be paid in </i>my<i> blood.
<br />

<br />
I tighten my grasp on my frost-kissed sword and turn my thoughts once more upon the enemy. The Alliance is shattered. They do not even pause in their flight to recover their dead, much to my hungry brothers’ delight. Final victory in this wasteland is only a matter of time. They flee north to the keep that will soon become a charnel house. For a moment I feel a tinge of anticipation in my dead fingers, but perhaps that is merely the cold.
<br />

<br />
No matter, for now I ride. To the north. To victory.</i>

<b>Battlegrounds pwn.</b>
<br />

<br />
Despite all of the pre-release blogs touting a flawed design, horrible wait times, and crashing servers, Blizzard got Battlegrounds right. Predictions of failure proved to be nothing more than wishful thinking of the fatalist die-hards. After all, if those blogs and guild pages didn’t have something to bitch about they might not get a chance to become game designers would they? (A discussion for another update: why do so many WoW players want or expect to see Blizzard fail?)
<br />

<br />
Prior to Battlegrounds, Science of War had taken only tentative steps into the world of PvP. Our primary motivation is beating the PvE game and we center our guild efforts on learning and mastering PvE encounters. Battlegrounds, however, has given us something new to sink our teeth into and so far the dogs of war are pleased. In fact, we’ve had to ask several of our “younger” members to make sure they aren’t losing too much focus on the task of leveling to 60. It’s a great system, full of charm and challenge and uh-something alliterative that means “thematic.” Battlegrounds hits fun on all cylinders.
<br />

<br />
So what makes BG work? I don’t really want to completely dissect Battlegrounds. Well, I do…it would be fun…but I don’t want to do it right now. Let’s look at the broad picture.
<br />

<br />
<b>Class Interaction &amp; Teamwork:</b> Tanks lead the charge, rogues stealth behind enemy lines, warlocks call down demons: World of Warcraft’s class roles really shine in Battlegrounds. The most successful CTF teams utilize strategies that emphasis class roles. For example: Druids make good flag carriers because of their ability to move fast, Hunters make excellent screens for the flag carrier because of their ability to snare pursuing enemies, Rogues make excellent recon because of their ability to survey the battlefield undetected, and so on. Similarly, the Alterac Valley scenario relies on large groups of players cooperating in a way that maximizes their class effectiveness. Tanks backed by healers carve a wave of death into the ranks of unorganized defenders. Playing your class well and being rewarded for it is fun. Knowing you just did something through a genius moment of teamwork is crazy fun.
<br />
 
<br />
<b>Lots of Variety:</b> I’m blown away by the amount of variety in the two Battlegrounds scenarios. Alterac Valley is brimming with quests and roles within roles. Any class can choose to perform supporting quests, such as clearing a nearby mine of Kobolds and then providing the army’s smith with supplies. You can capture enemy fortifications, escort sorcerers to raise fell allies, or rescue key military advisors to bolster your selection of weapons. Alterac Valley could easily have simply been “take and hold locations A, B, and C FTW!” but instead it’s a dynamic storyline that unfolds a different way each time it’s played. Warsong Gulch, the CTF scenario, lacks the variety of Alterac, but has an extremely well designed map. There are many strategies for mounting an effective offense or defense and that alone will provide for many hours replayability. 
<br />

<br />
<b>Thematic Content:</b> Battlegrounds is full of “Warcrafty-ness.” In Alterac Valley, each side has to mine and collect resources to equip NPC soldiers with upgraded weapons. Warlocks demand blood sacrifices. Wolf riders patrol the valleys and gryphon riders patrol the skies. Due to the large numbers of weaker NPC soldiers involved in the scenario, the battles feel epic and your character's role feels significant. With so many of us playing MMOs to briefly escape the real world or indulge in our romantic side, the strength of theme in battlegrounds really helps make the experience exciting. If I had envisioned playing Warcraft 3 from the point of view of one of the heros I probably wouldn’t have come this close to hitting the mark.
<br />

<br />
<b>Endless Slaughter:</b> Let’s face it: taking out another player is fun. Few opponents of PvP dislike it because they don’t like killing another player. What they don't like is getting killed. They don’t like getting ganked when they’re focused on some quest. They don’t like the idea that their skills might not be as good as another player and they don’t want to be reminded of that fact. Battlegrounds helps take the sting out of PvP. First, the penalty for dying is nil. You die and within 30 seconds you are back in the action. Second, the battle takes place in a fixed area on straightforward terms. You can easily leave and remove yourself from PvP. Third, you are surrounded by allies. If you play smart, you’ll always have someone to watch your back. Getting unexpectedly ganked is rare. Essentially, Battlegrounds puts control over the PvP experience in the hands of the player.
<br />

<br />
Those are just a few reasons why I think Battlegrounds works. There are a lot more. This really is the patch you’ve been waiting for. Get it, get in, get to the killing.
<br />

      <td>Just two weeks after the start of official raid hours (M, Th, Fr: 8pm ET to 12am ET) we have breached the seal on Molten Core and have begun to clear our way to Ragnaros. With this raid, we became the second guild on the horde side to enter Molten Core (some alliance-type raids have entered, but those have been a mix of players from a number of random guilds).
<br />

<br />
I'll be honest: right now, Ragnaros is laughing his molten anus off at us. We're not yet fielding a full raid force of 40 players, so we're having to crunch our way through the zone with a smaller group of people. It's not easy, but it is honing our raiding.
<br />

<br />
This zone is going to be <b>easy</b> once we find a few more able level 60 players to fill out our roster.

  <table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
    <tr> 
      <td>How can it be a surprise to anyone that Phobeus has earned May MVP? 
<br />

<br />
First, he introduced TeamSpeak to the guild. He set it up, he paid for a year of TeamSpeak out of his own pocket, and he continues to provide troubleshooting and support for it. TeamSpeak has increased the quality and fun factor of our raids and has taken raiding with us to the next level. It's also increased the bonds between guild members and has helped humanize everyone a little bit.
<br />

<br />
Second, he's lead all of our UBRS raids and many of our raids in other areas as well. At first, he started doing these raids to give our faster-leveling members something to do, and for that I'm grateful. It wouldn't do to have people get bored before the guild really even started the official raiding game. I'm thankful that he did this. 
<br />

<br />
Third, he spent about 25 hours with me in LBRS one weekend to marshall a ton of guild members through the Warlord's Command quest. Even more impressive was the run with a certain unskilled former applicant that would have had me tearing my hair out if I had to lead it. His patience for unskilled players far exceeds my own, and that makes him a pretty good coach.
<br />

<br />
Fourth, he just donated 200g to the guild bank to help the bank save up to provide a lucky guild member with an epic mount. He could have received DKP for doing this, but he declined the DKP. He could have P2P'ed the gold and received DKP, but he didn't. This was very generous and selfless of him.
<br />

<br />
And finally, he's got a great personality. He manages to keep a good sense of humor and does a good job of keeping everyone relaxed on raids. He cracks little jokes, he releases tensions, he keeps things light.
<br />

<br />
He's a core member of the guild and I feel lucky to count him as an officer. I'm not sure he feels the same way about me, but that's yet another of his strengths: he does a good job putting up with my shit.

    <tr> 
      <td><font size=+1>In World of Warcraft you pay to raid.</font>
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">Adventurers prep gear, form ranks, and then delve into the pits of some loathesome dungeon. War crys on their lips, they fly into battle swinging magical blades. Demons and dragonkin are slain, treasure is plundered. The battle ends and the tired adventurers return home...only to find their gear beaten, broken, and in need of expensive repair.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Faucets &amp; Drains</span>
<br />

<br />
Every online game economy is characterized by a set of "faucets" and "drains." Faucets are gameplay mechanisms that introduce money into an economy. Drains are gameplay mechanisms that pull money out of the economy. The balance between the rate money enters the game via faucets and the rate it leaves via drains is critical to online game design. In general, MMO game economies are closed: the amount of money in the system is fixed and players can only create value in limited ways.
<br />

<br />
A closed economy with too many faucets (sources of new money) rapidly inflates. Money becomes valueless. This hurts the game in several ways, but the most obvious are the increases in trade prices between players and the reduction in the value of quests that give cash rewards. A closed economy with too many drains (ways money can leave the economy) leads to poor players with no ability to buy NPC offered goods. Both extremes can lead to a debasing of the game currency to the point players barter items intead of using the currency. (An obvious example is Diablo 2. Gold duping led to hyperinflation. Gold became valueless. Players bartered items for items, using rares like the Stone of Jordan as a base.)
<br />

<br />
I say all this merely to illustrate a point: drains are important. Games have to be able to reward players gold and then take that gold away.
<br />

<br />
That being said...some drains are better than others.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">The Cost of Raiding</span>
<br />

<br />
In World of Warcraft, player equipment degrades during battle. Death, in particular, causes a 10% hit to the equipment's health. When gear hits 0 it offers no protection or stat enhancement. The player is effectively not wearing that gear. This system exists simply to provide a drain: you fight, your armor degrades, you spend money to repair it. Money enters the system from your adventuring, then leaves the system through various drains like gear repair.
<br />

<br />
This design works great for solo and group play, but doesn't scale well to a raid force. On the individual and group level, players generally earn enough loot or coin to pay for their repairs and keep a portion as a profit. Raids are a bit different. You have from 15 to 40 players fighting a limited number of foes for a limited number of drops. At level 60, a post raid repair often costs around 3 gold. A full raid force, then, would cost around 120 gold to repair on a typical night.
<br />

<br />
God help your guild if you wipe several times and need to repair half-way through your night's raiding. I hope everyone in your raid force brought along 5 gold for the repair bot...
<br />

<br />
The simple truth is, raid zones are weak on cash drops. You just aren't going to see enough coin or enough random cash loot to compensate the raiders for their outing. At a microcosmic level, the drain is outpacing the faucet. The players end up paying to raid. At least a few hours each week have to be devoted to earning cash to compensate for the repair costs.
<br />

<br />
The question then becomes: does the guild pay for the repairs or are individual members responsible for their own gear?
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Who Pays the Bill?</span>
<br />

<br />
This is a question our guild has been discussing, recently. In EQ1, all cash drops during a raid went to the guild bank. The only players that payed to raid were clerics and other casters that used high-value gemstones to power buffs. The guild compensated them. Even with that expense, the guild would take in more money over the course of a week than it spent on casters. The profit could then be used to host guild events or provide rewards to members and apps.
<br />

<br />
That option doesn't really exist in WoW. If the guild collects all the cash drops and then hands out a repair allowance, it will likely end up with a greater liability than it can cover on a per raid basis. At the same time, if you ask the members to pay for their own repairs, it creates some frustration. Time is money. 10 gold a week for guild related repairs equates to at least an hour or two of farming (blasted lands or the auction house, whatever suits the players style).
<br />

<br />
The real cost is in frustration and the feeling that you're losing something if you attend a raid in which you may not receive loot. A guild's key members are often the first to max out on a zone's gear, but will still be needed at successive raids as the rest of the guild catches up. It can be frustrating for those players who aren't going to bid on drops to lose money for a day's effort.
<br />

<br />
We haven't yet found a clean solution to the problem, but I feel it's something that the WoW design team should examine. Increasing the silver/gold drops off of raid zone mobs so that one clear of the zone would drop about enough cash to pay for one night's raiding would be a great solution. I'm sure there other equally effectively ways of solving this problem.
<br />

<br />

In the thread, a poster asked:

We both have full time jobs, he goes to Grad School part time and I have 2 small kids, but yet we find time to play a good 18-25 hours a week or so which seems like a lot for people in our situation. We each have a few alts lvl 25 or lower. We're basically casual-professional hybrids as we like the professional side but don't get the 40 hours a week it takes to facilitate that sometimes. 
<br />

<br />
I was just wondering what guilds would best fit our play style. We really like doing the most challeging instances, but may not be able to participate with the frequency that some guilds would require as getting 3-4 hours uninterrupted can be hard with 2 kids or school. 
<br />
</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
I responded with the following, which I think is really important for people to understand about SoW, so I'm putting it here as well: 
<br />

<br />
The majority of the guild is comprised of working professionals and/or dedicated students. 
<br />

<br />
Our focus is on Game-Life balance. To help our members get the most out of their limited play time, we have structured the guild in several key ways.
<br />

<br />
1. <span style="font-weight: bold">We cap raiding hours to 4 hours, 3 nights per week</span>. This means that Science of War will raid just 12 hours per week. Just to put that in context, many guilds in this game try to raid 30 to 50 hours per week. That sort of schedule simply isn't healthy for the people in SoW. We have major responsibilities outside of the game and we deliberately cap our raiding hours so that we don't neglect these responsibilities.
<br />

<br />
2. <span style="font-weight: bold">We have a predictable, regular raid schedule</span>. It's not just the fact that we raid an average of 12 hours per week, it's also that we provide members with a predictable, regular raid schedule that allows them to avoid schedule conflicts with raids. We're not the sort of guild that's going to call you at 12am and say "Dewd, Kazzak's up. LOG YOUR ASS ON NOW!" Instead, we have published a (private) calendar that already covers every raid date up to July 15th. In general, the date and time of all raids will be scheduled months in advance. This makes it very easy for you to work out your schedule in order to minimize conflict with the other activities in your life.
<br />

<br />
3. <span style="font-weight: bold">We take a professional approach to the game.</span> We have a lot of fun, but we are very focused on getting as much done in as little time as possible while we raid. If we've got a record of 2 hours, 10 minutes for UBRS (including the rookery) then the next run we attempt to do it quicker. We are very, very focused on doing things faster and better so that we as a guild are as effective during our 12 hours of raiding as many guilds are in their 30-50 hours of raiding. 
<br />

<br />
In Everquest, we were very successful with this mission. We ran very tight, very organized raids on the game's top content and accomplished as much or more than most guilds that raided twice as many hours per week. It really doesn't matter if the game is EQ, WoW, Baseball, Football or Quidditch. Our approach works for us, and tends to attract the professional who wants to have his cake and eat it too.

      <td>I have a screenshot or two to put up later, but last night we 5 manned LBRS with no warrior and no priest. We had a shaman (Halatos) healing and a druid (Kotsya) tanking. It was a long run and if we cared to try again we could probably do it faster and more efficiently.
<br />

<br />
That being said, a rogue, shaman, druid, mage, and hunter clearing LBRS is a pretty incredible achievement. It demonstrates that learning pulls and playing smart can make up for a lack of traditional class-roles in a group.

Not even a week has passed since we got our first UBRS key and we've already utterly sacked the place. Every foe lies defeated. <A HREF="http://www.scienceofwar.net/flatline/images/emberseer.jpg">Imprisoned horrors</A> have been sent back to hell. <A HREF="http://www.scienceofwar.net/flatline/images/corpse_strewn_hall.jpg">Corpses line the halls.</A> The <A HREF="http://www.scienceofwar.net/flatline/images/rend.jpg">false Warchief</A> lies lifeless and torn in a pool of his own ichorous blood. The flesh of <A HREF="http://www.scienceofwar.net/flatline/images/the_beast.jpg">gargantuan beasts</A> decorates our battle halls.
<br />

<br />
And above all, the blood of the mighty black dragon general pours out as a libation symbolic of final victory. To borrow a quaint phrase from a <A HREF="http://www.tritonguild.net/">favorite guild</A> of mine,
<br />

<br />

Everyone played a tight game. We steam rolled to victory and a truck load of premium loot. UBRS: <I>Welcome to official farm status.</I>

<B>UBRS &amp; Official Raids</B>
<br />

<br />
Science of War is officially keyed for UBRS! After several gem farming runs we've managed to assemble our first UBRS key. With this achievement comes the announcement of the start of official raid hours in the middle of this month. Our first month of official raiding will be focused primarily on Onyxia keying. Bring on the bitch!
<br />

<br />
<B>Level Requirement at 45</B>
<br />

<br />
We are now under phase 3 of the <A HREF="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=12021">Guild Level Calendar</A>. Applications will be accepted for players of any level, but initiates must be at least level <b>45</b> in order to qualify for full membership. We are still accepting applications from all classes.
<br />

<br />
