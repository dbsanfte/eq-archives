<br />

<br />
World of Warcraft is just a piece the balancing act we call life.  Many gamers have a job, friends, girlfriends, boyfriends, wives, school...  Beyond these obligations are smaller, more mundane issues like bills, mortgages, chores, pets, other girlfriends, etc.  Where among this mess does WoW fit in?  
<br />

<br />
I like to think of Science of War as a second family.  We all share the same goals and values, and have made a long-term commitment to one another.  Members of Science of War develop real relationships with each other and take on the responsibilities of keeping that relationship intact.  We rely heavily on one another to be there through thick and thin.  We understand that everyone has a life outside of World of Warcaft, and have organized our raid times so that they're predictable.  
<br />
We're not kidding when we talk about "game-life balance."  
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/korea_games_dc;_ylt=AoaggOawc0HoxB_ItOHQM8Gs0NUE;_ylu=X3oDMTA3ODdxdHBhBHNlYwM5NjQ-" target="_blank">Here is a prime example of faulty game-life balance.</a>
<br />

<br />
Because we don't want this to happen to our members, we'll continue to reach out to working professionals, students and anyone else who wants to see end-game content, but doesn't want to spend 60 hours per week online to get there.

    <tr> 
      <td><img src="http://webpages.charter.net/askrenes/sow/images/joker.jpg" valign="top" align="right" title="Hi, I've got an appointment with Mr. Ullman.">If there's one thing that we can learn from Batman, it's that average shmucks like you and me can beat the odds with enough preparation and the proper resources.  Successful generals do not run their troops into battle without first learning about their enemy and making sure that their arsenal includes up to date and useful equipment.  We are no different.  
<br />

<br />
Science of War requires its members and applicants to use a few extra components that make raiding more efficient.  The first, and probably the most significant is <a href="http://www.goteamspeak.com/news.php" target="_blank">Teamspeak</a>.  We've been both criticized and praised by others on our server for making its use mandatory on our raids.  If your guild hasn't tried it, I encourage you to give it a shot.  It's easy to set up, and you'll notice the difference in no time.  Teamspeak allows the communication of raid orders in a fraction of the time it takes to type them out.  
<br />

<br />
Another requirement to raid with Science of War is <a href="http://www.ctmod.net/" target="_blank">CT_RaidAssist</a>.  This UI mod is incredible.  Blizzard even put their own copycat version in the latest patch, but failed to add any of its most useful features.  Scud put it best: "This mod rockzors my boxzors!"
<br />

<br />
<img src="http://webpages.charter.net/askrenes/sow/images/freeze.jpg" valign="bottom" align="left" title="The Governor of California">Although it's not mandatory (yet), most of our casters have also installed <a href="http://www.curse-gaming.com/mod.php?addid=643" target="_blank">Decursive</a>.  This mod checks each raid member for curses, poisons, diseases, etc.  If it finds any curable status ailment on a raid member (and you're capable of curing it), it cleans it for you.  It really is that simple.  One of its newer features allows you to set a priority list (in case by default it decides that your local hunter's pet is more important than the raid's main healer).  
<br />

<br />
As Vovka has said many times before, the majority of our guild is comprised of working professionals and/or dedicated students. To help our members get the most out of their limited play time, we need to run very tight and organized raids.  These items, along with the talented, determined individuals that we have fighting by our sides, have helped us meet our expectations.  
<br />

<br />
By the way, I'll leave the Tim Burton's "Batman" vs. Christopher Nolan's "Batman Begins" debate up to you.  I'm sticking with the 'Arnold Schwarzenegger in a can' version myself.

In the event that the first applicant we select does not make it to full member status, we will select an alternate. We will be giving away an epic mount no matter what!

Why are we doing this? Because we're very, very close to filling out our roster and we'd like to encourage anybody that's on the fence about applying to SoW to do so earlier rather than later.

The results have been pretty fantastic. We saved 900G in guild funds in a very short period of time and have begun purchasing epic mounts for our members. Junckey is the first recipient of an epic mount via the SoW-Warren-G "Regulators, Mount Up!" program.

Congrats to Junckey, and pre-grats to all members who will be getting epic mounts via this program.

PVP participation will go up across the board as a result of this change. It's huge!
<br />

<br />
The cynic in me says that they've done this because they're further behind in development of PVE content than they reckoned they would be and that they need SOMETHING to mop up all the spare time their level 60 players have. 
<br />

<br />
In the short run, this change will mean many more players participating in PVP as everyone attempts to achieve a high rank for gear. If you're a more casual player, now is NOT the time to jump into PVP, as you'll be competing for rank with just about everyone else.
<br />

<br />
In the long run, this change will accellerate game mudflation. Overall, it has become easier to obtain gear. This buys the company a few months to make detailed announcements about a significant PVE expansion.
