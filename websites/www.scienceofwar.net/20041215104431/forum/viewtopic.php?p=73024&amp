				<td colspan="2" height="100%" valign="top"><span class="postbody">This post has been made for guild applicants who don't know what to expect coming into a raid with us. Here's a spoiler that will help you impress us and cut down on your mistakes. 
<br />

<br />
<ol>
<br />
<li><b>Communication</b>: This is a key differentiator for us. It allows us to kill targets with a fraction of the players than our closest competitors. It allows us to finish raids by 12am midnight. It keeps us from making the same mistakes repeatedly. Here's what you should do. 
<br />

<br />
<ul>
<br />
<li>Cut the clutter. If you have a bunch of spam going to your main window, you will miss raid instructions and look like a tool in front of the entire raid. Then we'll come back to the site and write some not so flattering comments on your app. Set up your UI to minimize spam to your main chat window. You should not have ANY melee damage spam going to your main chat window. You should not have any spellcasting going to your main window (unless it's your own). You should also turn off the auction channel and anything else that could obscure the message.
<br />

<br />
<li>Get in the raid channel before the raid begins. Ask any guild member what the channel and password are. There's ALWAYS a main raid channel, a debuff channel, and a heal channel. Other channels may be set up on an ad-hoc basis, so ask a guild member if you need to join any others.
<br />

<br />
<li>STFUP (Shut the fuck up please). Unless the ENTIRE raid will benefit from it then you should not send a tell to the main raid channel. The main channel is really for the raid leader, the main tank, and other key raid members. If you want to joke or play around, use emotes and SAY or groupchat.
<br />

<br />
<li>Go LFG. Before a raid starts you should have /lfg ON and be at your keyboard ready to accept group invites. We start the majority of our raids RIGHT ON TIME and if you're AFK you're increasing the chance of destroying everybody's on-time DKP bonus.
<br />

<br />
<li>Use the AFK tag. If you are AFK for ANY period of time, turn on AFK and include a note about how long you expect to be afk. Notify your group leader at a minimum. If you are a shaman, you should notify other shaman that you're afk and for how long. If you're a cleric, you should notify other clerics that they'll need to cover your heals. If you're a rogue, notify other rogues that they'll have to assist with lockpicking and pulling. And so on.
<br />

<br />
<li>Take it to tells. The majority of information that flows through the raid channel of shitty guilds doesn't need to be there. Before you use ANY channel, consider whether your info could be conveyed in tells. Don't burden other people with information that is only intended for one person. The better we are at keeping extraneous information out of our raid channels, the more attentive we can be to the mobs around us, to player health bars, and to the really important stuff.
<br />

<br />
<li>If you aren’t sure about how/when/why to do something, ask someone instead of trying to figure it out or just slide by unnoticed, it will save you and possibly everyone else from the consequences of a bad decision. IF YOU AREN’T SURE ASK. One of the things that make an excellent player is not only knowing what to do, but knowing what to do when you DON’T know what to do. The worse thing that can happen if you ask a question is that you will be pelted with a hail of unclean sex toys… or learn something 
<br />

<br />
<li>Stop pecking. If you suck at typing, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00006IFST/qid=1039118602/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/103-0377541-7243822?v=glance&s=software&n=507846">learn to type</a>. Everquest is still a text-based medium. The faster and more accurately you can type, the better you'll be able to digest, act upon and reply to information that comes your way during tense raid situations. 
<br />
</ul>
<br />

<br />
<li><b>Pre-Raid Prep</b>: You need to carry certain items with you at all times. These items will help the entire raid function more efficiently. Get these items and have them with you always.
<br />

<br />
<ul>
<br />

<br />
<li>Don’t just be on time, be EARLY. The start time listed for a SoW raid isn’t the time the raid leader wants people to be arriving and getting organized, it is the time he/she wants the raid to START. This means you should be at the designated meeting point with any necessary equipment, reagents, etc. ready to begin raiding. 
<br />

<br />
<li>Resist gear. You need to be able to get any single resist to 200 before a single buff is cast on you. You should be able to get any two paired resists (CR pairs with FR and PR pairs with DR) to over 150 before a single buff is cast on you. Carry your resist gear ALWAYS. Most raid neophytes won't be near this level of resists, but this is the goal you should be shooting for. 
<br />

<br />
<li>Enduring Breath Item. I don't care if you're a necro and can cast DMF or are a mage and have waterstones. You need a permanent EB item. Some mobs that are fought underwater will dispell your EB. Your EB spell may fade in the heat of battle when you aren't able to sit down and re-mem an enduring breath spell. Get an EB item.
<br />

<br />
<li>Shrinks. You need to be shrunk at all times on all raids. Some raid are actually impossible without a shrunk raid force. Some encounters simply run much more smoothly when everybody is shrunk. If you are not shrunk, expect a tell from a guild officer telling you to get shrunk or get a TL out of the raid. Buy shrink potions from a shaman or a minimizing device from a tinker.
<br />

<br />
<li>Keys. Don't force an entire raid to wait for someone to duel you so that you can retrieve your keys from the bank. When you have some spare time, go to keyed-entry zones and add your keys to your keyring. If a key won't add to your keyring, carry it at all times unless it's something useless like ToFS. 
<br />

<br />
<li>Components. It goes without saying that necros should never be without bone chips, essence emeralds and peridots, that clerics should never be without peridots, and so on. If your spells use a component don't be caught without them. However, EVERY raid member should also have a sack of components for emergency outages. Carry a stack of coffins, a stack of peridots, a stack of pearls, invis potions (if you can't cast invis yourself), and a couple 10-shot shrink potions. And don't forget food either. 
<br />
</ul>
<br />

<br />
<li><b>Raid Time</b>: Some tips for a fun and efficient raid.
<br />
<ul>
<br />
<li>Know the Tank Order. The main tank on a raid sets the tank order. He'll periodically remind the channel of this order and will update the channel whenever this order changes. Store this list in short term memory or jot it down if you have to. If you're a healer, you may want to hotkey each tank in the tank order so that you can monitor his or her health. If you're a melee, you'll want to make sure you understand which mobs are being off-tanked and which are being main-tanked.
<br />

<br />
<li>Pay Attention to the Buff List. We always assign ONE person to make a hotkeyed buff list for the entire raid. Pay attention to this list when it is sent to the raid channel and request buffs appropriately. ONLY group leaders (or their designees) should request group buffs. Only individuals who NEED buffs should request the individual buffs. If you have a question or suggestion for the buff list, then send a tell to the person who is doing the buff list. Always ask for buffs by name. Not "shm buffz plz" but "Group focus, group sta, group agi please."
<br />

<br />
<li>Assist or Leave. This should be like breathing by now, but many guilds are sloppy and allow poor habits to form, and some applicants bring their poor habits to our raids, fucking things up. Never attack a mob unless the MT asks you to attack it. Never. If a mob seems to be ripping on a caster, then you can and should taunt it using damage-less spells (no dots, just debuffs). You should have a hotkey set up that says "/assist maintank" (no quotes). Attack NOTHING without using this hotkey, and only attack after the MT calls for the attack.
<br />

<br />
<li>Dealing with Link Death. When you go LD and get back in game, immediately send your group leader a tell (not the raid channel) and let them know that you're ready for re-invite to the group. Shrink yourself immediately. Get back in the channel. Let the other people of your class know that you're back and able to assist with class duties.
<br />

<br />
<li>Know your buffs. You really need a solid understand of what buffs are available and who can cast them. An unbuffed raid force may as well be naked in many cases. You should actively monitor all buffs and <a href="http://www.visi.com/~mlm/eq/buffs/buffguide.html">memorize this page</a>.
<br />

<br />
<li>Loot info for applicants. Our loot policy can be <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2375">found here</a>, but here's a summary just for applicants. Once you have an app in with us, you start accruing DKP. You may not spend any of these points until you are a member of the guild, but you accrue them nonetheless. All applicants may bid ZERO points on any item that is going to rot so long as you can and will use said item. This saves items from rot. If you have any questions about loot, ask the raid leader, loot master, or any guild officer.
<br />

				<td colspan="2" height="100%" valign="top"><span class="postbody">Don't take it personal.  You will be barked at.  Someone's gonna step on your feelings.  Science of War has a fairly unique raiding style and is a very demanding organization.  Expect a "vovagram".  Expect someone to jump on you for your positioning.  We don't want you to get mad.  We don't want you to get upset.  We just want you to follow the instructions given.
<br />

<br />
If you're unsure, ask.  Use your chain of command.  If you don't know the answer to a question you have, immediately ask your group leader.  If instructions are unclear, immediately ask your group leader.
<br />

<br />
Stay buffed.  Individual buffs are YOUR responsibility.  Nobody's gonna gripe at you for asking for buffs.  People will be upset if you die because you didn't ask for the buffs you need to stay alive.  In that same vein, tell your group leader if a group buff wears off.  In most cases, the request has been put in for a renewal, but it won't hurt to ask.
<br />

<br />
Don't ask about loot.  99.9% of the time, we don't know who's getting what.  We don't know who's dropping what.  So basically, you've taken your time to type out a question there's no way for us to know the answer to.  Additionally, you've forced the person you sent a tell to (you DID send it in a tell, didn't you?) to take time to respond "Fuck if I know" to a question you asked when you KNEW he didn't know the answer.  Unless it's a raid for a specific drop for a specific person (which is pretty rare) we don't know who's getting new gear.  You'll know when we know.</span><br /><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Limit the use of emotes.  An emote here and there during downtime can be funny, an emote for every hit of the attack button makes baby jesus cry.

Be ready for criticism: The leaders of SoW are tough and if you screw up you WILL get a nasty tell.  We have all had them and we still get them.  Deal with it, listen to them, and keep raidng.  We raid with so few people because we can, we got this way from Vovagrams(tm).  They are nasty, mean, and sometimes rude, but that is life in SoW.

<br />
Melee positioning is very important. If you are not a rogue don't be behind a mob unless it is specified. If you are not MA do no not be in front of the mob unless a push to disrupt casting/gating is called. 
<br />

<br />
All other melee should be balancing the mob by taking positions on it's sides unless we are pinning a mob and then all on one side. Drift occurs during a fight and we have to adjust to it so that the mob doesn't roll over the MA, the MA isn't pushed out of heal range etc... 
<br />

<br />
Be aware of the mob and it's movement and adjust your position on the mob to stop drift. Circle strafing is a good technique for this, if the mob is moving forward move to it's front, the opposite for moving away from the MA. If we tell you to push a mob one way or another get into a position 45 degrees opposite the side we want him to go until he is in position then balance out to hold him there.</span><br /><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<br />

<br />
For the majority of these I am going to use my personal hotkey’s as example. Many of these can be personalized; there are, however, a few exceptions. A point to note: NO unnecessary spam, keep your Raid and Chat channel keys Short, Direct, and Easy to read.
<br />

<br />
We will start off with the really essential, easy, ones.

-Assist MT/2T/3T if I have to tell you this one, you’re probably applying to the wrong guild. Everyone needs to ahve these keys, not just tanks, furthermore, know who each tank in the order is, fix your keys if that order changes.

-Offtanking key, as an app you will probably be using this one fairly often as we feel you out. Individuality has been squashed this now follows a strict outline, please notice the format...

Anything in the above post that isnt stated as otherwise going to /say goes into the raid channel. Almost all MT/RT or Offtank calls go into the raid channel. If someone is assigned to call an AE that is actually timed or Spellshield is down etc, they will be calling it in the raid channel as well.
<br />

<br />
Some healers, who's name I wont mention here so they dont get spammed on raids prefer when you ask for a heal in /say to also tie that to a /tell to someone who has fast heals.
<br />

<br />
Something along the lines of:
<br />

<br />
/say Heal me -- yourname -- Heal me
<br />
/pause 2
<br />
/tell Random_Healer_01 Heal me -- yourname
<br />

<br />
This allows them to /rt and hit their quick heals. Far too often people think that they are bugging people when they spam asking for heals. I will say its far more annoying to hold up a raid to rebuff people, and waste even more mana on buffs than it is to heal them quickly and keep moving =)
<br />

<br />
If you need specifics on something that hasnt been covered here drop me a tell in game anytime bud.

Okie, if someone likes that Heal Me in tells thing, that's cool.  Just don't send me those tells! hehe .. I like the healing calls in /say.
<br />

<br />
I love our hotkeys!  The uniformity seemed overly anal to me at first, but it truly is so much easier and much more efficient than anything else I've ever seen for healing outside your own group.
