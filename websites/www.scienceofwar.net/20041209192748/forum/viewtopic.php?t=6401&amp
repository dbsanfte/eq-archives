				<td colspan="2" height="100%" valign="top"><span class="postbody">A couple people in the guild were against me publishing these elite tips, but I want to make sure we're rejecting applicants for the right reasons, not for easily-fixed and easily-avoided errors. 
<br />

<br />
So here's an easy list to improve your chances to make it into SoW. 
<br />

<br />
1. <a href="http://www.eqgui.com">Get a UI that works</a>. Be prepared for LOADS of information to get thrown at you. Let's take a look at a BAD UI and at a GOOD UI. Can you guess which is which?
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/images/bad_ui.gif"><img src="http://www.scienceofwar.net/images/bad_ui.gif" height="100" width="120"></a><a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/images/vova_interface.jpg"><img src="http://www.scienceofwar.net/images/vova_interface.jpg" height="100" width="120"></a>
<br />

<br />
Let's talk about why that bad UI sucks. 
<br />
(a) It's the default. Default shows everything. You very rarely need everything. 
<br />
(b) Why does a WiZARD have his pet window up? 
<br />
(c) This person has the default window selector up. Why? Does he actually use it to click shit? There's no excuse for not knowing your hotkeys. You shouldn't be clicking anything. Get rid of that window with a quick alt-W.
<br />
(d) No filters. This guy doesn't have melee crits off. He doesn't have raid chat going to a different window. In a NORMAL raid situation (not the laughable Arch Lich) text is going to be scrolling past his single text window at an amazing rate. That means he's going to miss raid commands and that means guild members are going to call him an incompetent waste of raid space. Even if he is incredibly sharp, the lack of filtering is going to make him look like a complete and total idiot on more than one raid. 
<br />
(e) This person's mouse is up near his spell gems. He obviously doesn't use alt-# to cast spells. Again that's a flaw because he can end up clicking the wrong spell or simply won't get to the right spell in high-lag situations. If a spell is very important, put the gem in a hotkey bank. You should be casting the rest of your spells with the keyboard.
<br />
(f) This caster doesn't even have a modrod hotkeyed. We know it's on him, but how does he get to it? He probably opens his INVENTORY window with a mouseclick.
<br />
(g) His buffs have no names next to them. How does he know if someone's got clarity on him or Voice of Quellious? How does he know whether to ask for a cure disease, poison, or curse if he has a debuff on him? He doesn't.
<br />

<br />

<br />
2. Learn to type. Seriously, drop ten bucks on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00005NUNW/ref=pd_sim_sw_1/102-1718167-1065747?v=glance&s=software&n=507846">Mavis Beacon</a> and spend a little time with her. Everquest is text-based. Our raids are fast-paced. You need to be able to respond and communication quickly and efficiently. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
3. Know SoW. Make sure you have read the FAQs that were written about how we operate. Make sure you read them twice if you don't absorb material the first time around. Asking a guild member something contained in a FAQ makes you sound like a lazy moron who really didn't bother to do much research before asking his question. If you went to a job interview and the first question you asked was, "So what do ya'll do?" you'd be shown the door. There's no excuse not to know the material we put on the public forum and the app private forum for you.
<br />

<br />

<br />
4. Know EQ. You should be reading your class boards regularly to keep abreast on issues facing your class. You should occasionally re-read your spell list from level 1 and think of different ways to use spells that have been in the back of your book for months. You should read and understand EVERY patch message that comes through the patcher. You should probably be hanging out in the serverwide channel for your class. You should understand how to use lucy.fnord.net to understand what your spells do and the spells of other classes and NPCs do. You can do all of this while pretending to work. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
5. Participation and Effort. Don't be lazy. The first sign that someone is lazy is usually a sub-standard application that looks rushed. The second sign is gear that could be upgraded in the bazaar. Don't be a fly on the wall. Actively participate in conversations in your groups during raids. Ask questions if you don't understand something. Talk to the members of your class and get to know them. If you're a melee and assist is called, rest assured that a member of SoW is checking to see how long it takes you to start attacking. If you AFK through mobs you're doomed. If you just try to blend into the crowd and say nothing you're not going to get much feedback on your application and a dearth of feedback usually translates into a LONGER application period. The better we know you the sooner we can accept or reject you. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
6. Self Sufficiency. Don't you dare come to a raid and beg for a shaman to drop his group to shrink you. Bring your own shrink device or shrink potions. Don't you ask people in your group to come back and invis you. EVERY person on every raid needs to have insta-cast invis potions. There's no excuse for dying while moving through a zone invis. Consider this: An insta-invis potion costs 10 plat. If you die, someone's going to have to drag you. Some others are going to have to buff you. The raid WILL be delayed. Even if that delay is just 30 seconds, multiply that time by 60 people and you just wasted 30 minutes of total time because you were too cheap to buy a shrink potion. You just told the entire guild that your time is more important than our time. Not the way to make a good impression. Other tips for self-sufficiency: download and install all of the cartography maps from <a href="http://maps.eq-toolbox.com." target="_blank">http://maps.eq-toolbox.com.</a> Not knowing your way around a zone is a great way to get killed and waste our time. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
7. Character development. When an applicant shows us a magelo with a piece of gear that could be easily and cheaply upgraded in the bazaar he's telling us he doesn't care about being the best he could be for his guild, but expects his guild to hand loot to him, part by part. First of all, you slow your own progress down. You'll earn AA faster and be invited to more groups if you have better gear. Second, DKP are a scarce resource. Why spend DKP on an item you could obtain through the bazaar? You just increased the length of time you'll have to wait to upgrade other slots. It also goes without saying that you need to have various survival skills maxxed. 200 swim. 200 sense heading. 
<br />

<br />
8. Stupid Timesinks. Sorry, but Everquest is full of stupid timesinks. That's the game we play. You wouldn't be applying to SoW if you hated the game, so get over bitching about these timesinks and just do them. Some members of SoW have done the VT key three times. They're not going to be sympathetic to your whines about how hard that ME shard is. Network with other applicants and get that monkey off your back.
<br />

<br />
9. Maturity and Positivity. SoW's minimum age requirement is 17. If you're 28 and still act like a 16-year-old, you will be dinged. There's good immaturity (e.g., Adam Sandler, Jim Carrey) and there's inexcusable immaturity (e.g., anger about in-game death, loot squabbling, inability to resolve routine conflicts, inability to take corrective feedback and make behavioral changes). There's good and bad in Everquest. It's a complex game. If you dwell too much on the negative aspects of the game we'll assume you're just a hair away from burnout and pre-emptively ding you. We want people in SoW for the long run.
<br />

<br />
10. Raid attendance. This is last, but CERTAINLY not least. You need to raid with us four times per week minimum. Sure, some weeks you'll only attend three raids, some weeks you'll attend all five. But NO AVERAGE, you need to be able to attend four raids per week, minimum. And don't think you'll fool anybody by attending five raids per week for an hour each. Sure, the DKP program might show you as having 100% attendance, but we're noting that you can't manage to attend an entire raid.</span><br /><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
