Breaking records and going strong two months after release, everyone seems to at least know someone who's playing it. Not really a surprise, being situated in the popular Warcraft universe and being a product of Blizzard. But it's also pretty gentle with those of us who could never get into MMOs before, who don't like spending hours in front of the computer to get any sense of in-game accomplishment, and enjoy a colorful environment over something somber and Important.

With running on 88 servers located all over the nation, containing hundreds of thousands of players and providing thousands of quests, you need a lot of well-designed content to keep the masses happy. Blizzard is taking its reputation for post-release product support full-bore into WoW and has more than a few caves and monsters up its sleeves in the coming months. Sure, you've likely heard about Battlegrounds, the free PvP add-on we'll be seeing later this year, but since it's not just a simple arena, there's a lot to talk about. Even though they've written a lot about it already, there are always some new questions that will pop up. Instead of torturing ourselves with endless speculation, we asked them about a few things, and Tom Chilton, one of the designers, was kind enough to provide some answers. Of course, there are details they can't reveal yet because some things just haven't been finalized yet, but what can you do.
