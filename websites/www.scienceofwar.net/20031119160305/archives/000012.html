<h3 class="title">Mourning the Once-Great Warlord</h3>

<P>Folks, Rallos Zek the Warlord is dead. Not just last night's instance of him. The ENCOUNTER is dead as a challenge. Once a guild figures out how to time the thing and beat Vallon and Tallon Zek, he pretty much just takes a nap in the arena. The recent nerf went too far. At first we were surprised when two rival guilds on the server killed him shortly after the change to the encounter, especially after one of them claimed to have beaten a harder version, but that surprise melted into disappointment when we finished up our two-week backflagging spree by dropping him. Take a look at the screenshot below -- we didn't even have to evacuate or CR at the end of the fight. Everyone is still alive mopping up arena adds. The necros are having a jolly good time waking the dead on his corpse and mugging for the camera. Pathetic.</P><P>In other news: (1) We're switching this site from <A HREF="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</A> to <A HREF="http://www.movabletype.org">Movable Type</A> (URL FIXED). Movable Type is an amazing content management tool and should add a great deal of interactivity to the homepage. Can't wait. </P><P>(2) We've recently made a great change to how DKP works that deals with the ages-old conflict between a guild's most active raiders and its less-frequent raiders. It's called "vesting" and, in a nutshell, it's an exponential function that allows guild members to access more and more of their earned DKP as their participation level rises. This happens to solve another problem we were having where less active raiders were hoarding DKP to blow it all on the one big DKP purchase, leaving the rest of their slots in substandard gear that was making them a liability on raids. In general, top-end gear will cost more on a value-for-DKP scale than the mid-range gear. Vesting imposes a max-bid cap on those who participate less, thus foiling hoarding behavior that actually makes them weaker in a raid setting. Ok -- that's your "Inside SoW" scoop for the week.</P><P>(3) <A HREF="http://www.scienceofwar.net/gallery/">Gallery</A>! Guild members who want permission to upload photos to any album just need to let me know by responding to <A HREF="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=62408">this thread</A>.</P><P>(4) <B>Recruiting</B>: We are recruiting right now. We've just finished flagging 20-some odd applicants for the elemental planes (grats to them -- they win, even if things don't work out in the end). We're not going to be backflagging for a while, so right now we're looking for toons that can at least enter the tower of Solusek Ro. We're looking for Mages, Warriors, Beastlords, Clerics, Enchanters, Druids, Rangers, Wizards and Rogues in particular. In truth, we will NEVER turn away a good, knowledgeable person with play times that match our raid times and the requisite flags. Great news for apps with lots of AA: You can earn a very significant DKP bonus (50 to 600 DKP) depending on how many AA you have. Current applicants can <A HREF="http://www.scienceofwar.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=7777">read about it here</A>. </P><P><A HREF="http://www.scienceofwar.net/gallery/raids/20030710_rztw?full=1"><IMG SRC="http://www.scienceofwar.net/albums/raids/20030710_rztw.thumb.jpg"></A></P>
