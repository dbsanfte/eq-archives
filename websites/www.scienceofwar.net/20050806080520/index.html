      <td><img src="http://webpages.charter.net/askrenes/sow/images/joker.jpg" valign="top" align="right" title="Hi, I've got an appointment with Mr. Ullman.">If there's one thing that we can learn from Batman, it's that average shmucks like you and me can beat the odds with enough preparation and the proper resources.  Successful generals do not run their troops into battle without first learning about their enemy and making sure that their arsenal includes up to date and useful equipment.  We are no different.  
<br />

<br />
Science of War requires its members and applicants to use a few extra components that make raiding more efficient.  The first, and probably the most significant is <a href="http://www.goteamspeak.com/news.php" target="_blank">Teamspeak</a>.  We've been both criticized and praised by others on our server for making its use mandatory on our raids.  If your guild hasn't tried it, I encourage you to give it a shot.  It's easy to set up, and you'll notice the difference in no time.  Teamspeak allows the communication of raid orders in a fraction of the time it takes to type them out.  
<br />

<br />
Another requirement to raid with Science of War is <a href="http://www.ctmod.net/" target="_blank">CT_RaidAssist</a>.  This UI mod is incredible.  Blizzard even put their own copycat version in the latest patch, but failed to add any of its most useful features.  Scud put it best: "This mod rockzors my boxzors!"
<br />

<br />
<img src="http://webpages.charter.net/askrenes/sow/images/freeze.jpg" valign="bottom" align="left" title="The Governor of California">Although it's not mandatory (yet), most of our casters have also installed <a href="http://www.curse-gaming.com/mod.php?addid=643" target="_blank">Decursive</a>.  This mod checks each raid member for curses, poisons, diseases, etc.  If it finds any curable status ailment on a raid member (and you're capable of curing it), it cleans it for you.  It really is that simple.  One of its newer features allows you to set a priority list (in case by default it decides that your local hunter's pet is more important than the raid's main healer).  
<br />

<br />
As Vovka has said many times before, the majority of our guild is comprised of working professionals and/or dedicated students. To help our members get the most out of their limited play time, we need to run very tight and organized raids.  These items, along with the talented, determined individuals that we have fighting by our sides, have helped us meet our expectations.  
<br />

<br />
By the way, I'll leave the Tim Burton's "Batman" vs. Christopher Nolan's "Batman Begins" debate up to you.  I'm sticking with the 'Arnold Schwarzenegger in a can' version myself.

The results have been pretty fantastic. We saved 900G in guild funds in a very short period of time and have begun purchasing epic mounts for our members. Junckey is the first recipient of an epic mount via the SoW-Warren-G "Regulators, Mount Up!" program.

Congrats to Junckey, and pre-grats to all members who will be getting epic mounts via this program.

PVP participation will go up across the board as a result of this change. It's huge!
<br />

<br />
The cynic in me says that they've done this because they're further behind in development of PVE content than they reckoned they would be and that they need SOMETHING to mop up all the spare time their level 60 players have. 
<br />

<br />
In the short run, this change will mean many more players participating in PVP as everyone attempts to achieve a high rank for gear. If you're a more casual player, now is NOT the time to jump into PVP, as you'll be competing for rank with just about everyone else.
<br />

<br />
In the long run, this change will accellerate game mudflation. Overall, it has become easier to obtain gear. This buys the company a few months to make detailed announcements about a significant PVE expansion.

  <legend><font color="CC9900">Guild Recruiting Is a Classic Funnel</font></legend>
  <table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
    <tr> 
      <td>People frequently misunderstand how recruiting processes work. Even our own guild members sometimes get confused when they see us kick out an applicant who seems like a nice, upstanding guy. Just today, in fact, a guild member lamented that we had booted another applicant who was focusing on PVP instead of leveling to 60.
<br />

<br />
So here's an explainer.
<br />

<br />
A healthy recruiting organization applies a series of filters to the applicant pool. Generally, an organization like ours starts with a huge pool of potential guild members then gradually narrows that pool down until they're left with the best people.
<br />

<br />
This filtering process is commonly known in the sales process and is often represented as a giant funnel. 
<br />

<br />
<img src="http://www.firewhite.com/cms/images/salesfunnel.gif">
<br />

<br />
The top level of this funnel represents all of the people who we might like to have join our guild. So to start out with, we might say, "well, we'd like to look at everyone on planet earth as a potential member."
<br />

<br />
EVERYONE ON PLANET EARTH = 6 BILLION PEOPLE
<br />

<br />
Clearly, though, to play WoW with SoW, a player needs to meet a few basic requirements. As we layer on those requirements, we apply filters that narrow down the total pool of people from 6 billion to something a little more reasonable.
<br />

<br />
EVERYONE ON THE PLANET EARTH = 6 BILLION PEOPLE
<br />
LIVES IN CANADA OR THE USA = 300 MILLION PEOPLE
<br />
OWNS AN ACTIVE WORLD OF WARCRAFT ACCOUNT = 700,000 PEOPLE
<br />
ACTIVELY PLAYS ON AZJOL NERUB, HORDE SIDE = 2000 PEOPLE
<br />
IS UNGUILDED = 800 PEOPLE
<br />
IS LITERATE ENOUGH TO FILL OUT SOW'S APPLICATION: 600 PEOPLE
<br />
IS MOTIVATED/INTERESTED ENOUGH TO FILL OUT SOW'S APPLICATION: 30 PEOPLE PER MONTH
<br />

<br />
You can see how, gradually, we apply filters to gradually narrow down the list of potential guild members to the point where we have 30 viable written applications per month.
<br />

<br />
The filtering process doesn't end there. We quickly weed out people who don't fit with the guild for one reason or another. For instance, an applicant that refuses to level up and who wants to remain level 49 forever (in order to PVP) will be kicked because PVP is not a guild focus. Or we might kick someone for poor conduct. Rejecting apps who don't buy into guild goals is expected. That means that the application process is working to keep people out of the guild who don't belong here. 
<br />

<br />
In the end, out of those 30 apps per month, I expect maybe 5 to be invited to join the guild as a full member.
<br />

<br />
Sure, these people that we're booting may be very good people. They're probably managers at work, and they're probably quite smart and attractive and so on. But we're not in the business of inviting all the nice people on the server to join SoW. 
<br />

<br />
We're looking for capable players who are as focused as we are on beating the game's top PVE content. Science of War will kill Ragnaros on the Azjol Nerub server. We'll be one of the first guilds on the server to do that. But not if we dilute our efforts by letting nice people with no sense of focus into the guild. We filter out people who don't meet our requirements, and that's just common sense.
