<span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal">Summary</span>
<br />

<br />
Loot is just one of many rewards that come with being in Science of War, but it's something that's often a source of controversy in many guilds. We hope that clear rules and guidelines will set the proper expectations about the rewards you can expect to reap as you fight with us.
<br />

<br />
Some loot is dispensed the moment it drops, some loot is banked for future use, and some is moved to a trader for sale in the server bazaar. Our general principles governing loot decisions can be summed up like so: We want a long-lasting guild with low turnover. We therefore value loyalty to and time spent with the guild. Because we value these things, out loot system will reward loyal, long-term membership.
<br />

<br />
Science of War handles loot via an auction system. Guild members earn points via a variety of activities and can spend those points in an auction whenever loot drops. An auction system is the best tool for determining how much someone wants or needs an item over the long run because it forces us to choose what we'll purchase with our scarce points. This system encourages members to evaluate equipment choice and to consider long-term upgrade paths. The end result is more loot in the right hands. 
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal">Earning Points</span>
<br />

<br />
<b>Overview</b>: There are 4 ways to earn points: (1) All members are entitled to complete a self review every three months to assess their performance. Consider this a bonus for achieving goals that are not raid-specific but nevertheless help the guild. (2) You can also earn points by attending raids. Note that points you earn on raids are not available for spending until they've actually been entered into the DKP system. (3) You can also earn points by auctioning off gear you no longer wear. Guild members can bid on unwanted gear of yours and you will earn a portion of their winning bid. (4) Finally, the guild leadership may decide to provide incentives along the way and as those incentives are posted awarded, you'll recieve the points
<br />

<br />
<b>Raid Attendance</b>: This is the bread-and-butter of earning points. The very best way to earn lots of points (and by extension, gear) is to attend raids regularly and in full. 
<br />

<br />
<b>P2P Auctions</b>: We encourage guild members to recycle equipment (not cash). A member that no longer needs a piece of droppable gear (not cash) may GIVE that item to the lootmaster for auction at the current raid. Once an item is given to the lootmaster, the lootmaster will hold an auction for that item. If someone wins the item, the points are deducted from the winner's account and credited to the recycler's account. If nobody wants it, the lootmaster gives the item back. Sellers of gear are free to put a minimum price on any item they put up for auction. To do this, make sure the auctioneer knows what the minimum price should be so that he can announce it when calling for bids.
<br />

<br />
Example:
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" border="0" align="center"><tr> 	  <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>	</tr>	<tr>	  <td class="quote">Player-to-Player Auction: Blade of Carnage.  There is a reserve of 100 DKP on this item.  Please join sowpoints:kkthxu~ and start bidding.  This is a CAWU auction, first of two calls.</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
<b>How are raid points determined?</b>
<br />

<br />
- Points are awarded based on what we accomplish during the raid and apportioned by time. (Example: If we kill 10 points worth of beasties and you are there for 50% of the raid duration, you'll earn 5 points.)
<br />

<br />
- Calendared mobs are worth (2 * per tier level). (Example: Cazic Thule is a tier 5 calendared mob. He's therefore worth ten points.) However, for a raid participant to earn all ten points associated with killing Cazic Thule, they'd have to be present for the entire raid, not just log in and get a CoH right before we engage the mob. For a full list of mobs and their point value, <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/eqdkp/listevents.php?s=">click here</a>.
<br />

<br />
- The first time we kill any named, raid-level mob, each person on the kill will earn an extra point. If we FAIL to kill our target, but do give it our best shot, then each raid attendee is awarded one point. "Critical-path" mobs are worth DOUBLE the DKP on first kills. Critical path mobs are those mobs that are required for us to proceed to the plane of Time. Here's a brief list of the CP mobs: SolRo minis, Solro, Fennin Ro Event Minis, Fennin Ro, Coirnav, Xegony Key Mobs (Avatars), Xegony, PoEb Key Mob (Arbitor), The Rathe Council 
<br />

<br />

<br />
- If a raid starts on time (give or take 5 minutes), that is worth an additional point for all of the people that are ON TIME. Starting means that raid members are grouped, buffed, and the first pull or move order is given within five minutes of the published start-time.
<br />

<br />
- Three different encounters in a single evening is a 'hat trick' and earns every attendee a bonus of three points.
<br />

<br />
<b>How are points kept up to date?</b>
<br />

<br />
The guild DKP administrator is in charge of taking the information contained in raid post mortems and entering that information into our DKP database. The DKP Administrator can ONLY assign points based on the attendance list in the post-mortem.  Even if the DKP admin knows beyond a shadow of a doubt that another person attended the raid, he must enter points exactly as they appear in the post mortem. If you believe your points are incorrect, you therefore need to figure out if the error was made by the raid leader in his post mortem or if the error was made by the DKP admin when he was entering points. If you notice someone else's points are incorrect, feel free to send a private forum message to the raid leader of the DKP administrator.
<br />

<br />
Note that you have no points for a raid until your points have actually been entered into the system. If you are at zero points and attend a raid worth thirty points, you have zero points until the DKP administrator actually posts them to your account. It's as if the check is in the mail but hasn't been received by the bank yet.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal">Spending Points</span>
<br />

<br />
<b>Overview</b>: When an item drops on a raid and you can use it, the auctioneer will announce that he is taking bids on the item. At this time guild members may bid with the points that are currently in <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/eqdkp/">their accounts</a> at the time of the auction. (If the points aren't posted on the website, you DON'T have them yet.) You can only bid the amount of "available points" you have showing on the "advance stats" page. All debits are INSTANT -- this means that if you want to bid and win twice in an evening you have to do recalculation on your own. All penalties are INSTANT -- If you do not know the amount of a penalty, either don't bid or findout the amount prior to bidding. There will be ZERO tolerance for overbidding, bid with confidence or don't bid at all.
<br />

<br />
<b>Purchasing Dropped Items</b>: When items drop, members who can and will use those items may bid on them by moving to a special auction channel. The raid's lootmaster will announce TWICE in the raid channel that an auction is underway in the auction channel and he will link the item in each of these announcements. Bidding then commences in the auction channel until all interested parties have stopped bidding. The format for the announcements in the general channel is: 
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" border="0" align="center"><tr> 	  <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>	</tr>	<tr>	  <td class="quote">
<br />
"DROP: Bidding on {ItemLink} in sowpoints:kkthxu~ FIRST CALL"
<br />
"DROP: Bidding on {ItemLink} in sowpoints:kkthxu~ LAST CALL"
<br />
</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody"> 
<br />
 
<br />
Only one item will be active at once in the auction channel and bidding will proceed as follows: 
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" border="0" align="center"><tr> 	  <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>	</tr>	<tr>	  <td class="quote">Lootmaster tells auction: "Taking bids on ItemX - Please send your bid to the channel if you can and will use it." 
<br />

<br />
Bidder01 tells sowpoints: "20" 
<br />
Bidder02 tells sowpoints: "30" 
<br />

<br />
(no activitity for a minute)
<br />

<br />
Lootmaster tells sowpoints: "itemx - bidder02 - 30. Going once." 
<br />
Lootmaster tells sowpoints: "itemx - bidder02 - 30. Going twice." 
<br />
Lootmaster tells sowpoints: "itemx - bidder02 - 30. Going thrice."
<br />
Lootmaster tells sowpoints: "itemx - bidder02 - 30. SOLD." 
<br />
</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody"> 
<br />

<br />
The call between "Once" and "SOLD" must be atleast 15 seconds apart, to allow all involved parties time to complete there bids.
<br />

<br />
*Failure to complete the above process can lead to a "Bad Raid Behavior" penalty.
<br />

<br />
<b>Purchasing Quests</b>: Members can also purchase help on quests. Members may also purchase multi-group raids for non-epic quests such as the 10th Ring War or 8th Coldain Prayer Shawl. The player who buys a raid guarantees himself loot rights for the ONE quest item on that raid. All other items are bid upon per usual SoW rules. Talk to the guild leader for information.
<br />

<br />
<b>What if I wasn't charged correctly for an item that I won?</b>
<br />

<br />
Only two things could have happened happened. Either the points were entered into the spoils of war post incorrectly or the points were entered into the database incorrectly. If the spoils of war post is incorrect, you should contact the lootmeister for that raid and have him fix the post then alert the DKP administrator to the fix. If your points were entered into the database incorrectly, send a private forum message to the points administrator.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal">Penalties</span>
<br />

<br />
<b>Overview</b>: For a variety of reasons, people will make mistakes when it comes to loot. Most of the time the mistakes are honest, but they end up costing us lots of time and effort to correct, and fooling around with loot when we could be killing something instead is a pain. Therefore people who make mistakes are penalized. The number one thing to remember when trying to avoid penalties is that all loot is auctioned off on a can-and-will-use basis unless explicitly stated otherwise. (Please see "CAWU" in the definitions list below.)
<br />

<br />
<b>Penalty for Violation of CAWU</b>: If you bid on something and your bid is a violation of the "can and will use" policy in effect for all auctions (unless stated otherwise by the auctioneer) then you will be assessed a penalty equal to the value of the most valuable raid in the most recent four weeks. If your bad bid is caught (by you or someone else) before a winner is declared, the auctioneer should be notified and the auction should be restarted if your bad bid influenced the outcome of the auction. Whether the auction is restarted or not, however, any bid in violation of the CAWU policy will result in a penalty. This rule also covers withdrawals from auctions. If you have the lead bid in an auction and withdraw then you will be hit with the same penalty. 
<br />

<br />
<b>Penalty for Overbidding</b>: If at any time you bid more than you have showing in your DKP account, you will be assessed a penalty equal to the value of the most valuable raid in the most recent four weeks or for twice the amount of the overbid plus an additional 10 points, whichever of the two is greater. If your bad bid is caught (by you or someone else) before a winner is declared, the auctioneer should be notified and the auction should be restarted if your bad bid influenced the outcome of the auction. Whether the auction is restarted or not, however, any bid over your available points will result in a penalty.
<br />

<br />
<b>Bid Manipulation</b>: You may not contrive to fix bids behind the scenes. You shouldn't talk to others about what they're bidding, you shouldn't try to discourage them from bidding, you shouldn't ask your friends what they're bidding, you shouldn't offer to abstain from an auction in return for future favors. Don't ask, don't tell when it comes to your bidding. You shouldn't even talk about an item under bid in a subjective way. For instance, saying "nice item!" could be perceived a malicious attempt to pump up the price of an item that someone you dislike is bidding on. Similarly, telling the guild or group, "that sucks!" could be perceived as a sneaky attempt to keep the price of an item low so that a friend can obtain it more cheaply. It *is* ok to talk about objective aspects of items. "That's a level 65 spell." or "That effect is 10% haste on all detrimental spells cast." Anyone found guilty of bid manipulation will generally have his DKP account zero'ed out. 
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Bad Raid Behavior</span>
<br />

<br />
When raiding with Science of War you are expected to be paying attention and at the top of your game.  Should you at any time:<ol type="1"><li>Train the Raid to the point the we could or do fail to meet our objectives
<br />
<li>AFK without putting up your /AFK tag(Ninja AFK)
<br />
<li>Fail continually to follow instructions</ol>
<br />

<br />
You will be fined 20DKP for any of the above infractions. 
<br />

<br />
20DKP is based off of 50% of the average nightly DKP earnings over the last 3 months.  The fine amount can be re-examined at any time to allow it to properly scale with either the decline or advance in points earned per evening.  It will be based on a 3 month average, however.
<br />

<br />
All of the above wastes time, and that time is valuable to us.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Unfavorable Conduct</span>
<br />

<br />
Should you portray the guild, to the community or the guilds applicants, in a negative light at any time during your membership or application to the guild you will be awarded a unfavorable conduct penalty. The amount for this penalty will be 2 x the value of the highest point raid in last 5 raids figured at the time of infraction.  
<br />

<br />
Examples of such activity would be:  Posting negative posts on community message boards, Training individuals intentionally, not abiding by the Play nice Policies enforced on this server, divulging information or getting applicants involved in disputes which could make them view the guild in a bad light.
<br />

<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal">Applicants, Guests, Alts</span>
<br />

<br />
<b>Overview</b>: Applicants earn DKP at the same rate as full guild members, only they can't spend it until they've become a guild member, except in limited cases, outlined below.
<br />

<br />
<b>Applicant bidding</b>: Applicants may bid zero on any item at ANY time. A guild member who wants that item will only need to bid one to outbid you. If no guild member wants an item but several applicants bid zero, then the auctioneer will open bidding up to applicants only, at which point applicants may bid up to (but not beyond!) the points available in their DKP accounts. The guild bank can bid a single point on any high-value droppable item.
<br />

<br />
<b>Alts</b>: Alts don't earn points ever. If we FORCE you to play an alternate toon for a raid, then you may use your main's account to bid on items for your main only. If an item is going to rot and no applicants are interested in it, then any and all alternate toons who CAWU the item may random for the drop.
<br />

<br />
<b>Guests</b>: Guests earn no DKP.
<br />

<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal">Miscellaneous</span>
<br />

<br />
<b>What if I miss an auction because of linkdeath?</b>
<br />

<br />
All auctions will be handled in a timely manner.  If you are unable to be present during an auction, there's not much we can do about that.  We won't hold up an auction for one person, not even if that person is you.

<b>How many points do I have?</b>
<br />

<br />
A <a href="http://www.scienceofwar.net/eqdkp/" target="_blank" class="postlink">publicly-viewable points tracking system</a> will show current member points totals and a transaction log for each member. This system will also track lifetime points earned and other statistics.
<br />

<br />
<b>Can I win more than once in an evening?</b>
<br />

<br />
Though you may win more than once per evening if you've got the points to win more than once, you should remember that others also need upgrades and that monopolization of drops doesn't win you any friends. Try to find a balance.
<br />

<br />
<b>OMG my DKPz heav been stoled!~~ I'm not showing up on the list of DKP accounts anymore. Why? Did someone delete my account?</b>
<br />

<br />
This is a "feature" of EQDKP. If you go two weeks without a raid entered in your name in EQDKP, it automatically assumes you are "inactive" and moves you to the "inactive" list. Your account is still there, you'll just need to scroll all of the way down to the bottom right-hand corner and select "show all." Voila. 
<br />

<br />
CAWU: Can-and-will-use policy states that when you bid on an item you are bidding on it because your race/class/deity combination can physically use the item and you WILL use the item for the forseeable future (until you win an upgrade for that slot). If a cleric bids on a warrior-only item, this is a violation of CAWU policy. If a guild member sells or gives away a piece of droppable gear after using it for only a week, this is a violation of the CAWU policy. When win an item on a CAWU basis you are expected to put that item to good use in the service of the guild.
<br />

<br />
P2P: Player-to-Player auction. When one player no longer needs a piece of gear he can sell it to other guild members via the auction mechanism. The player selling the gear is credited a portion of the points that the buyer pays for the item. By encouraging P2P in this way we keep gear within the guild and help everyone upgrade their gear more frequently.
<br />

<br />
Post-Mortem: After every raid the raid leader must publish a post mortem that details the attendance of those who were present at the raid. Attendance should be handled via the guild parser program and ONLY through this program. Contact fuckingflake for a current version of the parser. See the sticky post in the top of the post mortem forum for information on how to format your post.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Raid: For a raid to qualify as a DKP raid, it needs to consist of 12 or more guild members attacking a target that can't be single-grouped. An officer needs to be present for the entire duration of the raid, and must preside over or supervise the loot handling. Furthermore, two posts must be made after the raid. One post detailing loot drops and how much they were sold for and another post detailing attendance and issues that arose.
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: red"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">Note:</span></span></span></span>
<br />

<br />
We award DKP according your percent attendance on a raid. If you are in a raid for 100% of the time, you earn 100% of the points available.
<br />

<br />
If a raid lasts four hours and you are there for three hours, you were there for 75% of the time. If the raid is worth 10 DKP, then you end up with 8DKP after rounding up. If the raid is worth 20 DKP, you get 15 DKP. 
<br />

<br />
<b>Note</b>: Raid leaders take attendance by parsing raid logs. You are not counted as present until you are listed in the raid window or, in some cases where the raid may be full, have your LFG tag on. It doesn't matter if you're in the zone with us. It doesn't matter if you're the MT and we're fighting the Aten Ha Ra. It doesn't matter if you're single-handedly-saving the raid through brilliant and miraculous playing. You get NO POINTS unless you are actually listed in the raid window or have an LFG tag up. None. Zilch.
<br />

<br />
What this means is that you should show up to raids with your LFG tag on and you should pester an officer or other leader until you have been invited to the raid. There will be no exceptions.
<br />

<br />
<b>Penalties for AFK</b>
<br />

<br />
Going AFK for brief periods is fine so long as those periods are indeed brief (under two minutes) and infrequent. When you do go afk, please make sure you have an AFK tag up explaining how long you'll be afk and when you'll be back.
<br />

<br />
If you go afk during a raid without telling your group and without putting up an "afk" flag and are caught doing this, you will be subject to the "Bad Raid Behavior" penalty listed above.</span><br /><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
