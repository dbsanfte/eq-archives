<p><li><b>Summary</b>: Science of War's fastest Grummus kill has been thirty minutes from the time our raid moved from the zone-in of PoD. Expect this raid to take about an hour if you're still new to the encounter. Depending on your gear and average raid level, you'll need 20 (EP-geared level 65s) to 70 (average level 60, NToV-level gear) people to drop him. Rangers and Druids are the ideal trackers for Grummus. Rogues report that SoS (shroud of stealth) frequently fails on the way to Grummus and therefore can't track him reliably. Druids and Rangers can track him from the bone wall (see map). Grummus is undead. 


<p><li><b>Grummus's Melee</b>: Grummus quads for approximately 1100, is unslowable, and rampages. However, his attack rating isn't as high as, say, the Avatar of War, so he won't hit for 1100 nearly as frequently. It's rampage that's the bigger healing problem.

<p><li><b>Grummus's Spells</b>: 
<ul>
<li><a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1112&source=Live"><img src="http://lucy.fnord.net/gfx/gem_41d.png?1"> Proc: Decay of the Plaguebringer</a>: This single-target spell is the most dangerous one in Grummus's arsenal. It slows your main tank by 60% and can only be cured in one cast by abolish disease (a level 49 shaman spell and level 63 beastlord spell). You need to have a dedicated shaman or beastlord chain casting abolish disease so that your tank can hold aggro effectively.

<li><a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1115&source=Live"><img src="http://lucy.fnord.net/gfx/gem_154d.png?1"> AE: Plasma Decay</a>: This AE spell is essentially unresistable, so don't even try to buff resists or swap gear. It's a splurt-type dot that will drop every infected player's healthy by approximately 3800 hitpoints over three minutes. However, it's extremely easy to defend against this dot! Make sure that you've got a Shaman, Druid or Cleric in each group with the first level of the "Radiant Cure" AA ability. When "Plasma Decay" hits the party, the priest will hit Radiant Cure and every group member will be cured. For extra safety, put two priests in every group just in case one dies. 

<li><a href=http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1113&source=Live"><img src="http://lucy.fnord.net/gfx/gem_137d.png?1"> AE: Stench of Decay</a>: This AE dot is the same one that Gryme casts. It drops the infected player's hitpoints by just 200 hitpoints per tick and so it's completely negated by MGB SoTW1 (druid AA skill) or MGB Paragon of the Spirit (beastlord AA skill) so make sure that your druids, beastlords and clerics don't blow MGB in the buffing phase. You should plan to have MGB SotW, MGB Paragon or MGB Ethereal Elixir on your raid party at all times during the Grummus fight. If you do this, the dot is a non-issue.
</ul>

<p><li><b>Triggered Events</b>: No scripted events occur during this event, but you do need to beat two mini-bosses prior to the fight with Grummus.
	<ul>
	<li><b>Gryme the Crypt Guardian</b>: First, you must beat Gryme the Crypt Guardian. Gryme roams the area just outside the locked door leading to Grummus's lair (see map for details). He's unslowable, but the most difficult part about him is his AE dot, "Stench of Decay." He drops the no-rent, no-drop <a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=28999">Gryme's Crypt Key</a> which is the key to Grummus's lair. It's important that you make sure the person that loots this key is going to be online all evening. You don't want the key on someone who will log and leave you in a lurch if you need to recover from a wipe and make a second go at Grummus.
	<li><b>Aramin the Spider Guardian</b>: After you've defeated Gryme, you'll need to clear about 20 trash mobs before the next battle against Aramin the Spider Guardian, who is rooted, rampages, and casts an AE dot with a small range (see map for details). She casts <a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3048&source=Live">Plague Silk</a> every 1.5 minutes. Generally, she'll be dead before she can cast it a second time. Upon death, approximately 8 smaller spiders will spring from her corpse. Your casters should be ready to AE them to death at her body. The key to this fight is to make sure that you have a DA/HS knight or necromancer pull the trash from behind Aramin's spawn point before you engage her. If you do not do this, you'll have about six additional mobs in camp as soon as you engage Aramin with your raid force. Group make-up is important for this fight. Radiant Cure 1 (priest AA ability) will cure plague silk with one cast, so stick a priest in every group to trivialize the fight. Because Aramin is rooted, you can completely debuff her prior to engage. Her melee is weak.
	</ul>

<p><li><b>Buff Strategy</b></li>: Of all the offensive spells you'll face in this encounter, only "Plague Silk" is practically resistable. Buff your raid's DR via the Shaman spell Talisman of the Tribunal. In general, you'll want your raid force to focus on hitpoints, especially for your lesser-geared members. Low-health-aggro can flip Grummus around at an inopportune moment (during enrage) and wipe your raid at a very bad time. It's a good idea to buff with Kazad and Bot9 over group Virtue for increased hitpoints. Make sure that you instruct your raid to keep up to four slots open for Grummus's two AE dots and for up to two AE heals at once. 

<p><li><b>Pulling</b>: Pull timing is the most important part of this fight. If you time it wrong, you'll have lots of nasty mobs respawning on your raid right in the middle of the Grummus fight. We recommend that you (1) Pull clear to the set up area at the top of the ramp leading down to Grummus, (2) flop a monk down to Grummus's area to watch for his pathing, (3) as soon as he paths away, pull everything in the room at the bottom of the ramp (see map for details) up to the raid in the set up area. Once all of these mobs are dead, move the raid down into the fight room immediately. Place your MT, WS ranger, and priests, and have everyone else hang back.

<p><li><b>The Fight</b>: If you've followed the pulling instructions your raid should now be down in the fight room and waiting for Grummus to show up. As soon as he shows: (1) a single ranger should immediately grab aggro, hit his weaponshield discipline, and pull grummus to the fight corner. (2) Your tanks should set rampage by shooting a couple arrows into Grummus as he's being WS-tanked. The tank that has rampage needs to announce it so that dedicated rampage healers know who to heal. (3) When the WS discipline has almost expired, the WS ranger needs to announce this so that your MT can AE Taunt. (4) Once the MT has aggro, a single shaman or beastlord needs to chain abolish disease on him and the rotation should be well underway. (5) Keep an AE heal on your raid at all times during the fight. (6) Remember that MT aggro will be a little shakey because he will be slowed during some moments of the fight. Melee and nukers need to be careful not to over-aggro. (6) Whenever "plasma decay" lands during this fight, priests MUST RC1 their groups immediately. (7) When Grummus falls heal the survivors, cure their ailments (abolish disease and pure blood) and get ready to fight respawn as loot, rezzes and rebuffs are handled.

<p><li><b>Healing Strategy</b>: Standard rotation on the MT. Two to three ancillary healers on the rampage tank. At least one MGB heal on the raid at all times. RC1 to cure the Plasma Decay dot the moment it hits. Abolish Disease to cure Decay of the Plaguebringer on the MT.

<p><li><b>Risk Management</b>: Plan to wipe on your first attempt. Because of fast respawn time in Grummus's Lair, it probably won't be feasible for you to recover in time to make another go from within the lair, and SoS fails frequently in the lair, so you're looking at a graveyard recovery. 

<p><li><b>Flagging</b>: The planar projection that spawns when Grummus dies will hand out a maximum of 72 flags per kill. You only need to hail the projection, not zone into CoD from PoD. Sometimes the planar projection can spawn in the wall. Use F8 to target it.
