      My thoughts on how to use the Shaman spells through level 24, as a level
      25 Shaman. I would greatly appreciate anyones thoughts as well.
      <p><b><font size="3">Rank One(Level 1)</font></b></p>
      <p>Cure Disease: Do not keep memorized, only mem on a per case basis.
      Also, some higher level diseases will require multiple castings, or the
      use of the Level 24 Counteract Disease spell.</p>
      <p>Flash of Light: Do not normally keep memmed. If soloing outdoors, can
      be useful to help you get away. Blind them, step back, root them, then
      Cheetah yourself. Or, Blind them, step back, root them, DoT them. Many
      possible variances. I have never used this spell in a group though, too
      many other spells clamoring for the slots.</p>
      <p>Inner Fire: Only mem when you buff it, then unmem it. Only use if no
      other class in group has a better spell. Very cheap to cast, so might as
      well.</p>
      <p><b><font color="#000000" size="3">Rank Two(Level 5)</font></b></p>
      <p>Cure Poison: Only keep memmed if fighting creatures with bad poison.
      You don't want someone to die while your trying to mem it ; )</p>
      <p>Endure Fire: Only use if fighting MOB's that use fire based attacks. I
      do not find it worth while to cast just for combating Fire Shields. But,
      it's cheap, so if you have the time and have the mana, and have nothing
      else you need to buff, why not.</p>
      <p>Gate: Always keep memmed. I would add, always keep memmed in the same
      spell slot. I switched it once, and won't get into the details, suffice to
      say I always keep it in same slot now ; )</p>
      <p>Spirit Pouch: I keep my summoned food and water in it. I also keep
      rusties, raw hide, cloth, or anything else you would normally destroy
      because of weight in it. NEVER put ANYTHING you would be upset to lose in
      it. Can you say, &quot;POOF&quot;?</p>
      <p><font size="3"><b>Rank Three(Level 9)</b></font></p>
      <p>Cure Blindness: I have never used this spell. So can not comment on it.</p>
      <p>Endure Disease: Not worth casting to avoid Rabies, or the like. BUT, if
      fighting something that gives you a truly bad disease (Like Evil Eyes, or
      high level shamans), always use it, especially on tanks and lurer.</p>
      <p>Sense Animals: Don't have yet. Seems pretty limited though. Any
      comments from those who do use it?</p>
      <p>Serpent Sight: Cast on all sight deprived members of your party before
      nighttime, or in dark places. You Do NOT want them falling into a hole
      that you see, but they could not ; )</p>
      <p>Spirit of Wolf: Obviously, always keep everyone buffed with this. I
      used to always keep it memmed too. Now I need the slot for Cheetah, so I
      only mem it when buffing. (Have since decided that I need to keep Wolf
      memmed also, for when Cheetah runs out and if you haven't reached zone
      yet) Only keep memmed if outdoors of course.</p>
      <p>Spirit Sight: Only when fighting creatures that can go Invis, and or
      when party members are Invised. I would add, that usually someone else can
      and will cast it. I would save your mana for other buffs if possible.</p>
      <p><b><font size="3">Rank Four(Level 14)</font></b></p>
      <p>Bind Affinity: Don't forget! Every now and then, I forget, and when I
      gate, I am unpleasantly surprised ; )</p>
      <p>Burst of Strength: Used before level 24, don't have a slot for it
      anymore. Also, I have been saving mana for debuffing and healing during
      fights. Warrior types said it helped their Max damage, and before level 24
      I think it is worth using. But at 24, I do not have a slot I am willing to
      give up for it.</p>
      <p>Disempower: If the fights are long (tank heavy or small group), I keep
      this memmed and use it (after I malise). If the fights are quick (burner
      heavy), I do not (I still malise though), not worth it.</p>
      <p>Endure Poison: Always cast if fighting anything poisonous or that uses
      Poison spells.</p>
      <p>Enduring Breath: You can use a LOT of fish scales VERY quickly in a
      group. If just traveling, I would rather levitate them, if anything.
      Faster trip too. If in group fighting underwater goblins, or whatever, I
      would just Enduring Breath the lurer while everyone else stays on shore. I
      am sure this is not always an option, but so far it has been for me.</p>
      <p>Invis. VS Animals: Only when traveling, and only if no regular Invis is
      available. Works on Griffens btw.</p>
      <p>Levitate: Wheeee, one of my favorite spells : ) In lavastorm can be
      very useful. Also, if you are Wolfed and Levitated, you run at wolf speed.
      Even over water, so much faster than swimming. Good for crossing very
      hilly terrain too. Plus it's fun! &quot;Flying Troll!!&quot; I love
      hearing that when in newbie areas, many have never even seen a Troll, much
      less a flying one. Har! Har!</p>
      <p>Root: Sometimes you need it memmed, other times not. Depends on where
      you are and who you have in group. Ensnare is much better, so always let
      the Druid or Ranger do their thing instead, if possible.</p>
      <p>Shrink: TBD</p>
      <p>Spirit of Snake: Always keep yourself buffed with this, and any casters
      who use alot of alteration spells, like Enchanters and Clerics. I usually
      ask who uses alot of combat Alteration spells in my group and then buff
      those you say they do. Helps with resists. Also, I make sure my group has
      me Snake them before they go selling.</p>
      <p>Walking Sleep: I have started to use this more. What I like to do is
      malise everything right after the other, then Walking sleep them. All from
      a distance of course. Depending on situation, I may then Disempower the
      one currently being targeted by tanks. I only do this if I am not the
      primary healer.</p>
      <p><b><font size="3">Rank Five(Level 19)</font></b></p>
      <p>Cancel Magic: Most other magic types have this. If they do, it is
      usually best for them to do it and leave you with extra spell slot. MOB
      specific use.</p>
      <p>Endure Magic: One of the most requested buffs. Some others have it
      also, again, if they have it, let them cast it, so you can save your mana
      for other buffs.</p>
      <p>Frenzy: Never used. At level 24 (now 25) I would rather Canabilize or
      meditate for more mana, not use it all up to melee. Melee is not our role.
      But, that's just my opinion.</p>
      <p>Healing: Always keep memmed, even if all other 5 members are clerics
      (Have never been in a group with more than one cleric btw).</p>
      <p>Malise: Always cast at least once on groups target. If your not the
      primary healer, try one or two more times if resisted. It does make a big
      difference to the other magic users and they will love you for it, or so
      they tell me : ) Now, if tank heavy, adjust strategy accordingly. Also, if
      you have an Enchanter, you may or may not want to, ask casters what combat
      spells they are using and go from there.</p>
      <p>Spirit of Cat: Always have up on yourself, the lurer, the tanks, and
      the primary healer. If you have time and mana, do everyone else too.</p>
      <p>Spirit Strength: Always have up on yourself and all tank types who are
      over Level 20 and have a Strength over 100. Damage bonus. If you have the
      extra mana and time, buff all encumbered group members as well.</p>
      <p>Vision: If a very dark place, cast on self, gives you Ultravision for a
      short time. You can also cast on lurer if you want, but there seems to be
      a max range, once they go beyond that you no longer see updated view. Have
      not tested much, but seems to be the case. Also, you can not see what is
      happening around you. I do not use much except for fun.</p>
      <p><b><font size="3">Rank Six(Level 24)</font></b></p>
      <p>Cannibalize: Always keep memmed, also always have Regeneration buff on
      you. Unless in emergency situations, never cannibalize below your 80%
      health mark. Be VERY careful, easy to get yourself killed. I use it all
      the time in combat tho. If I have not taken any hits, after I cast malise,
      I cannibalize, then cast other debuffs, then cannibalize again in between
      swings. Always being careful never to go below 80% health. Of course, I am
      a Troll ; ) When group is resting, I med, when a tick goes by and both
      bars go up a bit, I stand, cannibalize, then sit down to med again as
      quick as I can. Again, never going below 80% health. I timed it, if just
      medding it takes me 1m46s to regen 2 bubbles of mana. At level 24, when
      doing Med/Cannibalize combo, takes me 1m30s to regen 2 bubbles of mana
      when starting at full health and ending at 80% health never going below
      80% health. So, big deal you say, a whole whopping 15 seconds saved. Well,
      if you are down 4 bubbles of mana at end of fight, you will save 30
      seconds of med time. That is 30 seconds less that group will have to wait,
      or as is more likely to be the case, 30 more seconds you can buff the
      group while other casters med up. Also, if paladins in group, or other
      minor healers, if they are full mana, they can heal you everynow and then,
      making this even faster. Plus, it's fun! It adds color to the shaman class
      and helps with the role play.</p>
      <p>Counteract Disease: Only keep memmed if fighting a MOB that will give a
      bad life threatening disease. Same as Cure Disease spell, but more
      powerful.</p>
      <p>Creeping Vision: Have not purchased yet.</p>
      <p>Envenomed Breath: Well, lots of issues here. I will just say that if in
      a good group, with a couple of burners, I just debuff and heal and buff.
      Never cast Envenomed, no need. If in tank heavy group where each creature
      being targeted will last 30 seconds or more, I may, or may not, do it.
      Depends on my mood and what is being resisted. Thing is, I die alot more
      when I use Envenomed breath, than when I debuff. Any rational well thought
      out ideas on this appreciated.</p>
      <p>Frost Strike: Rarely use it in group. Dont even have it memmed at the
      moment. If in tank heavy group, will mem it and use it to take out
      runners. Maybe when I get higher it will be resisted less and do more
      consistent damage, at the moment tho, rather debuff and use mana in other
      ways.</p>
      <p>Invigor: Never used it. Have never been in a situation where need to
      use it. Maybe when swimming a long distance? (Since first writing this,
      was swimming out in water by Freeport docks trying to find that ledge that
      Trolls can get on, found it, but had ta do a quick memming of Invigor and
      cast everynow and then or would have died)</p>
      <p>Poison Storm: Sometimes I keep this memmed. Still playing with it. In
      my experience, AoE spells are a great way to focus every MOB on yourself.
      Attention you do not want, hehe. So, jury still out, again, any rational
      well thought out ideas on this appreciated. Also, I like to use this when
      in Newbie areas when someone is overrun and asks for help, usually kills
      everything with one or two stragglers trying to get away. Very impressive,
      you get a lot of &quot;WOW&quot; comments ; )</p>
      <p>Protect: Always buff yourself, lurer, and Tanks. If time and mana
      available, buff healer and rest of group as well. Lasts long time.</p>
      <p>Regeneration: Always keep this buff on you. Have been experimenting
      with casting on lurer just before he runs off, and then casting on main
      tank at very start of fight. Just started this, but seems to work well,
      and the tanks love it of course : ) Also, when resting after a big fight
      and everyone is pretty beat up, cast on the worst one or two. Be sure you
      coordinate this with healers, or your mana will be wasted.</p>
      <p>Resist Cold: Only use when fighting MOB's that use cold attacks</p>
      <p>Spirit of Cheetah: LOVE this spell! I use it more than gate to get out
      of bad situations. Very quick casting time and much easier to get off when
      being hit. ALWAYS keep memmed. Been thinking of not memming gate to free
      up a slot. (Since writing this, I decided to not keep gate memmed. Well,
      guess what happened? I got LOST in the Unrest House. Lots of speed and no
      idea where to go! Hehe, pretty funny now. Luckily, I finally found my way
      out. But if had Gate memmed, would have been much safer. So, now I keep
      gate memmed if in areas that I may get lost. Otherwise, it stays unmemmed)</p>
      <p>Spirit of Monkey: Cast on yourself of course, and on tanks and healer
      (helps with channeling and interrupts). If time and mana available, cast
      on main burners too.</p>
      <p>Spirit of Ox: Cast on yourself of course, and on tanks and lurer. How
      many times has a group member escaped with less than 20 hit points? If you
      had Ox on them, you saved their life. How many times has a group member
      died JUST before zoning? If you did not have Ox on them, you killed them.
      If time and mana available, buff rest of group as well.</p>
      <p>I have been told many times, &quot;Your buffs saved my life!&quot; I
      like that : )</p>
      <p>People I have grouped with before are also very happy to group with me
      again, so I guess I am doing something right ; )</p>
      <p>I am always open to ways to improve my methods.</p>
